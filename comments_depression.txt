We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say "PM me anytime" in a casual social context.    We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.    Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.  *****  ###Summary###  **Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.**    "PM me anytime" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.  * **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.    * People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue.   * **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)    * In our observation over many years, the people who say "PM me" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.    *  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.  * If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.
Understood and I apologise if I forget in the future and break it
I agree wholeheartedly.  When you're struggling, the random person you are not acquainted with saying "pm me" is generally not comforting, and I don't like seeing it thrown at people who post looking to get an honest discussion.  We're all damaged, and having an open support group is better than a one-on-one most of the time.  As an aside, I slightly disagree with this:  >The 1-9-90 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  It doesn't change the point you are making, but I think it's interesting.  I feel like this subreddit may be a bit of an exception to the 1-9 part.  If "creation" is making posts and starting discussion and "contributing" is replying to posts, then I think we have as much or even more creation as* contribution based on the low number of responses the majority of new posts get.    It's an understandable issue that I don't think can be resolved; people come here to try and work on their own issues, the issues presented can be very difficult - leaving people afraid of making an unhelpful response, and a lot of our potential contributors lack confidence or are dislike direct interaction.    This just makes it even more important to keep discussions in an open comment section rather than a PM.  Lurkers are all over, and sometimes will come upon posts well after they reach their peak popularity through searching.  If progress is made, we want it to be accessible.
Biggest Problem on private talks may be that you may reach a point where you're out of advice for the one who needs help and then what ? just leave the chat ? - that would even make it worse for both of you. In Public chat there's a good chance others may jump in where you got lost
I have to agree with this. I know that people mean well but sometimes it’s better to let the person vent and make that person feel understood instead of trying to change that person and make him/her happier.   I feel that forced positivity has a worse effect on me than sad posts. It’s hard for people without mental illnesses to understand that.   Sorry for my rambling. That’s my two cents on the topic.
Great rule! I’ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.       And even as I didn’t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren’t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.      It is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. “PM me anytime” isn’t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don’t deserve the time and attention.      It would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP’s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with “PM me if you want to answer privately”. Now OP won’t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn’t initiate a conversation — it has already been initiated. As you said, it’s better not to offer to PM and as it’s a rule now nobody should do it — I’m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where “PM me” is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.      Also seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker. It makes you feel like nobody really cares about strangers’ problems.
Thank you for posting this.... as much as I want to have a more personal connection with people here, I realize how that pre-disposes OP's to VERY bad advice and people who are suffering are often in an altered state that DOES NOT benefit others.  That's why I try to only reply to posts when I'm up and only make posts when I'm down (don't try to look for them I use multiple accounts and delete old posts and so should you guys for the sake of not being discriminated against for your problems, which are normal and sometimes feel extreme and can make the general public react to you irrationally because they don't understand).  Love you guys so much, I wish everyone as much happiness as possible, especially coming up on the holidays.
I really appreciate this post!   As someone who's posted here, I've received a few PMs that started off with the usual: "Hey, how are you? I felt like you needed to talk to someone."  I really appreciated the sentiment, but it felt like a forced interaction. Not without care or consideration, but catered specifically to be a body to talk to and knowing the intention behind it, ironically made me feel obligated to politely respond, but pussyfooted (for a lack of a better word) in my attitude.   This is only because I know it's a sincere, but more importantly, an instantly sympathetic reaction to a sad post. It's not something I expect to be a meaningful, lasting relationship, but one born for a moment out of immediate sympathy. Like a hand on the shoulder.   I do appreciate them. I really do, but I also can do without it, and like the moderators here have said, comments are all I need. Commiserating, advice for me or anybody relating to the OP, or a simple upvote to show support is really all I'm looking for. If a meaningful online interaction \*naturally\* precipitates, I'm all for it. I hope I'm not being too sensitive, but hey... I guess that's why I'm here haha
I’m guilty of doing this and, as others have pointed out, it has always been out of goodwill but it is too unpredictable and therefore dangerous. Especially earlier this year when I started therapy and found this sub I wanted to feel better and helping others or the though of helping others aided me in that;  I fell into the “I want to feel helpful” category despite my best intentions.  I did end up having a private conversation with someone, helping them as best I could, as often as I could and it started of pretty good no matter the time or topic. However, a couple days in I was out of advice and at a low point myself. The conversations came to a screeching halt - they couldn’t help me and I couldn’t help them. Their issues had transformed into (or had always been about) something entirely different than their original post posited and I turned into a helpee myself instead of a helper. We both went our separate ways none the better.   After that I never replied regarding dm’s and kept it to comment chains only.  Thank you for doing this and thank you for your work, this is a safe place which sometimes might need protecting from itself. After all, in the haze of my own misery and thoughts I never properly read the rules and just.. reached out.
Thank you for this ! Offers like this intend to help but no.. Just no lol
Thank you so much for this.
I think I broke this rule more than once in the past..I'm sorry guys I will think more before leaving a comment.
I agree "pm me anytime" is useless, imo if someone was that concerned, drop them a message not with a "I'm here to help message me anytime" but ask them what's up, people don't want to ask for help, especially in cases like this where someone's depression might feel silly even though it's not, I'm not sure on how much harm would come of it but possibly just being direct and making the person talk about it, starting with the concerning person might possibly be the way to do it
Wow. I understand that the rules are the rules, but you just painted *everyone* who offers that as either a psycho or a predator. I must say I am feeling like one now because of all the stuff you have said about a simple act of kindness, which is the only reason I ever offered to do so. Sad really. But, the rules are the rules. Now I have some hard thinking to do. Again, just wow...
Here’s my story and experience with this- I posted on SW a long time ago and was targeted by a much older man (I was an 18 y/o girl) preying on vulnerable women. He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted.   He convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being “crazy”. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could “find me easily”. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house.   A couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I’m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop. I don’t know if my video was used in court I kind of left it all behind after that.   But anyway. All this came from one PM. You should never trust a random stranger not everyone is just looking out for you and wants to talk.
I personally don't come here looking for helpers or to become a helper for other people. I'm mostly looking for people I can feel more connected to, for whom I can feel true empathy. And if I could make friends that would be very nice but I know that's not easy.  I don't know about the others but the whole 'relationship with the institution' thing is a huge part of the reason I personally don't like help lines. It's like we're supposed to talk to NPCs. Just like therapists (who I see as helpful tools rather than people who care about me. Well at least help lines do their thing for free.  Not trying to question the rules or anything just expressing how I feel about this. I'm pretty sure a lot of people would agree with me (which is also why I'm thankful to this community, I can relate to people, they can relate to me).
I wish I would've seen this sooner. I apologize for all the infractions.
I think this is a good rule, thanks. Someone's who's depressed doesn't need to risk being hurt by anyone here potentially offering to talk to them but not following through on it, then maybe feeling even more like no one cares. Besides, perhaps others could use the advice that would otherwise be given in PM's.
Good shout. I would never presume to offer that kind of one-on-one interaction mainly because *I do not want that myself*, and I am pretty sure most of us are in the same boat.
I apologize for breaking this rule. I never had the intention to put anyone at risk by doing so. I do hope I'm not going to break this again.
Had posted something here and someone PM’d me offering cbd oils for my depression.   Glad my depression can help someone earn money /s
I really agree. People start talking to me and then just stop. In that moment of depression I feel like we're friends, but I guess not.
Yes, this is a very sensible sticky in my opinion.  I have been on both sides of this coin. As a "helper", I find that I didn't really help the person via a more live chatting or back and forth messaging. Posting a few replies on the person's thread and boosting them up is fine, but you it's just a whole new ballgame to try and be the person's friend/advisor.  As a helpee, I've found myself disappointed as the person (understandably) just seemed like they didn't actually care all that much with their proposal, and even if they did, it's just not what I was seeking (which is not their fault obviously!).  So yeah, in a way it might even worsen things sometimes. I'm all for support, but I think that it's actually best to just keep it on the thread.
Almost every day i see someone I want to talk to more about what's going on and then I realize where that might lead when one of us reaches that emotional fatigue. It's good advice. It does make more sense to me to post it publicly also, because as you've stated it will likely be useful to a handful of people. Thanks so much for clarifying this.
ahh shit.
this makes sense thanks mods
What if I've been talking with someone in the comment thread for a while? Like were 5-10 replies deep and talked out the current issue? Cuz at that point I don't want to just say good luck see ya, so I'll sometimes say pm me if you want to talk more. But often avoid it, even tho it feels wrong, just to respect the rule even tho I feel like I've appreciated and understood its intentions
bro I feel so bad... I'm sorry
Agreed. Even if PM me is from a person who really wants to help it looks like 'ok I understand, send me a message whenever you want because rn I dont have a reason to try and help'
This makes me feel better about the way PMs in response to my depressing posts make me feel.  I never really feel comfortable with it.
> **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP.**   This is sort of counterproductive though. Most of the time, help isn't generalized, it's personalized by nature. Not everyone's depression look the same, some advice can trigger anxiety in others while it can be a wake-up call to some.      Generally a common way of dealing with depression from a CBT perspective is things like training mindfulness and practicing it often. But this is extremely hard for people with diagnoses like ADD, ADHD to get a working routine on, I'm not saying to defend the "PM you anytime" but reddit is a horrendously bad forum to help people quickly, often people get replies during a week's period and some form of support group for this type of struggle, not when people are suicidal low, but still depressed enough to make it hinder their lives can be helped if we could setup some form of group chat to remind each other or give ideas of how to deal with certain situations. A lot of times people know what they need to do, but hearing someone else tell them to do it will be of great importance.
When I’m on Twitter I get people saying ‘My DMs are open’ or ‘I’m here to chat’ but like I barely know them and I’m not one to talk it out privately, so I get it.
This is the reason why I use large chat groups. Even with those who have been trained in supporting ppl,I feel they might get too drained out. There is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.
So on Twitter, I’ve expressed my woes before and the DMs I got weren’t really assuring. I get that people mean well but pep talks don’t really help. Because even though they mean well, it comes off as, “Hey, you’re a freak. But don’t worry, someday you’ll grow out of being a freak!” Empathy is so much better honestly, but not many people give that. That being said, this is a great reiterative step in the right direction. Thank you!
I think I get it. It makes sense since I've helped people through difficult situations through private chats, and it can be extremely distressing when the person you're trying to help is suicidal. I'm not a trained mental health professional, and yet I've already dealt with enough of that stuff for one lifetime. Unfortunately, I have a tendency to play the savior for other people whilst neglecting my own issues.
I'm sorry, I just realized that I broke this rule. Won't do it again.
This isn’t related to the post but can I message someone? I really need someone to talk to and I can’t post because it always says post failed
[deleted]
Rules broken and fixed, but though i might share some point of view mod.  In the info section it's mentioned that helper can write in comment if their intention is positive, yet for some they are shy to post in public but they want to share their experience so they might opt to PM.  Although i understand that this rules is to prevent consequences, i am just sharing a view so that PMs are not so negatively viewed.  Although again yes, positive PMs might result in getting the OPs hopes up and gullible for bad-intentioned PMs, but i think i just need to share this.  I don't know if the english is too confusing or understandable though.  Anyway cheers for your wholesome effort 👊🏻
I agree, and I appreciate scorpionstanks and others good intentions. It's amazing to see that volunteerism and sometimes it does help those with depression. But agency/community contact is important. Everyone gets compassion fatigue. Having seen and heard our crisis coordinators, some of the most compassionate individuals I've met after a 12 hour shift. And you get the idea that their rapport building and call quality goes down substantially.   These are people who have brought people back from the ledge on a 30 minute phonecall, but clearly would barely be able to handle a simple check in with a well known well behaved caller after their shift.
Shit, I just broke that rule, I just panicked when I saw a post of a young girl talking about harming herself.
*Let Me Add My Thoughts with this, I've  must confess I didn't  read the whole post* (or the wiki, wanna check it out later, full focused  in it, I'm  kinda busy rn xp, I promise)  *and I will appreciate  greatly all kinds of feedbacks you all would like to give me. Well, with your permission:  I've suffered depression/been depressed since I was around 10 yo until this year's  February (2019). (Major depressive disorder, severe depression, you name it. The first  condition it's only a raw translation from my native language to English, although it may be different as the actual English name, sorry if I've made a mistake)  I don't  want to offend anyone here or make this condition appear to be worse than it really is, but for me, it was Hell. Perhaps I'm  lacking the proper words to describe it but for me it feels/felt like that. Around the same age ( I've  started  my toxic relationship with depression) I've  developed anxiety disorder, I'm  still struggling/fighting against that B****.  A nasty combo.  For some reason unknown, even for myself, in some moment in that time I've started to think about both conditions as females, ladies, nothing against them obviously, they are more beautiful than men,  proved they are more intelligent than men and without the ladies we are just savages, love them all. Xp   Now, as an adult (25 years old, male) I've took a phrase for myself, it says, more or less:  "Depression is nothing more than a sad lady knocking at our door in a rainy night. Let her in and listen carefully what she has to say, but do not let her stay. Once the rain has stopped, say goodbye to her. Otherwise, she *Will* get into every corner of your house( Inner me, mind, etc), and kicking her out it's hard, painful and takes lots of time, wasting life. You don't  have to be rude, though, learn how to treat her, listening her words and advising her are the best way to help her and yourself. Letting her stay and being rude will start  a war between both of you, a nasty one, and in the beginning, she is always stronger than us.  Takes years to overpower her and acquire control.  Listen the echoes inside of you, the voice around you and read the words dedicated to you. It may be someone nice trying to be nice with themselves or he/she could be someone struggling too, trying to make you know that there's others with their own wars, some of em had lost some battles, others had won, but all of em are fighting back, see them and learn from them. A few others have lost the will to fight and this lady took their heart, alongside their last breath. I never forget them, it could have been me. There's stairs to heaven, highways to hell and the unlimited potential we all have to evolve, let me tell you my secret ;) :you seek outside the reasons, help, strength or anything you think you need to not give up. You NEED to go and look inside, think about  it. We are amazed by the wonders in the space, maybe because we already forget the beauty of the jewels in the deeps of the planet. That's the hint.  I'm fool and forget to mention another possibility: if the written words were made for your eyes, the voices for your eyes, or the cheers for your heart, it could be a type of people I admire, respect and decided to become one of them in the future: The friends beyond all the fight. Because you'll find a friend in almost every one of them. And they will be one (or both) of two things: and adviser/helper, like masters, to share with you where they did stumble in their path and suggest useful things. Or your friends, doing the same as the first, and even more, much more. They've learned to appreciate anything that shines in the darkness after living there for so long that they don't  want anybody to feel the same, and if you let me include myself with them, we will do such things because we like it, and we mean it.  I am or I am not. Always. I'm always Too much of anything or absolutely nothing,  There's no mid points to me, I pour my soul in every thing I've decide to do, always help to anyone I can, serve the others and do good recklessly. That's one thing or two I believe in. So, c'mon Bro, grab this hand I didn't had and take the strength I've lacked. Anytime you want, mate. That's why I'm here for."                                                                                                          The mind of Sun  That's a little thingy I wrote not so long ago, I've felt it would be nice posting it here,  it's  not the complete thing, it has some holes intentionally, but it's the first 80% of my own writings I've post ever. Hope it doesn't offend anyone, if it do not help you by any means, hopefully don't  hurt anyone either. I like to write, you know, my poison  of choice are poetry and philosophy  (damned poetry 😂), And if you catch even the tiniest bit of the deep meaning it also have, you already figured it wasn't a cute this half of my life. Lived in the bottom for years, pretended to be fine bc like we all do, I didn't want to worry not even one of my love ones, I was unable to have a treatment with a psychologist or psychoanalyst, and my whole list of sins didn't help much either. I've even tried to "end" myself  (sorry for this) four times. Obviously, fortunately, unsuccessfully.  After I've surpassed, the very first day after, for the first time in years, I've  woke up, happy. I don't  remembered the last time it happened. A couple of weeks after I've decided to believe in the things I've mentioned in my poor writing above, among others. And even more in those in the last two lines. I didn't had anybody to help me. Support me, freaking avoid I've tried those 4 things. I'm not fully recovered, I believe  this lady never really leave, it's always lurking but nice you won her, it's  more hard for her to regain full control. I've decided to always go beyond if I find myself a limit for anything, return anything good people do or give to me 10x  times better, if it was something bad, I'd return them something 100x better, don't  be cruel, don't lose yourself, do not treat people as bad as they are, treat them as good as you are.  Many people here would probably know what cost me to learn these things too.  That's why I wanna help and give my full disposition when I've reply something similar. Regardless I do like to know all kinds people. Although I don't think of myself like a hero or anything. I'm trying to save pain to people that haven't reach that point, help the ones there, and for all the people struggling I'm  saying: I'm here for you, if you want. Just say the word. I don't start a chat, perhaps because I would be acting for my own selfishness at first glance. It's  the way I respect people's desires.  Although, I know how hard it is.    THAT'S IT, I'VE EXTENDED MYSELF QUITE MUCH. MY APOLOGIES HOMIES. I ASK YOU ALL TO FORGIVE MY GRAMMAR, I'M NOT A NATIVE ENG SPEAKER, LEARNED IT BY MYSELF, STILL POLISHING IT, I'M DOING MY BEST.  THE WRITING IT'S OBVIOUSLY PHRASES I'VE READ AND LIKED, MIXED WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS. I USE THESE QUOTE TO SYNTHESIZE MY OWN THOUGHTS/WRITINGS. I'm still a bit embarrassed for it. Let me quote a hero: "Whenever you suffer pain, keep in mind that it’s nothing to be ashamed of and that it can’t degrade your guiding intelligence, nor keep it from acting rationally and for the common good"  "My relationship to them. That we came into the world for the sake of one another."       MARCUS AURELIUS   You are more than you think, stronger than you feel, loved than you believe and unique than you perceive. Seek something you like or care about, make it a hobby. And do it relentlessly.   Things like mindfulness, stoicism, a essay/book of a subject you like, even slightly interested in, are helpful too.  Learn more things, do more things. Once you realize what's stopping you, bringing you down, you'll gain power over it and it will get weaker and weaker.  You are far more than you think. I believe that, soon you'll  do it too.  Regardless the feedback you guys give me, I'm  here.  Keep that in mind. Why not? ;)  Good vibes homies ✌✌✌😎 I send you all a Bro hug.  You can.  Edit: I gave some format to this text, I'm on a mobile right now, you know Reddit don't care about formatting and stuff. 2. I'm respecting the rule of no offering pm or smh, this was a last time. It could be helpful too, hard to measure and globalize something too random as the human being. Just saying. I'll stick to the rule from now on.
I'm sorry I'm very late to this topic but I agree entirely.   I appreciate the intentions may be good, but from previous experiences there are times when the conversation reaches a natural end - but the other person simply won't stop responding. I've had three definite experiences of this in the past where after a few messages back and fourth, I just want to be left alone and continue. I don't want to remain in private contact but there's no polite way of putting this across to the other person.   Prior to my time on Reddit, there was one particular forum I was a member of who private messaged me for many months. Probably getting on for a year. In the end, I just had to stop replying and inevitably ended up blocking that person when they continued to message me for weeks afterwards - turning quite nasty.   As my own personal rule, I don't and haven't responded to any private messages for around a year. I don't mean to offend anyone by that but after several 'less than pleasant' experiences and then the expectation to remain in contact thereafter - I've just had to call it a day and say "*enough's enough*". I'll stick to responding to comments in the public domain.
As a (very) newcomer to this sub, I find this post to be sensible - I guess, but also extraordinarily sad.
That's really cool.
It sucks, but I 100% agree with this rule. Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.  The crux of the issue I found is, you don’t know who you are helping. You don’t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for. As well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don’t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don’t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived. As was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.  My own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.  I’m not saying don’t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!  But as I said, you don’t know who you are helping and they don’t know you. And if you aren’t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties. Accusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.  To all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.
Thank you very much, it makes alot of sense.
I just saw this now, ill read it
So precisely worded and explained, very well communicated.
How can we block someone who has repeatedly sent PMs?
Wow, Thank you. I always feel I wanna be the helper guy... and this post makes so much sense. Although you'd expect that people (helpers) know these things, when you have good intentions you do not notice the bad/side effects ... and yes you are making promises that you might not keep...  Thank you for this post
What if the person in question is in the verge of committing suicide?
I'm sad that this is discouraged😣I mean, I get it, but still. doctors wont help, or prescribe meds. Family and friends are incapable or unwilling to help. Anonymous redditors are probably my last hope.
Oh wow, I’ve totally accepted a few such requests, and I’ve always felt that I let the person down. Since I have so many issues of my own, and since I’m not a professional, I cannot always be there in the online way that people might expect.   My being on the autism spectrum may have something to do with it. I don’t have great judgement concerning social interactions.
Just commented on a user's post after trying to reach out on another sub a week or so ago then saw this sticky and wanted to apologize to the mods this makes a lot of sense. I'm not sure if my comment and previous post were deleted or if my phone is acting up, but wanted to thank the mods for the well thought out explanation
[deleted]
My bad. I did that shit. My apologies.
ahh i just did that, i apologize.  but im it really is hard to do nothing.  what was the saying?  evil thrives when good men do nothing. i understand the need for the rule, most here are not trained in last resort intervention me included. but can i call myself a good man if i just scroll by...
I'll apologize up front. Unwittingly guilty. Mine came about because an OP asked what had happened to make me suicidal at such a young age (6 yrs old). That was of concern to me as I felt the "whole truth" on an open platform might be triggering or too NSFW for a minor. My private message asked the inquire's age up front with the statement I'd not tell all the facts of my story to a minor. They were 14 so "apologized" for asking... From my history, NOT my intent to belittle or dismiss any child/young person who might be struggling with similar historical casual agents & stated that. Thereafter, I gave only a brief summary of just the initial harsh facts.  My end comment was that, honestly there was no way I could "fix" whatever they were dealing with, BUT that they had my ear as a safe place to vent. Mea Culpa.  Commentary/Feedback?
Thanks for sharing the insights. I am glad I came across it. Just one suggestion, can u please hyperlink some terms like compassion fatigue (maybe with wikipedia article??) and others.....  I was feeling many other things while reading this, but as the current state of things is with me, I am forgetting/losing track of feelings pretty quickly (idk, it may be flooding followed by my mind closing floodgates).... anyways, very nice post 👍👍
I just went through it, I did ask a couple of guys for direct chat, Apologies, It won't happen again. However, I have handled these kinds of cases in past and studied a bit about human psychology as I'm a survivor myself. Anyway, It won't happen again.
I always think about this story about a woman that was dead for two years in her apartment before her remains were found. This is how I imagine the end of my life will be. I’ll die alone, with no one missing a beat.

Point taken!! I have done this a few times so I'm glad I read this. Thanks for enlightening me.
This makes a lot of sense and I wish I would’ve read this years ago
I had no idea about that, this should be also fixed on suicidewatch, sometimes I ask people to pm not because I want to feel close to them, but because sometimes the person isn't using a thrwoaway and don't wanna give too much details in public. Anyway, this rule makes a lot of sense.
So disable comments completely? I don't understand how this can be avoided accurately.
[deleted]
I understand that it's why I talk with people and sometime,s people just want someone to listen . me I try to remain active as possible sometimes I am helping people else where . and  I understand abuse concerns . it's those who are down who can be pushed to the edge . one thing I learnt  when I was younger you can't always save everyone. but it doesn't mean you should give up on speaking words of love,compassion and support
n.b.  I'm not speaking just to you, /u/scorpiontank27), but to everyone who's been upvoting this comment.  In addition to what /u/circinia has so wisely pointed out, there's another reason why it's a sign that's something's seriously wrong if you have trouble remembering this rule.    If you're really thinking about others' experience, then knowing how getting them into a PM conversation is likely to turn out should make a huge impression on you.  If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when "we want to help", what it means is that "we want to feel helpful".  "PM me any time" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different.
Please refresh your memory as often as you need to - the rules are always posted right there in the sidebar ("community info" on mobile), and we'll ensure the wiki stays highly visible as well.  Edit: I'm also concerned that you might not have understood the post, actually, if the general idea of "offering private contact as a first resort here leaves many people with depression feeling worse or at higher risk for abuse and/or suicide, even when done with the best of intentions" is hard to remember. Please let us know if there's anything we can do to make the wiki page clearer.
I just had to learn about this. It's dangerous to take on too much all at once especially if you aren't a professional. We want to help and sometimes we think there's no potential for error if our intentions are good. Do a little good where you can and just help people to understand they aren't worthless and aren't alone. I appreciate the tact of the mods. This made me appreciate Reddit ten fold.
>  I feel like this subreddit may be a bit of an exception to the 1-9 part. If "creation" is making posts and starting discussion and "contributing" is replying to posts, then I think we have as much or even more creation as* contribution based on the low number of responses the majority of new posts get.   I think that part of it is that a lot of posts are actually kind of comments rather than creations.  A surprising number of posts here are title-only, and we're not super-happy about that.  We would like to see people who've reached out for support (and given the community meaningful information to respond to) get more quality responses and we're working on some things to help with that.
> I feel that forced positivity has a worse effect on me than sad posts.  You're not alone, and this topic is one of the info wikis we're working on.

> it’s better not to offer to PM and as it’s a rule now   It's been a rule for *seven years*.
<3
Same. I got sick of all the "follow my magic cure" dms hahaha.
Can someone teach me how to play something?  I don’t see options to create a post
Yeah I agree. I don’t mind when people at least try but when they immediately send you a PM and say "was upppp" I immediately decline because I don’t want to deal with someone who clearly doesn’t get it. Especially when they ask "what’s wrong, why are you depressed", then why the hell did you lurk around on here and send me a private message then? It’s so fucked up.
We made the wiki and this post to make people aware of the potential consequences of getting into private conversations because we know those consequences are hard to foresee.    We don't mean to "paint" anyone, but although there are definitely predators out there, most of the people who offer private contact have nothing but friendly good intentions, but they don't have the information needed to understand the risks and downsides of getting into private conversations too early.  That's not their fault.
Wow, thanks for sharing your cautionary tale. So sorry that happened to you.
Wow that's awful. I'm so sorry you went through that, there are truly some sick people out there! Those are the ones who should be made fun of us, not people like us
Thanks, but it would be better if you went back and removed them from your history.
Agree, it's mostly coming from misguided do-gooders who aren't really thinking about the experience they'd actually be giving to the people they're trying to help.
Yep.   The worst part is that most people who contact me directly are stupid bs advertisers or someone who’s just lurking and has no clue what depression is. I’ve made sure to report these people more, I don’t want to come of as a dick but they’re obviously breaking the rules.
That's a well-known network of PM spambots.  Please report any PMs of that nature to the reddit admins.  The more of these accounts that get flagged, the better dossier they can build.
Yep that has happened to me many times : (
Same! It sucks. When you’re just left all alone and they don’t respond back : (
>  Like were 5-10 replies deep and talked out the current issue?  At 10 replies deep it's fine to offer a PM.  That's why the rule includes "as a first resort".
Yep, especially the ones about selling me pseudoscience cures. Dont forget to always report them to the moderators, who knows maybe they'll give you a cookie, right SQLwitch?
> This is sort of counterproductive though. Most of the time, help isn't generalized, it's personalized by nature.   Uh, no it isn't.  We're not suggesting anything so superficial as lurkers happening to read exactly what they need to hear said to someone else.  Observing truly supportive exchanges is good for everyone's mental health, and a great learning experience for those who want to help but aren't sure how.    > Not everyone's depression look the same, some advice can trigger anxiety in others while it can be a wake-up call to some.    Which is why we explicitly discourage advice.    FYI chats have been tried here many, many times and all have ended in disaster.  We've been forced to conclude that it's not a fit for our population and can't support any further attempts.
It's always difficult (and worrying) when someone gets attached to a resource or individual that just isn't able to provide the right support.  It happens sometimes at my IRL crisis line, most often because they've never had a supportive conversation before they talked to us, so they kind of "imprint" on us (we literally call them "ducklings").  It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that "only X can help me" and also that "X has what I need", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but "PM me anytime" does both those things.    >  There is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.  One of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people *not* in crisis.  We harm people by *not* disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly "I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment.
We also have a specific rule against "pep talks", i.e. general uplifting content.  That and "success stories" both generally work about as well as showing starving people pictures of food.    FYI neither of these rules are new, they're just widely ignored despite our efforts.
There's a lot more to it that that,but this is definitely a key concern.
Please help us by removing any rule-breaking responses. We catch as many as we can, but having any bad examples out there is a problem.
It looks like the technical glitch resolved itself - so sorry that was happening!   Just in case it's helpful in the future, the best thread for making a support request in the comments is the check-in thread at the top of the sub. We also welcome modmails (PM to /r/depression, that reaches the whole mod team at once) about problems on the sub.
Not sure why you put this here, but from reading your history, it sounds like your current therapist isn't handling your disclosure of thoughts of suicide in a way that's helping you.    This is, sadly, such a common problem that we have[this link](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2013/07/22/therapists-who-do-not-panic/) on our official resource list over at /r/SuicideWatch.
As the post explains, offering help in a PM that the OP didn't ask for carries serious risks (both for the person you're offering support to and for you) and can do a lot of harm no matter how well-intentioned; well-intentioned "helpers" using accidentally harmful strategies are actually the most common source of harm we see on this sub. So it's appropriate for people to be wary of offers of help that come this way.  I'm not totally certain if your concern is for people who might want to ask for support in private (which as the post says is always okay although it still carries some risks) or for people who want to offer help in PMs, though...? Again we're glad to clarify anything that doesn't make sense.
> These are people who have brought people back from the ledge on a 30 minute phonecall, but clearly would barely be able to handle a simple check in with a well known well behaved caller after their shift.  Let alone the 3-hour calls that *don't* end well, eh?  It's extremely rare for crisis-line responders to do 12-hours shifts for many reasons including compassion fatigue.  Ours are 4 hours for phone shifts and 5 for online chat.  Double shifts are *strongly* discouraged.
If someone is harassing you in PMs, please report that to the admins.  Exactly how to block and/or report someone depends on which app or client you're using.   In the official mobile apps, both are available by tapping the three dot menu in the top right corner of each message in your PM list.
Then it's even more important to avoid getting into a private conversation.
This rule doesn't mean you can get support here; that's really the only thing we do.
Sorry to hear you're having such a tough time, but an announcement post isn't the best place to talk about it.    Maybe put up a comment in the check-in, or feel free to make a post yourself.
>  it really is hard to do nothing  ... but can i call myself a good man if i just scroll by...  Your choices are **not** "do nothing or invite private contact"!  The wise choice for those offering support is to respond openly by replying to the posts of OPs you feel you can relate to.
If you link the thread in question I'll be happy to take a look.
You can report a PM to the sitewide admins by clicking "report" on it or going to https://www.reddit.com/report/ - don't post usernames of spammers, please!   I appreciate your wanting to report it - trying to proselytize to people when they're struggling with depression is not in any way okay or helpful, really sorry that happened.
We're sorry for what you're going through, but replying to an announcement post is not the best way to ask for support.  Please make your own post or reply to the check-in.  If you want to talk to the moderators,  use the "contact the moderators" function.
We have this rule on /r/SuicideWatch as well - did you receive the automatic welcome message pointing you towards the guidelines (which mentions the PM guideline specifically) after your first comment on someone else's post there?
> So disable comments completely?  No, making *comments* is what helpers should be doing.  What they shouldn't be doing is taking the conversation immediately to a private channel like reddit PMs or chat, etc.
> so can we chant on private in reddit or does it mean for every thing? Even reddit??  Sorry, I'm not sure exactly what this means.

There's no sidebar on mobile.  Edit: at least as far as I've seen.

> I don’t really pm people to force positivity  The point of the wiki and this post is that you shouldn't be PMing people from here, period.  it's not a matter of "offense", it's a matter of someone's mental health and sometimes even their survival.
Really? I could‘ve sworn I’ve seen tons of such comments here. Am I making this up or did I just see some comments just before they were removed or were you removing only some of them because a lot of people don’t know this rule?
I just keep to myself now, everyone has let me down, or more likely I've let everyone else down haha.
I find people switch to PM's when they've posted more than they thought they would. That's probably also one reason why people who haven't talked to anybody delete their posts.  For the people I've had experience with, I've found that this usually doesn't mean they want to talk indeterminately so much so as finish some topic without being abstract about it.  Now when you offer somebody the option of just chatting, that can be pretty indeterminate. You pretty much *can't* do both that and be an active member of this subreddit. You can, thankfully, be clear what you mean by chatting and that as a peer you have limitations yourself. This could be selection bias in who I can actually develop a rapport with.  Which is totally different from ending a thread by making sure somebody has talked about what they want to. Seriously, just advising anybody reading to clearly use the words 'reply' and 'in this thread' if they mean that, instead of a generic 'continue talking' offer. Even when starting to talk to somebody on the community threads, it might be best to specify that you're here to chat about this, rather than a generic 'to chat', now that I think about it.  I don't start PM's. I avoid accidentally encouraging PM's. I do reply to them. As far as I understand, this is within the rules since it's not a first resort.
>Observing truly supportive exchanges is good for everyone's mental health  this is not true, you're acting as if depression is the only mental health variable at play here. When you introduce other forms of mental health factors things gets complicated.  &#x200B;  > Which is why we explicitly discourage advice.   So what's the point of this sub? To circle jerk around depression?   &#x200B;  > FYI chats have been tried here many, many times and all have ended in disaster.    Makes sense.
Yes! I’ve called a crisis line three times in my life, all years apart. The one time when I genuinely felt understood and felt calmer at the end of the call was when the person opened by saying that there was only so much that they could do, agreed that others overpromising and underdelivering was a large contributing factor to why I was doing so poorly, and just listened to and validated my feelings without trying to “fix” them or tell me basically that I should “stop feeling that way.” I called while I was in the process of trying to access actual professional support and not finding it. And that’s what I needed in that moment, just another person to hear me out and tell me that I wasn’t crazy or overreacting by feeling the way I did, in order to help me maintain the level of calm that I needed so I could continue the search for more substantial long-term help.  “Ducklings” I like that. I know the type of person you are talking about. Yes, it’s true that their expectations are unrealistic, but it’s really nice that you’re not dismissive of the fact that they are in real pain and reaching out to the only source of comfort they may have found so far.
That’s good. Because that stuff generally comes off as braggadocio.   I’m aware, hence why I called it a great *reiterative* step! Though “emphasized” might’ve been a better term now that I think about it.
If I have broken the rule on asking people on this sub to PM me, which I probably have, I apologize.
Of course, I'll notify a mod if I see anything
People who like to offer help in PMs. *raise hand guiltily.  Haha i won't do that here.  Thank you for your effort. It put a literal smile in many people faces. :)   <-- that's mine btw. Sorry for cringe.
Staff shortages and holidays and the need for the agency to be staffed 24-7, and the fact that I'm in California makes 16 hour shifts a thing at my call center. No one is going to be asked to do a shift that long, but I am not kidding when I say that I've seen a few counselors do it.   They're reducing the volume. We've had to rerouting a lot of clients as the call volume is far too high right now.
Well I'm not finding it. Maybe I'm too far gone. It's been this way 33 years
Oh sorry, I thought this was the check in post.
your right ofcourse, i will follow the guidlines.  i apologize again.
How do I link the thread or link you to the messages exchanged?  Thanks.
The url link of the message exchange is  https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/mldzgl  Is that what you need?
I'll tag you in the comment/reply of the exchange.
Yeah, I did .... I read a lot of stuff on what not to say to people contemplating suicide but this rule I don't remember seeing. Could be my memory though.
Though will all the rules stating "Things you shouldn't be saying" what's the point of saying anything?  It's just odd 🤨
[deleted]
> i feel like sometimes its good to talk to someone and vent how you feel or what your situation is  Of course it is, but it's just better to get to know someone out in the sub first.  We know a lot of our OPs have privacy concerns, but we think that using a throwaway account (we have disabled all the settings that prevent new or low-karma accounts from posting) is a better option in that case.
On mobile, it's under "community info", "about this community", or a similarly-phrased link, depending on which mobile interface/app you're using.
>honestly helps no one but the person saying it.  After suffering for many years with pretty strong clinical depression and talking tons of folks who offer support, it's been rare that I come across someone who tries to abuse you like the OP says. Instead it's common to find those who only offer to listen and/or say cliche phrases to make themselves feel better for their "altruism". Their listening can give me an insincere vibe because they sometimes don't say something that would indicate they actually heard what you were talking about. Has irked me considerably.
So dont try to help cause we are too ignorant and that will make it worse? Alot of us reach out here because we have no one to turn to. Even medical professionals refuse some of us. I feel like I'd be safer in PM as opposed to on an open thread. Just my opinion.
> ? I could‘ve sworn I’ve seen tons of such comments here  That's exactly why we made this post and the wiki.  We have an automated rule that cleans up a tremendous number of them but some still leak through and people don't know to report them.  It causes us a huge amount of work and that slows down everything else we'd like to be working on.
> this is not true, you're acting as if depression is the only mental health variable at play here.  I'm saying that seeing how support can work is a viable treatment for every mental-health issue, but it is good for our general mental health.   And, don't forget that we are very clear that all we can offer here is peer support.    >> Which is why we explicitly discourage advice.  > So what's the point of this sub?   Support <> advice.
Exactly!  Why do people think parading around holding up a sign that says "look how well I'm doing" is supportive?
The best thing you can do is clean up your history for us.
Yikes, that's awful :-(
As you haven't made a post here, can you tell me a bit more about yourself and your situation?
We can't see your PMs even with a link.  I was asking about the public context that led to it.
So if you mean do reddit PMs count as "private contact" then absolutely yes.
The official reddit app. And thanks.
Please *do* try to help if you have the energy, but also please read our information resources.
Lol so many things mods do go unnoticed. Thank you for everything, especially as it’s such an important sub!
>I'm saying that seeing how support can work is a viable treatment for every mental-health issue  And i'm saying this is not true. OCD, and a lot of different types of neuropsychiatric disorders usually turns "support" from uneducated personnel, into support for destructive behaviors.     If I'm too be honest, we're not going to help even a minority of people reaching out here, and especially not the majority of suicidal people who just lurk and never reach out or post at all.      I do agree with you that advice won't help, but I don't agree that support does.

> And I dont believe in anything, least of all any goodness in humanity. But do you believe any of that?  Personally, I think that humans defy generalisation.  I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.    There are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.    There are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.  But I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the "developed" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.    >  I'm the most negative person alot of people have ever met.  Are you truly "negative"?  Or do you just need to have your personal ugly truths heard and understood?
Seems to me you got yourself into trouble by alluding to things you weren't prepared to share in the thread.
If you are acting as a helper, you're not allowed to invite private contact **in any form**.  If you're here to get help, it's not recommended but not strictly against the rules.  That is the whole point of the wiki.  Please read it -- it answers all these questions in detail.
Your resource are encouraging people to not get involved.
We know and we're working hard to build additional resources that are specifically to help the helpers (and especially the people who want to help but don't well they have enough knowledge).
Stop wasting time and do your job!!!!1
As I'm definitely an eeyore person as well, what can we do as subs to help the mods?
>Can you give me an example?  Sure, if the person is suffering from say a mix of diagnoses and is getting support from reddit for depression for his/hers self described situation, that can very easily turn badly if the patient in question is actually suffering from different types of mental health disorders and is currently self harming, that support can turn into support for those destructive tendencies.  &#x200B;  Another example would be psychosis for example.
I'm truly negative. Doctors cant deal with me.
"Got myself into trouble"... Frankly, Take what you like & leave the rest: It's more an issue of discretion...  I can write, in EXPLICIT detail about the events of my past AND my present. Further, from my own experience, I'm fully aware that some minors unfortunately go through vile & reprehensible things. For this LATTER cause, knowing there's NO age filter on this platform, I won't give ALL of the salacious details of the abuse which led to my suicidal ideations prior to age 6. So, my private message stated as such & I asked the age of the enquirer. (14 yrs old). I then informed them because of that,  I'd give some of the details, but not all of them. Then I stated I remembered well from my experience how difficult the teen years are & that I couldn't fix anything or advise, however if they wanted a safe place to vent, they had my ear.  As a moderator are you counseling I openly speak of the sexual use & abuse which fostered my want of self destruction regardless of the possible (likely) presence of minors?
::slinks away with tail drooping::
Read the rules, report inappropriate content.  When someone seems well-meaning, kindly direct them to the rule they don't seem to be aware of.  For anything really flagrant, message our modmail.    Do *not* encourage people who are *not* asking for support about depression *the mental illness*  1. "achievement" or "milestone" posts and encouraging people who make them are all outside our mission  2.  Any kind of bad life experience or situation (e.g. social injustice, lousy birthdays, bad breakups, any grief and loss) is *not* a mental illness.  Feeling bad for good reason is perfectly healthy.  So, again, all that's outside our mission and should be discouraged.   Sort by new, look for people in distress who haven't received quality replies and empathise with them.    Nice jaunty bow you have on your tail there :-)
So, wouldn't that be a risk everywhere on the internet, no matter what?  Not sure that's in our power to prevent.  Nor how you're claiming it would be ameliorated by private conversation with untrained peers where there's no community scrutiny.    Didn't answer my question about depression versus suicidality, btw.
How do you mean?
> As a moderator are you counseling I openly speak of the sexual use & abuse which fostered my want of self destruction regardless of the possible (likely) presence of minors?  Absolutely yes.    First, that type of content is common here and we don't ask OPs in need of support to censor themselves.  Second, most of the minors who come here have experienced a fairly comparable level of trauma.
>So, wouldn't that be a risk everywhere on the internet, no matter what?  Yes, which was my point.   &#x200B;  > Nor how you're claiming it would be ameliorated by private conversation with untrained peers where there's no community scrutiny.   Oh I don't. I think they're equal in their possibility to affect badly. But PMs probably open a different sets of difficulty from bad actors as well as depressed people generally having a bad effect on each other.
.... Uhmmm. Wow. I'll have to ruminate on that one for awhile. 🤔😬

Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the "role model" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.  We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under "Community Info" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us.    ********  Please keep in mind that no activism, i.e.  advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues, is ever allowed here.  It's not that we're against activism.  We're strongly in favour of it.  But we've learned the hard way that it doesn't work within a dedicated support space, so with regret, we can't allow it any more.  Thanks for understanding.  Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.
one of the hardest things, for me, has been realizing that when people say “you can talk to me, I’m here for you,” they generally don’t mean it.  a friend I thought I was close to gave me that spiel… and when I opened up to her about how I was feeling, she immediately recoiled and said, “you need to talk to a professional, I’m not your therapist.” she said it as if I had talked to her against her will, when she was the one who repeatedly invited me to open up (and I declined at first because I didn’t want to bother her).  I know she’s not my therapist. I know that no one owes me anything. I wasn’t looking for her (or anyone else) to fix my problems or even offer advice. all I wanted was for someone to listen to me and maybe try to empathize. it would’ve meant the world to me just to express my feelings to someone and hear them say, “that sounds hard, I’m sorry you’re dealing with that,” instead of lecturing me. I thought she was willing to listen, in the same way that I listened to her in the past.  I don’t know what I keep doing wrong. I think the best option is never to open up to anyone.
When life gets worse showers become longer.
I showered, brushed my teeth and changed my clothes yesterday. I even managed to go grocery shopping and bought mostly healthy things. I haven't been productive beyond that but it made me smile.
I keep making comments and deleting them. It all just seems pointless. When I do get an upvote, it's hollow.   And I cringe when I read back on them. I'm just dumping toxic garbage out on here when people have real and tangible problems.   I feel bad for contributing to negativity when it doesn't feel authentic anyway.
Nothing matters. Im 24 and started working. This is the rest of my life until i die. Just work, live for the weekends and repeat. Nothing but stress and anxiety bundled up.
Can’t sleep because of depression, but I’m too tired and distracted to actually do something. It’s 4:30 am and I just keep tossing and turning.   I feel super lonely.
Today's my birthday and I hate it. I've been hating my birthdays for some years now, I don't know why should I celebrate the day I was born, I hate that I was born
today’s my first day off after an 18-day run without any. but i managed to drag myself out of bed and get ready in time to meet with the person i’m seeing this morning, he’s a sweet guy. we went to the history museum and got lunch afterwards (while distancing from others, ofc). we discussed our favorite things, and he listened as i babbled about music for a while. it felt nice, even though i came home and sank into bed right away. by some miracle i also have tomorrow off, and he said he’d love to hang out then too.   i’m glad i got a good day today.
I'm so fucking tired, just like the lot of you.   Had surgery two days ago, so I know that that is causing the inflammation worsening my depression but I also can't think myself out of it. I guess the only thing I can do is rest and accept where I'm at right now.
I just cleaned my bathroom for the first time in over a year, and I'm fucking proud of myself right now.  For 1-2 years now my apartment has gone downhill, no cleaning and boxes and whatever piling up everywhere.  I haven't been able to use the sinks in my bathroom and the kitchen for ages now because it's just a disaster. And I haven't had family or anyone else over here the past two years because I don't want them to find out how I live.  Last week I had a panic attack that was triggered by someone suddenly knocking on my door, I think it was some routine thing by my landlord.  I pretended I wasn't home all day by staying inside, being quiet and having lights off. I decided that night enough is enough.  The devil on my shoulder tells me that the only reason I was able to clean the bathroom today was because I recently continued getting access to my ADHD meds. And just because the meds are what gave me the energy and focus to do this means I didn't accomplish shit.  I don't care, I can't stop smiling.  The kitchen is next.
I just want someone to notice my existence and that I'm not okay.
I turn 54 today.  No cake, no party.  I stopped celebrating birthdays years ago.  Rather than pretending that others forgot, I’d rather ignore it.  COVID means that I don’t even get the strained, obligatory “happy birthday” from co-workers if they even remembered.  They don’t.  Tomorrow will be the same as today and will be the same as yesterday.  One day, I revel in knowing that I will fall asleep and not awaken.  No one will notice.  Nobodies life will be diminished.  My adult sons will gather and lament “not being more involved” and will feel bad for a couple days.  Then they will forget.  I was told when I was 20 that things will get better.  That there will be parties, and friends...and while nobody lied, they grossly exaggerated.  So people, especially the young, time flies quick.  There are no guarantees.  And before you know it, you’re 54, sitting on your porch, just waiting for the end.
I have this crush on someone, and I just *know* they would never go for someone like me. I'm just too odd and different (just look at my profile).  Makes me think that I'm seriously never gonna find a partner, or even good friends. I can't ever, ever not be alone. And it fucking sucks. I want to be loved and appreciated for my existence.  Edit: I should add, I'm an old school practicing Muslim that's also gay. So it's all just generally confusing really. I want to just jump into the liberal pond and maybe find a lover, but every time I try I feel so out of my element. Don't think people like me are supposed to exist.
Ache so badly for things I can't have.
I honestly don’t know how much longer I can hold onto this world. Both my physical and mental health deteriorated so much these days, but everyday life is still so draining.
I started cleaning up my room yesterday. I don't want to show photos in case someone IRL recognizes it but I threw out at least like 20 pizza boxes to give an idea of how messy it was.    Then I woke up late, wasted some time and headed out to cafe to apply for work and go through emails. And to sort out some finances. It's something. I hope I manage to clean up more.  Job applications are stressful. I keep having negative thoughts on how I'm not good enough. The job description asks for a few years in something I'm not familiar with for something I WANT to work as. I apply anyways. I know I'm not good enough. So then should I try to get better? How? What do I build? It's not like anything I make will make me money. And it's several hours of work for something that should help me. But it's just so slow and not an immediate reward. It can take hundreds of hours to get good enough. For roles I don't want to work in at industries I don't like I keep wondering if as a beggar I can be a chooser or if I should apply anyways.
I'm having a real crisis, feeling like I'm not wanted at all.. Like I'm being replaced slowly or outright ignored by my family.. If I try to speak up, I end up feeling like the bad guy, or interrupted three times.. i don't know what to do anymore.
Mental illness like hypothermia. If you stop moving just once you'll freeze to death.
You know that feeling when you're travelling somewhere and are just waiting for the destination? The seat is not comfortable and distractions aren't enjoyable anymore, so just sit there and wait.   That's my life right now. Except I'm not going anywhere.
How many more years? How long more do I have to endure? I’m so tired. So exhausted.

Nothing made me happy today either
For the past 3 months I’ve worked out at least 4 times a week. Really proud of myself for staying consistent with this despite struggling a lot recently. Gives me something to look forward to now
I'm tired of being tired the whole day...
Sadly, I survived 2020.
I want to feel normal
Does anyone else want to have hobbies but the act of setting up is too exhausting itself?  ETA: will decluttering help with this?
reasons I haven't killed myself yet  * my mom and a couple other relatives would probably be really devastated, I don't want anyone else feeling as low as I do * when I get the chance, I want to visit Japan on my own. That's maybe a year or two away          I'm just not fit for this world. I don't like the way it functions. There's nothing I want to do, so why keep living. I've lived alone for a couple of years now. Alone as in it's just me in the apartment but also I really haven't had a single person to talk to outside that apartment either. Don't talk with my parents. They're just workaholics and everyone in the family is doing their own things. I have a job and a steady income but nothing to do with the money. Nothing but maybe that Japan trip. I've cried my eyes out in front of a few professionals about myself, but they just chalk it off as mild depression or something. No, I really just don't want to live. Can you cure that disease? Or should I just off myself?
thinking about how, deep down, I've always held onto this sliver of hope that one day, the abuse I experienced would be recognized and the people who hurt me would be revealed for what they are.  it will never happen. the world doesn't work like that. I wish it did.  I know the key is acceptance. and I think I have accepted that it is what it is and can't change. but it still hurts.  I accept the world for what it is. I just don't want to live in a world like this one.
Left my abusive partner over the weekend:  I built the courage to stand up for myself and leave and not tolerate the treatment I was receiving and I left that night after telling her to her face that I’m leaving and finding someone new.  She smacked me in the face previously on the day that I walked away for good. I spoke my mind and said what I had to say and then left never looking back.
I just need a hug right now is all.
I have a psychiatrist appointment that I’m looking forward to next week. I’m having very bad thoughts, especially when going to bed and could use a med adjustment. On a good note I bought myself a teddy bear in the hopes it will bring some comfort.
I just finished the third issue of the comic I've been working on. It's fan fiction, but still. It's beautiful. I've poured hundreds of hours of work into it and seeing the results makes it worth it, but I can't help but wonder if I only do all this to escape what I'm going through right now. The more painful it gets, the more I immerse myself in the work. It's the only thing keeping me going these days. I have to rest now, so I can't hide from the pain right now.
112 days since I last posted here. (I searched my comments) Hmm. For the last two months I've been in a very happy place/content.   I think I may have conquered depression? I hope so.
My psychiatrist died unexpectedly.He was such a good doctor he really cared about me and my mental health. I’ve been seeing him for over 2 years, I feel like he really “got me”.
Any of you feel like you just want to sleep forever? When you sleep all the good things come true in your dreams. When you are awake, it’s just endless suffering with no benefits.
why am I self sabotaging...why am I up playing a game at 5 AM instead of getting a healthy sleep schedule  maybe because life only feels like "have to" and none of all the stress is for anything I really want?  sigh
I don't understand why nobody wants to text me, call me or simply inform me when they hangout with each other. I used to be very funny, I made a lot of people laugh when I was in college, I even used to help them with their issues and shit.   I guess being unemployed and poor is not very attractive to anybody. I'm way too lonely, seeing people I used to know hanging out with each other on instagram is messed up.  I'm no more funny, I'm grumpy, this is my default mood.
Back in this sub again after a very long time.
Fuck me I guess for trying to express my feelings to anyone. There's never any point trying to "reach out" to people. There's never even any sympathy or compassion, they just get angry.  Some would probably miss me if I was gone, but they still won't do anything to help me while I'm here.
Amazing how quick a day can go from ok to shit. At this point, I just can’t wait until it’s time to go to bed.
I haven't had a conversation in years. I wish I had someone to talk to. I enjoy talking to myself but it gets lonesome after a while.
I wasted another day.
I'm honestly glad I could help someone out last week. I was heading to Wally World after the gym and had a small lunch that I grabbed from work that morning on the front seat. As I pulled into the parking lot I noticed a homeless gentleman and his dog across the street. Now I have seen him there for the longest time and was always very curious about him and I don't know what complelled me this day, because this is *so* out of character for me but I grabbed the food, walked across the street and said that I didn't know if he had eaten at all that day but I figured he could use it a lot more than me.  Cue me sitting next to him and chatting away with him for a good 20 minutes. And honestly, it was probably the only time in days I was genuinely happy; I had been feeling really lonely and sad about everything and nothing simultaneously so it was quite an unexpected boost. I learned quite a bit about him and honest felt bad for him and the situation he was in. Soon a man pulled up and handed him a bag of food for his pup and I think a $10. He patted his pocket and mentioned how it was going to help him maybe get a hotel room and a place to shower that night.  I was getting up to leave and remembering that comment and the fact I still had some birthday money in my pocket, I handed him one of my $50's and said "I know this isn't much but I hope this gets you closer to your hotel room tonight." The smile on his face and his gratitude made it all worth it. I know I myself am struggling and don't have much but I felt it was my duty to help him. I told him in these absolutely crazy times we do need to look out for each other and help out when we can.  Of course the next day I ended up feeling like crud again but I'm at least glad I could make someone else's day brighter despite mine being perpetually overcast and swarming with flying murder hornets.
the catch-22 of getting a good job with health insurance, then finding out that the thing that was supposed to enable you to get help effectively disqualifies you, because medical professionals think people who are "really" depressed or suicidal can't hold a job like that, so they don't take you seriously

I saw an old friend yesterday, and it was great to see her. But it was also kind of surreal because she seems like she's doing really well now, which is obviously great, but it made me realize that I'm not doing so great by comparison.  I've been working on recording music lately, but I'm not getting too much feedback from posting it online. I miss playing shows and I'm sad that I can't do that until whenever the quarantine ends.  My parents' political views have been brought out by the protests recently. And I've come to see we aren't really on the same page. I've been talking to them, but it's very hard to get through to them. That makes me sad too.  On the positive side, I haven't hit my head/self-harmed in over three months now.
Please stop giving me shit for still living with you at 23.....apartments  aren't even cheap, its going to take a while for me to even get sufficient funds for rent, bills + food  Just please stop  Its not like i don't do anything. I wake up every day at 8am to help and clean. Just fucking stop acting like I'm a damn leech  I can't even do much when I have so little money to move out.

im so tired of everything
i’m so tired
So I’m going thru a breakup, my mom died, I lost my business, discovered I’m to dumb for construction and call center jobs, and smashed my finger under a rock...I think I was way depressed before any of that shit happened, then Covid hit, giving me another dozen issues...Thursday I just snapped, I couldn’t stop crying, wrote a suicide note and planned it out. I was am taking Wellbutrin and was going to start couples counseling Monday.  I had to chat with the suicide prevention hot line...I felt better by the afternoon and functioned, then Friday hit and I bought some razors and started cutting myself..I’m going to cut again after I finish writing this...the Saturday hit and I was bad...I couldn’t wait till Monday...I emailed a therapist I knew and told everything..she told me to call the local help line..I did.  Then somehow the sheriffs department went to my house so now my so knows how fucked up I am and we decided to use Monday’s session just for me....she doesn’t know I wrote a note and had a plan am cutting myself.  So I’m sitting here all alone waiting for Monday...tomorrow I’ll be sitting here all day waiting for Monday I don’t know what will happen. Now I feel stupid, embarrassed, weak minded and like I’m not really that sick. I don’t know what to say Monday. He doesn’t know I’m coming in for depression.  I forgot to buy sleeping pills.
Sometimes I just wanna play video games, eat and sleep for the rest it my life .
Im so tired... Im really really tired.
I wish I could take a remote and rewind my life and start again.
In the Marine Corps there is a huge stigma against depression. They say you should get help but that will just skyline you. They really don’t care about you personally and will not hesitate to burn you and ruin your life. It’s an easy trap they want you to walk into.   I’ve been in 4 years now out of a 5 year contract. I always feel so empty inside. I’m always hurting. Physically and mentally. But I grit my teeth and push.   I joined to get away from my toxic past. I always fear it will one day catch up with me. I have not talked to my family in almost 6 years now. When I get out soon I know they will ship me back to that hellhole unless I take action quickly.   I’m still young but my shoulders, back, and knees are all pretty much destroyed. I’m going blind without expensive meds and I am almost completely deaf in my right ear.   It is extremely hard to relate to normal everyday people now. I feel like I should have accomplished so much more at this point in my life. I wake up everyday and try to ignore the hell that is raging in my head.
I’m so done with life
I wish COVID had killed me
I feel so empty and miserable but I don’t want to accept that I’m depressed even though I probably am.
no one really knows how bad I am doing, for some reason around other people I am completely normal and they can’t tell how much I really need help, but I’m too afraid to tell anyone because I am not sure if I know how because I have always been like this
thinking about when I was a kid, happy and innocent, didn't give a shit at what people thought about me, had friends, etc  but I wanted to grow up so badly, now I just wish to be my younger self again, maybe i wouldn't be stressing so much
I totally forgot I was a college student. Can't even remember the last time I attended my virtual classes. Well, guess I'm getting a WI... again. I have zero motivation for school anymore, my mind is completely on other things. Don't even want to think about trying to "catch up". Maybe next semester will be better...
[deleted]
So does anyone else on here just feel numb inside?   I mean there is stuff in life around me that I should be happy about, and I got nothing!!  I can tell people I love them, because I know I should, but I don’t really feel anything.
it’s so bad I can only laugh
man. im kinda really fucked in school rn. im missing assignments, not paying attention, all that shit. i also have a test in like 12 hours which i have no clue what the fuck its on. i dunno if i want to blame it on depression just yet. but fuck dude im so fucked.  im also crazy fucking lonely. so lonely man. i sometimes just lay awake because it. idk im just rambling at this point
Idk man.  Sometimes I feel like it’s getting better, then I fall right back into the same old place.  It feels like the last time I mattered was years ago.  And god am I lonely as hell.  It keeps me up at night more often than not.  Idk why I post here every few months...  I guess it’s just because I don’t have anyone to trust irl and I can’t deny how nice it feels to lay things out like this.  Ah well
I hate myself, i feel like im in hell. I keep repeating the same mistakes over and over. I ruined my life along with my family’s. I don’t deserve to be alive. Am I even alive? This is the worst day of my whole entire life. I can’t talk to anyone. I feel hopeless because it’s hopeless. Im constantly afraid of myself. I feel like im intentionally dragging myself down
What’s even the point of all this shit? All I do is study and work. I hate college and I hate working. Why should I keep this up for another 40 years?
Sometimes I fear I won’t make it through this fight regardless how much I fight. I need peace. I when I close my eyes the only peace I can see is through death.
I just want to feel normal for one fucking moment
how do you guys keep up. this world is so fast and so bad at the same time, everytime I open the news it's just bad news after bad news. we're supposed to be the smartest species but I really don't feel that. how do you guys/gals go on without acknowledging that deep pit in front of you? I can't find the strength to go on right now
honestly would pay to see an outsider's  pov of me. What is it about my personality that makes people not value me as a friend? Becuz I'm always cracking jokes so people don't see me as "worthy"? Becuz I don't backstab and gossip about others to gain popularity points? WHY????? :(
Just tired, tank is on less than empty and the thought of doing anything just makes me feel even more tired.
My life is a waste. Trapped alone in a room. Trapped inside of my own head. I just feel so sad about it all.
very alone. this is my breaking point.
It was really difficult admitting that people were right in their observations about me. I'm trying to be a better person now but my anxiety is killing me.
I just don't know if I can be here anymore. 31 and a failure at life. I keep making the same mistakes. In this state of arrested development. I wake up every day and by the time I gather myself to do anything, it's night and the whole thing starts all over again.   I gave up any hope of having a career or artistic dreams or relationships. I gave up everything and replaced it with nothing.
I want to fucking die.
I can not be happy, no matter how much I try to be. Everytime something good happens, my brain starts thinking horrible things that I don’t even know if they are real or just something that exists only in my head. I’m pretty sure everyone around me can’t stand being with me anymore, not my boyfriend nor my friends. I want to be good enough for them, but I’m just a burden and I can’t help it most of the times. I am so tired, I just want a hug.
These two weeks have been bad. I'm stuck in a rut and my job search is going nowhere. No replies at all.  Currently lying on my bed feeling down. I've been on social media, mostly YouTube a lot. The days get repetitive and I'm trying to not lose my mind.  Edit: I put together a wishlist of work outfits that I would buy when I get a new job. That somehow cheered me up a bit. I'm not encouraging overconsumption tho, just that most of my wardrobe are old clothes and in need of an update
i have nothing to offer to people around me anyway, im ugly, socially inept, unintelligent, unmotivated, gross. whats the fucking point of me. i wish to die
19 days before anyone tried messaging me to see if I was alright. One person shared with mutuals how depressed and despondent I've been in some weird effort to find a way to contact me, which I guess explains all the people who deleted me yesterday. The other messaged and is back to ignoring me after I replied - stopped gaming with him due to net issues, I've since been written off by the looks of it.  Being there for the above and letting them vent at me about the stupidest things over the years never earned me the right to do same to them. I keep finding the shittiest people to try and be friends with. Or in these cases I should say they keep finding me.  Being lonely sucks, but I was happier coming on here for half a month and not having to talk to anyone. Anonymous Reddit is a better friend. Kind of pathetic.  But anyhoo, methinks it's time for a friend purge. Maybe one of these days the powers that be will let us disable friend invites on social and gaming platforms.
My hearing to determine if I'll get disability is tomorrow. I'm hella nervous.
Not meeting deadlines ahhhhhhhh Not being productive ahhhhhhhh Keeping avoiding tasks that I don't want to work on ahhhhhhhhhhh
The phrase "it'll never be okay" with an image of me blowing my brains out is commonly on loop inside my mind
my eyes hurt from crying.
I guess I had been fooled, once again, about trying to have any hope and optimism that things would change, however slightly. Just ended up being another weekend spent alone. I am trying to find a date online, and in short, one turned out to be an inappropriate jerk when we hardly even spoke other than texting and two others don't seem engaged or respond well when indicating that I want to talk if not meet up and get to know them better. I know, 'love' will not solve problems or escape my own hell called mental illness. But when you're used to the same thing for so long and have almost nobody, you'll do anything to try feeling like you are worth something to someone. Apparently with my brief back to attempt at online dating, shown the contrary.
It's my birthday today. I have a huge headache and I found a dead mousey who drowned in a water bowl I put out.. I'm depressed daily because my ex-wife left, and I can't stop thinking about how much I failed to be a good person back to her in our relationship. She was the kindest and smartest person I've ever met and I was so lucky to have her. I just hope more than anything that she's happy now but it kills me that I can't be in her life anymore without hurting her.  I'm struggling to not text her because I just know she'll be hurt no matter what I say. I made a promise to myself to not put her through that pain any more and I feel like that's the last and least thing I can do for her. She deserves to not be scared of me texting her or being worried that I'm watching her. I love and failed her so much that my heart literally aches.  I wish I had someone in my life to distract me from this pain but the world is just so gray it's hard for me to imagine it. It's been almost a year and I'm really scared this won't end even if I deserve it. I'm tired of thinking about myself and I'm tired of pretending to be happy around people but I know that everyone who's left in my life will leave me if I don't. Going to try cleaning today to feel better and then just sleep my birthday away. Thanks for reading.
I'm a 28 year old man crying in my room because I'm bad at video games. I have no other hobbies. I'm fat, I can't do much in the way of physical things anymore. I have no emotional highs anymore because my doctor has been upping my dosage of medication. My lows are far less frequent but they feel so much worse now. I have no passion for my job anymore. I used to love what I do. Now I dread Mondays and feel sick to my stomach on Sunday nights. My apartment has been a mess for months but I don't have the energy to clean it. My family is all dealing with their own bullshit and keep coming to me for help and I just can't do that anymore. I have nobody I feel I can talk to because all my friends and loved ones either have their own shit going on or don't understand and just say the same shit about them not understanding. It's been a long time since I had thoughts of suicide. I still haven't been thinking about it but I'm getting to the point where I just don't want to BE anymore. I seriously need to change everything in my life all at once or I'm scared I won't make it.
Sister texted me getting onto me because I posted suicidal adjacent stuff on twitter. The posts in question:  "What is the point of therapy if material conditions won't improve in order to maintain my mental health. I makes more sense to just kill myself already if I could but I'm too fucking weak to do that. And apparently it's just "all in my head" and dying is "irrational" fuck you"  and  "I don't fucking want coping mechanisms I want a life worth living"  I am so sick and tired of her being above it all. Not everyone gets a loving partner and a life thats your own like you do Meredith. Not everyone is just as "tough and naturally gifted" as you are. I get it. I'm the weakest link. You don't know how that feels and you never will understand how that feels. You will never feel as worthless as I have. You will never feel this indescribable alienation that I feel from everything and everyone. Maybe at one point in your life you understood that feeling but now you lost it. You aren't on my team anymore and nothing else shows it better than the shit you said to me on that day several years ago. I can't even remember how long ago it was because my brain is so profoundly fucked up. Could've been yesterday for all I fucking know. Nothing matters anymore. You don't love me you only love the idea of me. You'd best just move along or kill me yourself.
I’m just getting so tired...
Cant cry, cant sleep. I only need to finish my thesis to graduate but im so tired of it. I really am. Still depressed over my ex god knows why, its been months. Ig im just tired of life
Depression is hitting me really hard. I have no one to talk to. No one at school, at home, or at work. I have no one. I used to be so much happier before even when I barely had anyone. Now, I can't even stand being myself...
Many, many times during a day, I refer to myself in third person and say: "He hung himself".

I’ve never really used Reddit, but I’ve gotten to the point I wake up everyday with extreme existential dread and see no point in moving forward, so I’m desperate. I just need someplace to let this out where other people can understand. I had my depression under really good control the last 4 years thanks to medication and therapy! Last year I really felt like my life was on track, but when coronavirus hit and threw everything sideways, it’s been nothing but downhill, and I feel like I’m back at square 1. I haven’t felt this godawful since 2016, before I started my current medication. Not only lots of personal issues, but with the state of the world as well, I’m constantly stressed out and feel awful about it. I feel like I’m only ever sad or struggling whenever I talk to my mom (or even my friends) recently, who’s been my support system for years and seen me at my absolute worst. All the work she’s put into helping me and yet here I am again, wallowing in pity because my will to live has vanished once more. I’ve started telling myself I’m 23 and I can keep going, cause I never expected to make it past 20. But as soon as I say that I break down, almost like I wish I wasn’t here. I’m conflicted every single day. And it feels like, for the brief time I was happy, mainly the last half of last year, that was it. Brief. So is that how my life is gonna feel if I keep going? What’s the point if I’m miserable all the time? I have a loving family and friends who really care about my well being and I’ve relied on, but all I feel like anymore is a burden. I’m stuck between “shit happens” and “the slightest inconvenience makes me want to break down and disappear so I can finally escape the hell that is my brain”. I’m still going. I know it would rip my mom apart if anything happened to me, our family has experience more extreme loss in the last 3 years than anyone should go through. Yet she still remains strong and I can barely go to online classes.   Not to mention I live in America, so I worry about being able to even pay for my meds.   At this point, I wish Covid had taken me out. I even have asthma and a history of pneumonia so I’m an easy target. I’d trade places with someone who got it and actually had a life to live for in a heartbeat, knowing I helped someone would be nice.  Thanks for letting me vent here. If anyone is reading this, I wish you the best.
i dont want to go on with my life anymore. but i imagine the looks on my parents’ faces if they see me. im slowly isolating myself from my friends and family. the thought of not existing anymore is all i think about. that’s why i decided to do something about it and contacted a local psychiatric clinic. i hope it goes well.
I have no motivation anymore. I’m trying, but I don’t have motivation to leave the house. I don’t have motivation to complete schoolwork (I’m in college). I was s*xually *ssaulted twice in the past year and a half, and that was after an ab*sive relationship. I found out about a month ago that my male best friend was a serial r*pist and he admitted it to me. I’m not contemplating ending my life, but I genuinely find no joy in doing things anymore. I’ll be content sometimes, but only briefly. Then the numbness sets in. Every day is the same, and I’m angry at myself for enabling it. I know that things will get better. I hope that they will. But for now, I’m just trying to feel alive.
I skip school and just go for walks alone listening to music. It’s the only time I feel at peace.
Fuck work, fuck depression, fuck anxiety, fuck procrastination.
Repressi depressi. Days are just starting to blend in eachother. Just wasting my lige rn even tho im almost dome with my bachelors. Cant even get stupid drunk to forget everything
I haven’t slept more than 6 consecutive hours a night -typically about 4-5- in over two weeks. My 9 month old is going through a sleep regression and I’m starting to get major anxiety before trying to put her down for the night, as well as extremely bad intrusive thoughts in the middle of the night when she wakes back up screaming and I try for hours to get her to go back down... I can’t keep going on like this. I can’t do this. I’m a horrible mom and honestly I just want all the pain in the world because I feel like that’s what I deserve.
I don’t use reddit much but perhaps that will change in the future.  So here goes...  I’m 27, I live in Michigan and I’m gay.  I’ve spent most of my adulthood single and in the last few years it’s gotten quite lonely.  My dad passed away a few months ago and my sister and I are now in charge of everything (mom is physically and cognitively unable to be on her own).   I lost my job in May due to mostly office politics and I have been waiting on unemployment ever since. I’m past due on rent, multiple bills and I have no idea when the backpay will be paid out.  I currently work for a local restaurant delivering food but I’m quickly learning the job is incredibly dangerous as I have already had food stolen from me during a delivery and a co-worker was chased by some crazy guy.   I have been feeling very trapped, hopeless and lonely these past few days and my suicidal ideation has gotten pretty bad. I just want to feel secure financially and emotionally. I feel like I’m a good person and do the best I can to be a productive member of society but that still isn’t enough.   I feel useless, ashamed and alone in life and feel incredibly unloved and unworthy and I’m tired of feeling this way.  TLDR: Shit has blown up for me with covid, losing my job, death of my dad, finances, etc. and feeling trapped in working a job that’s unsafe. It has caused my anxiety and suicidal ideation to worsen.  If you read all this, thank you. It was good to get this all out.
I always feel like I’m not good enough for anything. I’m not good enough of a person, I’m not good enough at my job, I’m not good enough at what I studied, I’m not good enough of a friend, etc etc.    I really don’t think I deserve my grades or my job. I don’t think I deserve the friends I have. I don’t think I deserve my parents. I feel like I don’t deserve a place in society because I fail to see how it is better with me in it than without me.
overwhelmed. cried in the bathroom at work. there's no help and no relief. I'm tired of being a joke to everyone. I can't keep doing this.
I had my first job today and I screwed up pretty badly, I’m behind on school work, and I feel like an imposter in my own life and it feels like I’m clinging to an edge of a cliff with my fingernails as my only anchor.
I had a good day the other day. So why didn't it do anything to help me? I did all the things I wanted to, and I just couldn't enjoy it. I thought more about how nice it would be to get into a traffic accident on the way home. If even a perfect day can't change my mind, why bother?
I hate myself, I can't keep up with my coursework. I feel so stupid and lazy I don't know why i keep trying to get this degree. I just wish I didn't have to keep living like this.
I feel weird. I think I might have experienced mania the last few days. I haven't been sleeping much, and I didn't feel tired at all. I was not eating, and I didn't feel hungry. I felt so focused on I suppose these grandiose ideas of me becoming successful, like super successful. I'm thinking that if I start go back to university taking school seriously maybe I could really do something great.   Four years ago, I wanted to aim to get a doctorate in History or some other field I was interested. Since then, I've tried to kill myself many times, been hospitalized, and lost almost everyone in my life.   Ever since the US elections results, I actually feel ambitious. It feels crazy, but I don't know. I think after everything I have been through, maybe I have a lot to offer to the world. I've been thinking about volunteering. I'm not sure where or for what cause, but I think that would be a good start.   I actually kinda feel like I can do this.
There are 1.7K posts already so reality-based thinking says no one will ever see this.  So fucking down right now. Used to struggle with SI but that went away but today it keeps popping up. All I’ve done today is get dressed and walked the dog around the building twice. I have nobody. I want encouragement. A simple “you can do it” is all I need. But instead, my kids are too busy to bother with me. Don’t want to deal with my baggage. I have all day everyday and  still can’t do anything. Oh fuck, I can’t take this. I’ll just sleep.
Hiding in the bathroom from my parents cause it's the only room with a lock. Constant yelling. I'm falling apart from stress even without them.  Living in constant fear from my parents. Permanent attacks, no matter what I do. Cooking and baking for hours for them and afterwards getting yelled at.   Parents making suicidal thoughts worse and everyone is just like "aww, they just want to help, y'know?".  Whenever I drag myself to therapy I don't even expect anything anymore and therapy is just like "lol you're right. It was really stupid to expect anything from me, ever".  Therapist doesn't even answer any emails anymore.
I want to die I want to die I want to die  Things are not getting better no matter what I try
I am so lonely
I've finally reached that state where I don't give a damn about everything, which is an improvement.  I don't care about interview rejections anymore because I don't tie my self worth to my employment. I am fine with being average as long as I'm "normal". I don't want to bite off more than I could chew.   I recognize that I have a history of MDD so I need to manage my health more carefully. I am not an ambitious person to begin with so I really should not be trying to impress others all the time.
Never done this before...   I have a beautiful home and the best kids anyone could ever hope for.  I've been married for 20 years (albeit every last one of them was a struggle).  I have a relaxed job that I should love.  I have SO much to be appreciative of.    I know all of this but I'm sitting on my couch alone.  Sobbing my face off because even though I'm surrounded by blessings - I am utterly defeated and alone somehow.    I don't want......ANYTHING.  What the hell is wrong with me?
If I always come back to the pits of despair and suicidal thoughts, what’s the point of trying to be okay?
i fucking hate this pain that’s never ending. there is no solution, j don’t wanna wake up anymore
I never get to sleep and I'm stressed out of my mind. Even when I should be sleeping I lie awake and just can't relax. There's this constant gnawing sense of dread and worry in the back of my head.  I really wanted the new antidepressants to work but they're clearly not. I'm still a fucking wreck.

I thought I was okay with just being alone for the rest of my life. I thought I was starting to learn to accept it. That nobody will ever care about or love me and I should stop seeking it out, that I would just love myself and find peace and happiness in solitude. For a while I thought I could. But I feel so lonely I want to die. I'm stressed and sad and have no one to tell. Maybe it'll pass. Maybe I just have to keep thinking of everyone who abandoned me and let me down to remind myself it's not worth it in the end. I feel like I'm from another planet, I can't function in this world.
I’ve lost almost everyone important in my life.  Love is conditional, I have found.  People I thought who would be around forever have completely jumped ship.  The loneliness is engulfing.  I am disposable.
I need help. I can’t stop crying. I’m having panic attacks. I can’t sleep I can hardly eat. I’m having dark thoughts for the first time in my life. I don’t know what to do except that the walls feel like they are closing in and there’s no escape from this grief. I’m in a failing relationship. We had a miscarriage six months ago and I desperately want a child but he left and I haven’t been able to leave my bed since then
I want to give up. I have failed and nothing will change it.  Why keep going to be reminded of my failure. It isn't like I get any satisification by continuing to go. Rather all I will get is more stress.
All that anxiety from school. From college. Never, ever left. Do I have an appointment tomorrow. Is there something in my emails I didn't read in time. Do I have all my papers.   Worrying about this stuff isn't even my main diagnosis. Either way, therapy didn't change anything about it. A lot of it got worse. It's so much stress with every email, no matter how often you face it and what you try to think it doesn't get less.
I'm tired of having to lie to everyone, telling them I'm fine when they check in on me.
After a long dry streak, I had sex with a friend who is in an open relationship. While it was a good time, it *really* hammered home how much I miss an emotional connection with someone I can be intimate with. Can't really stay and cuddle with someone who has an SO to go home to.  My best friends are a couple and had their first foursome with another couple and while they were telling me about it, I hated how lonely I felt. Along with a mind-numbing job and having no motivation to do much else, things haven't been so hot.  I'm doing my best to keep my chin up but getting out of bed is difficult lately.  Hope you all find what you're looking for.
I just don't feel good.
My mind is splitting apart from my body. I lose more and more each day I'm further and further away from myself...  **Trigger Warning Suicide:** I don't think I can be here anymore. My jaw hurts and it feels like my mind is melting. There is a strange pain in my hands and my actions are scattered and clumsy. It's hard to stand up straight like there are chains in my body and chest. What is happening? How can I live? Maybe I'm permanently broken and need to end things...
Oh, the opportunities I wasted.
Nothing seems worth doing in life. I just want to lay in bed and fade away. Travelling, food, love, all of those things are alright but they’re not enough. Life isn’t enough, it isn’t worth the pain
I wish someone would kill me so I didn't have to do it myself
at least i showered today... still didn’t have the energy to brush my hair though... laid on the couch and was able to get up and put a frozen pizza in the oven around 4pm
I’m not doing well. Being alone for the holidays and having an unsupportive partner doesn’t help. Thank you for your time to any kind souls who read this.
Christmas night. It did not feel like Christmas at all. No tree, no presents, no company. When I went to buy some food on Christmas Eve I saw people with trollies full of food and snacks for Christmas lunch, and I felt my heart sink. I just carried on today like I normally did. Only difference was that I wasn’t as healthy. I haven’t had a proper meal since breakfast. Not even gluten free refined sugar free pancakes aren’t that nutritious. Maybe that’s why I feel so ‘meh’ today. I really don’t know why my family members didn’t ask me if I wanted to celebrate Christmas with them. Though we have restrictions they could still obey them and invite me to Christmas lunch or come over for a visit, to check I’m still alive. I feel abandoned by them. It’s my birthday after Boxing Day and if their silence still continues I don’t know how I’m going to deal with it.
Happy Holidays guys. Just going to be reading mostly.
Sorry if this triggers anyone but I can’t exactly tell people this. I tried to kill myself yesterday. It didn’t work out though, got too scared to go with it fully.  For all of my life I have never found people I’ve connected. I’ve been basically alone all my life. This quarantine has been hard as I’ve been reflective and realized that what I hoped for when I was young was never going to happen. I’ll never be loved. And that hurts a lot. I don’t really have an outside passion to convince myself to stay, but I’m not completely comfortable with dying yet. So I’ll just have to live through the pain
I'm looking for reasons to live and the list is honestly growing shorter ever single day. How the fuck do people do this? My friends and family are all that is keeping me alive right now.
I'm not sure if anyone else is going through this but I feel like this is something we don't talk about often. I'm a senior applying to colleges and my entire life has revolved around getting into a good college, and after multiple rejections and my mid-year grades being worse than any grades I've ever gotten, I genuinely feel so beaten up. I'm so guilty for making my parents pay for the 30+ colleges I've applied to, making them pay for college help when I can't seem to get in anywhere. I feel so bad for letting them down because at this rate I'm praying to get into a safety. I feel like everything I've cared about and done throughout high-school is useless and I have no motivation to try helping myself or re-gaining confidence. My parents have honestly given me everything and I can't even pass a class or get into college when that's all they've wanted from me. I can't even be happy. I've isolated myself from all my friend groups because I feel like I don't deserve to be happy,   I don't deserve to have fun. I hate myself. I hate myself so much. I don't know how to live with the guilt of being this useless.
I'm always needing a break from everything. I'm tired. And I'm tired of being tired.
I find myself envying people that have taken their lives recently. I envy the courage they had to be able to step into the next life without any idea what it holds. I often times want to move on myself, but I'm afraid of surviving. Im afraid of what people will think of me if I attempt and fail a suicide. Will they think I just did it for attention? Or will they finally realize I need help and reach out? Other times I'm scared to do it because what if it is true that life gets better and I miss out in all of it? I still have hope, it's just been diminishing over time and the struggles I'm gracing now sometimes don't feel worth it. What if nowhere every changes and I feel like this until I'm old and I die with this sadness? Lately my urge to end it has been increasing and the only thing that really stops me is the judgement I might get if I'm not successful at killing myself.
increasingly clear that my life is just a pendulum between anxiety and depression. when I have any kind of pressure on me at all (ie my work) I am barely able to cope and spend entire days totally frozen, unable to do anything. when I take time off or actually have a weekend to myself, my inability to feel joy or create a purpose for myself leaves me depressed. one constant: regardless of which of the two is taking center stage, I want to die so very badly.  a new experience: for the first time in quite a while, I've had to be responsible for someone else in a direct, immediate way--my semi-elderly mom, who I live with, is sick in a bad way. does this inspire me to get past my own problems and help her? does this make it easier to avoid the spiral of doom in my head? nope, instead my anxiety has ratcheted up and is 10 times worse. I'm totally unable to do my job because of the stress. I took a day off because of that, but naturally I had piled up work I still had to get done. And I was actually finally making a bit of progress, because my mom seemed to be doing better. and then four hours in my mom mentioned that it seems to be getting worse and boom, instant panic attack, productivity tone, etc etc. Doesn't help that she's high risk for covid so appointments are going to be extremely worrisome.   Anyways, real fun to discover I can't manage to take on even the most basic, minor life stresses. Why am I such a useless human being? Why can't I just want to fade out of existence, allowing all my problems to melt me into a little pool of nothing? I don't kill myself for personal philosophical reasons, or that's what I tell myself, but in reality I think if I was just a tad bit more disconnected from my family or if my mother were to pass away, I might go ahead and do it.  Or, more realistically, I'd just quit my job to avoid all the anxiety, and then live off savings while being a slacker until I couldn't do it anymore. Honestly, even now, I want to quit the stupid job even though I know it'd be terrible for me to do so. If only I could just be a shitty employee who didn't care, instead of being a shitty employee who desperately wants to do good and so is constantly panicking about work. Don't tell me I should look for another job. For one, that process is very difficult for me to pursue (and only ratchets up my anxiety). But for two, this job is actually great... It just that I'm a fuckup and anxious all the time so I can't do it right.   I know I need to seek out help. I've known it for literally years. I even successfully did it, 4 years ago, but before long it seemed the help stopped helping and now I'm so much worse that even the basic steps required to get help are so far beyond my capability. And on top of it, I know that even the slightest setbacks will throw me back all the way to 0. I don't have the motivation to get better. I'm just coasting along, slowly getting worse every day, hoping God takes things out of my hands, one way or another.
I finally told someone how bad it’s gotten and that I’ve debated suicide.
I feel so weak and tired all the time
Holy fk. Just want to scream into an abyss and leave this world. Currently feel super lonely and useless af. Really want to reach out to people. But i always feel so negative around those friends that reaching out to them makes me feel like I m bothering them (yay social anxiety). And then at work, I have to pretend to be happy and that life is really good when in reality it's just a complete mess. Like wtf am I suppose to do?  -end rant
It feels like everyone talks at me, but no one really talks to/with me
[deleted]
I feel so empty and alone but at the same time I'm overwhelmed. I am tired
I’m not doing great.
If things couldn’t go worse in my life, today at around 5 pm I started having vertigo. Now it’s almost 3 am and I still feel awful, both mentally and physically. I’ll have to go to the doctor, which is always a very unpleasant experience for me. Again, I could use a hug so much in this moment. I’m so tired.
no idea what the heck to do with my life. i was depressed before covid. then covid hit and i actually enjoyed staying home and hermitting. now i'm working full time from home and the wildfires make it so i can't go outside for a walk. my violent roommate is moving out by the end of september, hopefully. but until then i am trapped in my room and withering away.
I'm so pathetic. I just want to be told that I'm not, but I don't have anyone to honestly say that to me, because I am. So instead I daydream about somebody, literally anybody saying these things to me because I need to hear them and if I can't hear them from a real person at the very least I need it from a fake one. The heart of all my daydreams is always just that somebody is telling me that I'm not worthless, in some way or another. Somebody wanting me around, or close to them. I wish someone would, but nobody does. So pathetic.
why do i have to live.
I just wanted to share a victory that today I was laying on my couch sleeping feeling depressed and I started actively asking for help. From god, from friends. I feel motivated today to get help from others with my depression and stop isolating. That’s all. And I sought out this forum for the first time. Love you all hope you have a good day.
Though I don't feel the intense degree of dread I had with my last job, I still feel depressed with my new one. Maybe it's the constant yo-yoing between day and night shifts. Emphasis on night shifts, in shitty shady areas with shitty shady people  I don't think I'll ever heal regarding my feelings towards people in general; they now repulse me for the most part. Sucks considering that I have very little friends, and I'm feeling that they don't want to be bothered with me anymore. Oh well :(  EDIT: Caved and asked my friend if he still wanted to be friends. He told me he had no reason not to be, but then he says our conversations tend to steer into negative topics, or just plain awkward.  I'm aware of the negativity and I'm trying so hard, but the awkward part hurts so much. I just want to stab my heart into little itty bitty pieces, and hurt myself (more) emotionally, since I'm too cowardly to do actual self harm 🙃
Well, I guess I'm back here again after a passable run at life.  I...shit, I guess I don't even want to write. Or can't. Does it make much of a difference? Probably. Whatever. Idk. Let it stop or kill me. Please.  Thanks for being here
Why the f do I spend time thinking about something that happened 19 years ago?
[deleted]
I just don’t want to exist anymore. I don’t want to keep trying.
Wish I had the courage to kill myself without thinking of my family. I can't take this anymore
People always complain that nobody cares about their depression. How about having friends who are a bit *too* concerned about your depression?  I have a friend like this. I am not particularly close to her but she has been oddly enthusiastic in checking up with me time to time since finding out that I have depression, like I have an incurable terminal disease. Which makes me feel like I'm a pitiful being and that sucks.  We went thru the toxic positivity stage, where I felt angry because she kept telling me to travel and meditate. Istg if she ever tries to promote her mlm health products to me I will ghost her forever.  Edit: Maybe I am a very skeptical and negative person but sometimes I feel like she talks to me to make herself feel better about her life.
Not sure why but today is exceedingly hard. Can’t close my eyes to attempt sleep without crying so now I’m in an endless loop of cry myself to sleep or waste time feeling depressed/numb while playing on my phone until I either stay up all night or pass out from exhaustion
Has anyone been in a place of hoping your friends/family will ask if you’re ok... then when you do you get defensive and say nothing is wrong?
wish I had someone who gave a fuck about my existence
I feel so anxious rn. Idk what to do, feels like I can't do anything. I feel trapped. I feel like crying.
Sometimes I hate sleeping because when I wake up I feel so shitty.
Living with depression is constantly thinking of the end, feeling guilty that you have these thoughts, feeling no one around you to listen, and forever living in your fucking head. I’m tired of being drained and having to lie about myself. I’m tired of feeling unhappy. This is what existence is? I wish I wasn’t born. Started going to therapy but I don’t know if that can help me. I’m starting to feel like this is just who I am. I’m gonna break up with my girlfriend because I’m a burden and I don’t want to cause damage with her. And she says she gets depression but insists on trying to figure out why I keep calling out of work, or why I’m sleeping so much. I’m starting to feel my soul drift into nothing. I’ve had this flaw since I was a kid. But now it just gets worse as I age. I’m just so tired of hating life.
Going to residential treatment soon. No friends or family to help. Just wish I had someone to drop me off on the day I give away my personal freedom.
I'm shutting everyone down...I hate this feeling. I hate myself
I had not been comparing myself to others for a long time but today I saw a Story posted by a friend... He is now working as a manager and I couldn't help but to feel like a complete failure.   I'm still figuring out my career path. Currently unemployed because my previous job severely impacted my mental health. Some of my peers have been earning a lot abroad (I live in a third world country). It really makes me question my own ability. If I were invited to any gathering, I would totally turn down the invitation.
I've been feeling pretty crappy these days. I'm constantly wishing I never existed and trying to sleep the pain away. Like many of you have said before, I wish  I could be normal again. I wish I could socialize like I used to and be cheerful and happy to face the next day, but each day just seems more and more painful. I'm really trying to find things to do to make me feel better but all I really feel like doing is nothing.
I just want a hug. I'm so damn tired of everything.
Turtle nuts
It doesn't matter how well I'm doing, I always slump back into this pit of feeling sorry for myself...
Everyday, I need to give myself a reason to stay alive, to continue the struggle inspite of no reward.
I want to quit. There, I said it. Of course I won't, I would probably not find another job, or at least not a better one. But I'm so tired of so many aspects of it. Most importantly how it monopolizes my life. There's just not enough left for it to feel like *my* life.
Ahhh job search is so unrewarding. No feedback at all. Not even a "we have received your application". I sometimes wonder if the online platforms are working correctly. I hate HR, I hate everyone who's involved in the stupid hiring process
Me: _tries to eat healthy, exercise, have a healthy sleep routine to fix sleep cycles_  Also me: _wakes up two hours early and can't sleep again because the window is open and birds are singing outdoors_  Yeah, that's enough.
I wanna die. I can’t sleep, I haven’t slept well in over a month. I hate my job, I can’t go to school because of covid. I don’t know what to do anymore.
Haven’t eaten for a few days. Can’t sleep. I have mental breakdowns on a daily and anxiety attacks. I recently moved and I’m in a bad financial state. My new job sucks and all my money goes to bills. Found out my boyfriend was lying to me about talking to other girls a few weeks ago. All trust is gone but he’s trying to be supportive and prove that he only wants me so I stayed with him. Took a huge hit to my self esteem (if it wasn’t bad enough already). I feel like I can’t live with myself anymore. Living like this is driving me mad. I hate myself, I hate everything. All I want to do is lay in bed and stare at my blank wall. Had a bad childhood and was abused quite often. Had severe depression in my teens tried to commit suicide twice and thought it would be over. But here it is again.
i'm 2 years clean today and my scars have been fading. feeling pretty good about that =)
If I can go back, way back before this all started have a conversation with that young girl who was of yet this broken. I would speak with her and show her how to love and care for herself the way she would one day care for others. I would remind her how beautiful she is for when she looked up in the mirror to see that beauty that stood in front of her. She would know that every nasty words her family have ever spat at her was not who she was. And every punches her mother threw at her was never her fault. I would be her medic and bandage those opened wounds her mother left on her. I would remind her that she deserved the moon for the heart that she carries within her chest to never settle herself for anything less in this world. I would take her and hug her tightly until she understood that she would never be alone when the darkness came to visit her. I would be her friend and love her how she would one love others. Perhaps the outcome would be different for her. Perhaps a peace in this world would be reserved just for her. Perhaps she would want to continue living.
Seriously though, what's the bloody point.
Everyday I wake feeling nothing but dread and anxiety.  I spend all day looking forward to when the day is over. I have nothing to look forward I’m just constantly miserable.
I'm falling apart. I have several work projects that are incomplete and deadlines are slowly approaching. My future career (medicine) is dependent on my work ethic and production right now, and I am dropping the ball hard. I am working an 80 hour a week unpaid internship, and have to work UberEats on the side just to have some sort of income coming in and not look like a complete embarrassment to my family. I'm falling deeper and deeper into debt and I'm losing my willpower to keep going on. It's like I know what needs to be done, but I can't muster up the energy to do it. I feel useless, and like a failure.
Every time I think I've pinned down something definite to say about my feelings it fades into my brain static before I can articulate it.  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  I'm sad and incredibly lonely and I wish someone would genuinely care. There's a start. Someone hugged me once in high school because they thought I looked sad and I think about that a lot.
Everyday feels the same to me. It feels like an endless loop. Life is so mundane and I have nothing to look forward to.
I made a video for a class and my ta complimented it and said it gave off the feeling of tension in a home that isnt a home and reminded her of her trauma at her own home lmao. i just find it funny that my idea was so clear and im actually happy rn lolol
I hate it so much when people share their success with me. I know I'm a piece of garbage and I need no harassment.
Whenever I feel myself sinking into a depressive hole again I go play the fuck out of the piano until my fingers cramp up and I physically can't move my wrists anymore. I think, in a weird way, the pain helps makes me feel better.   In nicer news, after weeks of trying and failing, I can finally play *Una Mattina* by Ludovico Einaudi without any mistakes... I cried after finishing it, but still unsure whether those were sad emotional tears or happy tears of achievement or perhaps a mix of both
I've never been diagnosed with depression, but that's because I've always been too scared to reach out to anyone. During quarantine, things got really bad with my parents, and I stopped feeling happiness. It's been that way since April. It got bad enough that I reached out to one of my teachers from last year when I got back in school. I was not only frustrated with my parents for sending me back into school during Covid, but I was also feeling emotionally abused, especially from body shaming and complete invalidation of all feelings I expressed.   So I reached out to my teacher, and he was super supportive. I didn't tell him my main concerns about my parents because I was still too scared to do that, but I did express my concerns about politics and Covid-19. I was just really frustrated with everything going on, and that I had absolutely no control over what was happening in my own life. My teacher responded and offered some kind words, also offering to help me take my concerns to the school board (this is legally allowed btw).  Then this asshole kid who has bullied me for a while decided to report me for having suicidal thoughts—not true at the time. In fact, after I had talked to my teacher, I had felt genuinely happy for those couple of days. Like a weight had been lifted off of my shoulder. When the report came, I was called down to the principal's office and they read what I had sent my teacher right in front of me. Seeing as this was the most I had ever shared with anyone, and this random person was just *reading* it, I started crying. I couldn't get it together at all, and I was like that for the rest of the day.   Because of that Remind text and the fact that my teacher responded after school hours, they conducted an investigation. My teacher was suspended while this was going on, and I was convinced that he was going to get fired. Nothing "inappropriate" was found, and nothing was against the rules, but I was no longer allowed to reach out to this teacher. At all. Ever. He was the only adult I trusted to tell anything, and I lost that ability as soon as I had taken advantage of it.   That was at the beginning of September, the week of my birthday. It has been about a month since then, and I have felt suicidal ever since. Absolutely worthless. My counselor doesn't listen to what I'm concerned about and acts like I'm a lesser form of life just because I'm younger than he is. I don't trust him at all. And I don't trust my parents enough to tell them either. The only person I would trust enough to tell about this is my best friend, let's call her M.   I know that if I told M about what was going on, she would take me to the school social worker or someone similar (we both hate my counselor), but I don't want them to know about it. I don't trust them. I also know that if I told them about it, they would be required to let my parents know due to school policy, and I really, really don't want that to happen. Also, if it were to happen now, my parents would likely have to sit in on the conversation in the first place because I got moved to online learning, and they would have to talk to me through one of my parents' phones. I don't know what to do. I feel trapped and suicidal. I feel absolutely worthless and I don't want to live anymore. The only person I trusted enough to talk to as an outlet has been taken away from me. I am not allowed to contact him, even though they found that he did nothing wrong. My work ethic is gone, and as an A student, I am letting my grades slip, which is making me feel absolutely useless all over again.  I just want to die. The only reason I haven't tried anything yet is because I'm afraid that I won't apply lethal force, and I'll just turn myself into essentially a vegetable for the rest of my life. I want to die. I don't know what do to. My only outlet is gone, and things are only getting worse.   So I guess that means I'm doing pretty shitty.
Saturday I drove the city early in the morning. Didn't even know what to do, just wanted to get away from home. Had so severe anxiety, didn't want to talk with parents again. Even just postponing it was a relief.   Spent two hours sleeping in the car. Slept like a stone, really needing that. Small "safe space" where I don't have to listen for sounds and nobody disturbs me.  Not much else to do in the city cause it was also a holiday and most stuff was closed. At least found a museum as a way to spend time. When I came back in the evening parents thought I'd done something productive which is at least something.
Today sucks. I want to really really cut. I have never. I don't know why I want to.    I just want to. I feel unheard and bottled up.
i want affection, but at the same time i can't stand people or social interaction. I get so lonely at times its really getting to me lately, drawing / playing games / watching videos isn't distracting me from the stress as much as it did before
I just got diagnosed with bipolar 2.
I feel sad for absolutely no reason. I don’t know why. I have the essentials, I have access to food, safety, and housing. I know that someone else would love my life. But I don’t. I wish I was gone. Being a high achiever almost all my life, people expect a lot from me. Back then I knew I was empty but I wanted to live long enough to become successful in any career path I picked. Now I just don’t even care enough to see myself prosper. I wish I was dead. Has anyone ever felt this way before? Where you used to care but now you don’t? Does anyone have any advice?
work is killing me with stress

Keep thinking "What might have been" and I get wistful.
I wanna be good at something. I wanna go back to school. I wanna be an artist. And make that other kind of art too. I wanna start a business. I wanna get married. I wanna have kids. I wanna travel and be free. I want lots of money and a fancy lifestyle. I wanna live like a hippy in a commune. I wanna be smarter, prettier, more interesting. I wanna be organized. I wanna be admired. I wanna be alone.    I don't know what I want or how to decide. I have lofty, fleeting goals and the attention span of a goldfish. I have lots of reasons to say no to everything, but I want to say yes.   I don't use my time wisely, I don't have anything anyone wants because of it. I am the maker and destroyer of all my dreams.
I feel like crying but I can't

Last night I drank way to much. Broke down. Friends are sick of hearing my difficulty, starting to distance and make our chat group unwelcoming slowly over time.   I lost my dream job a little over two years ago. Working bullshit gigs and dead end stuff. Constantly fucking up.   But today I took a shower and made a frozen pizza. So I guess the little things. I hope all of you are staying healthy.
So today I felt myself hit bottom...I feel useless, and pathetic, nothing I do is good enough.  I try to get help , I went to the doctor their answer new meds....they set me up with a psychiatrist but they can’t get me in til next month.  Went to a walk in psych eval clinic they won’t see me because of covid!!!  I hit roadblocks even when I try to get help it’s like I’m not supposed to feel good.  What else is there to do???  I have no joy, the fake smile is getting old.  Why am I like this?  I just want to disappear
Another check-in comment. I have been doing okay, no more breakdowns since taking my meds but little incidents in life still trigger slight panic attacks. I am talking minor incidents, like I mistakenly sold a slightly defective preloved item online (which is resolved). Going through the job interview arrangements. The panic attacks come, and I try not to fall into a depressed mood.  I went for my doctor's appointment not long ago. She said she won't reduce my dosage although I am doing way better. She is concerned that my symptoms will worsen after I get into a stressful environment (such as a new job). Her advice is to take the pills and we will continue observing my development.  Edit: My recent battle is to beat my internet addiction. I don't use social media sites that much but YouTube and Reddit take up a lot of my time. I also feel that I become more emotional/angry when I surf too much. So far I haven't been very successful in my attempts but I will try again.
I hate how I constantly have to push myself to keep going, and my efforts are not being rewarded. I have no idea what I have to do to improve and it's testing my resiliency.  I'm a third year mature university student who spent the first two years struggling to keep a part/full time job and doing school. It was really hard and my grades suffered but I knew that was the cost of supporting oneself and financing their studies all on their own. When COVID hit I was laid off and took that as a blessing, because now I can finally focus on my studies 100% without the stress of working and commuting. Everything should have been perfect. With loans, EI and emergency savings I have enough to support myself to complete 4/5 semesters I have left, I live alone so a nice distraction-free environment to study, and I no longer worked at a job that killed my soul so I could mentally and emotionally invest myself in my studies and hobbies.  But of course I just can't have nice things can I? Despite all this free time and no other commitments I am still struggling in my courses and the worst part is I don't really know why. I organise and structure my days with study blocks, and give myself breaks so I don't fatigue myself. For all of September I made sure to do my morning workouts and stretches to compensate for me sitting down all the time. I make sure to pay attention in the lecture videos, go over slides, do to exercises...but for some reason it isn't enough.  The first round of evaluations just finished and I got my ass handed to me. At least in the past I could blame my job for my poor grades but now I have no excuse. The absolute kicker that prompted me to write this post, was a test that got returned where I got a whomping 32%. Now if I hadn't studied, and did everything last minute I would totally own up to deserving this grade. But honestly I'm at a loss...this is a course where I keep up with the lecture videos, re-watch sections I have difficulty with, do exercises, make sure I understand all key definitions, but none of my work has paid off.  I have no fucking clue what to do now because clearly what I am doing is not working. But now what? I have to keep going because the next round of evaluations are coming up, but it is so demotivating to even try when there is no correlation between the work you put in and the grades you get. I *want* to continue, keep pushing myself, learn from my mistakes and finally just be done with all of this. But it just seems like putting any amount of effort into anything does not reward me in any way.
Had a friend fly down to visit this past weekend. They left yesterday. While they were here I was concerned about them because they felt off. Texted to see if they were okay and apparently I said something over the weekend that really upset them. My anxiety is very high because they wont tell me what is up until they sort their own thoughts out. I cant help but feel this is just inevitable with anyone who gets close to me. My urge to abandon the relationship is strong. They didn't say anything while they were here so I must have screwed up really bad :( Maybe it is better for my mental health to not have friends for awhile
I don't particularly enjoy feeling incredible malice for talented people who have friends but what else can I do when I have neither and can have nothing
I remember posting here consistently after my breakup about 7 months ago. Since then I’ve been working relentlessly on self love.  For the longest time I didn’t know if what I’ve been doing this whole time “worked”. I saw no obvious results. Today, I had 3 friends in separate contexts tell how much they love me, appreciate the positivity I put out, and how I’m a great person to talk to.  I cried because it made me realize that all the time I spent talking myself through my feelings, reassuring myself, finding things to like about myself, and being patient with myself, no matter how extremely awkward it felt at times, have gotten me here. It just felt really good.
Last night I got depressed, and was sinking into some sad thoughts about myself and my life. But then I realized that there was something specific I was sad about: someone had sent me an email criticizing a poem I sent them, telling me I should rewrite it completely, when I hadn't asked for any criticism (the purpose of our talking was to share OCD-related experiences and coping strategies). So I sent back an email saying how I felt, and then I felt less depressed. I'm proud that I stuck up for myself.
My son is so depressed.   I love him so much but I can't seem to help him.   He won't take ssri meds.   I really think they could help.  He can't sleep or anything.   Just doesn't want to care about anything either.   Maybe someone here has advice?  Thanks for listening
Doing a graduate program now, and it’s frustrating how everyone else seems to be doing well and on top of things and I just wasted my entire day hating myself.  I’m not that intelligent, and this program is gonna prove it.
I've cried so much today that I have a migraine and I haven't felt this suicidal in years
It’s a struggle everyday but I wake up and try to move forward.
Finally signed up for therapy.

Restrictions keep getting extended over and over again. I am sick of staying home all the fucking time! It's hard enough having NO friends offline or in real life, the ONLY person I had as a friend online decides to ditch me for others. I have no distractions or hobbies or anything to  ease the pain (they never work anyway! I still END UP ALONE regardless).  I will just end my life or have a mental breakdown, one of the two. Nothing else I can fucking do.
The thought of dying is so appealing. How can I possibly live like this for the rest of my life. One day it will be too much.
I want to fucking scream. I’m such an idiot. Such a fucking idiot. God damn just let me fucking die.
Where did everything go wrong?
Spent the whole afternoon baking cakes for dad's birthday tomorrow. When I finally came back to my room I notice someone opened the window hours ago and left it that way. With 50 degree F outside and my room being difficult to heat as it is.   Oh, and heating was still on the entire time so I guess we just heat for outside.   All this tiny, minuscule crap is bothering me way more than it should be. You can adress this a hundred times and it means nothing. For me it's like a really obvious demonstration of "lol we don't care about any of your needs, at all. If you don't want your stuff ruined by us you should've protected it better, it's your own fault". I've got so many fucking examples for that. Therapist is like "hey why don't you allow your parents to hElP you in life, they really want to" and I have to deal with all this crap and somehow just swallow it all up every time. Fuck this shit.  Edit: selfharmed again. Because of this meaningless crap. Other people have actual problems in life and I just have an endless battle with parents over the smallest things. It's just so pathetic.
I feel so broken. Everyone should just get away from me. I should die. I'm sorry for existing
I’m still alive. I’ve been in a depressive episode since mid June. I’m starting to show some emotion again. I’ve been an empty husk with no real purpose or desire for life. I got a psychiatrist this year and continue to take my medication daily. I have a therapist I talk to once a week and I have a full time job. How I’ve managed to pull myself together daily is a miracle. The sheer strength of getting up out of bed and dressing myself has me in awe. I think about dying daily but no real plan. I’ve lost all passion for my hobbies and don’t shower as often anymore. I guess I still feel like a robot, just going through the daily motions. I envy normal people so much. There has to be a light at the end of this darkness right? That tiny bit of hope must be what keeps me going.
I wrote other posts here since today is bad, but I didn’t get even one upvote or comment. I realized I messed up big-time with one of my courses and just need a hug.
Please, please, somebody show me love and tenderness. I want a mother. I know I'm old enough to be a mother, but I'd do anything for someone to show me that care. I don't think I did anything wrong by being born. I didn't choose to be this burden. Please someone just hold me for a while and tell me what's in my head isn't going to destroy me inside out.
feeling so low
I needed one thing to go right. just one thing. but no such luck. I'm doing everything I can and it's not enough.
I had my first therapy session last week. It made me realize how much trauma I need to work through. I really liked my therapist though, which is a step in the right direction. Looking forward to my next appointment tomorrow.
I way too fucking sensitive. And I hate it. Every little slight or social embarrassment puts me to the edge. I feel like I've never grown up and that I never could even if I try.
i just noticed that i'm back to escaping from reality, i delay all my assignments, workouts, and doesn't even worry about it.  and i'm just stuck on how to reach out
lonely. that's all.
I'm tired of being a failure. I try not to think about it too much, but it is always there at the back of my mind. I want to run away, disappear and never want to be seen again. Sucks.
I feel like giving up on treatment. How many pills do I have to try? Nothing helps and I’m beyond sad.
I just want the pain to stop, I just want to feel peace again.
I feel internally homeless. I haven't felt at home anywhere since 2017. I used to feel completely relaxed when I still lived with my parents and had the house to myself. I had no idea that feeling would be taken away from me. My neighbours sons started bullying the sh\*t out of me everyday, so I moved out and got my own place. My neighbours do the same thing, they are a young couple and say horrible things, walk by the window and scream FU at me and call me gay slurs.
I feel myself going into my hole again. I’m sleeping more again. I’m getting headaches. I hate feeling like this.
Completely lost my sex drive *again*... I told my bf about it today. So far he's taking it with humor but I'm sure it's only a matter of time until he gets annoyed by it... Makes me feel useless and like I'm a bad girlfriend.
Trying out online therapy. First time seeking help in about 5 years or so. Last time it wasn't particularly helpful (irl therapy) so I'm cautious about this virtual therapy thing. But it's covered by my province for 12-weeks and I'm not going to stare a gift horse in the mouth.
I'm so fucking miserable. Lonely. I feel abandoned and betrayed. Let down. I'm bitter and resentful as fuck. I regret the stupid fucking choices I made, thinking things would be different. And now I fantasize about either dying or running away somehow. But it's too late. There's no escape.
I’m worried I’m faking it. Just being lazy. I’m in college, supposed to be in class right now but I just feel glued to my bed and the only thing that doesn’t make me want to throw up with anxiety is looking at a certain spot on the wall and shaking my foot. But I haven’t had any big trauma or sad backstory. My family is amazing. I’m just being lazy I feel like the boy who cried wolf and everyone around me is sick and tired of me pretending to be depressed to get out of things
[deleted]
Ah, the feeling of success when you've accomplished something just really easily washes away when you realize you have no one in your life that you could really share it with. Welp. I guess I'm stuck talking to old polaroids and photos then again.  Ugh. Another day, another pain.
Thanks for offering this. I just need to get something off my chest but I don't want to post.   My mother in law took her life about 2 weeks ago. I'm so fucking sad right now. And angry. And lost. And overwhelmed. I am so fucking overwhelmed.   My brother took his life 5 years ago so that brings up a lot. And my dad tried a year ago but failed and I got him into the hospital. I'm just tired of the people I love wanting to die.   I am so mad at mom. We worked so hard to get her the help she needed. We worked so fucking hard. I stayed on the phone with her for hours talking her through shit. She didn't fucking call me. She knew I would've been there why didn't she fucking call me. She texted her boyfriend, my husband and my sister in law good bye not me. I know that's selfish but I was fucking there. I was the one one the phone with her. Not my husband. I was the one who knew how to get her head straight and not feel down. My husband didn't even fucking know how to talk to her. I didn't get a good bye. I didn't get an I love you. I didn't get an I'm proud of you. Who's proud of me? Who loves me?   My mom??? Who keeps making everything about herself and her late son? I don't want to talk about my brother!!! I want to talk about mom. I want to talk to mom. I want her to say I'm proud of you and I love you and stay strong.   I want to be comforted! I want to be held. I want my tears wiped away. No one is doing that for me! I am so fucking alone and I want to talk to mom.   We could've helped you mom. I could've helped you. We could've gotten you actual rehab. You could've gotten the divorce and tied the knot with Gary and left the state. You could've had a good life with him. You could've seen your future grand babies. You fucking ended it before I could even help you.   Why didn't you call me? Why did you leave me with this pain?
Ive been In a really dark depression. Horrible sleep, but sleeping all day, in bed all day, no energy, crying, avoiding every one, I’ve pushed most people out of my life, just quit another job I just couldn’t keep up with any more, I’m on medication that enhances this depression so I’ve been feeling helpless, my anxiety is not great, etc. So, for sure, I thought I’d end Thanksgiving drunk and sad due to already being depressed and also alone. I’ve been trying to cut down on drinking, so, holiday or not, I knew it would be bad if I started to drink. I held off for most of the day and kept justifying why it would be ok if I got drunk. “It’s a holiday and you’re alone, just celebrate, be *happy*”  I tend to think I’m strong and can handle spending holidays alone, but Ive been so down , and on top of that, missing some people in my life.   I started crying towards the end of the day.   A friend sent a simple message wishing me a happy thanksgiving, and that... motivated me to not drink. That simple gesture. Idk. I poured some whiskey in a glass, took a sip, but didn’t finish it. Decided I didn’t want to get drunk. That I didn’t need it. That gave me so much strength. More than that person will ever know. I didn’t drink any more of it.  I think maybe I can survive this. I’m going to keep trying.
I made it a full day without having any alcohol. Trying to teach myself moderation. I’m struggling a bit, to be honest. I’m not really sure of my purpose in life.
I'm one paycheck away from being homeless. Feels great man.
My stomach hurts from loneliness. Why am I so alone? I’m considered attractive and likeable, I guess, but no one wants me. Other people are surrounded by friends.   I don’t have a single person to talk to day to day. When I have something to say there is no one there. I think that suicide is a good option but people that don’t even care tell me to stay..  I’m completely alone and I have been since I was young. I’m nice to everyone but the world doesn’t want me. What am I doing wrong?
I hate having to get up the morning. Especially now when there is no point.
I got rejected from a job position again. I feel like I'm a failure and I disappoint my parents even though they never said so. I'm just a fucking piece of shit that can't even get a job and live by itself. I just don't know what to do, I wake up and feel like the most useless person in this planet and I've started to have suicidal thoughts more often.  I don't know what to do with my life anymore but if it could end now, I would gladly accept it. I do not deserve what I've been given.
Job hunting is so fucking soul crushing. It sucks to know that I will never in my life be able to work a job that is actually interesting or helping anyone because I'm too fucking dumb to finish school.
I was watching a TikTok of a guy who just goes for walks with his dog in the woods for people to enjoy, and it made me realize... I can’t remember the last time anyone did anything intentionally to make me feel better, or to be nice to me. It caught me by surprise so badly that I have tears leaking, realizing no one cares enough to go out of their way for me. I see them do it for each other all the time... just... not for me.  But I can’t tell anyone, because I don’t want to guilt anyone into pretending to care. I’m so tired of feeling so alone. I’m not mad. I just wished I mattered.
I feel so empty and numb inside that I can't remember the last time I had a genuine moment of happiness. nothing I do brings me joy. my p***y is as dry as the sahara desert and I have so low an appetite I've lost 15lb in a month. I feel hollow. like I'm trapped in the space between worlds. I don't even exist right now

Hey everyone,   I’m 100% sure I’m depressed and have been for years (although it’s been getting worse this year even before Covid and certainly worse during it) but I’ve never sought a diagnosis or treatment. Any advice or experience to share about how one should approach first time treatment and what to expect?  I really don’t want to share my depression with my family which is why I never sought treatment before, but now with online treatment and the fact I live away from home I feel like I need to finally take this step.   P.S. if anyone enjoys reading I recently read the newest book of my favorite series The Stormlight Archives and its an awesome series with a main character who has depression that I highly recommend for anyone interested (sorry I just really like these books and needed to recommend.
I am so tired. Every second of every day I just wanna not exist. I am on Prazosin, Wellbutrin and Adderall and I still have no energy. My doctor upped my Wellbutrin and my depression is still kicking it's ass.      I am 28 fucking years old and I've wanted to be done with it all since I was 12. It's not getting better. I go to therapy with an actual shrink twice a week and see a psych once a month.      I don't care if I am happy or not. I just wanna not wanna die anymore. I have Severe Depression, G.A.D, C-PTSD and ADD. It all just seems like too much to fight against.
I’m going to hospital tomorrow. I want to get better.
I'm sick of being depressed. Whether or not my problems are real or worth worrying about, I'm super fucking sick of doing the same cycle of being really sad, doing and saying embarrassing things because I'm not in a healthy state of mind, then coming out of it like "from now on things are gonna be different" only for it all to happen again.  I JUST WANT A NORMAL HEALTHY BRAIN AAAAAAAAAAA
I just found this sub tonight. I am so sorry for everyone. I have my own issues as well an I thank you all just for being here, just having a sense of community eases me a bit but I hate my self for find comfort in you alls discomfort. I know as I write this I can't solve your problems or offer any valuable advice. But I can tell you that I hope you all make it to see another day. Or at least more than I do. I want to Thank you ALL earnestly an honestly.
I feel that my mother uses my kindness to manipulate me and control me.  I only have 1 friend. Today is my birthday, I am depressed and I feel so alone. I wish I was never born.
Crying every night. So tired of everything. This never ends.
Hard truths that my idiot self learned, but can't accept:  -People are cruel and disgusting by nature  -Kindness can get you _somewhere_ sometimes, but in the end evil always wins  -Life isn't fair  -Dreams aren't meant to come true for some people  -Some people aren't meant to have friends  -Life isn't fair  -Sometimes if a girl gets sexually harrassed, it _is_ her fault  -Did I mention life isn't fair  I wanted to cry myself to sleep, but I don't have the energy for that either. I'll just pass out and pretend I'm dead, though I'll probably end up dreaming about having the mental breakdowns I repress irl lol
Being my parents servant, cooking for them in the hope they'll leave me alone. But it never works.   And it gets worse when they invite relatives to dinner who are the worst. My brother's father-in-law is a homeopathic, anti-vax, snake oil selling "doctor" who can't stop spreading his bs during dinner. And the rest of my family are followers of his cult, "oh yeah, you're so right, everyone's lying but you". You can't imagine the conversations at this table about covid alone. It's so disgusting.   And those are the people I'm cooking for. I just feel extra bad if I'm doing it for people who in my eyes "don't deserve it".  Ofc this is just my fault in the end cause I'm too dysfunctional to simply move out. Same train of thoughts for years.

I'm so nervous to start working again tomorrow. My boss and co-workers are very understanding but it's so hard to keep a smile on my face all the time. I'm a teacher and I have to stay positive for my students. I'm forever torn between "my students deserve the best so I need to be happy" and "my students deserve much better than what I can give". I skipped  socialising and exercising with my friends today because I just wanted to be alone, but in hindsight I should've just gone to distract myself. I might go to the shopping centre soon just to walk around and be around other people.
I'm gonna sound like a total asshole, but if I'm honest, I'm jealous of all the people getting weeks and weeks of additional paid time off due to the lockdowns. My brother is a kindergartener and has had months of time just for himself. I'm stuck in the same grind I've been in for years.
Man being lonely wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't so fucking unlikable
ive been so lonely the past few months.. i fill my time with just gaming and taking my mind away into a different world. nobody really cares about me irl and i have few to no friends. yesterday i was afk to take a bath so i left my character looking like a snowman in front of my guild's house. when i came back i saw my guild friends also posing as snow people around my character. like a little family. ive never known these people irl, but that made me feel a little less sad yesterday.
Broke up with my gf last night but it was mutual
I'm such a fucking man child. I need to stop.    Eat some food. Send an email to my lawyer.  God how do I tell my parents I don't have a job because I don't apply for work because I'm depressed?
So weird how fickle moods are, how you want to kill yourself a minute ago then ate some chocolate crakers and somehow not that suicidal anymore.
I tell myself that not having a successful career is no biggie. But boy, does it hurt at times.
Nothing like waking up at 5am and crying to start the day. I’m determined to turn it around though. I’ve got a lot of good things coming up and I can’t let my insecurities distract me from those.
Feeling increasingly irritated at small things...and so tired of everyone. I want to be alone but I am so lonely. Crying away more nights than not. I don't even know why I am leaving a comment, I doubt anyone sees it. But I don't have anywhere else to say these things. Feeling really hollow and unhappy just.
I can’t bring myself to workout. I don’t have any energy and I’m too down to move. I just don’t feel like I can keep going. I really want myself out of here. Finding out that my depression is worse than I thought made me realize how shit this life really is. I feel so helpless
I have this pit in my stomach it hurts so much. And I could cry everyday. I just want someone to be there for me..
I'm sorry I hurt you, and I miss you so much. I still think about you literally every day, I really hope you're happy and healthy and I wish I could be there to support you. I'm trying my best to fight this depression but it's hard to see myself for anything more than what I did. I just can't forgive myself and it hurts a lot. I hate that what I'm writing is centered around me, when it's you who had to go through several years of neglect and depression. I'm so sorry I couldn't see that, or wouldn't see that. I know that the person you're with now does, and I'm so glad you have someone like him to support and be supported by. I know that you won't read this, but I miss and love you so much and I hope you have a merry christmas.
The lockdown is killing me. Applying for jobs, but my mental health has been steadily declining.
I'm crying so badly.
I wanna die. Fuck this life.
I become a better person when I'm drunk. Like seriously, alcohol makes me a better person. It's fucked up I guess but if it makes everyone happy, what can I say?  Also fuck Christmas.
My wife and I lost our baby girl (stillborn) last week. I’m really struggling to find the good in life atm. Christmas is usually my favorite time of year and now I feel like it’ll never be the same again.
my old friend told me he wanted to do a group call with all our highschool friends on christmas.. well that didnt happen. i already mentally prepared myself to socialize and its all a waste in the end. why do i even try
If I'd played my cards right, I'd be so much more successful. Ah, f#$k it. I'll be like Diogenes.
Good luck out there today y’all. Hopefully liquor helps the smiles.
None of this really seems to be worth it, huh
I'm going to survive 2020, but I'm never going to recover from it.
Being massively unhappy who I am -> but also being extremely afraid of any change whatsoever -> I talk to therapist about all this -> she isn't able to tell me anything -> I have a total breakdown  _insert Gru meme_
Idk why but I’m feeling empty tonight.
Let's hope 2021 is the year for me right? At least I can laugh bitterly at things. I'm fucking tired of holding it all in, but to be honest it's pretty much all I've got providing me any semblance of emotion left and I'd rather keep it there.
I keep a journal. Idk, it's good for getting thoughts out sometimes, but after four years all it has is my depressed thoughts. Still I open it sometimes and see how the things that made me so unhappy and wretched don't matter anymore. I hope one day the things currently making me depressed will go away as well.
Still here, only I haven't posted before. Always worried that someone would know who I am or snoop my profile, but I honestly don't have to worry about that because I am more and more realizing how little I mean to anyone. I am having a very tough time, wherein I am considering living with my girlfriend, who I can't trust fully and who is constantly upset or disappointed with me, or staying at home with my angry and abusive parents. I don't know what to do and it's all moving so fast. I feel worse than ever now, even though my partner is supposed to not tear me down
I wonder how old everyone is here. I'm 21, I've been around on this subreddit since I was 17 or so. I remember reading posts and comments from older people and thinking I'd never reach that age (had plans to kill myself.) Here I am though all grown up. Sigh.
In general i'm not doing good. Don't have the energy to list why that is
I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired.  I finally fixed my sleep schedule just to stay up until 7am again and fuck it all up once again. I wake up at 4pm every single day wishing I could just never wake up again. I woke up at 4pm today just to fall asleep playing pokemon at 7pm. Why am I so tired all the time for no reason.  I bought a game I wanted to play for a while after my laptop broke and I had no access to my steam account. I scraped out $15 for it and I watched it download in anticipation, just to stare at my switch and not play a single game. I bought a game to not play it. My switch is right next to me. I'm just staring at my computer screen.  I want to scream. I want to tell people that I am depressed and get the help I need. But my whole fucking family is depressed. I can't make this about me when everyone else is going through issues of their own and I don't want anyone to worry about me killing myself. I wish death was easier to achieve. I wish people could forget me at the snap of my fingers so I can finally die and not worry about my family and friends mourning my death. How do I even die without traumatizing someone in the process??? I fucking hate living, I did not ask to be born. Take back my life you fucking coward god. Let me die.
I don't really talk to any friends. I just let out my thoughts here on reddit since that's socialization in a way. Just reading tonight. There's a manga I've been meaning to finish. After that there's 1 more I knda want to finish.  Feeling apathetic today.  Tired like everyone else. Maybe I didn't sleep enough. No coffee today. I'll try to sleep at midnight, not too early so I don't wake up in the middle of the night again.
Every time I post here, I end up deleting my comment...  "Life is a gift." I stand outside smoking, tasting the salt on my tongue, noticing I'm an embodiment of fear, memories, nostalgia, and anger. I shield myself from the world, waiting for someone to notice my pain, but they can't see through my calm demeanour. I get a little happier and a little angrier, drifting through the motions until my death. To acknowledge the problem is to suffer. I hope life goes by quick because, at 22, I'm already tired.
16+ years of constant depression in varying degrees and I'm still having weekly breakdowns ugly crying wondering if this is permanent and wondering if I should just neck myself. I guess one day I'll decide to but for the mean time I'll continue deluding myself into thinking theres a light at the end of the tunnel like a fucking retard
I’m not really a religious person but is it weird to feel like you’re being punished by god? I feel like I’ve had nothing but problems for the last year and when something good does happen it quickly turns around and becomes bad. It got so bad today I started crying randomly.
I spend so much time thinking about things that happened in the distant past. Thinking about them is completely pointless now. I wish I could put the same amount of thought into things that could actually help me.
I'm off my meds because reasons  Trying to hard to get a therapy appointment but I was off therapy for a bit and after 3 emails back and forth trying to find a time slot that works for me my therapist stopped replying  I'm scared this means I have to find a new therapist  And will lose my 3 year history and backstory and will have to rehash my shit with a new therapist and will bring back bad things and I am refreshing my email like crazy and its been over 24 hours since I last sent a summary of the days and times that could possibly work for me and im losing my mind and just god please I dont want to get worse   I just want to exist without not wanting to exist y'know  I just don't want to be back at rock bottom again but I need help but the universe isn't making it easy right now and fuck
I relearned the lesson that wearing eye makeup is pointless. It always gets cried away (waterproof varieties are laughable to someone who cries as hard as me) and leaves me spending so much time wiping it off in the nearest bathroom.  But I was having a great time the past few weeks at work, and felt good about myself, and eye makeup makes me feel pretty, and more confident. I was able to wear it for a few weeks with no worry. Now, once again, after an embarrassing cry in the work bathroom, I don't have the confidence in my happiness lasting to wear it without worrying about crying it off.  I can't go into the details about why, but my job that made me so happy has been ruined by my bosses.
I was clinically diagnosed with depression about 8 years ago, and escaped it about 5 years ago. I feel the same things surfacing again now for a couple of weeks and I'm terrified.
I'm shaking for no reason, sad for no reason. I hate this body so much. I'm so fucking tired of it.
Closing in on two hours of work out of 8, and I'm still trying not to break down (completely) in my booth  If only I had the courage to end it all already
Who here fantasizes about being dying on the way to work in some crash? Just something where it’s over in an instant than bam you don’t exist anymore
I eventually stopped crying. I finally got up. I ate a bit. I cleaned up the house a bit. I washed the dishes. Somehow I feel a bit better. Somehow I feel a bit in control. I still feel anxious and hopeless, though. I'm broke and I don't even know if I'll have anything to eat tomorrow. But I guess I'll have to try again. Idk how to off myself anyway. I guess that's good. Somehow.
Haaa having a long-distance contact with someone, only seeing each other a few times a year even before covid. I'm still living at my parent's place, sending her glamorized photos of the landscape I live in and the food I make and whatelse but only because she wants to see those (it's like watching foodporn for her).   Yesterday did something like that again and she was like "you're living a good life!" and I was just thinking "are you serious?".   So far we talked about her problems but I only implied or joked about my ones. I replied with a meme that the rest of my life might not be that cozy beside those pictures and she said one day she'd like to know why exactly I were unhappy.   It's absolutely surreal for me that she can't even imagine what those reasons might be. That just means how well I've been able to hide it. I've been living a triple life for years and even though we know each other for years as well she only knows a carefully created fake personality of me. I don't do that to exploit anyone, I'm just too dysfunctional to actually leave the house and talk to people.  What she don't know is that I've been unemployed for years. My life is a total mess but my parent's place is still producing nice pictures! So it's like an iceberg where you only see the small top. Still I'm living in eternal fear of my parents and emotional abuse. I'm super dysfunctional and it took me years learning how to even use public transport or sit in one room with other people. Still able to hide all that _when_ I'm actually meeting someone else, it's kinda catch22.   Suicidal thoughts for years. Running away from mental hospital for years, the one therapist suggested. Doing super irrational things and not even having plans for tomorrow.  Haaa really not talking with her about my problems. I see no point in this, it won't make me feel better and I already lost two other social contacts because they asked me about my problems and I thought I could trust them and it only ended in arguments. She's also not really the right person because she can be very hurtful and my emotional skin is made from paper hahaha when someone's looking at me the wrong way I get a new trauma. I can't deal with the loss of control when "sharing".
It’s been awhile since I post on here.   Last night was the hardest for me but I got through it. I haven’t showered for two days nor have I eaten for two days. But you know what today I’m gonna force myself up and get things going. There are sick people waiting for me and I can’t fail them. I must continue fighting because I am stronger beyond any pain I feel. Today I will go on a quick jog and take that shower I need to take and eat something. I will play a song on my piano and put on my waist trainer then I will get ready for work. At work I will go to the chapel and make a small prayer let all my tears out then prepare to help those who need me with a clear mind a smile on my face and a still bruise but warm heart. This is my goal for today. I am stronger then how I feel. I can do this. You all can do this. I love you all take care💜
I’m having one of those days where I feel empty. I feel like I only exist in others lives out of convenience and that those I do try to communicate with - I just annoy them.   I just want to stop feeling so alone.
Have an illness where you're scared to death anyone will reject you + Be fucking boring without any interests = Recipe for disaster
I have so much to do and no energy to do it. The more I look at my bf, the sadder I get. It feels like I am alone, but with someone living parallel to me out of pity and financial necessity. If we don't live together though I am essentially homeless while disabled.   I just don't know what to do with life, so I read and maldaptive daydream my way out of it for 90% of the day, sleeping for the other 10%.
So today one of my only three friends that live in the same continent as i do let his friend just tell me that he doesnt want to be friends with me anymore while he just sat there and i have known him for eight years and her for two months and just hhhh
Been stuck at home for almost a full six months now. I’ve only left the house once. Since I came back home since the lockdown, I’ve been slowly reverting back to my teenage days aka not knowing how to deal with the fighting matches at home( after trials of trying to break them up, fight back or straight up ignoring them).  Mentally, yo-yoing from ahahah shit I’m in a not so good place to hmm maybe it’s not so bad.  Have successfully isolated myself from everybody.   Read and watched some of the most depressing things I could find and literally couldn’t even bring myself to cry lol.  Given up on trying to talk it out with people because it feels kinda useless( I’ve tried but I guess I just suck at articulating?).  Haven’t been productive and while I’m completely guilt stricken I also cannot being myself to do anything.  Since I can’t be self destructive at home, guess I’ll just not exist lol
I have no trust in my future and can't imagine things getting better. I hope I have the heart to talk about this the next time I see my therapist.
Happy 10th anniversary to me and crippling depression and anxiety. Til death do we part.
I just started taking medication a week ago. I don’t think it’s related but I’ve been feeling pretty ok this week. I’m struggling to figure out what’s going on with me since I have many breaks in my downswings. I guess many people would consider that lucky but honestly sometimes it makes everything feel that much harder. Knowing and remembering what life can be like without a complete lack of motivation and what life can be like when a smile comes naturally. Trying to get the right diagnosis while constantly doubting everything that happens internally and externally... depression is such a fucking mind game. Sometimes I feel like it has an intent. It decided to crush me in the most sinister way possible... by first systematically taking away every connection I have with reality and then making me feel guilty about it. Making me hate myself for something I didn’t even fucking do... like I said this week has been pretty ok, I even had the pleasure of sitting with a friend on a bench and feeling a deep rooted happiness. The fucking fucked up thing is though that even in that happiness there is a void staring back at me. Even in my brightest moments I must be reminded that I am not free.
I felt like before the pandemic and lockdown, I was stable enough on my 50mg of Zoloft to stay on that dose and do alright. Things have drastically turned for the worst and due to the situation this country is in I am incredibly hopeless and sad. It doesn’t feel like a full depression relapse yet, but it could be headed in that direction. I’m reluctant to raise my Zoloft dosage due to the side effects. I want to feel better and am doing extra things to feel better - getting enough sleep, eating well, light exercise, and CBT techniques but it’s not doing to be enough.
I’m doing horrible
I've had panic attacks 2 nights in a row, currently having one now. I went to urgent care last night and they diagnosed me with a bacterial throat infection and said "come back if you need to." Problem is with my fucked up brain I have no clue what the difference between painful but harmless and literally dying RIGHT NOW. I'm up at 2am fighting every minute to not go back to urgent care and I can't keep my mind off death. This is the worst
hurting a lot and can't tell anyone. I come here and say that a lot. it's pathetic.  talked to an old friend recently for the first time in a long while, to catch up on what's been happening in our lives. he told me that he was seeking therapy for his eating disorder. I was glad for him, and we talked about that for a while and I tried to be supportive and let him know I'm around if he ever needs anything. I really meant it.  but there was an awful, selfish part of me that felt sad, because I knew instantly that I can't open up to him about what I'm feeling. I can't tell him about my grandpa's cancer, or the horrible things I read at work, or how I want to die but I'm struggling to get treatment. because he's got his own problems and he doesn't need to hear about mine.  and that's the thing - at this point, everyone has their own problems, and those problems are much more serious than mine. I feel ashamed just thinking about it. I have no justification for feeling the way I do. I just want to go away forever and stop bothering everyone.
I have lost control over my life
Yet another Sunday night where I have my mind going with anxiety for the fact that it's yet another work week to which I hope passes by quickly. By the time Friday rolls around and off the clock, it suddenly becomes Sunday night with the onset of the dread all over again. I feel tempted to just call out. I have an older cat who very likely has cancer and may have to take a day off for an appointment to affirm on it. By then I'm not sure what will go down since it's very likely that she will have to be put to sleep because of it. I'm second guessing with my job search since I want something concrete but nothing in my desired field will be offered until at least the beginning of next year. If I didn't have loans to pay off then I would risk being unemployed for a few months. I should also stop reading news trends since it doesn't help with my mind racing.  Don't mind me. Just another narcissistic rant while I think of it and have no other outlet to express this on. I'm just tired of this.
The emptiness is scary.
I'm not in a good mental space right now  going through the 3rd divorce within 3 years, first my mom and dad that really hurt me and 2nd my step dad I hated and my mom and 3rd and right now my grandma and grandpa I had to live through lots of my parents fighting and yelling and I have depression as a consequence I've struggled even when I didn't have depression with self esteem and I've done self harm and it hurt my friends and I feel like I betrayed them 1 friend especially we've all ways liked each other she helps a lot but since COVID I can't see her and I don't have that help any more but I'm trying to do something and it made my moral sky rocket down so yay...
Birthday in a few days. It's probably going to be the loneliest. Oh welp.
yup im getting worse every day
well i know for sure, my future's fucked
[deleted]
not very excited for therapy, don’t think I’ll open up 😐
Today I stayed connected with people and socialised. I have to become functional again.
Things are getting worse. Have been.  I think I need hospitalization but that makes me feel like even more of a failure.  I don’t think I’ll make it to 28.  The only thing that keeps me here is the thought of my child going through this alone herself. But lately that thought hasn’t been holding me on like it used to.  Will anyone remember me when I’m gone? Or am I just that insignificant? I guess I’ll never really know.
I'm just so over all of this atm. I hate my job. Im going to school for a job I have no interest in. And the main reason I'm going to school is because my boyfriend is, and I figure once that fails like everything else, then I can say I at least tried, and maybe will even finally just end it all. But I don't even want to talk to him about it, because I know he'll get upset, tell me not to talk about things like that, etc. I just don't know if I can really really do this. I'm so  tired.
Ive been in a positive mood as of late, call it the upswing. Gonna try and maximize this, hopefully I can minimize the crash when it comes  Been good but my sleep cycle is all fucked up and maybe got 8 hours in 4 days? Really starting to feel that.  My dreams are back, though, a bit wierd. Why the hell would Green Bay trade Aaron Rodgers to the Bears, and why would I tell everyone in my family as if I just found some lost treasure? Dreams are friggin wierd, man. But at least they're not nightmares, yet.
One of my good friends got arrested today. If I had been smarter I could’ve avoided her getting arrested. I think my mental state had been declining almost everyday I think about suicide daily and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been smoking weed when I get really stressed but I’ve just been wanting to die/forget everything by taking bars.
I feel so unhappy and lost. Life is just suffering
So much anger against my father. And graduate advisor. Both the father figures in my life.
Do you ever feel like you feel tired and drained because you feel like you're chasing something but nothing is even happening????
i'm depressed inside, dead on the outside
I'm going to die someday, either of my own hand or not. In the meantime, I'm going to surrender to little pleasures programming, math, science and chocolate.
Finally had my hearing to get disability. It did not go well. Fuck I'm scared about the future.  I'm just killing time until I die.
I continue to feel the extremes of deep depression, high anxiety, or just the complete feelings of emptiness and numbness.  I just don't feel like I feel joy anymore.  I rarely even daydream happy thoughts.  Rather my daydreams just have me suddenly disappearing off the face of the Earth.
The anniversary of my father's suicide is coming up. I found old letters from him today, mostly apologizing for disappointing me. I was an asshole kid who never got to apologize to him and I feel responsible for his death. Reading those letters makes the wound feel fresh. I was a horrible, mean daughter and I should have killed myself when I was a teenager, before he did, and maybe things would've been different for my family.
the world is an evil place and I don't want to live in it anymore.
What a tough week last week. My self esteem is zero. I haven’t felt this badly in a long time. I’m hoping I can pull myself out Of it the next few days to weeks but I know I’m just going to keep falling back in until my situation is resolved.
My mom called today. I ignored it and kept gaming. I'm not in a good relationship with her.  Gonna eat now and I'll keep this comment updated hopefully with what I do next. Hopefully something good.    I'm gonna eat the pizza I got and check out some video game mechanics then catch up on 2.5 days of shows.
Cymbalta stopped working for me. I've been spiraling really hard the last couple of weeks but I have a doc appt this Friday to talk meds so hopefully he's willing to kick it up a notch to something more potent.
I told my Mom about my friend's sister's recent suicide and the first thing she did is to blame the deceased, who btw was a diagnosed bipolar. I just find it really fucked up.
Sometimes I'm doing pretty okay, and it just swoops in to nail me without warning. Wtf. How can I go from almost enjoying myself to wanting to die within twenty seconds?  I can't keep doing this.
I haven't hurt myself in a few days so that's good, but every day I struggle with wanting to.  I'm also realizing that I've used self harm as a coping mechanism on and off for my whole life so that's fucked I guess
I cried for three hours today. Straight. At least I got a little productive after that
First off good evening to anyone reading and thank you kind people for this subreddit (and this open space).  I am 24 years old, employed for around 4 years and live with my brother (we rent an apartment).  Even if that sounds like some good accomplishments, I feel like a loser without energy (or with just some) every day...  The fact that.. I am still a virgin, makes me hate myself, my lack of social skill and confidence. Had online girls on Tinder "wanting" me but never happened. I just feel like a straight up loser that can't enter nor make a relationship work  Another thing that makes me hate myself is I want to invest my money a bit riskier but I never commit. Idk, I really don't know what is wrong with me.. I am so sorry to bother you guys but thank you
I hate people sometimes. Had a friend who totally screwed me up emotionally today with toxic positivity. After I made it clear that I didn't like it, friend apologized. She then proceeded to invite me to her mlm product event.   Biatch... I can't even. How could you do this to your friend? It feels like a combo of manipulation, pity and self-centeredness. You wanted to invite me to this event so that I'd feel better? Quit lying. Also did you just assume that my life is horrible just because I have depression? (I'm feeling better nowadays... If she had bothered to ask)
Haven’t been here in a while. Things have been going a lot better as of late. I’ve been going to the gym and following a diet very well. My body issues remain to be a large concern for me but I’m really hoping I can begin to get on the right track.   I would say my next area to focus on is self worth. I’m trying to allow myself to realize that I’m doing well for myself and there are people that are proud of me, but there’s the endless battle with the voice inside my head.   I want to matter.
Idk why I'm so cranky these few days. The same friend kept bugging me with texts and giving me advice and suggestions. I'm so tired of feeling like... being pitied?
So much anger, so much resentment.
"The younger generation cannot survive without their parents!" - my parents, today in a conversation with a friend  It's not my fault that I cannot earn enough to sustain myself (I can, I just can't own a house...). It's not my fault that I'm getting the degrees and work experience I should be getting only to be underemployed/unemployed.  I wish someone could make the older generation goes thru a simulation of life of a 24 year old in 2020, maybe that would open their eyes. My parents seemed smug when they talked about how youngsters rely too much on their parents and can hardly be financially stable.
Here's hoping I at least get an interview for the full-time position at work. I've been waiting YEARS for something like this to open up and even if I never move beyond this, if I get it I'll be happier than a pig in shit! And maybe, just maybe, I'll finally be able to somewhat survive.
Maybe my "depression" is just an excuse so I can justify my patheticness. "It's not my fault, it's the depression," right? Feel bad for me, pity me, care about me. Maybe I'm mixing up the two, pity and care. Doubt anyone feels either for me. Doubt anyone feels anything for me but hate.  Why am I such a shitty person? I have no excuses. My childhood wasn't awful or traumatizing, it was sucky at times but everyone's is sucky at times. So what? Why am I so shitty? I don't even have depression, I'm just a shitty healthy person. If life's shitty it should at least be shitty to the max. Moderately shitty, big deal. Who cares. Nobody.  I keep flip-flopping between imagining scenarios where I'm a fantastic person and everyone cares about me, and scenarios where everyone despises me and I try to kill myself. I've noticed the former borrows from media: movies, books, anime. The latter borrows from my actual life. Guess that's saying something.
I'm less sure I can do this than I used to be. Running off hope, resilience, and general grit without a payout? It's been so long man. I dunno how long someone can keep doing that, but I'm worried it's not going to be enough for me.  Enough? Enough for what, anyway? To get old and have my body and mind start failing on me while the world changes faster than I could dream of keeping up with hoping I get enough to scrape by? To watch anything I manage to care about fade away or die? Yippee fucking skippy. Why would I even care? I dunno, I dunno.  Looking in from outside, I know this is “bad”, but why I can't quite pin point. Funny phrase that. Huh. Even writing this something in me is desperately clinging to ... wholesomeness? I dunno. Something. It's that same part that keeps saving me. Why? Why does it even bother? Idk. This sucks. Hope you're doing good, sorry about the bad rant.
After weeks of no response from all the job applications, I received interview requests from two of my ideal companies. Although I'm tired to have to go through the entire interview process, at least I'm a little closer to going back to work and not feeling like I'm doing nothing.   Working in a toxic job, quitting and job searching have been tiring. I don't like the idea of working 40++ hours a week. But sitting on my a** is depressing too. Idk how to reconcile this, gonna take it a day at a time.
Is anyone else a NEET who rejects education, work, and everything else required to survive these days? I know I have potential, but my ability and will to work has been sapped over the years. At least I am getting treatment.
I feel like I’m getting worse with no end in sight. Lately I’m feeling lower than I have on my worst days, and I’m beginning to have physical responses to my stress and depression. I’m scared because I think I might hurt myself and I don’t even want to. I just can’t get out of my own head.
I'm just totally fucked in the head. I've spent so long trying to distract myself from my thoughts and emotions that I've forgotten how to actually know what I'm feeling. Any time I try to focus on the causes, my brain just jumps to awful intrusive thoughts. Chronic depression's a bitch, and I'm afraid I'll be like this my whole life.   God I need fucking therapy, but the last time I went to therapy it wasn't much help cus I can't even really describe what I'm feeling, or why.  Just that I feel like shit.
I feel awful, it's everything all over again. I feel stuck in an horrible place.
Tonight I feel numb.
Life feels like it’s just one long day
loneliness is genuinely eating away at my soul. Every night i imagine all sorts of interactions with people i never talked to. i imagine the scenario, dialogue, and everything. and then i realize that this would never happen. its so pathetic. i am so lonely man
Today well technically yesterday (since it’s early in the morning now) was not the best day if I’m being honest. Idk I’ve just been feeling really lonely and empty, It’s just been an endless cycle of getting up and wasting the day procrastinating and not being productive at all and then hoping for nighttime when I can be alone with my thoughts in peace. The only time I’m at peace is when I’m sleeping tbh. I want to stop this cycle but it’s hard when you can’t think optimistically about life and feel like giving up all the time:((
It's hard to move, every movement... every breath feels so heavy. I feel unwanted and useless. The only thing I've done that's productive is get out of bed... but then I found my way to the couch... I hate feeling like this. I hate crying.
It’s unbelievable how much I fuck things up  At some point all this stress is going to have serious repercussions on my physical health
feeling like shit for who knows how many days or months in a row. not in the worst headspace of my life but geez this sucks.
I called a suicide hotline today and gave a fake name. Apparently I sounded distressed enough that a half an hour later some cops showed up at my house. I managed to lie to them to make them go away but now it’s 3 in the morning and I want nothing more than to kill myself. My housemates hid all the pills and knives. I don’t know what to do other than sit here and feel numb. I wish I could just die.
Feeling absolute shit right now.  I don't feel like I'm in control.  Why can't I just fucking do the things that I should be doing??
I just feel like I can't cope, that I'm barely in control of my life and the things I am in control of I don't have the energy or mental ability to do anything about.
I just want to feel normal.
Parents are back from holidays, something I was feating the whole time. Made a cake hoping they'd leave me alone but it never works. It's like there's no escape, no safe spot. I'm so afraid of them and I hate it so much. But also too dysfunctional to move out or do any other big changes.
I wish I could give up on stupid and impossible hopes like being successful or not lonely. It wasn't that hard for me to give up on being happy because that's quite honestly never going to happen but somehow this hurts worse.  I can't have even one aspect of my life that isn't shitty?? What the fuck did I do to deserve this
So extremely scared of tomorrow. Parents are back and want to raise the pressure, demanding to know what I did while they were gone. Have to make up lies on the spot. Just want to run away from everything.  Also, pretty much everything is closed. Libraries etc because of covid. Feeling like I'm constantly under attack at home but can't go anywhere else either which sucks especially since now it gets cold. Feeling like a trapped animal.
I just dont know how long i can take this. I can bear this feeling of hollowness, nothingness anymore. Nothing makes me happy anymore, i cant focus at anything. i dont want to eat anything, i dont want to do anything, i have lost all motivation i dont want to exist anymore
I just want to die already
I just dont want to tomorrow. im tired. i feel so shit. I just got triggered recently about being a virgin i guess. idk why I care so much about that. i just feel like a failure socially and because of covid and my previous jobs where I was super awkward and nervous I feel like a failure in work as well. I don't really mind having very little friends. idk I just wish I could make another one or get a gf. I just want that one person who I cant talk to about anything. mostly my depression and what weighs me down. i feel I cant talk to me friends very well about that stuff. they're not great to talk to about depression. i don't think they understand. im just so tired of doing interviews and applications and getting rejected. im tired of doing uni as well. i feel like whats the point if Im not getting a job and not getting what i want which is a gf. i cant really meet people because of covid and online dating sucks. im just finding it hard to do anything. im so alone. i don't want to do tomorrow. its so hard being a person. its so dumb. you just look for that next hit of endorphins to make you feel good for no reason. always suffering. why do anything? i hate everyone. idk ahh. i really don't know anymore what to think. im just tired of trying, failing and being alone. i feel i dont like socialising that much its pretty boring a lot of the time idk. need to meet more people but still hard to meet people who you actually like. zz
feeling like i will never be enough in my current relationship. i always feel like i’m lacking in one way or another and it really eats away at me. sometimes i feel like my s/o would be better without me in the picture
everything is so difficult
Already had an awful day. Took a two hour walk to get away from parents. Got so much anxiety and stress.  Later that day I saw my ex in the local newspaper. She's writing her doctor thesis. I guess you can do a lot in life if you have a healthy brain.  That was eight years ago. I suffered so much back then, can't describe how brain-dead I handled all this, tons of dysfunctional lines of thinking. But hey at least it got _so much worse_ since then. Bad internships, bad therapy, bad job, unemployment. Running up the walls rn. I'm suffering for the last two decades, there hasn't been a good year since I was ten. It's just "pick a bad year to think about". All the crap back then and then a constant like to the even worse things today.
Can I please please please stop worrying do much about the future. Why do I have to be so convinced that I'm going to be an absolute failure in life? Why can't I just be okay with who I am? I get in such a bad place when I'm alone and I'm gonna be all alone after college and everything is just gonna be so bad. College is awful right now and idk if the online garbage will be ever by the time I graduate. It's like the last few years of my life are being ripped away from me. I just wanna stop worrying but I can't. I wish I could know what I wanted to do for a career. I wish I knew I wouldn't be alone. I wish I had any reason to loom forward to life after college. God I'm already somehow super lonely and I live with four people. I'm not going to be able to live a life on my own.
If only someone I trust asked me if I'm okay instead of laughing at my suicide jokes. And why the fuck do they keep making jokes about that I'm  lil fa tjust shut the fuck up. They are my friends but please just shut the fuck up and when I try to say that they just make fun of it. I cannot be alone again and for like 75% of the time they are great friends I had houseplants to replace the oxygen I waste and even they died. I even fail at keeping a plant alive. I fail at everything. I really don't believe that it gets better so should I just end it when the next chance comes.
Parents backing me in a corner. I can't do what they want me to do. So instead today I managed to write my former therapist again and also one of my former employer. Asking both for a talk. That's the most I could do, tried to do it for years. Had huge obstacles, but today I _just_ pretended I was someone else (not the first time) and that I'd feel happier afterwards!  Tomorrow I'll probably have 100% pure panic about "omfg what have I done" (also not the first time). But whatever.   Idk where this leads me. Especially since I usually have huge problems with any change whatsoever. Maybe tomorrow I'll crawl under the couch again unable to move.
Had a horrible interview and can't sleep well ever since it ended. Not sure why hiring managers have to be so rude and  condescending, especially during a time like this.
Pretty much flunked a graduate assignment and it has been the only assignment graded, which means I have received an F. Trying to stay numb and hope that the professor does give another chance, but it's leaning towards that maybe I'm not cut out for all of this. Not to mention it's a class that is not in my comfort zone and yet if I try to drop it then I would really look like an idiot. I knew that getting A's during my undergraduate was a sham. Why am I even bothering to try?
I want to feel things again, I want to be alive.
When someone choses to leave you, because you are what you are, that's the worst; i just don't know what to do, i fuck up everything
I don't feel anything anymore. I hope this lasts longer than usual. It's better than being miserable. I don't think things will change in my life especially since i self-sabotage  and have a negative outlook. I'm pretty sure I have some mental illness, but I don't seek therapy or help because I am embarassed and avoidant. It feels like every year just gets worse and I'm becoming more and more detached. I haven't been to any doctor in years and my mental and physical state are deteriorating. I guess people have tried to reach out but I always push them away or they get frustrated and abandon me. I'm not worth it. I wish I could just die already. I don't have any passions or goals or dreams. I no longer am upset over my inability to keep relationships. I think I've accepted that it is something not for me. I feel bad for disappointing my mom but I'm doing the best i can pretending I dont want to die everyday.  My family is the only reason why I'm still here. I dont want my death to hurt them. I wish my existence would end quietly.
I fucking hate myself
[deleted]
I have no one to talk to right now. Asked the guy I like, who very much knows how I feel if you wanted to stay over. He is currently sleeping on my couch while I cry in bed. Fun times
I've never hated myself so much in my entire life
I hate how easily I feel rejected. I cry over the dumbest shit because someone will talk to me in a slightly pointed tone and it makes me feel like they hate me
I feel very precarious. I spent the past two days deep-cleaning my room because I thought I had bedbugs, but they turned out to just be carpet beetles. I should be happy that I don't have bedbugs and that my room is so much cleaner now, and I did feel that way last night, but today I feel anxious and just...frightened.
I’m just sitting alone all the time hiding the pain that i feel because no one seems to care too much about what I feel. They don’t have the time to talk or just spend a little time with me. In a home where your parents claim to love you but their still to busy to question their child about what’s going on in their life sucks...sometimes i just wanna go somewhere on my own and think....
fuck i wish i was smarter, it'd make everything easier. and have energy. I have no agency or ideas. Don't know what it is, but i don't have it. Resigned to mediocrity and survival and stress. Will be criticized by people who do have agency for whatever reason about doing x or y, and i'll understand it and be unable to communicate why i can't do it. My uncle is a successful self made potter. Why is he that and im a small anxious skill less cog in the machine. Gene enviornment relationship. I cant think past the immediate future and yet always preparing for the worst.
I hate the word “I”, don’t think I deserve it. Yet, I’ve already used it twice. It feels impossible to not use it, but I’ve come to the realization over the past decade that my well-being is no more or less significant than any one else’s. It feels incredibly selfish for me to talk about my issues with depression when there’s people with equal and much worse symptoms. Further, my time is worth no more or less than anyone else’s. It is arrogant and ignorant of me talk in general, the space for me is nonexistent in this universe. There’s no reason for me to exist, a creator put me into this world with no intentions of success. Thus, I’m only hurting others with my existence. One could argue against this with simple logic, saying that anyone could feel this way, but I assure you, I am hurting the world as much as it is hurting me. This is not the case for others, I am a selfish individual for existing. It is impossible not to be one with the universe, consciousness is all you know, yet, it’s insignificant. I beg to no longer exist, I don’t want to be perceived at all by anyone who has met me, it is only selfish of me, and difficult for them.
I’m in this “rut” of feeling like I don’t want to do another day.
I don’t even have the words to describe how I feel anymore. I’m going through some health issues and back and forth with my doctors right now, which I absolutely know is contributing to my mental state, but I almost feel like I can’t keep it together right now. At work, I feel like I can’t concentrate and I’m really irritable. Short tempered. I’m better at home but I know it’s not going to last. I was managing really well for a long time without medication or therapy but I’ve been bouncing the idea of going back. Now that I’ve made up my mind to do it, trying to squeeze yet another dr appt into my schedule is making it worse. I have a high stress job and my direct supervisor is a stickler for attendance. This post is kind of all over the place but I just needed to let it out. Some days are better and others I literally get out of bed just so I don’t worry my husband. I feel like I’m being ridiculous.
I keep realizing there are people who've never had to deal with depression daily. How is that even possible? It's so surreal to me, why am I like this?
i feel trapped.
I’ve been struggling hardcore. Lately I’ve been so down my partner can’t even be around me. And I can’t even blame him
i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die  i want to die i want to die
Can someone tell me that I deserve to exist and that things are going to be okay? I really need to hear that right now.
I washed and even conditioned  my hair today! It still feels weird to be proud of something that basic.
If my parents had spent as much time talking to me with concern, as they do praying, maybe I wouldn't have ended with lifelong insecurity, anxiety and depression
I feel like depression has made me so stupid.
When I entered college I thought with this degree I could have a job where I could help my family economically and still be able to live decently. Fast forward 4 years, graduated in the middle of a fucking pandemic, jobless. I feel like a fucking failure and a burden to my family. It seems like I will never find someone that will love me no matter what. Sometimes I wanna fucking kill myself and the only thing that keeps me here is literally my mother. I promised her I would be the one to bury her but everyday that goes by it's more difficult. I don't even fucking know if I'm depressed or just constantly on a down-ish mood and I feel one day I'm gonna explode. I don't want anybody to know about this so everyday I put my clown mask because that's the only thing I can do. This is how I feel right now.   I'm sorry if this isn't meant to be here, I'm just so mentally exhausted I wanted to vent. If this doesn't comply with the rules I'll delete it.
So much resentment towards my graduate advisor and my father.
I’m pretty sure school and schoolwork in general  makes me depressed... I’m just so lazy and after failing over and over i just feel horrible
I feel so lost, I’m tired of feeling like a burden to those that say they love me. I wish I didn’t feel unwanted. I want to climb out of this hole but I think I keep digging it deeper.
Sleeping all day and crying all night is the norm now. I’m tired of reality.
I guess today was an ok day. I cooked for my family (I haven't eaten though bc no appetite). I exercised (a little) for the first time in months (whoa since July...didn't realize so much time had passively passed). I also showered, which I haven't done in days... At least I feel like I actually did something today. I know I should be kind to myself and be content with what I've managed to do, but it just makes me sad that this is my mental bandwidth. I want the old me back...  I'm still not motivated enough to work on my grad school apps...it just makes me cry thinking about it...about how I'm such a fucking failure and this is all just a waste of time and energy. Guess I'll just go back to mindlessly watching gbbo and let myself get further behind.
Man, I didnt know there was an entire forum filled with people who are depressed.   Ive been feeling anxious and depressed for a long while now. I want to get better so i decided to go to a therapist. It's helping little by little, but there are just some days where im tormented by thoughts of past scenarios. I catch myself talking to the people in my head and making a conversation out of it. It isnt driving me insane, but these things clearly affect me to the point where its constantly on my mind.
My eyesight legitimately got worse because im on my phone all waking hours trying to escape my responsibilities
Hello I am depressed
I’m not doing okay today. I missed a deadline for a project and didn’t realize until a day after (today). The person waiting for my submission emailed and I sat, staring at their email.  I was trying to think how/why I missed the deadline and I don’t know what came over me but I started crying. I haven’t cried in a long time and I realized I have reached some sort of a breaking point.  There seems to be just so many things going wrong for me recently and I’m having a hard time. I have trouble telling my friends and family any of this because I don’t think anyone wants to hear this and I don’t want to be the “Debbie Downer”. My mediation app and breathing exercises only help so much.  I’m writing here because I hope someone will read this. I don’t need acknowledgement but thank you for being here. I’m trying too.
I feel so incapable of the simplest fucking tasks. I’m falling very behind in school and yet still spend hours sitting around staring at walls, listening to podcasts or doing chores around the house to give myself a semblance of productivity. I lost all my running progress and am regaining all the weight I had lost from running through the summer. I have no friends and am starting to feel disconnected and angry at my boyfriend for no reason in particular- he deserves better then that.
Thinking of giving up everything and just go live in the woods. Maybe I can suffer the same fate as Grizzly Man.

I'm like a month behind in the sole "college" course I'm taking: a remedial math class. It's finally caught up to me and there's just no way I can complete the exam that's due in a little less than 2hrs. I'm not even upset, I'm more apathetic than anything, but I still can't believe I did this to myself. I can still salvage this class, I just have to start over immediately and act like the semester begins tomorrow (I'm gonna start studying/reviewing tonight though). I really really hope I can hold myself to this; hopefully the thought of having to admit in 6 weeks that I failed this class, again (I took this class in the spring but dropped it), will be enough to get me to power through my apathy.
I'm spedning so much time thinking about things that happened 17-19 years ago. It just doesn't go away. And what happened wasn't egregious at all. Wish it would go away, and stop occupying space in my head.
There's nothing more fun than having your shitty ass brain loop twisted thoughts and uncomfortable truths in your head all day long :')  I have one more workday to go and it's in the shitty area I hate _again,_ I'm so fucking done rn
Didnt eat or drink today.   Gonna try to be hygenic when i wake up, and go outside
I was ghosted two weeks ago. I haven't showered in a week. I rushed back to my apartment this morning after I unlocking my neighbor's door because I was too embarrassed about my BO, and I slipped and fell on ice as a result. My knee hurts, and I want to binge eat. Hi.
i feel so embarrassed. yesterday i left a comment for the first time on someones page that ive been following for years. this person shares a lot about their life, i dont know who they are but they have a community on instagram. they often make posts about them feeling unhappy or angry so today under her new post i asked her a question about whether shes heard a song from a group i know she follows. today i wokeup and checked the comments, someone commented after me mocking my question because it seemed insensitive to the post, and over 20 people liked their comment.  i saw how they must have seen it, it seemed as if i just ignored her post and thought about myself. as a long time lurker of her page, she often ignores lots of the messages in her comment section but replies to questions especially music related, in my head i thought she’d feel better if i asked her something not related to mental health. it never crossed my mind that she’d be offended by it. i honestly had good intentions and it feel so shot down as it was the only comment ive ever left and it is now deleted.   can i get anyones opinion on this?
uh oh, getting bad again. i'm so fucking tired of being a failure in just about every part of my life. i feel like i have to try so much harder than everyone else and i still fail no matter what, i guess i'm just inherently incompetent and worthless. what's the point when i will never have success or happiness.
I reached out to someone who said they would be there if I needed them  for comfort and support and I ended up feeling like an idiot. They said they were sorry and then it shifted only to their issue before they completely disappeared. I tried to play it off like I was okay and I tried to comfort them for the short period they spoke with me, but  I was crying, feeling alone and stupid and not knowing how to approach this person going forward.
Well that's it. Govt cut my benefits, no hope of appeal. Won't be able to afford to stay where i am by next year.  Can't hold down a job, can't hold down a coherent thought. Moving here was supposed to turn things around. Therapy is useless, friends barely reply to me. Wish i'd died years ago, i've achieved nothing.
Wish i could reroll life is get a restart at least.
Watching people who have done nothing but down you get blessed by god really takes the wind out of your sails, especially when youve tried against the odds to no avail your whole life.    Im not feeling good today.
I want to die please I don't want to live anymore. Everything is so hard I'm unable to do anything properly

I've been taking Vitamin D for a few days and my mood is immensely lifted. I have the same focus and energy I had before. I'm still lonely, I still have no friends or future, but at least I can get out of bed now. Hopefully it doesn't end ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  I put off taking Vitamin D because I thought it was my shitty life situation that was causing my stress and depression, but it does still help. From time to time I have depressive episodes, but they don't last. I recommend giving it a shot. Granted it won't help everyone, but it's worth trying anything that might help
I have, so far, successfully  removed myself from 95% of my support network and am in the middle of fracturing the last 5%. There is no will or desire to improve, no sense of self value. I thought promises I made to myself would hold but those goals are becoming more unattainable and uninteresting by the day. Things aren't going well and I'm tired of struggling. The only thing keeping me here is an imagined fictional universe and not wanting to cause harm to that last 5% by finding my corpse.  I've been in this fight for longer than I've known the name if it. It's been so very long and I am so beyond tired. I want to rest. I want to be at peace.
I just don’t want to get out of bed, I just ate brunch with my roommate and her boyfriend. But now I am in my room with the lights off, and I know that I have people and if I talked to them some of my feelings my clear up but I don’t want to be a burden to them. Sometimes I wish I could just disappear without a trace and just have people not remember me.
I want to be happy
I spent 30 minutes being insanely destroyed by something that triggered me, and feeling like I was worth nothing.   That's better than being destroyed by it for an hour. A part of me rose up after 30 minutes and decided that I had done enough suffering, and that I was worth more than just feeling like I deserved to die.   This would not have been the case 4 years ago. And it is now, and I have no idea when it happened or why. It's not consistent, but it's just often enough that I'm noticing it now. That it can be really bad, that it can be just as bad as the other things that hurled me into the pit before, and kept me there for a while. But this time I did not let myself sit there.
In addition to my ever-present depression, I now have Covid. Just when my depression was getting better.
I feel so bleh and low. My critical inner voice is getting louder and louder. Can't wait for this quarantine to be over and I can be around other people safely again.
Nothing’s objectively wrong. But I wouldn’t complain if I died in my sleep.
Hope everyone's staying sane during the election day! I'm not even American but my dad kept mentioning the race, China and Russia that it's driving me crazy.   I have developed some sleep issues lately as well. Having a diffuser in my room didn't help much. I think the main problem is my over-consumption of internet content that fried my brain. Gonna attempt to draw and read more this week.   The job search is ongoing but I'm also investing some time in my part time gig for now. Tbh life is the most balanced for me now; too bad that I am forced to get a full-time job for societal expectations.
I can't believe you left like that
its the kind of tired sleep doesnt fix
Talked to a friend whos in a bad place today. I tackle depression with a lot of weird concepts that make sense and help me, but i dont think they can do the same to them. Everything they said just sounded so ...empty. Can anyone help me be a better friend lol and tell me how to talk to people like this?
My birthday is this weekend and I have no plans as usual because I have no friends. I don’t think I would mind so much if I didn’t have work on Monday. My coworkers are going to ask me what I did for my birthday and I’ll have to lie that I had dinner with friends or something. People expect you to do fun things on your birthday and I feel like that’s just another expectation that I don’t live up to.
Procrastinating. Did nothing all day. Will have to work weekend to compensate, but i just want to desapear.
I can't concentrate on anything I'm so weak I just want to kill myself
my cat died unexpectedly tonight. please god let me die in my sleep. there's nothing good in life for me.
I have the second episode of depression this year and my boss confronted me about not being super productive "again". I tried to explain that I suffer from depressive episodes and that I feel overwhelmed with my workload then, but I was very emotional about it and felt really stupid and ashamed afterwards. He just said that I am being illogical in my arguments and wanted me to think about it again and talk to him tomorrow. I am dying from anxiety over here.
i am so embarrassed to be alive. i don't know where to go for help. i'm too scared to kill myself and too scared to be alive
Every fucking day it feels like my life is falling apart. I can’t make it through a single day without feeling so hopeless. I’ll wake up and be happy, but by 2-3 I’m so hopelessly depressed. I’ve been on anti-depressants for years now and it just doesn’t feel like they work anymore. I’ve called over 2 dozen psychologists and therapists in the area and they don’t even call/email me back. I’d broaden my search, but I can’t afford anything beyond free or heavily discounted and I’m out of places to look. My mood brings my SO down so much I can tell she feels like it’s her fault. Fuck I just want someone to tell me what to do...
I have a computer science degree but it's been hard for me to get a job because I don't have any impressive portfolios because I just constantly depressed through college. Recently a private company in my area invited me for a written test. I applied for IT support position. In the advertisement, the technical requirements only stated that candidate must be able to do database administration, which I am able to do. But turns out the test was about full-stack web development, which I am sucks at. I thought I already get over it but now I find myself crying while watching John Mulaney. I feel so useless and my degree means nothing.
I can feel that today isn’t going to be a good day for me. It’s already off to a bad start. I feel just unimportant to everyone around me.  The people that say they care about me, I just don’t believe them.
First time posting, so please forgive if I screw up something. I just need to get this off my chest and don't have anyone I can really turn to. I've been dealing with severe depression for the last twenty years, and normally I have my shit together enough to not break down, but today hit it hard for some reason. I've been extremely lonely. I'm not attractive, even to myself, and I haven't had an honest relationship since my divorce.     I've recently been blocked by someone I've followed on Twitter for over two years, and today she said she was closing her account because she's retired from her industry. I had known that she was in a relationship with another influencer before the tweet, but I didn't know that they had broke up. I don't follow people on Twitter or Facebook that often tbh. I rarely check either. But I figured I'd be nice and say congrats and happy belated anniversary.     Turned out they went through a pretty public and bad breakup that I wasn't aware of.     Obviously the first thing I did was tweet an apology and explain that I didn't know. I felt horrible about it because I had been through traumatic divorce. It's the worst feeling in the world losing the one you love most in the world. But she immediately blocked me. I know in my head that I'm taking this way too seriously, but it hit me hard. It reminded me that I'm no one and I feel like I got thrown out like garbage. No thought of humanity, no thought of emotion, just refuse to be discarded. It reinforces how I see myself and how the world sees me.     I'm so very tired of being alone. Tired of not being able to make friends. Tired of being a nameless nobody that's passed on the street or not talked to by anyone unless it's for business. I just want some form of genuine acknowledgement that I matter to someone. You know how people fantasize about getting a relationship? I get rejected in my own dreams. I'm not making a joke about that either. I legitimately can't see anyone wanting me not even in my own dreams. It's pathetic.     I want a hug, a kind word that's given in sincerity, anything. And I know that deep down I'll never get that. I'll always be seen as "that creepy guy" or "that loser", and it's the worst isolating feeling ever. I break down and cry nearly every week. I smoke to take the edge off of my nerves to keep my from screaming into an uncaring void. And I long for a day where I no longer feel this pain, but I'm too terrified of death to do anything.     I can't take it anymore today, and I just had to get it off my chest.     I'm sorry I took up your time, but I appreciate it if you did get this far before scrolling off.     Thank you.
im sorry if im posting a lot but i really needed a space to vent and i have no one to talk to.  i dont think this is what a mentally healthy adult does but lately ive been living in my life escaping reality. ive been playing an online game out of boredom and sometimes i wish i can just escape my life and stay that universe for some time. it feels like living in a fantasy dream where i am a person in my own right. i dont have to live up anyone's expectations. i dont have to worry about the fact that im expected to marry a man by 30. i dont have a narcissistic family that ridicules the things i love. i can do whatever and know that i wont ever be less of a person than anyone else. i dont have to always be the mature adult im always expected to be.   i just feel so tired of life. i wish i had the courage to just say fuck it to everything and live only for myself. it sounds so selfish but i cant see how i can be happy juggling everyones expectations of me.
I had to take a stupid fucking test today but I though it eas tomorrow and I didn’t catch it so now I’m out $112. I hate my life. That test was super important and I don’t think I can get my money back and now it’s 2:30am and I think i’m a fucking failure and I don’t deserve to live on this earth because i’m stupid
On the bright side, I've reached the blessed valley of 'too depressed to eat' so at least I'll lose weight.
I keep thinking about how completely useless I am
I don't know what's my goal in life anymore.  Everyday is just tiring. I can't concentrate on like something for even 30 minutes.  Even lying in bed gets tiring.  I don't know what I want in life anymore. Left job, supposed to be looking for a new one but I'm feeling so out of it and worried I'll screw up the new job.  Applied for psychotherapy but haven't gotten a reply or notice yet. Don't know if that's going to even happen at this point.
I think the hardest part is that I'm still doing everything I'm "supposed" to be doing; eating right, exercising frequently, taking part in my hobbies, doing martial arts, talking with others as much as possible.  I'm just tired? I'm hitting 40 soon, have very little family, all of which is out of the country and I cannot legally visit. I have a handful of friends, but they all have families and spend most of their time with them (understandably). What little social life I had was torpedoed by betrayal, and further torpedoed by covid. Any time I've expressed my concern at just wanting to be able to go on a date before I die, I've been called selfish, disgusting, and (my personal favorite) a murderer.     I've spent nearly all of my 40 years quietly reading and writing by myself; I'm kinda burned out on reading endlessly and playing D&D on weekends.  I destroyed my leg in the military which makes weightlifting and martial arts (and sleeping) far more difficult every day. I just don't want to spend the next 4 months, much less 40 years, going to work, lifting weights in my garage, and reading a book, and then silently going to bed alone; never able to date or travel or have a party again.  I wake up every day wondering if I should just cut my loses.
I don't know what is going on anymore. I don't want to die, but things just get harder each day that goes by.
I recently got an art commission request and I haven't made any art since the last commission I had in September. I've doodled a lot, but these drawing commissions are the only things that give me the drive to actually finish something. It has been a really unproductive year for me, I've not made any of my own completed original drawings this year really, just a lot of unfinished stuff or rough doodles. It feels really unnatural for me. I've been perpetually exhausted and lacking in the motivation. It's very different from last year, last year I was so much more enthusiastic. But I love the saying "its okay to not be your most productive during a f\*cking pandemic."
I’m high-functioning, so I’m kinda moving through life. But the moment I’m not distracted, I just want to disappear and fade away so badly. I’m lonely, sad, and tired. I don’t know why but I feel it in my bones at this point, and I wouldn’t fight it if I just went to sleep and never woke up again.
I wish I could just have a day off. One day where I don't have to think about work or school. Yet, that isn't possible.
This week's highlight:  "Friend" talked me to condescendingly. Offered opinion on my MDD. Made the decision to cut off the relationship cuz I have a feeling that she's in touch with me to promote her MLM business. I'm done w this shit  Another old Facebook friend posted publicly about his mental health struggles which I support and welcome but that guy's an ass. His posts usually go "I'm depressed but I did this project and won that award" or "what good is a dean's excellence award if you're depressed all the time?"
I say I’m lonely but I don’t have the will or courage to keep up with relationships. Maybe I’m meant to be forever alone. Idk, not a fun feeling
My husband told me he doesn't think I should be sad everyday. I dont even know how to respond to that. I decided not to respond at all. I'm grieving and its winter and I just cant seem to find anything to be happy about. I cant enjoy anything. I'm not going to waste what little energy I have in reserve defending my feelings.
feeling anxious for no reason I'm tired of crying all the day
Feeling numb, my head went crazy, cant touch reality, lying in my bed with no point 4 living
feels like nothing at all is making me happy anymore. i keep opening games just to get bored and close them five minutes later. i don't even know what to do with any of my time anymore besides just sit here. i don't understand what's wrong with me
no matter what choice I make I always end up angry/dissapointed in myself
I’m not doing good. At all. My life is completely fucked for the time being. Currently without work, unemployment bennefits, backlog on rent from no income, failing all my classes for school, I can’t do anything and am sick of being like this.
It’s almost 4 in the morning over here and I can’t sleep. I’ve been in bed for hours and experiencing an anxiety attack. I’m not okay and I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I feel like I’m only good at messing things up the good things in my life and making bad situations even worse. I keep reminding myself every single day that one day things will be ok... But it feels like I’m just lying to myself and that I don’t expect any better from myself.  I just feel like shit... I’m 25 years old, haven’t graduated yet and oh, I have a huge student debt. That’s a bright future to look at, huh? No. Because I know I’m capable of finding ways to make it even worse (if that’s even possible).  Let me just say this... I’m tired and ashamed of myself. I’m a disappointment.

Currently sitting in bed with my gun debating on whether or not I should just fucking do it already. Dunno why I commented this tho cause it'll probably get deleted ✌️
I cant seem to move on past an asshole ex. Its been a year now he is still in a relationship with the girl he left me for and I cant seem to move on. I dont want to be with him. I just want him to get his bad karma for what he put me through. But they seem happy while i'm depressed and suicidal from the trauma they caused. I dont trust people anymore. I feel like everyone is out to get me. I prefer to be by myself now. Its lonely and depressing but at lesst I dont get hurt. I just cry now. Also my grandma recently died she was one of the few people in my life who I knew loved me. I feel so alone and I cant stop crying. I wish I had the strength to make the pain and tears stop.
I’m just really tired of life
Part of me is hoping I don't wake up in the morning, because all I'm expecting is loneliness and pain.
Can depression please just fuck off and leave my mother alone. She doesn't deserve this. She's the best mom anyone can ask for. I can't stand to hear her cry anymore I can't take it anymore it hurts too much. Why do things have to be like this why can't she just be okay. Depression can keep fucking me over for all I care but please can it just leave my mother alone.
Idk what to say.      Haven't had proper sleep for quite some time.      Going back to work from tomorrow for the company I despise these days. (Not easy for be to switch).      Doing things for people just because I offered help, they need it but I can't refuse because I have to maintain that "nice person" image. The help in offering is making me do a lot of things I'd not do. They'll stop needing my help in a few days, I'm thinking of limiting contact post that. Anyways I'm a disappointment to others how does one more person matter.      I'm broke, don't have money to gift family things they need but won't buy (family have money to buy it themselves but i like gifting things).        I'm useless, not living upto the expectations of anyone, not even mine, unable to study, exercise, work. Have constant thoughts of meeting ab accident which would kill me no matter how horrible the death be but not dragged. I don't want to be incapacitated and become a bigger burden.
Feeling lonely and guilty. I really am an awful person with very few redeeming qualities. I don't really have people to talk to so sometimes I look for help online but if someone who knows me doesn't like me or care about what I have to say, why would a stranger?   I'm not good at anything. I'm not likeable, and I've made terrible decisions. I really don't know how to feel any type of good about myself. I'm lucky for the little bit that I have. I can usually do things day by day but I had such a rough time at work yesterday that I'm dreading going back and I'm starting to spiral.
no one will read this and even if they do no one will care and even if they care they wont help so there is no point of sharing my thoughs :) :D
I can feel myself slipping back into a bad headspace again for no reason, it feels like I’m spiraling and idk what to do. I can barely even help myself, how can I even begin to start helping the people around me. I feel like such a burden.
My partner was exposed to covid on the day he was supposed to finally see me after a month of us being too busy to see eachother so its killing me because I'm so lonely without him I miss the affection and human contact I started a new stressful job but I have to quarantine because I'm getting really sick and i gotta test to make sure I don't have covid I've been so isolated this year and all I want is to feel normal and okay again my Ptsd isn't getting any better either its all so much to deal with alone
My mom stressed me out to tears again bringing up that damn orchestra again. She refuses to accept that I don’t want to do it and it is impossible for me to do it because I’m a theatre major and I literally have no time for it. The music majors already have no time to sleep, I will like kill myself if I start it. At least she agreed during the summer. She makes me regret ever starting violin. Last semester is my last time taking lessons. It’s not fun anymore all it brings is stress
I hurt myself today after learning I would be hired for a tenured track position after being a visiting assist prof as it was hinted to me earlier this year though Uni will be hiring TWO tenure-track professors next year.   My friends mom died from covid two days ago and her family was like my second family for many years.  Im mentally exhausted. I feel like I’m not heard and that I can’t express what’s on my mind, as if there’s something preventing me from uttering the words.   Im really tired. I’m afraid of sleeping so I can’t have a good night sleep. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just don’t know what to do
I feel so disgusted when someone uses my bed or my blanket or my pillow. My house is so dirty and disgusting, I feel repulsed by the floor, the carpets, the table, the chairs. I don't want to touch anything. My room, my bed, at least, feels like the only clean place. At last I can be comfortable. My parents used my blanket and now I don't even want to touch it anymore, I can't bring myself to go to bed and even the thought fills me with anger and disgust and I feel so frustrated. I feel like I've been waiting all day for this chance to recharge and now I have to spend it losing more and more battery in my anguish. It's such a pathetic thing too. So why do I feel so sickened by it?
[deleted]
I have no plans or anything. But man don’t I feel calm when I think about dying. Either by my own hand or God’s. It’s gonna happen, it might happen soon. I don’t know.   This life I was born into just wasn’t meant for me. And that’s okay. I don’t have to be here.
Not a day has passed since as long i can remember where i didn't felt like killing myself, but knowing i'm to much of a pussy to actually do it seen by how i already try to do it 3 times just this last year and failed to take the final leap which makes me hate myself even more. I simply cannot recall what it is like to feel like life isn't miserable and not wanting to just spend all my time either having dreamless sleep or getting blacked-out drunk.  Edit: I wrote it weird. I think it is better now.
My memory is getting worse and it's scaring me. Is this a symptom of depression or something else?
Whole day super exhausted, depressive thoughts, back pain. Cooking for my family, afterwards making food for my brother's family as well since parents will visit them tomorrow.   Afterwards just want to take a small nap. Will help with exhaustion, back pain and depressive thoughts. Setting timer to 20 minutes. Can't even sleep that long, mother comes back and wakes me for no reason cause I'm supposed to "go for a walk".   Someone waking me makes everything worse again. I'm constantly on guard anyways, I can't be "vulnerable" in any way, can't talk about any problems. I need so much energy just to defend myself all day. Even if I'm productive it doesn't protect me from being yelled at. And it fucks me up if parents are like "we make your life worse for no reason, we don't allow you a small break". Same for all the verbal stabs while they pass me.   The "help" of my parents is making me so much worse and last therapist didn't seem to believe me. This is such a psychopath thing. Imagine your school bully would show at your home and say "I _really_ care about you, you know?". And you just think "don't say anything that makes him angry".  Hiding in the bathroom again because it's the only room with a lock. Sometimes I actually went for a walk just to get away from things but rly no energy today. It isn't "selfcare" if you just do it to avoid more yelling.
I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but I really just wanna share my experience in the hope that it gives you guys some hope that things will be better.  Two months ago, I was constantly depressed, unmotivated, apathetic, and considered suicide.  Today, I am happy, motivated, and afraid of dying early because I want to live so much. I actually have to order some books to help me deal with my mortality haha  &#x200B;  P.S. This is absolutely not intended to flex on anyone. I know this sub is intended for those currently struggling with depression, but my intention to let you guys know that, **there is hope, there will be the light at the end of the dark, seemingly endless tunnel. Please give yourself a chance at living a happy life, by holding on right now.** I can definitely say that I am so grateful that my past self who was struggling with depression and finding the will to live, has managed to hold on long enough, so that I can find the light and come out of the rut, to start a happier life. It totally makes it worth it.
I thought I was doing pretty good, until this morning when I realized my roof is leaking and dripping into my kitchen and I just completely lost it. I’m tired and overwhelmed. I lost my dad when I was 26, I’m currently 31 single female and I pride myself on being strong and independent. I lost the only person that mattered most to me in the entire world. I took over the house, made necessary repairs, work hard to pay all my bills and take care of myself but this year has been tough and it seems I can’t catch a break and I realized that as water dripped down onto my head. I’m overwhelmed and exhausted. I try to beat back when life starts hammering but today I just feel like waving the white flag.
Basically being drug addicted and chasing all the distractions I can get because I cant deal with my life and when I talk to a therapist they cant deal with it either
Another holiday season shaping up. My work life which was at least tolerable has gone down the complete shitter. Personal life what the hell is that, the few friends I did have, haven’t heard from all of them in months. The only people that ever call or text is either work or family. I can’t remember the last time someone showed even an ounce of concern for me. Things ever so bad that you just get the point of numbness? Like if you acknowledge your feelings it’s like ripping open your chest
I dont want to keep going anymore. Everything just seems like a waiting room for the awful moments. I feel so alone with no one to talk to and no actual loved ones. I feel like such a weak fuck for not being able to go through this or to end it. I cant do anything right and straight up hate myself.i hate my appeareance, i hate my sexuality i hate who i am and If i had the option to be someone else i wouldnt think twice
I'm so fucking done with life. I feel like shit 24/7 with no relief
i'm so tired, i have nobody and my family is falling apart. my roommates want nothing to do with me, i spend every day too anxious to eat, too anxious to leave my room. im trying so fucking hard to keep going but depression is taking it all from me and i can't do anything about it. i don't enjoy anything anymore, I can't force myself to work anymore. i want it all to end
I tell myself that career success is not everything, that having a job and earning money is not everything, that it doesn't matter if I am not a success in the eyes of the world, that it doesn't matter if I die alone begging on the streets. But sometimes it is so hard to continue with this attitude that nothing matters.
At what point does it get better? I'm on meds. I've been through therapy. I had ECT as recently as two weeks ago. Why isn't anything working?
Online school has been killing me. I'm I'm 2nd year of uni and I don't know what the hell I'm doing with my life. I barely get myself out of bed, I have several assignments that are overdue and barely even started. I've tried talking to my profs. Some are understanding and give extensions and some don't really care. I can't do this. I've been crying my fucking eyes out in bed every couple nights. I'm scared.
I made my bed and I am sleeping on clean sheets.
Therapist when it's about improving your life: "think about what 'could be' in life...  ... but don't think about what _could be_ in life"  Me: _screaming starts again_
Anyone else at that point where they aren't even really sad anymore, or stressed, or angry, but just completely devoid of literally all emotion? I just don't even really feel anymore.
New member here. I was hospitalized with major depression for ten and a half days. My principal diagnosis upon discharge was depressive-type schizoaffective disorder, which sits just between full-blown schizophrenia and a mood disorder. I'm taking Risperdal for the bipolar symptoms, and Zoloft and Remeron for the depression.
Life fucking sucks, hoping some of you guys find a second light.
I feel broken. My mom died just before Covid hit the US. COPD took her. I haven’t cried more than a tear for the loss. I was addicted to oxy back then and was swiping them from her. I’ve since been clean of them but I’m not feeling much else. Except maybe anger. Not at my mom, just in general and maybe most towards my wife. 21 years with her and things just keep going more and more down the drain. Just started working again but am completely broke. Almost lost my home the other day and my kids will be getting NO Christmas this yeah at all. I’m to the point where it’s hard to not just leave and disappear. Not die but just go away and live in the streets.  I’d feel bad for my kids but I don’t know if I’m even any good for them to have around.   Yeah that’s where I’m at and it really only scratches the surface.
I’m new here. My depression has been all consuming recently. I cry a lot when I’m driving alone with out my kids in the car.   I’m a small business owner, and this last year my business has grown in a direction that I am not happy with. I live in constant panic, which is destroying my already fragile health. Everyone always tells me how amazing I’m doing and how successful I am, but I don’t feel that way. I view myself as a failure. I’m struggling, a lot.  I have formed a plan to shift my business into a direction I can be happier with. I have many loyal customers which helps give me the confidence that switching things up won’t end up with financial ruin for my family - something I didn’t see possible 6 months ago.  Second item I need to work on is my physical health. I have hypothyroidism and have been trying to ignore it. But this year has forced me to make some changes. I can feel that if don’t reduce stress and become more active, eat healthy and have a better mind set I will have a heart attack and dementia by the time I’m 60. My body hurts so much every day and the brain fog is debilitating. I’m starting to make small changes already - like not devouring half a tub of ice cream in bed to find some sort of comfort after an extremely hard and draining day, this is literally the only thing I look forward to some days. But I am hoping once my business shifts, I’ll have the time to focus on myself a little more and actually have the time to find a physical activity I can enjoy.  I’ve realized all the money in the world isn’t worth it if my stress and depression are out of control. Something needs to change, I can’t keep living like this. Every day is painful, physically and mentally.   At least I have a plan though. Wish me luck!
Just grabbing some food. Have not been taking good care of myself.
Keep replaying an incident which happened 18 years ago in my head. I feel I was manipulated and taken advantage of, and I can never let it go. I know that there is no light at the end of this tunnel.
I don't think anyone wants me around. It hurts a lot.
They said depression is about loneliness but mine isn’t.  Mine is like a big gaping wound in my chest. A void that doesn’t fill. It doesn’t get better when I’m socialising, being around friends and family. If my depression isn’t about loneliness then what’s the cause of it?   My therapist has been telling me that the cause doesn’t matter but I feel that finding the root cause could help me get better. What should I do if nothing helps and I feel so hopeless?
TW: suicidal ideation    My depression has returned with a vengeance. My doctor upped my meds but says we may have to change them if need be.   I feel like I’m starting all over again and it almost killed me last time. I don’t want to do this again. I’ve started obsessing about suicide again and feel so useless.  Trying so hard to take the advice of the doctor but he says stuff like “you don’t have to fix everything. Maybe just worry about this one thing.” I can’t stop worrying about “everything” and have absolutely no motivation to fix this “one thing.”  I know I should be happy for all the things I have but that’s what makes it worse. I just feel guilty. I’m lonely but don’t want ppl to feel sorry for me. Just useless to everyone.
I am just so tired of everything. I feel nothing and I want to keep it that way because it's too painful when I do feel. I don't want to think anymore.
As sad as this sounds my mom is the only family I have here. Even if she manipulates me for money I have no one else I will take whatever love I can get. Plus in a weird way I think she loves me. I just want to be loved and for someone to genuienly care for me. That is the main source of my depression. I feel so alone like I have so much responsibilities on my shoulders.
Need some help every day is the new worst day of my life.    Dogs don't even help anymore.
My sister has cancer. It doesn't feel real. Nothing about this year feels year. I feel like I'm experiencing extreme dissociation because it feels like I'm dead. I know all of this sounds crazy, and I'm not sure if anyone can understand. I've lost too many people this year, and I'm can't handle it.   Erika, I fucking love you. I care about you so much. I hope you're ok, but you're probably not.   Considering my sister, she's always been there. I can't imagine life without her.   Fuck this.
To lie awake late with fictional scenarios running through my head in an attempt to feel some happiness, or to let myself fall asleep so I can wake up on time and get stuff done tomorrow?
All I do is cry and breakdown. I just want to run away from everything. I sleep or avoid everything, I just want to be alone all the time.. I'm so tired of trying to get my life together. It's like something just always weighs me down. I try to pick up the pieces and build myself again and again but something always knocks it down. Sometimes the smallest of things.  I have been constantly failing in exams, my financial situation is not good at all, parents are always fighting.. I have become obese.. I try so hard to change but everytime something upsets the delicate balance and I tip to the wrong side.  From acing exams and playing nationals for squash to failing exams. My grades and game have brought me so much happiness even during hardest of times have been robbed from me. Everyday I wake up is a different battle I didn't sign up for. I'm exhausted and I feel like a failure. I'm so confused and I don't know how to fix it anymore. I'm surrounded by stubborn people who won't just relax a little and empathetic.  I just wish some miracle happens but do they? I am supposed to be able to change but I don't have energy left to constantly try and do better and I hate what I have become to let go and just relax.  What can I do?
Treating myself today to buying the new call of duty Cold War game
Anyone on here free to send me a message to talk please, feeling very lost and could do with advice
Finally hit me that I won’t be at my brothers wedding tomorrow because of things that are beyond my control. I can’t stop crying. Crying is an understatement for the flood that has been flowing from my eyes lately. Had someone who hardly knows me anymore more tell me I was depressed today... not that it’s not true... but hearing it out loud hurt me deeply. This year has been the worst of my life. Last week I couldn’t get out of bed for 4 days. Lately even breathing has been a hard decision. Hoping for better days is the only thing keeping my feet on the ground.
Treated myself to a holiday espresso drink at Starbucks
I did pretty poorly with Christmas gifts last year, dealing with uni and near the peak of my depression. This year I've graduated and my meds are working so I actually got a lot of gifts, some my family knows about since I had to ask for suggestions and also some surprises I was able to think of. I started wrapping early and it all looks really pretty and I'm proud of it. I left my family Christmas last year crying because I felt like I did so little while they did so much and I'm glad I'm not piling on the guilt anymore for something that was out of my control at the time. Really excited to exchange gifts tomorrow.
Have a happy holidays guys. Or at least as good of one as you can.    I'm home now for the first time in I guess 4 years. With my parents. They want me to move back in. It'd help with my inability to deal with stuff on my own.    It's always cold though. I feel tired. I guess I should go get some coffee.
I feel alone. My parents didn’t even try to act like a family and have us all sit in the same room together. They forget about me. Just like everyone else does. I feel very alien. I don’t know where I belong but somehow I feel uncomfortable being with my own parents. I wasn’t made for this world. I wish I was never brought into it.
No interest in Christmas anymore. Forced cheeriness, extra stress, facing family when I feel like shit, spending extra money...I could go on.
Nothing like spending Christmas Eve and Christmas in dangerous neighborhoods all night with a upset stomach, while everyone gets to stay home :') Merry fucking Christmas to me I guess
Sitting here, randomly scrolling Reddit, pondering spending all day tomorrow fighting a clogged sink. Finding out what few friends I have all lied about being up for gaming tonight because they had a match set up with others and decided to hide it from me (idk why, don't play that game). Awkward calls from relatives earlier. Watched some dude 360 his F150 into a snowbank down the block. Weird night.
I think I ruined Christmas. My mom always makes us sing these Christian songs with our relatives. We did it over a zoom call this year and I just couldn’t deal with it this time and stormed off and locked myself in my room. She started crying. Also I’m 23 and still live at home and feel like a failure. Many times when my feelings come to the surface like this bad things happen. You know how when you’re a kid and you cry no one takes it seriously and they just tell you to stop? I feel like that’s still happening.
On Jan 1, 2020, I deactivated my FB, and felt better, even though I lost touch with a lot of friends and classmates as a result, since some of them were only contactable via FB and Messenger. This coming NY, another app will go for the exact opposite reason. But I hope to be brave and stick with it and not get separation anxiety like I did when I tried to delete it before. I’ve also been working on something for about two weeks now that’s saddening but necessary. Come Jan 1, 2021, things will change.
im thinking of whats the point of me staying around.. i know no one who would miss me anyway. and if theyre hurt im gone then so be it. maybe they should have tried harder. all they do is just talk to me only when they need something from me
I came here often on my old account but I can't recall the password nor do I have the energy to figure it out. I am feeling so depressed. I don't know what to do. I am going to be 30 next month and haven't accomplished much. I have depression, anxiety, add, and I have to have some other learning disability because I take an eternity to learn everything. Nothing bas ever come easily. And here I am going from job to job working trying and failing. I have been the live in girlfriend with my husband since he was 22 and I was 19. We married 3 years ago and some of his family doesn't hate me. I'm childfree because I am so poor that I can't afford to get a house for myself let alone put a roof over my own head. Some days I want a baby and other days I know that I should never have them. I am so easily angered and I fear that I will hit my kids like my mother hit me. I am just so sad. My husband and I got shoved to a new state and I am sad here. I mean I got used to it but I hate the desert so much. I miss the green of plants and rain. Everything seems so dead here. The sunlight is nice when it isn't 120 F° out but I miss my medical insurance. I finally had an adult job in an office where I was barely getting much done compared to the one other person on my team but at least I got stuff done. I miss my old job. I miss going to college and bettering myself. There are no legitimate degrees out here under $5000. I was trying to go to school, a friend gave me the $4000 to go to school but my husband was bad with money and I never paid attention because I am so absent-minded all the time that I wound up having to use that money for bills. That was three years ago. I miss believing that I would make it somewhere in life. I feel like I will never make it that I will always just barely be getting by. I want to pay that friend back.
I never knew my family could become heartless... They laugh and made a joke about it...wow
Was miserably depressed. Then my *real* problems started. Who the f@uck suddenly loses knee function at 33 years young. What kind of luck is that. I feel so defeated. Not sure how I'm gonna handle this. Before this I'd been desperately researching ketamine/ECT/TMS, now I don't even know how I'd get to the appointments. fml
I forgive my mom and we have a stronger close mother daughter relationship now.
Today I was asked if I was paranoid or a schizophreniac.. it was the icing on the cake of a generally horrendous last few days.  One of my friends was being attacked online by a bunch of rude idiots all because I shared a post and they responded to it.  I should’ve defended their position but felt unable.. helpless even. My relatives are hounding me about my depressions and offering me their input on what I should be doing and what I’m doing wrong.  “No, don’t stay inside, you have to go outside to the park.. or the store.. or the mall.  It’ll make you feel 1000% better immediately.”  I suffer from depression and anxiety, even tonight on New Year’s Eve I couldn’t be in the room with my friends because they made me super anxious with the loudness.. how am I supposed to surround myself with strangers.. oh and you know.. the Covid-19 issue.  Lost two people this last week and a third one is in critical care right now because of it and I’m being told “just go outside!”    And then to top it off I get attacked by a stranger on the internet for mentioning that I have expierenced paranormal things.  It was my first time in a long time letting something about myself be known.. but it was met with ridicule... it made me feel shitty and that person will never know.. I’m feeling so tired and.. well, I’m just going to hit this button and hope tomorrow comes soon or never does
why do I feel like crying all the time I  can't stop this I feel like I'm always on the verge of breaking down. I feel nothing just anxious all the time. I'm unable to motivate myself to do something. I'm getting constant urges to hurt myself. I don't know what to do I'm too scared to get professional help I know I need it but i dont trust anyone. Please god just give me the courage to get the help I need. I'm getting suicidal dreams, cant even sleep properly man fuck everything. Wish I had someone to talk to I pushed away everyone I have no one to hear me wish I was a good friend to others wish i could be better I'm so pathetic
I know everyone is looking at 2021 like it's going to be a big turnaround... even I had that feeling a little, but I mostly just feel too broken to move forward. 2020 was by far the worst year of my life and I don't know if I even have the energy to try and fix it. I'm fucking exhausted.
Just tired. Tired of not being good enough. Tired of people telling me to do what makes happy, when all of the things that made me happy no longer do.  Tired of being a shell of the person I used to be.
I almost called him. But then I realized I don’t have anything to say to him. I just wanted to see if he would pick up...
I cried hard today. Sudden sadness hit me. I don’t understand why antidepressants don’t prevent me from crying or being sad. The hit makes me feel life is meaningless but I hanged in there although no one was there for me. I cried for half an hour and I passed out for an hour. Now I am going to shower and get ready for tomorrow’s work, although I still feel life is meaningless. Maybe tomorrow will be better
I've been doing so much better over the last couple weeks (even though I spent Christmas alone!), but of course whenever I start feeling \*too\* good I get worried and feel like it won't stick around... I know a huge part of the reason I felt so good is that I wasn't working, and now I'm back to work.  I can also feel myself getting sucked into a "wellness spiral"... I'm not sure what else to call it, but I've done this plenty of times before, where I finally start taking care of myself a little and then I feel so good about it that I start getting obsessive and carried away, and then I burn myself out, and then I'm back to square 1. REALLY need to figure out how to avoid that because I can already feel myself heading in that direction. I just want to be able to stick with a good habit for longer than a month or two!  But at least in the meantime, even if it's temporary, it feels really good. I bought a Peloton and have actually been using it and enjoying it. I cried at the end of a class yesterday and it felt amazing.
I am becoming depressed again, pandemic and new lockdown is only exacerbating my desire to remain in my PJ's and in bed, preferably asleep. I don't feel I am of any benefit to anyone, and I am scared to apply for new jobs for fear I won't be able to actually do them and I'll further disappoint people and myself. I hate how antidepressants make me feel and know that the only ones that work are terrible to come off. My usual coping mechanisms are limited due to lockdown.
Just had the realization that at some point recently, I'd unconsciously given up on making new friends. I don't have any close friends or people I'd be comfortable hanging out with recreationally, and for years I was really insecure about that, but sometime recently I stopped caring and stopped trying (not that younger me necessarily made a huge effort to begin with, but it was still something). I don't know how to feel about this. Part of me feels bad about it, but another part of me has just accepted that me ever really having friends seems unlikely
I remember describing the darkness to someone who I thought would sympathize and understand. I remember they told me never to bring it up again to anyone. For some reason that thought is paramount in my head tonight. I can't help but feel betrayed
I was born into a reasonably privileged family. Somewhere between middle class and upper middle class. Never lacked for anything. Even so, I had issues with my parents. Even so, I was not able to make anything out of myself. I did get a PhD and worked for almost 7 years after that, but after it all went kaput, I have been severely underemployed to unemployed. Makes me depressed, this lack of career.
i really regret how i handled my ex. i wish i was more empathetic and more communicative. i never really initiated contact with her. though it felt like she was trying to make me feel bad about everything.
Ok, where I'm at. Well w holidays it's a little tough. I uh neglected cleaning my house for a month maybe...possibly less. It's cluttered. Not like smelly or disgusting. Just empty toy boxes from Xmas. Grocery bags everywhere. Toys scattered. A mess really. I know I should clean but I don't have the motivation to. Also been sleeping in more. Till like 11am/12pm. Which angers my fiance since he works 12 hour shift and works hard only to come home to a messy house and me still sleeping. But I can't sleep at night. I stay up till, let's see what time is it now 12:15am. Ok so till midnight or later. I know when I'm in a slump but I cnt seem to get out if it w/o angering him. So it ends up him yelling and me crying my eyes out. All while wishing I was dead them feeling ashamed since I would NEVER leave my son w/o his mommy. So I cry harder and he doesn't care. So when he's leaving for work he says " I love you" I reply "ok" cuz I don't believe him. Well that angered him more. "If you push me away I'll push away as well." No I didn't want you to say that. Why would you say that. I cry harder again. Then he leaves. This happened yesterday. So that's where I am guys. Been together for 12 years... yep. I'm fine... not really. But I'll end up submitting like usual and just swallow my tongue. Well goodnight everyone.
I need to check into somewhere and talk to someone. I need some help.
Ever since my freshman year of Highschool I gave up, now being a freshman in college I realize that I can’t keep trying to better my life. I keep trying to be the perfect student, daughter, sister, whatever & it’s not working. One of my wishes this year was not to cry, & I just broke it. I’m tired. I’ve only lived because of my family. Now though, I don’t see a point. I don’t want to keep smiling & act like everything’s okay when it’s not. I’m studying as a pre-med student, but how the hell am I supposed to support others in the future if I can’t even do that for myself. I’m really at my breaking point this time & im scared lol.
I’m having a really shit day and I have no one with whom I can talk about it to without getting a million questions and unwanted advice. I just wanted to come here and say it’s shit, I feel shit and I don’t want to talk about it. Just acknowledge to someone other than myself that I hate this and I feel shit and don’t think I deserve it.
Been alright, but it's hard to deal with being a failure. I try not to care, but there's no denying it hurts from time to time.
Had a shitty entitled customer _climb over_ the locked gates of the _closed_ station 30 minutes ago, just to use the bank. Then acted like it was no big deal and that I was a stick in the fucking mud, because how _dare_ I do my job!  And now there's gunshots firing while I'm typing this. I fucking hate it here. I hate the ghetto. I'm hating the negative feelings I'm developing for a certain demographic, I hate how I have to live for fucking nasty ass green paper, I hate myself, I just want to go home or die
I wish someone loved me.
Ive been trying to find low cost therapy options, but the only services available in my area have a minimum 12 week wait list.   Im feeling very desperate and I dont know how I'm supposed to cope for 12 weeks on my own
I just tried to hang myself in my basement. I got it around my neck and tied to the rafters. Couldn't go through with it. I couldn't fucking do it.   Why, when I want to die so badly, can I not finish it?
I feel very disregarded.. it makes me want to cry
I took a shower today.
New. I'm looking for a space where I can post how I'm doing and (especially) whatever tiny good/productive things I've gotten done a few times a day. I want to try to support people as well, but I'm worried I won't make a good 'accountability partner' because I tend to flake on things a lot.   Is this sub good for that kind of thing? Or could anyone suggest other subs/websites/groups they've found helpful for doing this?
today i sat in bed for 5 hours, but when i finally had to get out of bed to help my mom make dinner i had a decent night. lots of things feel really overwhelming and the whole idea of living a life as an adult and all of my choices having an impact on my future is really scary esp bc it feels like depression is making so many of those decisions for me
Most of my waking hours are spent trying to distract myself from my feelings with games or drugs or food, but every now and then I imagine a little glimpse of what it's like to be a functional person; to feel loved and to reciprocate, to have friends, to have a shred of confidence in oneself. Those moments feel like being stabbed in the gut. I need harder drugs.
I feel in love with my best friend who's made it clear she never had and never will have romantic feelings for me. she claims we would be horrible for each other anyways, but I think I'm just blinded to it ig. all ik is I guess I love her (or something cuz wtf is love anyways) but have to endure never being with her romantically
I hate myself so much
First check-in. Starting college for the first time in a while on Wednesday, I am really nervous and anxious about it, even though it's just online courses- I've let depression and anxiety rule over my life for years, but I'm trying to take my life back. I'm scared that I won't try hard enough and fail, like I did in high school because of being suicidal back then. I'm doing much better these days, but I'm still far from being okay.

Having difficulty being productive. Just going to read my emails and get back to this comment later.  Alright for the next 2 hours if I procrastinate it's going to be on writing code. At least I'll say I did something today.  Fuck I hate myself. Why am I still awake? I'm not a kid. Staying up this late is dumb.
i fucking hate not being high. marijuana makes everything more bearable. even just a little. it gives reality this extra sheen. this extra spark. this ability to just experience and enjoy life in all it's forms down to even the most mundane. life becomes not just bearable, but fun. but it only lasts so long, and plummeting back to earth i go. back to the lonliness and misery and isolation.   when high i can just be alone and be totally 100% content with only having myself around as my own company. and why not! i'm fun when i'm high! everything is fun when i'm high! but then it ends and that warmth and safety that was there is gone now. i can't have those moments back. and the substance that i do get is from the generosity of others. i can't get more myself. even if i had the ability to it would be irresponsible of me to go on a multi-day weed bender since the longer it lasts the worse it will feel to come back to earth.  i'm back on earth after my first two-day bender and i feel awful. not in a "hangover" sort of way. weed doesn't do that to me. i feel awful in a way that i'm all too familiar with. i've always been like this. i've never not been like this. the only difference is that for a few days i got to experience a world worth living in. and now that i'm not back in that world anymore, and I can't go back for who knows how long, everything looks ever more bleaker. what even is the point if i can't live in that world permanently?
I can't work. Work defines a man. I am not a man, certainly not one a women would have sex with
I think I might be legitimately dying and I wonder if I care enough to do anything about it. Since the end of November I've been having a lot of trouble breathing. Family doctor and ER doctor couldn't figure it out. Next week I have an appointment with a pulmonologist. Maybe she can figure it out. Today I looked at multiple website's symptoms for emphysema. I have a lot of the symptoms but not all. As a pack a day smoker for 20+ years I won't be surprised.  If I'm diagnosed I wonder if I'll even care. If I'll even do anything about it. What's the point? Christ, I can barely stand life as it is. More living with depression and not seeing a way out.
Feels like life never give me any break. Anxiety back at it again. My head feels like about to explode. heaviness in my chest. I’m crying with no more tears I’m screaming without voices . . . And nobody cares.
Working up the motivation to finally try tms/ketamine/ect.. I know the insurance company is gonna fight me tooth and nail because our healthcare system is psychotic and inhumane, but I’m at least gonna give it a shot
Im just tired of the time and have no reason to get out of bed. Every day feels the same and i dont feel like a person. This doesnt feel like my regular depression this just feels like im stuck in a groundhog day scenario where i wake up and do nothing then repeat.
An ex-friend who always crowed about mental health awareness and treating neurodivergents like people said I was too depressed to be her friend : ( I've been trying the "Fake it till you make it" tactic of acting happier to feel happier, but that statement really just kinda shook me.
Went for a walk for the first time in two weeks. It felt good and I'm glad to have enough energy to do that. I've been dealing with exhaustion everyday and it often feels like I'm trapped in this body. On a good day when I'm not emotionally depressed, my body will just not have energy to respond and simple tasks feel monumental. When I try to do art I find myself struggling to keep my eyes open most of the time and can only get a little bit done. It's unbelievably frustrating. I've thought about consulting with the doctor but I hate the idea of the doctor telling me I need to get my sht together and I have no one to blame but myself for this exhaustion.
Fuck this suffering shit. I want to just have enough energy to have relationships, to have fun, and be happy. But no, I have to sit here in this dying world and bear through the storm of thoughts of suicide even if deep down I know none of this is fucking worth it. I don’t even care about being happy. I just want the suffering to end. By any means.
Another dull day on this shithole planet, thank god there are pizza and video games to justify existence.  /s
I don't know who to talk to. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. Recently I realized I may have a condition that effects my sex life... I haven't been properly diagnosed but the thought of getting that diagnosis and doing the treatment scares me... something so many people do and enjoy hurts me and it's killing my relationship. My boyfriend has been patient but lately it feels like he's becoming hopeless.   I'm so sick of this. Being depressed, being anxious, feeling unmotivated and wondering if I should just die because all I want to do is sleep. Wanting to do better and treat myself better but feeling like I don't deserve it.   I keep having thoughts about suicide- where I should do it, how I should do it. I'm just so tired. I don't want to deal with life anymore, I just want to sleep.
My wife left me in August. We’re wrapping up amicable divorce where we split our things and asked nothing if each other financially. Considering the state of marriage you could say I got out of it with little to no lasting damage financially and materially, but I’ve fallen into a massive depression.   More so due to the bigger concepts rather than the loss of my partner. “Will I ever get to start a family now?”, “this was hard enough to earn her love, can I ever do it again?”, “one more rejection and I’m throwing in the towel”; you get the idea.   I’ve been seeing an MD for over ten years so I am being monitored and we talk weekly now, but nothing he’s trying prescription wise had made a dent and other then showing up for work and doing my job well I have no desire to do anything I love. It’s emotionally painful just to do sometime I enjoy and I feel no better for it.  Anyway, long time lurker, I’m sorry I haven’t participated in the past, but I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest.
22 and living in Norway. I can't pinpoint exactly when this started to happen but im pretty sure it was right before summer last year. It was as if the fire i had about life inside me just suddenly vanished. I think most of it comes from constant realization that the privileged and well protected bubble i live in does not mirror the disheartening situations and problems we are surrounded by around the globe which will inevitabely impact us all in some shape or form. Climate change, divide, inequality, preventable deaths from covid and just a foul stench of greed and individualism that I witness through the web on a daily basis has completely thrown my mind and heart in a state of emptiness. Constantly tired, unconscious, unfulfilled and just longing for some sort of reasoning behind why to continue trying to live. I have everything one could ask for from money, lover, friends, family but yet i still feel no emotional attachment to the world and its content. Its as if with this virus and the constant exposure to the outcries about the worlds problems on social media have just dismantled my ability to live. The worst is that my insecurities have grown with the inclusion of being forgetful about the simplest of things, such as what day it is, struggling to solve everyday tasks and work related problems and the worst is the growing inability to express myself. I want to believe there is light at the end of the tunnel, but as i keep on learning and reflecting about the direction we as human beings are heading towards with our growing life-threatning problems, I just cant be heartless enough to leave my children and the after to continue living in such a cruel world. I just want to erase my knowledge so i can live care-free and in ignorance again. Now im just a doomer.
They say you ought to be thankful. Today I am thankful for the heated bathroom floor I've collapsed on.
My mum's fiancee seems to have cut me out after I told my mum how I felt about my childhood and its impact on my depression. Not that her fiancee was even present then but I guess she took offence to me opening up to my mum. I spent two years saving up to fund their honeymoon so they can travel to the country I live in together. I never told them, but I know they planned to come here and I wanted to surprise them... my mum seems normal when I text her but I don't feel like I will be truly welcome at "home" again.
[One of my first posts here, but I did things. Im wore out but feel a little better ](https://i.imgur.com/XyxHbW5.jpg)
I’m tired all the time and I can’t sleep enough when I do sleep.  I’m scared my SAD is coming back full-send this year, after already going through enough I can feel the hormonal imbalances taking control of me.
Got laid off yesterday from a company I loved. Hurts a lot, feels like I just got dumped. Life just likes to go up and then back down.
Being shown kindness or disdain hurt in the same way right now. I don't know why I just can't stop crying
The only reason I can't seriously consider ending my life right now is because my apartment is  a disaster and I really need to clean it...I'd be embarrassed to be discovered in this pig sty.
I made a big fucking mistake at work and now I’m stuck being even more miserable. I’m such an asshole and ruin what few decent things I do have.
I want to step off this ride. I'm ready to be "normal". Whatever that is anymore. But my head never shuts up. There's always something wrong. How am I supposed to get it to stop? I want off.
My spouse told me they think I'll be struggling forever. That I'm not strong enough to convince myself to be ok.
I feel like my existence is nothing but obstacles. Having depression, anxiety, and ADHD, I feel like I'm just nothing but mental illness. Every single aspect of my life is affected by at least one if not all of them. Every aspect of who I am and what I do comes from them too. I just don't feel like a person, just like some sort of glitch trying to function properly despite that fact that that'll never be possible because I'm defective beyond repair. And my skin gets so dry and I get super hot so easily and my hands shake so much, it's like I'm nothing but problems. I don't even know who or what I am at this point, I feel like nothing. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore. I hate life so much. I hate everything so much. I just want to be okay with who I am but I'm just not.
God please help me it’s nights like these where I’m alone listening to my thoughts and music I worry until I can’t take it anymore and think about how better it would be to be dead and not have to deal with life what do I do
Life has been really hard during the past few weeks, and especially the past few days. My anxiety has been really impacting me, to the point of missing sleep for a number of days I even lost track of.  I came to realize the hard way (again) that I just am not cut out for friendship as most people intend it. I continue to make this mistake to try, only to find myself in the same dark place every time.   I am forever going to consider myself extremely lucky to have a significant other and one single friend (though I can't talk about everything with them), considering how impossible it seems for me to connect with other human beings without getting hurt, otherwise.  I am back to picking up the pieces. It feels so familiar, by now. I feel so alone and I feel terribly guilty for feeling it given I do have two people who genuinely care about me. It's complicated.
Why is everything so hard for me ? Why am I so weak ? Why cant i do anything properly ? i hate myself so much
When I told my therapist I wasn't sure what the things I want to do or my goals are - my therapist said I am a "parentified child". She is right 😥 I have been taking care of so many responsibilities for my parents since I was a kid and continue to.. So much I don't have time to think of my own goals or motivations for anything. Sometimes I struggle knowing what to do most days other than knowing I have to eat at some point. Is it normal to know what you want to do? I've struggled with this for a long time. Often I would just throw myself into things in order to find feeling or passion.
Why is it that people love me when they meet me and I can feel them liking me less and less as they get to know me? I’m on vacation and haven’t talked to anyone in 8 days now. I have no friends. Everyone gave up on me. It hurts so much and the worst part is I’m trying so hard but nothing works. I don’t want to try anymore. I don’t want to keep getting hurt. I don’t want to exist.
I don’t sleep at normal hours anymore. It is currently 4:21am where I am and I’m yet to sleep. I don’t think I will, to be honest. Too much stuff in my head. Honestly though, apart from the sleep thing, I’m coasting along just fine.

I'm losing it right now. im not ok, im not coping. i feel like im building a sandcastle on the waters edge. it's all for nothing.o dont have anyone to talj to and even if i did i dont know what to say. I'm just so tired
Wave of depression hit so hard this weekend. Don’t want to go to work tmrw but would feel bad bc we’re busy and that would put us behind. But i just don’t feel the energy to do anything anymore.
I don't know what's happening I just cant stop  crying i want to cry and scream so bad right  now. I cant explain what im feeling
I feel so bad. Everyone here has actual problems. I’m privileged but lazy and unmotivated. I’m doing poorly in college. What is wrong with me
I think I'm wrecking my livelihood permanently. I know I should do something about it. But I don't even really want to... I'm not even sure I can. It's so hard to "do" anything at all. I'm like a barely functioning human being, not willing to shut off the engine by killing myself but also not willing to fix anything, instead just coasting slowly along as everything breaks down inside me and around me. I know the basic steps that would probably solve this: see a psychiatrist, see a therapist, start taking anti-depressants, talk to a psychiatrist about taking ADHD meds. But those steps seem impossible... I can barely do anything outside the very basics needed to survive (and barely even that). I just want to fade away peacefully. I want to have never existed in the first place.  I hurt myself intentionally for the first time today. In an extremely minor way--so minor you wouldn't call it "hurting yourself" if I described it to you, and you'd never see it physically. Still felt like a bad step. I don't even know why I did it... I guess I'm frustrated at my combination of apathy and unwillingness to die? Or maybe I want to prove to myself that I have a real problem even though I'm not attempting suicide? Who fucking knows.  EDIT: Also, I really love being told I'm doing "unquestionably better" by people who bullshit with me for like 20 min every other week. You definitely know enough about the inside of my brain to say that, yep. I'm definitely telling you all the things I'm feeling or everything going on in my life, there's no way there are any gaps in your knowledge. Or maybe I just know you wouldn't be able to deal with the full burden, so I don't go about trying to prove that I am absolutely miserable every time you say this dumbass shit. Few things make me mad nowadays because I know I'm the one to blame for all my problems, but hearing that "you're feeling better even though you think you feel worse" shit definitely gets me angry.
Running up the walls. All this manipulation by my family and all this "programming" inside me I can't rip out. Hey but they only mean so well!   Having reached levels of being pathetic other people can't imagine. It's so laughable when professionals say "oh people with anxiety/depression may retreat from society" well maybe it's just that nobody wants to have anything to do with me.
It's not like I dont want to do anything...I really want to do things i like i want to get better.  i want to feel better. But I just cant man whats wrong with me.
I'm a shitty person. I work a job I dread most of the time but there's no other job that won't be like that. I need a break in between jobs which risks being unemployed for months, a year, especially now. Just being tired and stressed all time, sedentary and alone until I die in middle age. I don't have the energy to work 10+ hours a day, cook healthy meals, work out, all that shit, be positive all day, etc.
I'm fucking done. The only way people will understand is if they suffer from this too (and I hope they will) . People should shut the fuck up if they don't have any idea about something (in this case, mental illness).
I moved back to my hometown and i lie to everybody that i have alot of friends here. In reality they are Tinder hookups (we have no restrictions here) because i need just  someone to touch me but im so numb so i dont need anything serious because whats the point i can't even feel emotions.   I don't go to therapy anymore because at my last town they messed up and couldnt send one paper so i could have gotten benefits. Now i have just been barely eating because they messed my finances.   So i dont care anymore and havent contacted a therapist here in my hometown.  I just literally dont care anymore about anything

A research paper I helped write was just published, I'm a week ahead on my homework, and it's my birthday on Monday. I should be ecstatic but all I've done this afternoon is bummed on my bed and now I'm bumming on the couch with a beer and a distinct lack of attention to the TV with hockey on. I wish I could just feel good about my accomplishments...   I want to talk to someone about this but I always end up feeling like I'm wasting my psychiatrist's time because I inevitably end up having a good day on the day of my appointment and I'm not introspective enough to remember and talk about the times I'm not well.
I am having a tough time tonight. I think my boyfriend of 3 years has fallen out of love with me. I am disappointed in who I am. I don’t feel like I’m contributing to society much. I’m not in physical or mental harm. I value life. I just feel very selfish and unable to be anyone but the qualities he sees in me.
I don't think I will ever be happy.
Almost all I feel is fear and anxiety
I'm feeling very annoyed, angry at myself today. Weight pushing down on my chest. It’s getting hard to breathe. Letting out deep sighs.
Was ok in the morning but that has changed to sadness because of triggers.Hope everyone else doing better then I am.
First time in my life I don't even want to be awake.
I eat and am lazy and get drunk because I hate myself. And I hate myself because i eat and am lazy and get drunk.   When do I just get to die?
I'm a fucking pussy cant even cut my self properly i hate myself so much I want to kill myself please I don't want to live anymore
Is being young an age or a mindset? Both?  What if you're young but don't feel that way? What if you can't relate to other young people? What if you worry too much? What if you're missing out all the key experiences, all the milestones? What if you're so much behind in emotional development?  Just feels like I've never been young.
I suck at art no matter how hard I try. I can’t do it. I’m such a pussy for crying. I hate it I want to die fuck fuck fuck
I'm not doing anything today. Just need to be consciously writing down my thoughts.
I don’t understand why no one wants to hang out with me. I’ve been texting friends and my boyfriend telling them to do something, just watch a movie or talk, but they always end up rejecting or canceling. I know people are busy, but then I see them posting pictures with other friends and it just breaks my heart. It happens every single time. Why no one wants to hang out with me? I always try my best to plan something nice and funny, buy food that they like and stuff like that, and still they always have something more important to do. I’m so tired, I really want to be around people and have fun for a while.
still no access to actual therapy but still trying to do CBT worksheets and things because it's what everyone recommends and apparently it's the only kind of therapy that actually helps depression (or so I've been told).  and I know it's like a miracle for some people. I wish it could be the same for me. I'm honestly trying but getting nowhere. CBT honestly just feels like gaslighting myself into believing that nothing I experience is real, that nothing harmful has ever happened to me, that all my thoughts and impressions are delusional, that I made it all up.  which of course is what I've been told all my life by the people who hurt me or covered for the people who hurt me - "you're too sensitive," "it wasn't that bad," "they didn't mean it that way," etc. never in my life has anyone believed me. which I guess means I probably really am crazy.  there's just no point. I have a bad brain and I can't fix it. I just want to go away forever.
I basically gave myself serious depression by going against my doctor's advice and Its entirely my fault.  I knew it was risky. My doctor had warned me. I played guinea pig with my brain and he warned me not to. I'm manic depressive and he warned me treating ADHD with stimulants is dangerous. I went around and him and found another doctor and convinced him to prescribe to me. I ended up having a 2.5 hour long panic attack after my last dose and after quitting, I felt awful and now I feel really depressed. I don't know how long I'll be depressed, but it may last a while since I was on a stimulant for 5 whole days.   But what gets me the most was my hubris in disregarding my psych's advice and doing what I wanted. I feel like such a fool. Before this, my meds worked so well I didn't have any symptoms. I'd forgotten how bad depression and anxiety can be. Now I'm depressed and get random anxiety. I'm worried I've permanantly made my condition worse. I need this brain for the rest of my life. I brought this upon myself and I feel so dumb.
Will have to sort of host a meeting at work tomorrow, very nervous. Hate this so much. The older I get I don't get any more comfortable or less anxious about these sorts of things. It's almost like I'm still in highschool.
I never really lived without depression, it just became less over the past few years, but right now I'm back at rock bottom and WOW I totally forgot how bad it used to be.
embarrassing, petty vent: tomorrow is my birthday. which I know isn't a big deal, because I'm an adult. I've never made a big deal out of it and never wanted to (I had one birthday party when I turned 5 and never again after that) - I just always kind of hoped someone would remember and wish me a happy one.  anyway. I was planning to have dinner with my family tomorrow night. nothing fancy, just dinner at home. and I guess I was kind of looking forward to it. but today, my mom told me I have to reschedule so it would be more convenient for my sister (who works part time during the day) and her fiancé (who is currently unemployed, through no fault of his own) to attend.  two years ago, the only birthday gift I received was a card that my mom bought 20 minutes before she gave it to me, using my debit card. last year, my family canceled our plans together at the last minute and made separate plans that did not include me because they were punishing me for moving out 6 months before. and this year, I have to reschedule my "birthday dinner" so it's more convenient for my sister.  at this point, I'd rather not have dinner together at all. but that seems petty. I don't know. I'm too old to care about this stuff, but it still hurts. I want to move past it all.
I haven't given up fighting it, but I ran out of hope for living a decent life a long time ago. Still see my therapist and psychiatrist, I guess because I hate the thought of giving up. I don't put any effort into getting better though... I don't want to die, but I don't see a future for myself that doesn't end in suicide.
part of me hoped today would be different. a good day. I tried. honestly I'm trying as hard as I can. so much is out of my control. beyond my ability to fix or change. which I know sounds like I'm making excuses. but I'm doing as much as I can on my own. it just isn't enough. nothing I do is ever good enough.
There was a point in my life where I decided I would end my life after my parents died and that thought hasn’t really gone away for about 2 years now. I have some good friends, but talking about it doesn’t seem to help, and when I think about my life being over I honestly just feel better.
Last night, I wrote a to-do list for things I need to do at work today—things I should have done ages ago and are now catching up to me and biting me in the butt. Not everything is on it, and I can’t seem to push myself to even start on the first item. I’ve just been sitting here staring at the clock, my head completely void of any thoughts other than “why can’t I think?” and “why can’t I just do it?” The last item on my list that I wrote is “sink into the floor and evaporate.” And that’s just as unlikely to happen as everything else on the list it seems...
I'm technically on vacation this week, but I've been working remotely every day, because the work has to get done and there's no one to cover for me. this is work I won't be compensated for and time I won't get back.  and things keep going wrong. like they always do. I've been having nightmares about work. last night I dreamed that someone euthanized me like an animal because of a mistake I made, and in the dream, I felt like I deserved it. still feel that way.  I don't understand why I can't have one thing - just one thing in the world - go the way it's supposed to. it's just disaster after disaster, with no help and no relief. I'm so tired.
I have intense sadness over the fact that my ex-wife (who left me over a year ago) did something to her self which resulted in permanent damage/disability. I am beside myself with sadness for her. I can almost physically feel her pain and I am heartsick over it. I still love her, see.
I feel so sad deep inside. I’m so scared . I keep thinking to myself I lost everybody . My whole family stopped talking to me . My best friends stopped talking to me. I feel as if I can’t take it anymore . I’m getting evicted . Everything has been so hard on me lately and going downhill that I’m so scared to tell anyone in the fear of pushing them away. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. Is everyone giving up on me . I know I have to hide my sadness From everyone. I can’t eat. I feel like ive been losing so much weight . I feel like I can’t do normal things anymore. I laugh to take the pain away , I’m always on the verge of tears. I isolate and suffer myself in silence .
I have cried myself to sleep for six straight days, with many more in counting... the pain in my heart is beyond unbearable.
I'm quite concerned about what will happen after my parents die. Will I be able to manage my life? How will I deal with the emotions that will arise after their passing? I'm single with no kids and no SO so I need to deal with this alone.
Hi strangers, I feel lost 😔 I have a job and is not bad regular job and just started a new career on IT but I do not know why I feel this way 😔I have lost all motivation, I try to concentrate to study even tried one of those apps to regulate the use of your phone since I get distracted easily but I just get lost on my mind, I feel alone and sad and pathetic.
I can feel myself starting to spiral. My heart beats too fast for my lungs to breathe.
When I told my friend I was depressed, he kept asking what my problem was, and I couldnt say because I dont know.
Up late at night fighting hard not to spiral. I can feel it slipping through tho and can only refresh Twitter so many times before there’s no new tweets to distract you...
I never thought I would miss college but goddamn things are sucking for me right now two months after graduation. Turns out I was just using school as a distraction from what a fucking loser I am and how shit my life is this whole time. I hate this, I hate me.
I really feel awful, my life is getting worse each day, and I dont know what to do about it  Every decision I make is bad, and I dont have the energy to deal with the consequences, I'm an adult and everything but I just wish I wasn't here with responsiblities and tasks and being a burden to everyone  I wish the things I did were meaningful, leading a way forward, out of this despair but everything I do is messed up. I wish I could apologize for existing, I wish I could at least be of help.
I am not doing well. I feel empty and without happiness. I feel flawed at my very core. Most of all I am confused to why I feel this way. It scares me that I feel so bad without any reason. can’t I just be normal? Why can’t I just be content? I wish I could take better care of myself.
Whenever someone talks to me, all I can hear in my head how every single shit they say is a lie. Nothing they say and do is real. They're just stupid enough to believe it is.  I can't wait to disappear from everyone else I knew in my life. I had enough of these illusions.
Once again, another Sunday night which I have anxiety because of the workweek ahead. What's the point of having a weekend if it will only go by fast? Even if it doesn't seem it at a given moment, overall it's too brief. I wish I can have a job where it's freelance and I can do my own hours at my own time. No, I have to work for crappy bosses and management for little pay. Why should I see myself as exceptional in that way?  Also second guessing my graduate program, which has been at the back of my mind but becoming a bit more inevitable. It doesn't seem like what I had thought I signed up for, which still doesn't say too much. Plus I might not be cut out for it anyway. The thing is that my undergrad doesn't really mount much unless I have good connections, which is another thing that I dread and not cut out for to try 'networking'. Even if I did and sort of had, I still get looked down and rejected in some form either way. I'm used to being looked down on. One of the consistent things that has ever went on throughout my life.  I went from being somewhat outgoing to now depressed and trying not to go into a 'dark place'. Things go wrong but I do the same thing to just merely exist and somehow expect a different result. What else can I do?
Therapy is fucking wrecking me. When they act like "ooh, you're such a nice young person who just feels kinda uncomfortable in some situations".  And I don't know how to do physical contact. Or look other people in the eyes. Or have actual conversations. Or not be exhausted for days after every social interactions.   I have more in common with some autistic people than with healthy people, and I don't mean that as an insult but that's just how it is.
hey everyone. i never know where else to go when i feel like this so i guess im here.   it even feels hard to open up on reddit. i dont think i can type whats been going on so i guess ill just say i hope everyone feels better than they did yesterday. im struggling to find the strength to take a shower, im so tired. but i hope you guys make some achievements today
It is so peaceful at night...all alone  by myself, just some music playing.
I feel like I come to work just to cry everyday in office. Good thing I'm alone.Thought yesterday was a sort of productive (just cause I did like 2 productive thing) but end of the day realising I'm still letting things slip.  Took a week off previously but evidently it didn't made much of a difference. I'm still doing disappointing things. Times like this are when I really hate that I can still function on a daily basis. Fuck everything.
Today I contemplated suicide again. Today I’ve hurt a person whom I’ve claimed to admire all because of my pain I’m feeling. This time my thoughts hit harder then most times. I’m afraid. Current Sitting in the small Chaplin at my local hospital before the start of my shift. It’s hard not to cry. I promised myself I wouldn’t cry at work. I have a fake smile to keep up once on the floor it won’t be believable if it’s accompanied with puffy red eyes. Tonight I am afraid that I won’t be successful to help another heal due to my own pain. I’m afraid.
I hurt somebody I love. Simply.
Been struggling hard all day today at work, would rather just have sat in the dark and quite. Got home and don't waste to see or do anything, taken a sleeping pill and hopefully ill go to sleep listening to some true crime audiobook. Atleats when I wake up tomorrow another day is over and another begins.
Every once in a while. A freind from work will say he needs a ride home. So, me and him will go on a London drive before I drop him off. Me and him talk back and forth about how we both have pretty crappy lifes. The other day, he told me his sister went to a therapist and was diagnosed with depression. Although, when he asked if he could go, his parent told him no and acted like he couldnt be depressed. My depression is only getting worse. Out of nowhere I decided that i wanted to watch who use to be my favorite youtuber. I chose to watch "Doki Doki literature club" by pewdiepie. Spoilers for that game by the way. You've been warned. In the game the main character best freind is severely depressed. In the end, she kills herself. Its unstoppable unless you mod the game. Not sure why, but ever since I saw that, I cant get it off my mind. It's so horrible how it happens she hangs herself, but you can tell she changed her mind in the middle of it, cause she has blood under her nails and on her neck. Indicating that she tried to escape. When I see all of that, I can only think that I'm so similar to her. I dont think I could hang my self, but i do have a variety of guns and weapons. I know I'm not going to do anything, but I honestly cant stop myself from pondering. Anyway, sorry for the long post. I hope everyone's day is getting better.
So i really just have no one to talk to so i figured id make a post ive been struggling so badly as of late when i was 11 i started staying at a ski area in my hometown turns out the owner was a pedophile and raped me for years the sad part is there were so many times i felt bad for him when i was younger i would want to go hangout with a friend and he would guilt trip me and say how he wanted to have dinner and coffee or shit like that and would put this look on his face that would make me feel bad and most of the time i would end up staying, this went on until i was 17 and he finally went to jail because a guy who went through the same thing i did, at the time was in his mid twenties saw me with him at dunken donuts and started the process of pressing charges a year later he was in jail im 29 and until 2 years ago i couldnt even talk about this at all, i did drugs for most of my teens and mid twenties because i think i blame myself for not saying something to someone or stopping him from raping me but he was like a 8th degree black belt in martial arts i believe moi tia and others and he was in his 50s so obviously there wasnt much i could have done in the terms of stopping him so i just laid there staring at the wall wishing it would end and now i have this depression that never ends its like im living in hell i hate myself and if i didnt have a mother who loved me and a son who it would destroy if i was dead tomorrow i would hang myself right now gladly i was doing better when i started dating my ex 3.5 years ago and then i relapsed and started using again and fucked the entire relationship up because thats what happens when you do drugs you become miserable and iritable the depression also causes those things so it got worse and she started hating me i guess she was my bestfriend for 8 years before we started dating and then we were together 2 years i had decided i was getting clean because i could tell it was taking a tole on her so i started going to the clinic and got clean i thought things were getting better i truly did and the next thing i knew she said she was going to her dads and never came back here we are a year and a half later and she wont even talk to me at all so now i have no friends because either they were drug addicts and fucked me over or they fucked me over or they are drug addicts so i dont talk to them so i can stay clean im not sure why i have even stayed clean though because whats the point if i just sit here everyday sitting here in a living hell depressed and then at night its twice as bad and all i can think about is how much better off i would be if i was dead litterally i hate myself for destroying my sons childhood because now hes living with my mom because i cant function the girl he was calling mommy is gone after telling him she would never go anywhere because i fucked that up to im sitting here with tears just pouring down my face as i write this pitiful story that is this hell i used to call a life idk what to do anymore i just want to die i loved her to death im supposed to be pressing charges on the guy who destroyed my entire life but i thought my ex was going to be here for support and now shes gone and every day it gets closer to when the detectives or district attorney may call and say we are ready to prosecute him you need to come to court my anxiety and depression just gets worse i have no one to talk to anymore my ex was my bestfriend i thought she was my soulmate i thought we were going to get married and have kids and a family and now im just all alone with this weight that feels like the entire world on my shoulders i feel lost and alone constantly but even when im around people i still just feel all alone my mother is on me about getting a job and getting my son back and i cant even take care of myself she has no clue how lucky she is that im not dead right now and i try to tell her how depressed i am and she doesnt get it she says i understand life kicked you while you were down already but you need to get up and keep going little does she know how badly i would love to never feel this way again and magically be better but i cant do that i barely shower i barely eat or get out of bed because i cant function right because im so depressed i used to like playing video games and i cant even get myself to do that half the time because i just cant make myself want to i know it would probably help alittle but i just cant make myself do it idk if any of this makes sense to any of you at all but im just lost i dont know what to do and i feel like i have the weight of the whole world on my shoulders just crushing me into the ground everyday i just want the pain to end i wish i could look in the mirror and like what i see but as of today i dont like myself at all in fact i hate myself for ruining my entire life my family my sons childhood idk what to do anymore i would hang myself right now if it wouldnt kill my mom son and brother idk what to do anymore... im beyond lost and i feel so alone😭😭💔
This morning as I am getting off of work the thoughts are back to haunt me. I’ll get over him I tell myself. Like all who left and abandon me when I needed them the most. I’ll get over him. I created the being I fell for. I don’t like it when I am force to compare myself to the lady he moved on to. Perhaps she is better then me. Perhaps she is kinder then I can ever be to him. She is prettier then me. Who stops to ever look at me as beautiful. No one. Maybe that’s what he likes about her. He defended her without hesitation but I understand I was nothing to him to begin with. I was a passing enjoyment. I have to accept the pain I’ve created. None of my feelings for him was his doing. After all he was only doing what guys does best flirt and move on. I’m the stupid one created this perfect being. I’m the stupid one who fell. When will I learn? When will I protect my heart better from this world? When will I value myself as someone who is important?    To you; thank you for abandoning me when I needed you most. You left me in tears broken and scared to love another but I understand I said some mean things that I wish I never said. I hurt you with my words because I was in pain. Baby you abandoned me several time when I needed you the most. You didn’t have to love me I just wanted you to know that I was there. I wasn’t invisible. I wanted you to know that I was gonna love you regardless if you didn’t return it back. It hurt me knowing u had many girls to choose from. You made me feel invisible.  and now you left me cold and abandon. I understand I’m not important I have never been important in anyone’s eyes. My feelings were real. It was all real. I’ve lost you I only have myself to blame.

So many times during a day, I think: what might have been? I think of the opportunities I wasted and I shake my head.
I’m losing so much hair to stress
Just checking in. Every day I promise I'll do better the next. But I never do.   I think I'll just brush my teeth for now and pee. Wasted another day.
Today was worse than yesterday and tomorrow won’t be better.
I am needy and I want validation from someone else.   So of course that’s something nobody finds attractive.   It’s a loop.
I am watching way too many asmr facial videos to calm myself down. I've been job searching and interviewing. The entire process sucks. I've probably posted the same comment here before. Trying to cheer myself up
10 months ago we started a new decade. Many of us loudly proclaimed it would be better. A great year! Maybe a great 10 years! A fresh start!   This year sucked. I failed everything. I put in effort but the constant rejection is too much.   I want to turn it around for October but my motivation is fleeting. Im not well disclplined. Everything is so hard.
Well, today was the day, my favorite jidol Nijika graduated. I expected but it’s a lie if I said it didn’t hurt. I want to cry but I have class today so I’ll wait until tonight to let it out. I just have to power through it. It might be stupid to others but she really got me through tough days, idk, I just wish her the best
People get tired of me, everyone is leaving, They forget so easily, why can't I?
I did bad on my presentation, my professor stopped me before I could finish, I was so embarrassed, he thought I didn’t understand it, I did, the class tried to distract him, I almost started crying in class, I did as soon as I left though, fml
Growing up like "Displaying emotions is not allowed. Having interests is not allowed. Don't consume any resources. Don't bother anyone with your existence."
It hurts to be in pain. I wanna be dead to stop the pain. Gaping hole in my chest, eating through my soul. I’ve been having visions of myself jumping from a high rise building.  Anyone here with really bad suicidal ideation? I don’t know what to do when the urge to die consumes me. I’ve been sleeping a lot to escape from these feelings.
I wish i could work on myself and work on my looks as im constantly depressed by how i look and then ill be too lazy to not even buy a new pair of shoes which i need so badly ....sometimes i just dont care how i look bcz i dnt think anything matters in this world we are all gonna die ....but i really want to be better ...ill work on it really
Next month will be officially a year of choking through whatever I call this pathetic life. And soon after that it’ll be a year of meds and therapy.  Therapy and meds help but at the same time I feel I haven’t moved. A year of money spent on therapy and it feels like as soon as I stop I’m just going to be exactly where I started. Thank god I’m in a country where I don’t need to pay for my meds or I’d be really fucked.  What a waste of money. As if throwing money at the problem is going to solve anything.
I should not exist.

I feel like I'm living a life I wasn't cut out for. Like I've been plonked in this massive network of people but I have never felt so alone. Had thoughts today that maybe my kids would be better off without me and it scared me
I had a breakdown yesterday. But now I'm feeling better. But before, whenever I had a breakdown, my mind would be really bad for days, even weeks. It's actually nice to be in a better place. And it's nice to acknowledge that.
i feel sick i feel really sick  sometimes i really can't believe that there is a way out of this  sometimes i really can't believe that i don't deserve to suffer  i can't stop feeling hopeless i can't stop panicking
I’m cold, I’m alone I want a hug, but I truly have no one. God I want out this hurts so bad. I feel gross and unlovable and I just want to crawl in my mamas bed and let her rub my back and tell me everything will be ok.
House is so insane. Parents yell at me all the time. I'm super dysfunctional while trying to hide it the best I can, because they thought me all my life if you show any sign of weakness they will use that against you, now you got two problems instead of one. They say "it's just an offer!1" but if you don't do what they will hate you for days.   I'm so in fucking shambles. Two of the worst things for me are 1, making phone calls and 2, "lol parents did it for you and signed you up for something without asking, hf". Feeling super stressed because of the second one, having so many bad memories about it. Was especially fun in the past when I couldn't leave the house without throwing up and carefuly and to monitor my body 24/7 so someone dragging me somewhere was a total loss of control for me and so much pain and stress. Happy memories.   Being super dysfunctional and everyone is like "what do you say, you're not able to do that? You're 22, you're supposed to do that by now lol". Oh you need an internship for college? No worries, how about parents pick out a phone number of the biggest and most important cultural institution around and you just call them. Me trying to deal with fear of parents and fear of everyone else doing that cause it's. expected. of. me. Only to have the person o nthe other end telling me wtf I want, this isn't the right number to call them, how do I fucking dare to, if you want an internship you have to sign up for one six months in advance don't I fucking know that.   Fun, fun memories. I can't stand my parents doing the smallest thing in my life, I wasted so much energy pushing them away all my life fighting for the smallest bits of indepency and control. Spiraling again and selfharming.
I feel more anxious than depressed, but depression still randomly hits me when I make a mistake or try to envision my future 5 years from now. I feel so bored at work that it gives me time to think and be alone with my thoughts.   Also the overall state of the world is ruining my mental health. So there’s that. My therapist had been flakey and forgetful a lot these past few months (I gave leniency at first because I know this is a stressful time for everyone) but it got to the point where you could tell she just didn’t give a fuck so I quit talking to her.
I’ve been off work for 6 months and it hasn’t gotten me anywhere. I don’t want to go back to work. I’m 26 and living off my parents. 5 small tasks that I need to get done in a day feels like 50 and I barely get one done.
Not doing so good lately. I’ve been depressed for years, off and on medication but been on for over a year and a half now. My wife always has more issues and bad luck going on so I feel guilty that compared to her my issues aren’t as bad. She was in the hospital and the time away I definitely felt better but as soon as she comes back I’m feeling bad again. I have a good job but I hate it. Two teenagers one of which likes to drive me crazy, a dog who drives everyone crazy, and a marriage that probably should be over but I can’t seem to be able to leave, especially since she’s dealing with serious stuff. My psychiatrist suggests therapy but I’ve been to three and they all want to focus on fixing my marriage which I don’t really want to talk about because I don’t want to fix it. So I mope through every day and occasionally smoke medicinal marijuana to feel better temporarily. I don’t want to kill myself because of my kids but I definitely don’t want to live feeling like this for the next 40 to 50 years.
Not enjoying my work or anything else for that matter... got into a fight with a rude coworker today too. DEPRESSED.
I always go really quickly from motivated to fix my life to realizing how fucked everything actually is and how nothing ever really changes.   After 3 years of therapy, school, and self improvement I have nothing to show for it. My life is the exact same and my depression hasn't improved one bit so what the fuck is the point??? Why even try anymore???
No one will see this or care but everyday feels like nothing I can act happy but I don’t feel it I can’t sleep eat properly and I’m losing friends I can’t talk to anyone about how I feel because I’ve tried and all I’ve gotten is “man up” it’s hard to keep my head high when I’m insulted on a daily basis saying my hairs terrible or I’m annoying at this point I just wish I’m not afraid of death. No one understands I can’t talk and my parents are divorcing at the same time just wanna stop hurting. I don’t wanna call myself depressed because it’s such a hard subject and I don’t wanna assume my struggles are as bad as everyone else but I just can’t deal with anything anymore
Goddamn I hate my job. Itd be fine if it was normal working hours. But it's like all day most days. And too scared to quit because I have no skills and all the covid stuff. I can't do this sitting on the computer twelve hours a day, it's not healthy. It's not even helping my job standing in the slightest.
does anyone know if it would be possible for me to go about acquiring an anti-anxiety script online? 29yo american, unemployed, no health insurance. will probably have health insurance around November via ACA.  everything that is going on right now is just very overwhelming and I keep having panic attacks sometimes more than once per day... I just really feel like I need help to get through the next few months and this seems like a responsible thing to do.
Had an initial assessment with a therapist yesterday. Hope this works out.
Parents (on their own) contacted a friend of theirs who works for the job center. They organized pretty much everything already, told me phone numbers to call for new job etc. I'm supposed to call them and say I'm unemployed, would like to talk to someone and have "psychological counseling". Which is with a psychologist but not therapy, they more just ask what's the reason behind you being unemployed for a long time.   There are so many reasons I can't do this. Having so many problems with emails, phone calls, talking to people, any change whatsoever, feelings of embarrassment, etc. I can't be honest, if I'd talk to them it would be a super sugarcoated, superficial discussion. And I can't sign up for unemployment because I'm feeling so confined and so embarrassed. Any pressure is killing me.   Having tons of anxiety during the last days. Can't cope. No one to talk to.
Long story short, I displayed some 'minor' symptoms (which I knew were allergies) and had to be out for two days from work. Then after having my doctor's appointment they referred me to take the test which happened today and of course it came out negative. I go back tomorrow and honestly I am not looking forward to the fact that I'll be questioned by other coworkers as to why I've been out. I'm pretty sure they know by now since the managers also like to partake in the whole gossip trend, as that has happened before when I had to be out for other reasons.   I've also taken the depression test while at the initial doctor's appointment and scored a 6. Of course the doctor pointed that out briefly and I disclosed that I am taking medications for it. When it said about losing motivation with life and thoughts about no longer being here, I circled a zero for each. Then times like now I am reminded that it has been something occurring a bit more so than usual. I'm not happy with my job, my graduate program is pretty much a dead end to which I'll have to pay back and they couldn't give two sh\*\*s about. I don't see any way out from my current situation even though I know that it can get worse. If I were to die tomorrow, none of this would matter. I have just about nobody now since my 'friend' doesn't even want to talk to me as much anymore and I realize that I can't tell her everything. Not that I should expect her to be my psychologist but she's helped me quite a bit in the past when she could have just walked away then.  I'm just...alone. Wondering where all the time I have wasted has gone. I'll be alone and there comes a day I know I won't be able to fend for myself. I can't get close to anyone since I know they will walk away anyway. Maybe I am better off dead.

I felt especially low last night, because my best friend made a comment about me “bailing on plans”. I don’t leave anyone hanging, but if I know I won’t be up to it, I say no. She sees this as me being rude or selfish. It fucking hurts that she can’t understand the emotional toll and absolute drain on your energy a social situation or event can bring on. I just want to be understood and respected by someone who has been in my live for 20 years now. It cuts deep.   My last partner saw how often I was sleeping during an episode and called it a “lack of motivation and accountability”. I’m already down, but go ahead and kick me anyway. He said “I’ve been trying to be patient”. I just wonder if I will ever find someone who can truly empathize and not judge me.
Hi reddit, I'm feeling stressed out recently from the job hunt. My sleep and appetite are both affected. I will be meeting my psychiatrist soon for a follow-up evaluation whereby the doc will decide whether to reduce my dosage or not. I want to but I'm not sure if that would mess me up.  I have been doing fine on the meds, wonder if that's a sign that I need to start weaning off or continue.   Anyway, hope everyone's doing fine. Stay safe :'(
So tired with everything lately. Couldn't seem to focus and falling behind
I only feel like myself when I am alone in the dark...I feel like it is just me and I often end up crying to myself. If I look out of the window I can see the night city glittering with lights and I feel like I want to drive away forever and get out of everything.
I tried to talk to my family about being depressed and hitting myself for some support and basically get dismissed or get steamrolled out of the conversation about their baggage before i can actually say anything. Or I'll get the standard, everybody feels down sometimes and 'be positive' speech. I guess I dont really know where to start seeking help or what route to take
I'm crying over something stupid again. I wish my emotions weren't like this, but I also don't want to invalidate my own feelings. It's so conflicting
Hope everyone’s quarantine situation is okay. My abusive mother just said “we’re all traumatized” as if that excuses the trauma I went through last night. Jesus Christ. My depression has peaked staying at home with a narcissist sibling and toxic parents. Nobody cares about my mental health until I’m physically broke and I have to deal with this emotional shit at home. And my parents are doctors!! They still don’t give a shit!!

I had been doing better for a long time. It felt like a punch in the gut the way it hit me. The feeling of loneliness is truly one of the biggest drivers of depression. My soul felt like it was being ripped out. I’m just so very tired.
I am late for work by at least 2 hours EVERY day, for the past 2 years. I cannot wake up. Alarm clocks do absolutely nothing for me, and even if I do end up hearing them I end up laying in bed for hours before I even move. I'll be on way to work some days and just cry while in traffick. Earlier this year I was contemplating just ramming my car head on, in to a median or wall on the express way. I believe I'm a nuisance; hard to deal with if you will. I try to be easy going but my anxiety fucks my world up nearly every day.  Quite frankly, in a world where so many people have lost their jobs this year it baffles me that someone like me still has one. I feel guilty about that as well.
I want to die. I can't do this anymore. I'm tired of hurting.
Nothing like spiraling into depression in a dangerous neighborhood at night because someone at the office told you one area to work, only to find out that no, that person lied, and if you don't get to the right location ASAP despite _every_ fucking train being delayed, you'll get a miss and you'll potentially lose the job you only had for a month  I🙃 fucking🙃 love🙃 it🙃 here🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
Well this has been a shitty week. My whole house has COVID now, my mom is doing better but I'm still worried. I was/am sick which wasn't fun. I developed some weird leg/back pain. I can't taste food which is the best part of eating food. And I don't have much of an appetite. A huge branch fell in my yard and I'll have to deal with it soon and I'll have to mow the lawn soon. I had a "job" over the summer taking care of my neighbor's yard and such but now that we're all diseased, I have no income. It wasn't much but it was enough. And now my mom's job is at risk because she's missing too many days even though they won't let her back at work without a negative test.   And because of all this today I found out we might have to get rid some or all of our cats.   I'm so bored nothing is fun anymore. Video games, drawing, movies. Not interested.   Important Career Shit that I should have been doing all summer? I just can't be motivated   Politics suck but that's not really new.  The past few months have just been a big blur of suck/meh and this week in particular was extra suck.
I feel like I'm constantly looking at the people around me do all of the things I can't do. Even when they're not bragging it feels like bragging. Look at me I'm cooking meals and working out and having a fun time with friends! Meanwhile I'm just dragging myself through life and I feel so heavy.  I'm trying to stay away from social media to help with this, but I still know it's happening and everyone in the world is growing and moving and laughing and enjoying life while I stay stagnant.
Haven't been on here for a while. Have been feeling mostly good for the last, however long, I can't really remember time well enough anymore to know. But I've been good with exception of a few kinda bad nights. Tonight was a good night until just a bit ago. I feel so very lonely. My best friend won't talk to me. We got into a fight like a week ago, and ended up making up a few nights ago, went to her place two nights in a row and then we immediately got into a fight again yesterday. Both fights were kind of centered around the same issue, I wasn't there for her when she wanted to vent about our friend she's apparently into leading her on. I'm usually there for her when she's down but I sometimes struggle when it's about guys to have much to say to her, especially since I know this guy. The reason for this is honestly because I'm in love with her.   I always have been. Ever since I met her. I guess it's been a bit on and off. When she had a boyfriend I wasn't really into her, because it felt wrong, like I was invading. When I almost started dating her friend she introduced me to, I didn't feel that way for her because I thought I actually found something. But now she's single, and I am alone, like always, and I can't stop feeling this way about her. I try to find other girls to start something with, and it works to get me to stop feeling this way about her, if I'm interested in the other girl, but I'm too boring for any girls to ever be interested in.  I feel so alone. I have never had a girlfriend, I want to feel like I deserve to be loved. I want to tell my best friend how I really feel, but I know she doesn't feel the same way, she's made that very clear in the past. She has also had some kinda recent problems with other guy friends admitting they're into her and starting drama, and now with this thing with the other friend, I don't want to add more trouble onto what she is already dealing with. But at the same time I feel she deserves to know. I feel I'm lying to her everytime we hang out and I pretend we're just friends, like that's all I want. Like I'm not dying to just hold her the entire time. I don't know what to do. She snapped me back today, and with how our fights usually go, that means we'll probably be back on good terms tomorrow. I already apologized to her, but didn't explain myself. I suppose tomorrow I might have to decide if I do that. I'm terrified.
I have depression and anxiety and the two tend to take turns with eachother. Currently my depression is in the driver seat. I’m 32 and feel very behind in terms of not being married, owning a home, being an adult. I have stopped working out in the past couple of weeks and have just been laying in bed. Doing everything is hard and knowing the facts that I have so much going for me won’t help me. What do I do?
I haven't done anything meaningful in the past 5 years. I used to love to do art. Drawing, sewing, sculpting, any craft really. Ive always been depressed but I used to manage and force myself to do the things I loved. But I haven't done anything creative or even attempted in the last 5 years. I watch so many art videos and look at a lot of peoples stuff they make and feel inspired but never take any action towards doing stuff. I'm 26 almost 27 and these are supposed to be my good years right? Idk. I just want to sleep and cry. Sorry if the wording/writing is awful on this but I can't be bothered to try harder.
I'm sad. But at least I know I'm not alone. Thank you for this group. ❤️
Waiting to most likely fail a big test tomorrow, and on top of that things with my girlfriend have gotten more rocky and i just don’t know how to express how I’ve been feeling, so tired of everything in my life and don’t even care about class anymore. It feels so painful to lose interest in my major which used to fill me with hope
I pretended to be sick to get out of work. I dont want to do anything, just lay in bed all day
Please let me die, I'm so damn useless, life is just getting worse and I contribute nothing.
Still no progress finding something to do with my life. Everything feels like work, like not worth doing unless I'm paid. No passion or any such thing. I can't give up but am very discouraged. Taking time off or leaving work early feels awful when you have nothing better to do. Like at least my job keeps me occupied. Everything makes me feel sad.
My work exacerbates my depression. It’s really hard to describe how I feel when I’m there, so I’ll just say... alone. I have no one to talk to about it, besides my folks (who have heard my moaning and groaning a thousand times) and I have a hard time articulating how I feel because it’s all just so much.
In feeling so shitty right now. I cant keep it together I feel like crying all the day. I don't know what to do. Loneliness, anxiety, headaches everything is making it so hard for me to survive a single day. I try to study but I cant study more than half an hour. I just cant concentrate on anything. I want to fucking kill my self that's the best thing I can do for my self.
My mind is racing like crazy. I'm losing my mind and going insane. It's hard to breathe. I also somehow believe that I'm going blind.
I can't hold down friendships. I get tired and bored easily. There are nice people who try to befriend me but I am not a fan of listening to other people's life stories and rants. Would rather go around on my own and with my best friend (my partner)
I don't understand why I am a secret for people who say they care. I don't get why people say they care and they want to be around me or talk to me and then hide my existence,  hide what I am to them, or lie about what I am. There is such a double standard and it kills me. I beg for it to stop and I asked nicely, with anger, with tears to stop it and they say they will but they don't. Am I just good as a secret? Am I good as just an object that can be tucked away and remembered only when required? Why is respecting my wishes to just be acknowledged properly such an incredibly hard act?
wrote in here a few days ago because I was feeling hopeless. I'd finally found a therapist willing to do a consult, after months of searching, but she had no appointments for a month  after waiting almost the full month, her office called to push the appointment back. I was just feeling terrible about it.  well... the office called again today. they needed to push the appointment back for the second time.  "getting help" has become like a joke at this point. it feels like the entire system is designed to keep you bouncing from place to place, each one shifting you off onto someone else, never receiving any kind of treatment, until you finally give up and go away forever.

I feel like a reject. My "friends" are all meeting up tomorrow, but I was told I couldn't come because it was too many people... I already didn't want to go because it's a pandemic and it's irresponsible, but pretty much being told I'm the odd one out hurts. I already feel so worthless that it feels like a knife stabbed me in the stomach.
Why do I have to be lonely. Why do I have to be alone. I don't want to be alone anymore but I'm unbearable to be alone with. People have friends that love them but I have no one and nothing. I have no attachments. Besides, im unremarkable and easily replaceable by someone better. No one ever stays with me. Nobody wants me. I am wrong and supposed to die.
Social media is weird. A lot of the time is just makes me realize how lonely I am, as I see people interacting in communities or talk about their lives (even if they're open about the really bad bits) that shows they're a lot more socially active, liked, and just more of a functioning, respectable adult than I am. It hurts more when I follow accounts of similar backgrounds to me.   So sometimes I get off of social media. Delete my accounts. But then I'm just reminded about how lonely and pathetic I am in real life too. So I get back on here so I can get some kind of response from somebody.   God I'm really pathetic...
I just want to stay in bed and sleep all day. Just be in blankets and wait for the next day to come. Just want all the days to pass by. Tomorrow is going to be the same damn thing anyway, so there is no difference. Man my fiancé is really worried about me. He really deserves someone much better then some shell of a human
Everything I try seems to go nowhere. I feel like no one supports me with what I do and my friends I was close with continued their lives without me. I feel like I’m drowning and I’m watching everyone swim to the surface. And there’s no way out. I don’t even want to be associated with them I just want to feel free.
I have a psychiatric appointment in two months and I can't help myself from preparing what to say and running through the conversation in my head. It's driving me nuts. I liked it better when I could just ignore my problems.
If you want my favorite songs about depression [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4zrNL1rezdtuzlTE0AX8ac?si=380SMYP3SVi1Zx2mttuYNA](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4zrNL1rezdtuzlTE0AX8ac?si=380SMYP3SVi1Zx2mttuYNA)
I feel like killing my self every moment no one will ever understand what I go through every day.
My depression makes me lose the ability to feel. In addition, I seem not to care about anything anymore. I have a hard time working and have clothes piled up that I would normally clean up. Instead, it's "....Too tired, i'll get to it..." Then I forget about it and the rest of my day is a blur and then i realized the day ended. Sometimes I forget to eat the whole day and I don't have much of an appetite so I only eat once a day.
I am scared and I fear what will come. I returned to a self destructive behaviour. I can barely care  and the same thought is running through my head: "does it really matter in the end ?"
I'm making an escape plan to get away from my mom and brother. They are both extremely abusive, and I don't want to be around them anymore. I would like to go no contact in the future. I might keep in contact with my sister. She seems to be the most sane out of all my family members.   I'm really scared. I don't do well with confrontation. I always try to appease them, so I don't have to deal with their anger.
I hate existing.
I’ve been really worried for my close friends recently. One of my friends has been going MIA on social media because of her mental health and I miss hanging out with her so much. Knowing that she’s not doing well mentally makes me really sad. My other two friends aren’t doing well either and it just pains me to see them all struggling mentally and idk how to help them. I feel stuck and I’m scared of losing any of them because if I lost them idk what I’d do. They made me wanna keep living everyday. Because of that I’m very grateful to have them in my life but I’m more worried for them now(Ｔ＿Ｔ)
Trying to hang in there.  The next few weeks will likely be difficult.  Having thoughts of self harm and suicide.   Went to google "reddit depression" and misspelled it to "reddit derpression" and thought about what an idiot clown I am.   Finding it difficult to concentrate on my telework even, it all seems pointless.  I don't know if I'll ever find love, I'm such a loser.  Thanks for any replies.
Some days are the fuckin best, then most are today like damn wtf, I can't even enjoy those days cause I wait for shit to hit the fan
I dont have anywhere to be or anyone to go see so I just stay at home and lay on my bed all day. I feel disgusting laying around in my filth all day but I dont feel like showering. I always start the mornings convinced that I dont need to shower If Im just going to get dirty later and I could just shower at night.
I just want to sleep until my life improves, but I can never manage too because mind can’t be strayed away from the depressive state of my life. I cussed God today. A video from August 24th I watched and I was doing the same. No life improvement since then. I had a journal I was reading a month or two back. There was a July 2018 entry where I was doing the same- cussing God. God is useless, look at the ever echoing chaos of the world.
I’m such a sad, pathetic and stupid person. Just did bad in two assignments, and I just know that it’s a matter of time till I get kicked out of this program (two C+’s and that’s it).   I wasn’t cut out for this life. Even modest success isn’t something I can have. I have no one, and nothing to go for me.
I’m sad. I suck at drawing, I don’t feel like doing anything
OCD combined with depression is the worst. The OCD makes me more depressed and I have intrusive sad thoughts. At least I have a diagnosis now, that makes it a bit easier to deal with.
I found a YouTuber that makes me happy when I watch him
I'm too old to do anything
I’ve been quite depressed. I can’t find the motivation to do my schoolwork and often feel like a lazy dumbass who can’t get anything right. I feel like such an impostor when people say I’m smart because Ive lost all motivation to do my work without significant help from the internet
I haven't had friends in idk 7 years (25 now). Wasted my youth. I promise myself I'll experience EVERYTHING I missed later in life. But... I'm 25 and I been saying this since forever. Not sure when I'm gonna start experiencing life. I've literally just been living a lonely existence. When I mean I haven't done anything in life, I mean that. Didn't have a coming of age stage, didn't do anything with family. Didn't learn to be social earlier in life.  I just want to leave my home + go away to start a new life. Whilst also doing therapy because I need help, need someone to walk me through life.  Wish I had a gf, a relationship, at least knew what it felt like to be hugged.   I don't want to have a family of my own until I get to experience everything I missed out on.   I say I feel like I changed as a person but it's pretty small amount , I'm still the scared little boy who doesn't do anything + overthinks + spends ages doing something.
So much anger
Today I said a prayer to no one in particular. I've never wished so desperately to just be able to live my life.  My wife and I are expecting a daughter in April. If anything could lift my spirits it's this, what we've wanted for so long. But all I can think about is how horrible our world is now, how much worse it's going to get, how gleefully stupid, selfish, arrogant, reckless, cruel, greedy, and self-absorbed Americans are (myself included) and how selfish I've been for chosing to bring a new life into this vile world I'm too weak to protect her from. If I were her I'd never forgive me for my failures.  People need me but I'm just so god-damned tired all the fucking time. Everything and everybody wants something from me that I feel incapable of providing. There is nothing left of me to give to anyone anymore.  I am an empty rotting husk hollowed out by guilt and shame.  I don't even have the decency or energy to kill myself.  If anyone is listening, heaven help me, I am beyond help or hope. Please end me. Let my daughter not have to see what an awful shitbag her father is. Let her grow up in the blissful ignorance of wondering and projecting whatever sort of person she wants me to be over what I really am.  I can't live like this any longer.
I have no idea why I insist on over complicating everything
Tried to do something for myself but my family had to come in and ruin it. Sports in general has basically been ruined for me. My family are loud and obnoxious, they don’t care to give space and are constantly judging. I just wanted to do something nice for myself, but I can’t even get that without them joining with the same terrible attitudes.   It makes me tired of living.
Should be grateful I’m functioning like everyone else  I’m melting on my bed rn It’s tiring, why? Why am I not good enough
It's supposed to snow on Tuesday when I'm supposed to have my second therapist appointment and just the thought of potentially having to cancel it is making me fucking miserable. It's gotten so dreary and cold I just dont think I can go on like this. I'll be lucky if I survive this winter. Then again I'll be lucky if I somehow end up dead considering the fact that I already tried suicide and I couldnt go through with it for some goddamn reason. Just hell punishing me for daring to breathe by making me feel torment for 40+ more years.
How do you guys learn to not take things personally? I got into a stupid fight with some friends of my partner’s about politics and misinterpreted a comment that I thought was derogatory but wasn’t intended that way. It also seems like they’re indirectly insulting me by saying I ‘took the comments too personally’ but that in and of itself is me taking it personally.  Honestly I just feel like a POS and kinda wanna die because now my partners friends probably hate me and I don’t know what to do to amend shit.
I am suffering general spike of anxiety this weekend. I still feel like I am just spinning my wheels and wishing I could do better.  I wish there were a way to check out and just disappear for a while.
I’ve had a relatively good day today. Hope I will stay the same tomorrow.
I genuinely  might give up. There's so much weight on my shoulders. Nobody listens to me. My mom thinks i'm faking my depression. I want help. I'm missing 65 assignments in school right now because I can't get out of bed.
I AM STILL HOLDING ON TO IT everything is under good control, but not my system 2. I’m barely living, days passing by like it’s, it’s, not mine.
I’m having a shitty day. I’m scared and I’m shaking and I don’t know what to do. I want to talk to someone but I’m too scared too. I want a hug so bad and I want to wake up from this nightmare. I want someone I can hold and tell me it’s all gonna be fine, but that’s not happening anytime soon so I’m just gonna vent here.
I’m feeling ok right now. My depression is far from the worst out there and I can function normally and be happy most of the time. I have a few very close friends and even more acquaintance friends, and they all help me stay grounded. Whenever I start to think about what will happen once my senior year ends and we all go our separate ways I get that awful pulling feeling in my chest. I’m without a doubt going to follow my best friend to college. Reading all of these posts from others who have it much worse than me makes me feel terrible about myself and I start to think that maybe I’m just faking the depression and that I’m really just a lazy high school kid. I know that I should be all thankful for what I have and stuff but everything I see here just makes me feel so hollow. I guess I just need to fake it? It’s been working well so far. If you read all of this word vomit, thanks. I don’t know how bad it is for you but I hope it gets better.
Life isn’t going well, I’m thinking of killing myself.
I don’t feel good about myself, I feel like I’m the best I can be and it still isn’t anywhere near the person I want to be. I feel like a loser. I used to go out and hang with friends with no worries at all. Now I find myself sitting in my bed in my messy room and not doing anything productive. I wake up and do my school work and then just go back to bed. I don’t have anything to look forward to. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to be here. I don’t feel like I’ll ever be the person I want myself to be.

I want to, I don't know, start over or something else.
I’ve been trying to keep a diary. Get the bad thoughts out of my head and onto the pages. I have lots of homework to do and I’m doing it! But very slowly and I don’t feel happy or less stressed when I complete it or make any progress on it. I try to make deadlines for myself and if I can get out of bed to meet it I’ll be fine, if not then I’ll wallow until I finally brush my teeth and shower at 10:00am. I’m starting to feel numb, nothing feels worth anything and I’m starting to forget what I actually like and dislike.
I'm seeing a therapist for the first time in my life after being some level of depressed for probably the past 5 years or so. This summer it got pretty severe so I finally reached out.  I have to say, I'm certainly not magically cured or anything, but I honestly had really low expectations for this, but so far my therapist seems really cool and is actually going a good job of gently identifying where my depression changes how I think about things in ways I didn't even notice. She calls it "gently observing" and tells me not to worry about it or try to change anything or get upset about it for now, just to try to observe some of my own thoughts so we can talk about it and work on fixing it later.  It's nice so far and I just wanted to share.
Keep thinking about decisions and incidents that happened ages ago. Just can't move past them. Keep thinking about my miserable failure in my career, and an empty future. Wouldn't mind if I die; wouldn't have to suffer through it all.
My Body Dysmorphia is getting worse. My therapist is having me record my meals because I've been severely undereating.  I recovered from an eating disorder years ago, and gotten to the point where looks/appearance/weight didn't rule my life. I saw the inner beauty in myself and others.  Now I browse looks-focused forums and subs and even though I know it's just feeding the toxic thoughts I find it so hard to look away - I keep going back to it.  My body is changing and I don't like it. I don't want to be sexualised again, like I was as a teenager and young person.
Bascially using internet as a drug just to escape for one moment. Can have a somewhat stable mood most of the day but the moment I'm turning the pc off and going to bed I'm screaming so hard.
I feel completely alone here on this planet. I feel as if im nothing and that i cant be nothing. Alla my dreams have been failed and im just nobody, fitting in nowhere. What can i even live for?
I don't want to exist.
Ever since I started working, I feel way less depressed than I used to, but I don't feel happy either.   It's hard to snap out of putting all my hours into my job. The moment I do, I just enter some negative spiral of thoughts, or end up not interested in anything. I can't seem to get myself to get in or out of bed, and my eating pattern is all over the place.  It feels like I just want to be sad again, because at least that's familiar.   I'm not sure what's going on.
I am a complete fuck up. I wish I was brave enough to stand up for myself. I was wish I was smarter so I could just succeed. Instead, everything is just a struggle or I feel like I am going no where. I wish I would just disappear from existence.
Was feeling hopeful for once in a long time, but now I showed up for work... At the wrong station. And now I'm gonna be late getting to my actual destination, my whole work schedule for the day is fucked up, and I'm likely gonna get written up for it.  I'm trying so hard not to burst into tears in public, why did I ever think things would change or go right
My therapist said that depression is caused by a failure of growth, but doesn’t depression itself cause this “failure?”   It all seems convoluted.
I'm not doing well. Life is lonely and going downhill quicker than I'd like it to. Not sure how much longer I can deal with that.
Lol got nothing clever or interesting to say but I sure do wish I was dead right now
Life situation is deterioating.   Fake friends doing anything to get to me ("oh hey, ill say ill buy something for you, then say i cant and when i tell you im buying a car im actually buying two OLD COD games lol")   When i try to be alone people come around, snd when i try to be social people are non receptive/assholes.   I should just fucking burn this place down and become a homeless serial arsonist.   Id hate to be taking out my anger on others, but the whole world takes out its anger on me and does it more so because i dont hurt people.             My only solice in all this is one of the people involved doesnt know how much their girlfriend secretly is using them.   Im sitting right next to him.   Think imma keep it a secret, slight for slight
I feel overwhelmed just texting parents and putting away clothes and getting groceries and depositing some money.  Talking to roommate since I missed depositing his cheque.
I cleaned up my depression nest today. Still feel like shit, but at least I'm not sleeping in it tonight
I just need to write this down so I hopefully gain some new perspective. To start, I feel depressed, long hours where I know I matter and all but am just down and sad. I think I want to live but the thoughts are there about maybe ending my story as I don’t really care about the end of my book. Some perspective about me, Iused to play college basketball but now just go to school and try to keep a positive attitude but sometimes it’s slips and I feel seething rage and I feel like in a wrong situation I really could hurt someone. The only person I think it is okay to hurt is yourself as you are you and the only one capable of making decisions for yourself. I get the slippery slope here and am not a backer of suicide but I do have a hard time grasping why it’s not a legitimate choice you should be able to make. I know I’m not able to see the future or say it’s the right decision but I really don’t feel like wasting away, waiting for the day when I’m 65+ to die. I’m relatively young still, just turned 22 but I’ve had a fair bit of life experience from abuse as a kid, used a lot of different drugs(am 100% sober writing this), to being stabbed and getting 10 stitches. I know life has ups and downs but I don’t really believe that the highs are worth the lows tbh, and the main reason I haven’t already committed to my plan are 2 of my family members but 1 is my drunk of a mother whom I love but have lost a ton of respect for when I get drunkenly reemed, reminding me of when I used to get beat then have my father verbally abuse my and my brother and I’ve kinda just stopped feeling tbh it just hurts too much.
I'm an awful mother and I am ruining my life daughter's life  A six year old shouldn't be saying things like "I'm the worst kid ever" or "it's okay, mom, it's my fault"  I am fucking her up and she would be better off with a dead mother than what she has
Made the mistake of lurking the ex online friend's Tumblr. They're happy with their new fandom friends and forgetting about me it seems. What is worse is that their birthday was the day before mine (it's this month) and I was sending them presents. I always got a thank you. Last thing I sent them before COVID was an Easter card and I heard nothing, not a peek since then. Then months later I found their 'new' Facebook that they didn't even bother adding me on. I constantly worry what I did that was so wrong.   I wish I could move on and find others, but being a boring loser that does not belong anywhere, does not connect well with others does not go down too well. Loneliness is unbearable and seeing others around with me with their friends just makes it worse.
Can chocolate help??  I've gotten a lot of candy from trick or treating and I heard chocolate can increase your dopamine and help u feel a bit better. Hopefully, some sugar can bring me out of this feeling for at least a little while
This is my 3rd time crying my eyes out before bed. Just thinking of all the mistakes I’ve made and how lost I feel in this world. I crave the peace and happiness it seems so many people in this world have. Feeling like I’ll never get it right. This hole in my heart has left a void within me. I paint my smile on before work everyday and live within a hollow shell of what used to be me.
I'm tired I've been crying.
Some people fucking suck.   Every argument has to make you look smart or its a fight, and you always gotta have the spotlight on you even when people dont care?   Coercing people to get attention is so fake, i guess that's why the fake love it, even worst is after they sit there and try to attack you for 3 hours, they wonder why you dont sit with a group of empathyless subhumans   Pray for me while i sit and listen to someone try to explain how an adola link is similar to a stand arrow and would produce the same powers while calling Dio the goddamnded dod, and then trying to be annoying when i dont give a fuck about a CRAPPY DELUSIONAL EXPLANATIONS.   I wish i had better friends.   And thank you to anyone who reads this.
My eyes are so tired but I still can't sleep. Everything is so terrible
Second big heartbreak of the year just happened today and I am really fucking tired of never being anyone’s first choice, never being anyone’s person, never good enough.
I wake up screaming every single morning. Only person I can still talk to despite extreme anxiety, my former therapist, can't tell me a word. And in my head if she can't tell me anything anyone else can't either. Torn apart between selfhatred, apathy, despair, escapism and being irrational.
Sooo I have been experiencing sleeping problems lately. For the first time, I put on a diffuser last night, limited my screen time and meditated before bed. It worked really well and I was knocked out not long after.   I need to work more on limiting the screen time. I newly installed a screentime tracker app and found out that I spent 1/7 of my week on my phone. If I include my time spent on my desktop, I would have spent a significant amount of my time awake in the digital world.
My therapist told me she is raising her rates. Been $50 and after January she is going to $175 with no negotiation room since I’ve been getting sliding scale and she is no longer offering that option. I don’t have health insurance and am gonna have to find someone new and who can accommodate no insurance and decent rates. I’ve been seeing her on and off since 2014. I understand she needs to raise her rates so she feels like she is compensated fairly, but it feels like she’s closing the book on our relationship, because she certainly knows I can’t afford that.
Staving off depressions and loneliness by drinking my days away.    Starting to think I should give up on being happy, and just become desperate to survive like everyone else.   Gonna try online dating, lets hope i dont get my head chopped off
i just feel really awful today. and i dont know how to cope with it :( i feel alone
Damn i wish i had friends that weren't assholes because they threw their lives away.    Shouldnt expect much for a person who cant even find a stable place with a kid and hangs out with someone she says is bad for her.   Oh well, here's hopping talking to people online pans out
I’m tired to living. Just tired.
Just drink some water, get some rest! I get so irritated when I hear this advice.
I’m so alone. I just want this one person to love me and give me affection. That’s all I want. It’ll never happen.
i opened up to someone and they laughed. that’s about it
I don’t enjoy being alive, I just don’t want to die yet. Everyone says shit about potential but if I haven’t been able to find much joy in two decades, attention seeking, and medication, I dont know how I’m going to survive a lifetime. I already hate it.
Also its weird watching two peolle ave a conversation with each other that neither are invested in.
I don’t even want days off anymore. I have next to nothing. Barely see friends anymore, so many things I can’t do because of covid, just try to exercise when I dont feel like shit. I’m sober so I can’t just numb myself with drinking. I think I’d rather work every day.
Reddit always pisses me off. I don’t know why I bother interacting on this hive mind site
physically can not cry anymore
I got Covid 12 days ago. Thankfully the symptoms have been extremely mild, but it has robbed me of my desire to work. I've been working on a project diligently for the last 5 months. Suddenly it has started to seem like a mountain.
I didn't do a single thing today and it's already afternoon. I feel that another slump is coming because I have been slacking in self care, which is a major symptom. So I took a quick shower (didn't bother to wash my hair) and brushed my teeth. Gonna have a cup of chilled coffee later. I'm tired all the time for no reason; I do nothing much.
Really wanna disconnect from life for a bit. People starting rumours and bullying, even my own family participates in that. I can't deal with it anymore. I've been way too fucking fragile lately.
Iam always on the verge of crying but cant shed more than a couple tears. I just want to break down and let a good fucking cry out. I feel anxious all time, I mentally beat my self over small shitty things nothing gives me the sense of satisfaction even if i do something productive or complete my goals i feel like a fucking trash. I just dont know what to do, my mind is filled with negative thoughts i just cant get my shit together i try so hard but i just cant. I feel like giving up everything sucks man.
Things are at the point where it feels easier to become nothing rather than invest in decades more dishes, laundry, and doing things when you have no energy or interest. There are so many limitations on my body and my mind that it's hard to see a future that isn't steady decline.
I just want to stop suffering so much
Have an interview later. Uninterested and wish to hide in a hole. Currently in bed feeling a bit suicidal.
Went a few weeks feeling not the best but pretty decent. Unfortunately this week I fell into a massive depression it’s completely taken over and I’ve experienced new things I never had before. For one, the newest feeling last night was that I wanted to feel pain. I wanted to be beaten. I’ve never felt that before so it was weird and I kinda just mentally noted it, and it was a pretty strong feeling to like I would have paid a group to jump me. So idk what that’s all about. And this morning I woke up super hot and wanted to die. The first thought when I opened my eyes was I wish I was dead. That isn’t new to me but the extreme want was. Now I’m at work and feeling a little better but just no energy, the usual. Anyone else experience the wanting to be hurt thoughts? This is new to me.
Finding everything rather draining at the moment. Definitely been having depressive episodes for most of the year but I also have SAD, so I'm feeling a lot worse now. Trying to self medicate on a cocktail of vitamins and try to get out when it's day time, although it's hard when im pretty much working from home full time. Also I have nothing to look forward to outside of working, so everything feels like a drag.   I'm finding every little thing so stressful as well, even things that would normally motivate me, I'm just not feeling it at all. Hardly seen anyone at all outside of my household for months, not because of covid, just because I'm self isolating due to feeling so crap. Its becoming too hard to hold a conversation with anyone so I try and avoid situations where I actually need to talk/listen to anyone. Also, I'm usually too physically unwell, getting bad headaches most days.   I'm supposed to be looking for my first house and honestly, it's just too much. The alternative is to stay in a flat that's falling apart and I pay too much rent for. I can't move in with anyone else in meantime because I need my office space.  Just want the winter to gooo awaaayy!
"Allow others to help you"  _me, drags myself to therapist, one more time_  _therapist doesnt say anything_  "Well that was helpful. Apparently there just isn't anything to say! I'm worse than before haha"
Really could use some support, or someone to vent to

I have to move again in a week. I need to socialize, I need to feel human. I don't feel human. I don't feel like a person, I feel like a shell of a thing that's just meant to keep pushing forward. I keep reminding myself of what I might get to do. The idea of that is all I have right now.  I wish I could've had a partner or romance, but I don't get to do that because the world is fucking ending.   I don't want to move. I don't want to stay. I wish I could drink but I can't my hands on any booze. I keep thinking about walking to the store to get NyQuil.
I feel so far behind everyone in my age group (26-30). I don’t feel as mature as other women.  I’m always anxious and scared. I feel stupid when I try to make simple conversation with people. Especially men I’m interested in. I cry all the time.  I just really need a hug. I haven’t had real, significant human contact since February.
Existential crisis time, why am I majoring in theatre, oh yeah I remember why now. Fuck college though
I feel like such a failure, I keep missing due dates and my profs don't take late assignments. It's so demoralizing to see myself fuck up time and time again.
TW: weight They weighed me at the clinic today. I have lost 22 lbs in less than two weeks. That's 50 lbs since June. It's not like I'm starving myself on purpose, I just can't keep my appetite up. Not only does everything taste like cardboard, but just the smell of food makes me sick. They give me these meal replacement drinks. They're not bad, but one is my limit. The doctor says it's better than nothing and to take small steps. Which is a good thing, because at this point I can barely walk.
My biggest fantasy at this point is to suffer some kind of head injury and become an amnesiac. I'd still be a worthless piece of shit but at least I wouldn't have any idea of who I am or remember all the reasons why I suck.   I just want to be a different person. Fixing my problems didn't seem to make me happy so that means that it's me who is the problem.
You ever have a shit day at work that just kills every other good thing that happened during the day? That’s today. I’m angry which is just making me sad.
I am just so lost and alone. I wish I connected with things better. However, everything is a struggle for me. While my peers don't seem to struggle as much.
I found out today that my therapist of 9 months doesn't really believe I'm depressed. Despite me telling him I'm depressed and providing examples weekly for the last 6 weeks at least and intermittently before that. He also told me I should educate myself about depression...then didn't know what the phq9 was. It's my worst nightmare to not be believed. I don't want to be vulnerable anymore with therapists or doctors. I hate telling them the most personal things about me.
I feel so incredibly ugly and worthless and I want to die
I’m just tired of living
I want to die. I don't want to be here.
it feels like I've just lost you too...
I feel so numb.
I’m tired of my therapist basically telling me that it’s basically my fault that I feel this way. Where everything feels empty, and I want nothing to do with anyone.   Why would I want this for myself?
Empty, tired and living in the past.
I quit smoking three years ago Nowadays i feel like shit The thought that smoking will leviate my depression keep haunting me
Hopefully things will be better
I was thinking about how differently people are coping. A gaming pal of me had his gf break up with him and he's been crying and throwing up ever since. And I'm trying to be empathic and helpful but I'm not really able to. It's not his first relationship and I already had my suspicions that this one wouldn't end that well either but didn't say anything and tried being optimistic for him. Until this one ended badly as well.  Meanwhile I got social anxiety so severe I can't be in one room with other people. I don't want to do any gatekeeping and certainly it's awful for him right now but I'm still not really able to be empathic. I feel so numb towards my own life so I can't care for this as well. I'm just totally the wrong person to ask for relationship advice.  He's openly crying because of this break-up and I'm having suicidal thoughts for four years now and can't/don't want to show anything. It's like the most important compulsive "rule" of my mental illness: don't show any symptoms, don't show any problems, don't show any "weakness". Ofc this is super stupid and worse what he's doing.   Contrary to him I've at least been to therapy though, even if it didn't help me. I still recommended it to him if he doesn't get better, I didn't know anything else anymore.
Tfw you join your sisters friend group and the first time you try initiaing a conversation, everyone says "no one cares"  Granted it was a negative topic, but I saw other people bitching about something else so I thought it was okay and... It stings really _really_ bad. I feel sick, why does being rejected by so many people hurt _so_ much
I have my monthly maintenance ECT treatment on Monday. Hoping it helps alleviate some of the mental anguish I’ve been experiencing.
I'm depersonalizing to the point it's genuinely hard to tell what's a dream and what's real life. I have no emotions except anger and occasionally sadness but mostly just numb. I don't react to anything anymore, good or bad. I don't care about anything anymore, nothing makes me happy.   I already feel like I'm not living so what's the point.    I'm not in the real world already, at this point I'm a lifeless body floating around going through routines, that's it.
I can't get over things that happened in the distant past.
Friends and loved will sometimes tell me how great they think I am and I've been doing my goddamdest to not reply with how much I fucking hate myself. Living has not gotten better, easier, or more enjoyable over time, I have no purpose, but I'm do afraid to end it. Been that way for years. Why though, I don't know. I don't know why I'm like this, wish I did, if I had one half the belief these other folks have in me I'd be crushing life. Instead I keep on praying they don't leave me while doing everything in my power to slowly drive them away.
I'm so hungry. I don't want to eat
Hey my first time commenting i guess or even posting I think. Just wanted to actually admit to someone or something anyone really that im not Okay. i thought typing this out might help, but i dont know. I opened an old phone i had. That definitly did not help. brought a kinda rush of emotions im just having a hard time dealing with. Only thing keeping me somewhat sane i cant even enjoy. Thank you.
I really wish I just didn't tell anyone about my birthday. Ugh I hate it I just don't want it to happen. I don't want people to feel obligated to care about me. I don't like the attention and the expectation that I'm gonna do something significant or fun or special but I don't wanna do anything. At the same time I know everyone else would think that's sad so it makes me sad for some reason and now I'm upset that I'm not doing anything for my birthday even though I absolutely do not want to do anything. I wish my friends at least wouldn't give me presents. I really appreciate it but I'm awful to showing gratitude and it's always so awkward when I get gifts and I just feel bad that they wasted their time and money on me. And I'm turning 21 so forever people will be like "what'd you do on your 21st bday" and all I'll have to say is " went to work, tried not to cry as my friends gave me presents I didn't think I deserved, and stared at the ceiling, cried and played Minecraft all day. I have no desire to drink, and even if I did I'm on like 3 medications that say I shouldn't drink alcohol while taking. I don't want my first drink to be a big deal, I don't wanna do it unless I'm alone if I ever do. Ugh I hate my birthday so much I wish it just wasn't happening. I already can't stop crying uuugh tomorrow is gonna be fucking awful. It's gonna be so awkward when I have to tell anyone I'm not doing anything for my 21st I'm gonna be so stupid and pathetic. I wish I could just cancel my birthday forever

Feel like I was on a positive roll and one really bad day just set me back months.
Finally reached out and got real help for my depression and anxiety. On medication as well as therapy which is going well.  My only worry is a close friend who won't speak to me but still stalks my instagram on a stalker account? I was close to them but they have distanced themselves recently. They know they can talk to me but choose not to, it really hurts.
I'm just existing - nothing seems worth doing or is even pleasurable.  Spending a lot of time clicking random shit on the internet because it passes the time and makes me look like I'm doing something to my wife.    It's possible that I have bipolar (which I'll need to bring up the next time at my GP) which might explain why all the various meds have only worked for short periods, and probably why I've failed to get anything useful or lasting from therapy.    I'm due a review on this medication anyway so I'll have to bring it up then.  Keeping a mood log but it's not been good so far, owing to a constant low.
So, I think I've finally admitted to myself that I have no confidence in myself anymore. I don't. I don't believe in myself anymore. I feel like a waste of oxygen and I think I feel like I deserve this kind of mediocre life and I feel embarrassed to really be happy and this is the best I will ever do. Fuck.
It's not even a lot of yelling, but it sure feels like it.
Wondering about my mistakes and my future. I tell myself that I'll be able to survive, but I wonder if I'm lying to myself.
I'm ok. COVID has hardened me. I've become something of a bitch. But being an ok bitch feels better than being a lonely and depressed gentle person. /shrug
Know things are getting bad when the psychosis is back. All of a sudden everything is a message/criticism again.
why are counselling and therapy services so expensive?? gaming my life away costs $15 a month, therapists are $200 a session
I feel like I've crossed the line of no return... So hopeless and filled with resentment and self-hatered. I want to believe I can get better but I instead feel like a void. Empty and exhausted. Seriously struggling to find the motivation to even move.

Washed my hair and styled it today. Still feeling really lonely. Still haven’t been hugged in months and it’s really getting to me
The only thing i managed to do today is not end it. Layed on the bathroom floor for an hour, couldnt get myself to eat or do any work. But i managed to stay alive.
It suddenly got really bad in the past month. I'm mean, I've been living with depression for several years at this point, and it's dipped this low before, but never for this long. I know I'm not going to do anything so I don't want to bother people I know, especially ones that might get it, because they're going through their own shit. It's so much harder to do normal every-day things than people looking in from the outside can tell, which is just so fucking frustrating. I'm trying really hard here.

Thanksgiving was fun for like 3 seconds till my family started yelling at each other and gaslighting each other, this is why I don’t like being home for holidays
"Nobody Here" by sunsetcorp is the story of my life. A vibrant rainbow road led by a lifetime of happy art leading into a void of a city where nobody cares, talks, or exists. It makes me doubt if I exist because I can't even see myself. I see yucky colors and the ugly nature of my existence. It's so lonely but this is how I escape the anger, the immaturity, the inability to grow, the lifetime of misunderstanding that plagues me. The future is beautiful but oh so fake and there's nobody around to help it get better.
Tidied up my little depression nest I've made out of my room. I feel better about it, but I still feel empty generally. Baby steps I suppose
Woke up feeling like shit again for some reason all I could think about is selfmutilation, it's an old habit I had and right now it's tempting
Would appreciate it if someone reached out to me
All my posts are getting deleted and I don’t know why so I’m sad
i just want this pain to end.   i can't go on with this life anymore i just want it to end somebody please kill me
why am I so weak ?why I cant do simple things ?
My family and friends are the only things keeping me going so it would be great if I could stop feeling like I'm nothing but a useless inconvenience to them
[deleted]
I’m feeling frustrated because I keep getting into stupid arguments with people because they make me feel like a fucking idiot for asking questions or nitpicking shit as they put it. It seems like their style of conversation is more suited to less questions and any time I act like myself I feel like I’m being fucking attacked for it. So I have to smile and brush it off like it doesn’t bother me but it does. We honestly don’t seem like we’re compatible conversation wise and they seem to mistake my questioning for judging them which is not how I meant to come across at all.  Idk if it’s just me or if it’s just them but it makes me feel insecure and judged and like I have to walk on eggshells around them.
Fuck chat rooms. Everyone has their fucking little chat room friend groups and shit. What do I have? Fucking nothing because I can't stand chat rooms they go by so fucking fast and they're so impersonal why is everything so goddamn impersonal we're all so goddamn miserable that we have to hide behind a thousand layers of irony and I answered my own goddamn question I just want to have genuine connections with people again. I wanna kill myself but I can't. I wanna break something but I can't (and shouldn't). I wanna scream and cry but I cant't welcome to hell welcome to hell welcome to hell welcome to ehell weolcome to hell welcome to hell welvomec to hell welcome to hell
My wife left me this year February 17... shortly after quarantine happened. It was hell. We were together 8 years, married for 3 and it was out of the blue. A few months ago I was finally feeling good and started talking to some one else. That fell through, but from talking to her I made some amazing friends through her, her sister and her best friend. And honestly they’ve done some great things and included me in everything. But damn I’m still so lonely. I miss waking up and knowing I have some one, some one I’m special to, some one j can’t wait to tell about my day, to cheer on. Thanksgiving was rough. I had an amazing time with family, but came home to my house we used to share alone, just the dog and I, and this week I’ve just felt so hopeless. Like I wasn’t good enough for 2 people this year.
I’m so done. My only identity is shitty mom and person who cleans house.
Finally got serious about my self-medicating. I'm using more bourbon, weed, and cigarettes every day. Doesn't matter at this point, I just have to make it through the holidays. After that, I'll be able to do something that is long overdue.
I wish I could just disappear.
Waking up with depressive thoughts. Can't grasp my life. This awful personality, I tried working on it for so long and nothing changed. Therapy is like "dude that's _your_ problem, fuck off".  One reason I can't get up in the morning and try to avoid it as long as possible is because I have to see my parents. All those stabs and accusations and humiliation. The first people you meet in the morning will berate you for 15 minutes. Constantly alert and on guard. There's just no use in saying anything.   Hey but they "jUsT wAnT tO hElP yOu". Imagine your childhood bully would be _really, really_ worried about you. This fucking psychopath stuff. And everyone believes them ofc, including therapist apparently.  I get 24/7 berated for fucking everything and it's draining so much energy. No matter what I say. But hey why don't I allow my parents to "hElP mE"? They ruined my life a couple of times, let's just do it again, there's no bigger fun than doing the same mistakes over and over again cause that's what my life is all about.   "Just be... a functioning person, you know?". Great, why did I never think of that? It's not like I tried for the last ten years on how to make phone calls or open mail without problems. Therapist doesn't help me. Therapist doesn't answer emails. Just "fuck you". My expectations got so low it's not even worth it anymore.  Parents are so 100% clueless and naive it's fucking ridiculous. I hate their fucking "advice" that's making me worse.
Been a long time since I've checked in. This year sure killed all momentum I had planned to give myself a good growth period. Being back at work is not the same after being furloughed, I feel so detached from it. My winter depression is burning me out, and I feel kinda trapped atm. So now I want to change my job asap but it's difficult in these times, plus I don't even have any idea what career I want to go into next. I'm going to have to evaluate myself for awhile.
I dont know why im saying this here but here it goes. I dont have depression officially, I havent been diagnosed ever, ive never had the insentive to see if i actually did. What I do know is that this entire world makss me so mad, sometimes I wanna end it all, heck most of the time, and the worst of it all? I have everyrhing in the world, im smart, i have friends, quite a few of them, im in a well-off family, with two fun brothers and parents who love eachother, yet where am I? Unabke to do anything, thinking about dying, wanting to leave
Constant screaming. When therapy itself becomes another problem on top of all the others. Now I need all the rest of my little energy to move both myself _and_ another person who apparently doesn't care at all. It feels like moving square stones up a hill.   Escalating so hard. People be like "oh well, you gotta _ask_ for help and gotta _talk_ about your problems in therapy but when I manage to talk about my most difficult issues I feel like they're not taking me seriously and don't do anything with it. It's so shallow and so far away from everything and afterwards it's like they just blame you for not trying hard enough. Trying something that doesn't even really help.   I'm super irrational but also hiding it extremely well so just nobody can imagine, if I were walking around with a live cam and a log of my thoughts they probably still wouldn't believe it.
Wow 22 days since my last post here. That's the longest in a while.  I uh haven't gotten better. Money's getting tight. Likely moving back home with my parents which means I need to tie up some stuff here. See friends. Clean up. Talk to my roommate. It's hard for me to do anything.  I'm just gonna read a bit of that CBT book I've been putting off.  I don't get along with my mom. That's an understatement.  I sleep during the mornings now and need to reset. My food situation is bad. And I really need to play less of this game.
I’m new here, not sure what to say but I do know I’ve never felt so empty and lonely in my life. I live with my husband & son but there’s nothing there. I may as well be a roommate. I feel each day go by like a page from a Ray Bradbury novel. I’m not sure they’d even miss me if I were gone. I have forgotten what love feels like...am numb 99% of the time. I’m not suicidal but I’d welcome death were it presented to me. Is this all there is? Is this why I was put on this earth? I honestly do not understand WHY this is happening to me but I’m so tired & worn out I don't have the energy to find out why. I can’t even cry anymore, I’m so numb.
I hate feeling like a disappointment. Sometimes I think maybe my parents have a life insurance policy on me and that maybe it would be better for them... but I know it won’t be. I’ll be someone they can be proud of one day before I make a decision like that.
I wish I owned a gun
i want to kill my self nothing will ever change i will never get better
I feel sad all the time and people closest to me trample all over my opinions. I have had enough. I have to do things and attend functions that I don’t want to and my anxiety is through the roof. I just wish for death sometimes.
When I was a kid and bullied years ago I took up penpalling as a hobby. It started off fine but years later in my early 20's onwards it was nothing but drama just like with real life friends and online friends, full of lies, fighting, not connecting well with anyone. I read an article online about people finding best friends and partners through penpals. Why does it go right for them and not for me?
Ugh. I had been doing really well for probably a month or so. Even had a great Thanksgiving and was feeling like I wouldn't have much to talk about at this week's therapy appointment. And then suddenly... back down into the depression hole this week. I have no idea why, I just woke up feeling like shit and it hasn't gone away for a few days. I can't focus on work. I'm so upset.
I feel like such a useless person today
I feel really horrible, this one particular feeling has been with me for years now.
I always have a reason to feel bad, ugh
I set my life on fire and everyday I find new charred remains that make me feel like waking up is more masochistic than just falling completely away from life.
lately my depressions been the worst its ever i think ever but comparable to how it was a couple years ago. ive been on the verge of suicide twice within the past 2 weeks but i survived and im here. cant decide if its getting better for good or its just been an okay day. im technically undiagnosed since my parents refuse to acknowledge my mental health (i had a really bad anxiety/panic attack in front of my dad a couple days ago and he continued to scream at me through it and after, and then ignored the fact that i had an attack). ive started to hurt myself more recently lately bc ive been bad at coping with everything im feeling. i feel temporary. empty too. like i dont belong here. im also so disconnected from reality i barely remember existing or living through days anymore, and i become a completely different person when i get suicidal. is that normal? i feel like i have some sort of dissociative disorder, too, but idk. dont have the right kind of access to figure it out anyway.  but whatever lol. i made it through to today i survived. idk if i like myself for that or not. :/
I hate life and I hate myself but we all know that
“To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them. To die........  But that the dread of something after death, The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of?”  My current war in my mind—to continue to suffer in this cruel life, or to let go, though the unknown is more terrifying than the act itself. This quote brings me comfort, knowing that even characters suffer. But then I start to think about what would happen if I died, if I became ash once more. Who will remember me? What will I be remembered for, and how? What will happen to all my collections and my stuff, to my memories and the pictures I’ve taken? And then I get anxious, and panic, and go back to being depressed. Lol. Hope this quote gives someone a good thought session.
I just ate an easy mac, one noodle at a time, while sitting on my stairs, staring at nothing, leaning my head on the wall, and crying.   So that's my day.  Relationships of any kind apparently are not my strong suit. Except for one friend who was shipped away across the globe. ...thanks army. 🙄 I just wish to be able to see and hang out with her like we used to in undergrad & grad school. Pretty much my only support is now on the complete opposite time zone as me and I have so much to tell her
I feel like a perpetually sinking hole. I feel empty most of the time even though I have a great support system, a wonderful fiancé and a nice home. Nothing seems to make me happy. I’m afraid to take the next step into our relationship by having a child. I don’t want to pass this terrible mental health disorder onto my child. There’s just nothing I look forward to in the future. I feel like curling up into a ball every second of every day. I seriously don’t know how I’m even still functioning I feel like a ghost
Teared up a bit in the middle of work today and as I do school work now.
I can’t keep the voice in my head quiet today. I really needed to study for my test more. If I don’t pass I don’t get certified. I’m scared. I had all afternoon to study but I just shut down. I hate that I just shut down. I did well at the beginning of the semester but the voice in my head that screams “I can’t” is just so loud right now. Why the fuck am I like this. I feel like no matter how well I express my anxiety and depression there’s another voice in my head that invalidates me and makes me feel guilty. I can’t even tell what my real feelings are anymore. Earlier in college I was able to just not give a shit and take the test and scrape by with the bare minimum. But this time there’s really something on the line and I need to really show up, but I’m just caving in. I feel like a huge failure. How do other people my age get so excited for career fairs and job interviews, and have suits and ties and special resume paper? I feel like I missed the bus on my own life. My ex is employed at a good job, married, and working on another degree, and I’m at my parents house alone, procrastinating, panicking, struggling to finish a program to get a job that was my plan c, and just as depressed as the day she left 3 fucking years ago.  I’m just venting, I don’t really want advice, I know I shouldn’t compare myself to others. I’m already exercising, meditating, breathing, and getting enough sleep. It still gets to me sometimes and I just need an outlet.
I opened up to my friends and family. They finally started taking my problem seriously and they don't brush it off anymore. We might even see a psychiatrist :) i'm still not feeling well but i've noticed that telling the people around me what's going on took a huge weight off my back.  - forgive me if i made any mistakes. English isn't my first language.
On auto pilot I said I’ve been sitting in the easy chair, rocking rocking rocking all day. But need to be kinder. Today I got up early, got dressed, and made my bed. Emptied the dishwasher and filled it up again. Sink is bare. Coulda, shoulda done more. I took all my meds. Oh yeah! I found out my giftee on Secret Santa and did some stalking. I watched Jeopardy and knew the final question.  I did good enough.
I've just been crying all the time randomly for weeks now. I've not felt just "depressed" since I was a teenager, not really. And even then it had more of a.cause. but no now I am just depressed. I can't cope with anything and am feeling totally useless. The only reason I am not off work is because my office is only the room over from my bed. So tired of this. PTSD gave me something to fight. This is just a huge cloud of "give up"
I know this might sound dumb but juice wrld helped me with my depression because i felt like I related to him but when he died my hope died. My depression has gotten worse. Sometimes u really just think whats even the point anymore. I have been going through a lot of stress with school and everything going on. I just don't know how to bring this type of thing up in a talk with my parents. Anyways goodnight it feels good just to atleast tell this to someone even if it is a random person online.
I feel that my psychiatrists are just afraid of me taking my own life so they dispense meds to sedate me. They don’t want another suicide case and don’t wish to be implicated in the death of a patient.  To be honest no one cares and I’m merely another one of their cases. Just another patient taking meds and allowing pharmaceuticals to make a profit out of my depression.  Or are they really that compassionate for broken souls? I find it hard to trust them. Having a really bad day and my thoughts are distorted. Why am I so messed up. I’ve been suicidal since I was a kid. After all these years, I’m still suicidal. When will I not be?
I'm not doing well. Job hunt has gone poorly and I'm about to be almost homeless. My furlough is supposed to end Jan 16 where I could be sent to work somewhere. Supposed to be. My lease ends in Dec. Talked to Dad, he said I could stay with him until I get back to work, so I let my lease end.  Then during Thanksgiving meal he lets me know I can't stay with him. Because of his bitch of a wife. Great.   I have to fucking beg to be allowed to stay in a camper and can't enter the house at all.   Two weeks. I just needed a little help and compassion for two fucking weeks. Two. TWO.  I'm tired. So tired. So many years of trying to make things better. I'm trying to scrape up enough money so I can have a small little Christmas tree for me and my dog. I think this is going to be my last Christmas. I love my little dog, I don't want to leave him.
I feel like my head is a constant war zone. I cant actually remember the last time I smiled. Depression sucks.

Need to get it out.      Haven't done dishes in two days.   Don't have clean utensils to cook or eat.   Don't feel like cooking, out of vegetables and fruits don't feel like shopping for them.   Don't feel like washing clothes, exercising, studying.   I'm a hot mess right now idk why, I need to get back up.   I'll give myself 30 minutes to go back and study rest can take the backburner for today aswell

I have a drinking problem, but i don't care. Alcohol is the only thing that makes me somewhat happy, even if it is short lived haha.
Been in a miserable state for the last few days. I have post Covid tiredness and it's causing depression and lethargy. Lethargy means that I don't have the will to learn what I'm learning, which in turn causes depression. Vicious cycle.
I played piano for the first time in years today, my fingers arent what they used to be but it was still fun
i end up here a lot when i don't know what else to do. it's 3am. i'm really struggling with everything. i can barely get anything done as i'm so tired, i fall in and out of sleep for hours and i have absolutely no concentration when i'm trying to work. if i even THINK about school i start panicking i'm so behind. sometimes i don't even take the dog out for a walk and i feel so guilty about that. he has access to the garden whenever he wants but still...i don't even want to talk about hygenie right now but that's so hard to get done too, and i'm fucking up my body by being inconsistent with meds (occasionally forgetting a dose of my antiepileptics which is......not good, and straight up being too afraid to go to the gyno so i quit birth control cold turkey. not like i need the traditional effects...), and goddamn awful diet. grilled cheese sandwich has basically become my comfort food as it reminds me of my childhood and while there are days i don't eat it i'm just fixated for the time being. probably it'll pass as there was a long period where i put mayo on everything and that passed too. ...these sound like such petty concerns but everything is weighing me down and on top of everything i'm scared my relationships are going to detoriate, i'm much better with in-person communication, and while i do try to keep in touch nothing's really happening. it's the same. "hi, i really love you, i still feel like shit and think about death a lot. i do nothing worthwhile enough to mention. and what's up with you? :)" i really do love my friends but i'm so so scared. maybe it's irrational but i can't be honest about some stuff with most of my family, and one of my friends we're basically soulmates which sounds cheesy as fuck but insert that emily bronte quote about souls. that's kind of us. i don't know what i would do if i lost that. and also my family members - they can certainly be a bit much, especially my mum and stepmum, but they're doing their best and i know i'm batshit at this point and impossible to deal with sometimes. my little sister's the best at it, but she shouldn't have to manage her unstable older sister crying on the floor for the nth time this week on top of exams and friends and whatever else. god i don't know why i'm writing this. i told them i'd try to seek help but i'm a coward and i'm so scared. i got a book called "reasons to stay alive" or whatever the fuck for my birthday, cant be bothered to look up the english title, and i literally read the whole thing mostly without stopping as soon as i was alone. i cried a lot too. i don't know why i'm writing this...i'll probably feel insecure later over having posted so much info to the internet. whatever.
I feel like such a fuck up, I feel like everything is falling apart.
The word “I” feels so incredibly selfish when I say it, but there’s no replacement for it, so I’m trapped into using it. Two instances in that sentence.    So, so afraid to be alive. Stuck as me, for the rest of my life. Very afraid to be alive.
I feel like I’m just prolonging my life on anti depressants. A life that I’ve never asked for. I don’t know how to continue living if I can’t enjoy anything anymore.
Got told I procrastinate a lot/ am lazy what my family know not is I don't feel like doing anything just lying there.       I don't like to procrastinate, I want things be done ASAP, especially when they are in my control, but with anyone else being involved, especially when someone else is doing a favor for me, I don't push them. I get distracted once or twice aswell, but I don't do it because I'm lazy.      Anyways I'm out to sleep early today
Feeling like shit. Quarantine has gotten me so deep in self loathing that I don't know if I'll be able to be the positive 'test tasting every bakery' girl again. I also live with my grandmother, which has gotten me super paranoid about catching and spreading covid to her.
I wasted so many opportunities. This causes depression.

I'm sorry for everything....
Tired. Hoping for the right job which fulfills me where I don't count every minute.  This time of the year I am always getting sad because I regret some decisions in my life. Of course I cannot change it.  Please let me find myself and have job where I want to go. I don't care about earning lots of money just being happy with my loved one is enough.
I shouldn’t have procrastinated. It’s like I’m hooked to this high of anxiety and panic and my thoughts that then stray to you. I hate this helpless feeling and know it’s self-inflicted. Why do I do this. I know I can talk myself reasonably through this but I don’t want to. Or rather, I’m too on the edge right now.  How is it that the days go by so stressfully for me and you seem ok? How did you get over us... My heart clenches at this thought. Why am I so stuck on you?
4 more months until i graduate. no plans. have to move back in with abusive parents. scared to feel so afraid and trapped again. not hopeful. harder because i love this home i have right now so much. this room is everything to me and i have to give it up soon. so frightened. i live with this fear inside me and i try not to think of the end each day but it can’t be helped. will i ever be this free again. will i ever be free. will i ever be this happy. i just want a home like this forever.
I hate getting Covid. Instead of killing me, it has just made me mentally and physically tired.
feels like i've hit the edge of a cliff and there's nothing to do but try to cling on for as long as i can. my life has always had direction no matter how badly i may have been doing mentally but i'm at the end of the road now. there's just nothing left at this point. i'm not getting better mentally, nor do i really even want to but it's still so terrifying all the same thinking about what's coming next. or the absence of what's coming next i guess.   i feel like my grasp on everything is so loose right now and i feel so so close to just collapsing entirely. i don't want to spend the rest of my life sitting at home doing nothing every single day besides trying my best not to completely lose touch with reality. i don't know what to do anymore. i feel so fucking afraid.
Feeling alone and craving attention but I want no one to talk to me. Feeling lost and empty. Not sure what to do in my relationships anymore. Some days are hard and today is one of those days.
I failed an exam because my internet was slow to upload it. I don't know why I even bother with school fuck my life I can't keep trying to so this. I just want to give up
I want to cry, I feel hopeless.
3:26 AM, can't sleep. Too much to think about. I'm so lonely all the time. I can't open up to anyone. It's a safety thing. But it just hurts so much and I'm just so tired. Nobody ever has time or energy for me anyways. Nobody ever wants me around. Not like I have anything to contribute.
I don't know what happening to me. I've never felt so low. On one hand, I have an amazing, supportive boyfriend, I'm in a program I love, living in a great spot, and have a good counsellor, but I can't help what I'm feeling. Every night I can't fall asleep unless its 3, 4, 5 in the morning... which is completely out of character for me. My thoughts just face so badly and I think about everything that I did wrong in the day... i used to love being active, going outside, eating healthy, but I feel like I've forgotten everything that makes me feel good. i just don't know what to do anymore.
Trying to cope/distract myself as good as I can. Making christmas cookies today in an attempt to be "productive". Mood is so volatile, despairing so hard halt the time.  I got a letter today and immediatedly opened it (which is rare for me, because of anxiety I often can't open mail for weeks). It's a notice of default from a medical company I never even heard of who wants 150 bucks from me within one week. What??  I haven't ordered anything all year. Overwhelmed with everything. Anxiety obviously exploding since I opened the letter cause fearing my account got hacked or whatever, all the worst possibilities.   Struggling so hard with any bills, papers, banking. No matter how hard I try I can't understand it and constant memory loss makes all of it harder.   Trying to think what to do about that mail. Hoping it was just something my parents accidentally ordered in my name. Hoping it won't be super awful cause I can't even deal with ordinary life, any problems on top of that and I completely shut down.
I like to tell myself that I dont need anyone and I'm fine as an Individual when I've come to realize being alone all the time hurts. I have no friends and my last relationship was 5 years ago. Im 22 years old yet I'm thinking my life is almost over. Not from suicide, but from emotional pain and the fear of not being able to take care of myself properly. The thing I wish for most in this world is to find someone that really understands me because most people find me unlikable before they even get to know me.
I don't like my life.
I had a fucking terrible day...I bombed a presentation, had my menstrual disc leak while on rounds at work (thank god I was wearing a liner), the container with my lunch leaked on my clothes while I was walking back to the workroom, and now all my coworkers are treating me like I’m incompetent (pretty sure my boss thinks so too).  And my day’s not even over. How’s your day?
Alright I'm tired. Discovery tomorrow and I haven't prepared. Gonna just pee, drink water, shower, and figure out what I can do before tomorrow.  edit: alright did some hard stuff. Threw trash for a bit. Deposited money a bit.
I hate myself so much I wish I'd just die.
I am not into either of them. I am happy alone and after all this work is done, I just want to catch up on sleep. I could totally use some time just completely alone. Hibernation until the spring or summer.
i disassociated the other day, i wish i never came back  i really liked this girl i dont think she likes me back its okay at least i got my car and bunnies, and i broke my record for my mile time yesterday
I’m lonely, I know. But somehow when I thought back to intimate moments with my ex, I felt disgust. I guess I’m finally getting over him. And or going into a phrase of nunnery... and focus on me.
Today was not good. I hate working with people. I prefer working for myself by myself. Going to stick it out at this job for 3 years then quitting. Hopefully by then I will become a full time trader and become fianacially stable enough to not have to work and to do the things that I love.
Everything is piling up. It’s stressful
My pc broke down, I feel empty inside.
I'm an engineer of over 30 years in the field and I feel like I don't know jack shit. Nothing excites me any more. My hobbies I used to love are now just empty and boring. I love my wife and think she's the hottest thing around; I know she loves me too, but I don't think she's physically attracted to me any more.   I'm thinking I should just go outside in this 20°F weather, get drunk off a half bottle of whiskey, and pass out and die of hypothermia.
I don't know if I have depression but I had a terrible year, before, without and with covid.  Lost my grandma unexpectedly, at the same time a girl I knew ended her life, I didn't know her very well but she was really nice and did not expect it one bit.  I've been struggling with finding joy/happiness in the little things, I've been struggling with finding the motivation to get to sleep in the evening and getting out of bed in the morning, I had times where I'd rather had my heart stop in my sleep than wake up in the morning. I don't want to end my life because I directly saw and felt how it affects others (even those who you think don't care about you) I made myself the promise that no matter how bad it gets I can't end it if I haven't tried everything and I'm under 25.  I don't know what the purpose of this post is but it feels kinda good putting my thoughts I haven't shared with anyone on here.  Anyways, I feel a lot better now and feel like it's a longer lasting sense of being content with who I am en where I am. I actually feel somewhat optimistic about the/my future.  &#x200B;  Enough about me and my weird thoughts. How are you doing, stranger on the internet?
Waking up feeling like absolute shit today. Can barely move.  When I get to breakfast my parents tell me that my toddler nephew (who was ill the last days) had contact to a kid that has covid... and ofc my parents had to visit him this week despite it even being illegal here afaik.   So that means we all have to do a test again next week. I just hope nobody got it. I'm having so much anxiety and despair even on normal days, I can't deal with this on top of it.
Been struggling a bit lately, driving home from work yesterday there was a piece of wood in the road that I ran over and scratched my front bumper & I need to replace my headlights. 🙏 hoping things get better after today
I just don’t feel happiness anymore, I don’t feel connected with the people and world around me. I don’t feel like myself, I feel like a detached unlikeable shell of who I used to be. This has been going on for a few years and it feels like these changes are becoming more permanent with every passing month. I don’t know why it’s happened this way, I don’t think I can fix it and that hurts me so much. Because it’s only been getting worse and it’s been going on so long, I see no reason to hope that I might feel normal again one day. Therapy and medication has not helped.
I just feel so alone. I love my girlfriend so much and she is so supportive, but it gets hard not being able to see her as often as I'd like. I miss my dad and my cats so much. My dad passed away 2 years ago, and one of my cats passed away about 6 months before my dad did. My last surviving cat passed away the day after thanksgiving, 2019. I feel so lonely and hopeless. I hate the empty feeling that always creeps up on me. And I fucking hate having Tourette's.
Today was awful, my mom added extra work to my schedule (I’m homeschooled and my mom is my ‘teacher’) and I worked about 3 hours after my regular end time. And I still have work left over. Now I have to do it this weekend and I’m dreading it. I tried my second suicide attempt a few days ago and I keep thinking about how I failed. I just wish I could be happy.
Dri king again because I hate myself and why the fuck not. Ran through a fifth of whisky like it was nothing. About to get another and finish a bottle. Fuck it all. My wife went to bed without acknowledging my desire for sex so fuck it imma dri k the shit out of some whisky.aybr I'll do like I said yesterday and stumble outside dru k I. The cold and fucking die of hypothermia cuz I fucking hate my goddamn brain and the way it fucking things.
I (F14) may still be really young but i've been struggling with suicidal thoughts since i was 10/11 years old. I feel like no one is by my side at home and i'm just being a burden. I have really low self worth and in my eyes i wasn't born for myself (idk if that makes any sense), i'm still alive only because some people need me in some way. I'm terrified of the future, i fear that i won't be able to get a job and start my own life. Everything's gotten worse during quarantine, suicidal thoughts turned into real plans and i don't see any meaning in life anymore. Sometimes i think i'm making things up and that i should just suck it up and stop bothering others, especially because i'm just a teenager and people keep telling me that i don't know anything about life yet. A few weeks ago i opened up to my family, they were really supporting at first. My mom would check up on me every day to see if i ate, if i showered and if i got out of bed, but i guess it was too tiring, because it lasted for two weeks and then everything came back to normal as if my mental health just magically got better.I know i probably sound a bit salty but i'm just so frustrated with constanly getting forced support and i'm so tired of not being taken seriously. I would write more but i have so much stuff on my mind right now i feel like i'm about to vomit... On one hand i want to end my life as soon as possible but on the other, i still have so much more to experience in life and if i killed myself now, i would never be able to do anything. I'm torn apart and it just hurts a lot.  Please forgive me if i made any mistakes, english is not my first language. I'm also really sorry for jumping from topic to topic here, i feel really overwhelmed and i'm not sure how to put everything in words nicely.
I found out my mom was practically looking at every little thing I do. I was looking through old family photos on her computer and I found a few pictures of my iPad with my discord notifications, and texts from my friends. I later found out that she sent them to my dad and they proceeded to talk shit about me. Not only that but I found out one of my closest friends are cutting, I already had one friend commit suicide and if one more does I’m going to as well, she’s basically my only friend, all the others ignore me. My week has been awful, I just need a hug.
It’s so hard to get up and try.  I’m in college (at home with my mom bc covid) and on winter break right now. My tuition is incredibly expensive and I don’t know how I’ll make it next fall. I have a scholarship that depends on a high gpa and I’m maintaining it so far, but it’s weighing heavy on me mentally. Even with the scholarship I have to come up with 30k, plus a place to live, a car, etc. I can’t get a job bc the children I live with are high risk for Covid. I’ve really been applying and trying for remote jobs but I’ve gotten nothing but rejections, IF I get a reply at all. Its hard to try when I know nothing is coming out of it. I thought of sex work and/or Only Fans but Im afraid for my supposed future career. Even if I did work it wouldn’t be enough for school though. I’m trying for outside scholarships but it would literally take a miracle.   And that’s just the stress from school.   I’ve started cutting, being hygienic is a daily battle, I was almost accused of cheating in school and was going to kill myself bc of it (I’m already 20k in debt from one year of school. They would have kicked me out and Id have debt with no degree. My mom would have kicked me out for being a failure. I have nothing outside of her and school.)   I’m barely hanging on.  False hope and fear of hurting my siblings feelings and leaving my family with the burden of my debt is the only thing keeping me alive.   Everyday is terrible and I’m getting closer and closer to when I’ll need all that money.

I can't function. I'm useless. I'm a burden to those who know me. I ruin everyone's time. I think that I am being selfish in having a partner. She deserves someone successful. I feel no connection to my family(mum dad). I feel like it's an inevitably and I'm just holding on for some reason. good luck everybody else
I need some disappearing ink
I've been awake like 30 minutes and I already can't stop crying. My family's really dysfunctional but had been doing mostly ok for honestly the past year so I'd both forgiven them for things I was previously really hurt by and those instances have been far enough in the past that it felt plausible that maybe they'd changed, but this past week has just dredged up everything and thrown it right back in my face that they're all still the same, and in one case even worse than I'd previously thought. This whole thing's so fucking hopeless and it only gets worse from here
I am tired of feeling angry and sad. I am tired of feeling manipulated and controlled. I am tired of working hard and not reaping the benefits. I hate everyone I meet because I think they will use me or leech off of me in some way. I dont trust anyone and I hate everyone.
Takes so much courage and will power to not give in to my depression and surrender to the path of alcohol.
Alone for Christmas. Need I say more? I feel like everyone has forgotten about me. Oh sure, you’ll be fine just being entirely alone on Christmas. Why should we even try to ask how you are? Why should we even visit you on your birthday two days later?
I realize that self-loathing and self-sabotage Is the factor Of my depression. i really hate myself. Everything. The way i Speak,thinking,etc. Every mistake is like the fatal blow that hits me. I could not even take step forward.
I'm grateful for my therapist. She told me that she is going to be out for six weeks, and I'll miss her. However, another therapist is stepping in for her, and she's also really great. It feels like therapy is one of the only things giving me hope right now. I'm very depressed, and I don't feel like I'll ever escape my bad situation.
Today is a hard start to the holidays on Christmas Eve morning the thoughts started to sink in that my ex that I broke up with a week ago could possibly be seeing somebody else already.   I wont let that ruin the holidays and I’ll look for other ways to get through this and enjoy Christmas with my family and not let these thoughts torture me.
Suffering the entire day. Working for my family while getting abused by them. Mother throwing shit at me she wouldn't dare with my older brother but hey if you aren't able to defend yourself you deserve it.   This constant abuse. Fighting over every small thing. Being dependent on toxic people.  Hate my family and hate christmas.
I thought the holiday blues weren't going to come after me, but I guess I underestimated it.  Fuck the holidays and every memory that comes with it.
Unable to see family and can barely afford our mortgage, nevermind gifts. Lost the first job I ever felt truly fulfilled in doing. Ran out of savings. Turned down for food stamps. No idea how we will survive. Govt won’t help. With a history of tragic losses around this time of year it’s always been hard around the holidays but everything finally broke me this year. I really can’t take any more.
I have to keep telling myself that I am alone and can't rely on anyone else
I am so depressed that in the middle of sharing what i m going through, my thoughts were, 'who cares?'
Increased my Opipramol dose and feeling much better now.
Feel like I'm being smothered by my own self-doubt. Everyone I know is doing better, and I'm just trying to find anything I like doing at all and not given to the constant voice telling me to hurt myself because I'm worthless and stupid.   I can't even get the people I live with to use my pronouns. I can't move out and everything seems utterly bereft of meaning or value.
Lame Christmas Eve.  We decided to "cancel" Christmas get-togethers out of an abundance of caution for the parents.  So these will be just like any day pretty much.  I have zero Christmas spirit and only a smidge of the regular Christmas sentimentality.  It's been a horrible year and decade.
in the past, i've thought of setting a goal of the age i want to reach before i end myself. the very first number was 30. then i realized that i have a younger sibling i have to take care of until they can stand up on their own and i raised it to 35, just in case. now, years later, i've shifted through various moods, highs (or what can be considered 'high') and lows (low that just goes lower every time) and it never really got any less than 30 because every time i do, i always remember the sibling that potentially needs me sometime in the future.  but now, i think if i can live on for two more years, i'll call it a grand miracle.  it gets harder to live. it gets harder to live with people. it gets harder to live with family, people who you thought you could be yourself with but instead get alienated for the very thing you hoped to have understanding for. it gets harder to live in a place i've always thought home but i've painfully realized isn't really home anymore. or was it ever home?  in the past, i've set the bar on the method to end myself as something less gorey, quick and painless, with certain locations and other details that i now laughably consider as naive, foolish and impossibly luxurious plans. now i drag the bar lower and lower and that scares me. i've resolved myself that when i'm going to end it all, i'll do it in a place where, at least, won't be close to where my family are living. but now, i'm slowly slipping down the slippery slope of not caring anymore.   one day i'm just going to look down a building and think that i'm done and jump, uncaring of who i am with or where i am or if it hurts or if i'll regret it or anything at all.  just as long as it ends. just let it end.  (all this hurt will melt into apathy, eventually. it's already starting to. just as it always does. can't tell if this is wrong or right.)
A week ago I took my older sister to the ER because she said she was feeling suicidal. I am proud she reached out to me, but I feel like I can't reach out to her or anyone else. I always feel like I'm a bother to others no matter what they say, and Christmas is always stressful for me because I live in a house full of people. I am trying to get better at reaching out to people, but the only friends I've ever had were either one of my mom's friends kids or my older siblings friends and their younger siblings. Needless to say I feel like any friendship I've had wasn't real. I just want to feel happy, I always feel sorta empty. I feel guilty that I feel the way I do when others have it so much worse. And I wish I could feel loved or except that love. Sorry for ranting...
**Trigger Warning for suicidal ideation:** I'm crying on and off I don't know where else to turn to I've exhausted my discord support....  I'm thinking about killing myself tonight I can't stop these thoughts. I want to go to a bridge and jump off it. I'm a failure in life. I don't like the person I am. I don't recognise myself. Every day things get further and further away. I'm scared. It seems like this is the only way the only way for things to end. It won't get better....
i don’t know what to do. i feel drained i feel so done and so helpless that i don’t know what to even do. i’ve been shutting out everyone and laying in bed without making a noise.
It's only gotten worse in 24 hours. I took Christmas Eve off to be with my mom, my only family, the only thing close to a friend I have, and I've been more alone than when I'm at work with some of the best people I've ever known - even though I've only been working there since August.  We ate a hearty lunch today and got really sleepy, so agreed that we'd take naps and reconvene later. I've been up for two hours waiting for her so we could watch more movies or a game or something, and she's been up secretly talking to one of her old high school girl friends and cleaning in her bedroom - two things she promised she would wait until I'm back at my full time job to do - while I've been waiting.  I am hurt beyond words. I am such a piece of shit that this Christmas I spent so much effort and more money than either of us can spend on gifts over the past four months. I got really personal things she would never think I would think of. I work in a thrift store, so every week when something nice came in that I knew she would love, I would put it aside until I could buy it.  I'm so mad at myself. I'm so stupid, she's been the most selfish person for years. Abusive in so many ways. But she's still the only person I have and I'm literally stuck with her. I thought things would be different, especially since she knows my mental health has been very bad.  I'm one more panic attack away from caving my head in with a baseball bat I keep for self-defense. I have never felt more alone and still somehow surprised at how things could have gotten any worse this year.  It's been a wretched year and she's still somehow made it worse for me.  I wish I'd spent the money on myself like I usually do with my bipolar impulse shopping, even though I always feel guilty. But at least I'd be marginally more happy.
i am in such desperate need of dopamine. i dont even have the energy to say the details. im so fucking depressed. i contemplate suicide every fucking night. i do not see ANY future where im happy. i am so lonely and miserable. i do the same shit every fucking day. im so tired of it.
I haven't had any (real) physical contact with people in over 10 yrs. With real I mean holding a hand, a supporting shoulder, or a hug, or more.  The lack of affection is sooooooo painful.
Why can’t I just enjoy anything I once had interest in?
All I do is game and sleep. I don't help around doing chores. I don't cook. All I do is freeload. Tried to help dad few days ago with some chores, but got scolded due to some mistake. Now I don't have any motivation to help with anything. I don't go out of my room. Seldom ate. Tried to have lunch before but my siblings kept their mouth shut when I go out of my room. I feel worthless.
I keep feeling fucking miserable. I hate my life. I feel like shit for having ended up in this kinda life. I could have made different decisions and ended up somewhere else. But I guess I'd still be more or less miserable. I was always broken, there are no good options for someone like me.  I survived this year but what's the point.  Maybe I'll start cutting myself again. My other coping methods haven't been working. Downside is it makes husband upset, but maybe he should be. And if he's angry at least he's paying attention to me.
Today I’m feeling a bit more lonely and sad than other days, but I’m pushing through. Recognizing that I need to put effort to get the support systems I need, so I’m reaching out to loved ones. Trying to silence the negative talk in my head and focus on self care/wellness. Reparenting myself will be a core focus for today.
Brother's family is visiting my parent's place. So fucking stressful and exhausting. A two-year old who yells as loud as he can during dinner, just for fun. I got social anxiety and react very sensitively to people who don't know any social boundaries... like small children.   My brother is even more exhausting. Being inconsiderate and annoying but if you say any word of criticism he acts offended and like you did everything wrong while he's just trying.   Family made me so kaput when growing up. Older brother being a pita for anyone else, so 'naturally' the younger child has to behave very very well, be quiet, don't require any attention or resources.  And even after recognizing this today I am still my parents servants partly in the hope they leave me alone but also because of dependencies I can't break. Even more afraid from the outside world. Fuck
i really regret how i handled some people in the past
finally trying to get out my depressive hole and going for a job interview tomorrow, hopefully i get the job. i’m really nervous since i have social anxiety too, please keep me in ya’lls thoughts that i get the job :(
So much anger towards the athority figures in my life.
My talk therapy appointment is today
I think by this point we've established that I'm too much of a coward to kill myself but I really really really wish I didn't have to live the rest of my life as such a trash person.
Im on zoloft now. So I feel like shit for only 15hrs a sday
Had a strange surge of optimism waking up today. I hope 2021 goes well.
Another year to spend in pain
feel like shit 24/7. so lonely. oh my god.
I am done, I fully accept that I want to die as I have no motivation, or dreams, or cares
I don't want to be conscious right now. I kind of wish I could get really extremely stoned or trip on mushrooms, or get very drunk. But I don't have those and I don't drink so. I'm eating fudge. I raise a piece of fudge to the end of this absolute horror show year.
Was kinda hoping that at least my sister would be home tonight and we could share a smoke but guess I can't even have that. My siblings are all gone and I'm just here alone with my parents. Thinking I might just go to bed early 'cause I feel like shit.
I've had nightmares that made more sense than this.
Birthday in a month and I don't think I'll make it. Can't handle the disappointment from after I fail to get into a master's program. My only goal to keep swimming. Even if I did I wouldn't have been able to finish it I was just delaying the inevitable. I can't watch others move past me and I'll always be stuck catching up but never good enough
I started thinking about cutting my ex out of my life. Spent almost half my life with her and even after we broke up she was my best friend. She has been getting more and more distant and I feel like I mean so little to her now. Our relationship is so lopsided with how much I still depend on her to keep myself stable and how little I seem to matter to her in comparison. I don't know if I would make it being completely alone without her but it feels impossible to move on in any part of my life.
I am pretty tired I think. Less deep violent sadness and more of dull resignation lately.
I am so sick and tired of getting hurt and left for someone else. It is humiliating. I can not wait until I get into a relationship with someone who genuienlly cares about me and will put me first. I feel so worthless right now. All my exes have moved on while I am single and can barely find anyone to be in a relationship with and who wants to be in a relationship with me. I feel worthless, lonely, depressed and suicidal. Crying helps a little. I dont even know why I cry I am not in a good mental place to be in a relationship. I just hate the lonliness.
I keep on buying video games thinking, hey this might be something I could play when I'm no longer depressed. Well, things aren't going the way I wanted it to be it seems.
So very tired
I’m losing my will to live. I don’t feel like fighting anymore. I can’t do this anymore I’m so fucking tired and I’m so hurt

[deleted]
I want someone to notice my problems wish I had someone who could understand me. I feel so hollow and alone. Everything is getting worse.
I haven't talked to most of my old friends in forever. Just too ashamed to not be working. It shouldn't even matter. Haven't talked to my old therapist either.    Got a ton of calls today as this is the first day everyone is off vacation. It's stressful just replying to them and talking about how I haven't worked in a while. Makes me feel like a PoS which isn't fair. I was being lazy.    I'm also tired today. Trying to trudge since I didn't sleep enough last night because I was trying to fix my computer after moving some stuff from the SSD. I'll apply for some jobs on linkedin and then sleep early later today.  edit: I'm watching The Wizard of Lies. The Madoff ponzi scheme that no one detected. I feel like Madoff a little bit, how I let my problems get worse and worse over time digging myself into a bigger lie. At least my lie isn't $50 billion big lol.
I am just getting back to school after winter break. My depression is often triggered by my anxiety which is triggered largely by school. I was feeling really normal over break, it was remarkable how easier it was to do anything. My first day back was today and it was pretty rough. I stayed up all night last night thinking about school, and then slept through most of my (online) classes today. I’m up and showered now but it’s a harsh reality remembering how my brain makes simple tasks kind of painful. I’m going to try and eat and exercise and work on some school, and I have therapy tomorrow so this hopefully won’t continue to spiral. Mainly it just sucks to remember that life can suck, but it’s nothing I haven’t handled before.
I don't think I'm going to make it through the night without ending it all.
I started a new job recently. I don't think I have enough experience of the day to day work to say that I hate it but I can see myself being bored down the line. I give it maybe two years before I get listless and want to leave again.  I know I sometimes tell people that wfh is bad for me because going into the office gives me some sense of normalcy. But now I cannot imagine having to go into the office and meet people again. At least at home I can work from bed when I feel like it. I can slack off and nobody would know.  Personally, I was the happiest when I was only doing my side gig. If I didn't have to worry about my "career growth" and "skills development" and if the job actually pays enough\* for me to support myself, I would totally do the side gig only. (\*it's actually enough for my monthly expenses, just insufficient if I wish to buy a place in the future or smth).
Everyone else is loving working remotely and dreading going back to the office. Then there's me who hasn't worked during the covid lockdown or even before that.    I'm frightened by the prospect of programming interviews. It's ok, this is normal, as is procrastinating and not doing prep earlier or thinking of doing it.    I'll look for books. I don't know which one. There's so many options so I guess I'll just use codeacademy since I'm used to it? Also considered cracking the coding interview.    Family pressure to get married is big too. At least I'm not a girl lol. Like I just went to get a thread and needle to sew my pants and I get comments from my dad about how I should just find a girl to do it.  edit: Not too productive right now. Gonna journal my thoughts as I go.
it's hard to ask for help and be ignored.  I think it's even harder to ask for help, get told "you can talk to me, I'm here for you, I'll listen" and then have your messages ignored when you open up like they invited you to.  I'm tired of being worthless. I'm tired of being a joke to everyone. I'm tired of being alone. nothing I do is good enough. I just want everything to stop.
This is the lowest I feel for months. Some asshole sued my family business. He want so much money which is more than my net worth. I can't do anything. For two days I haven't slept. We talked this all day with my family. While this is being awful, I didn't want to show bad emotions in front of them because I dont want them to feel worse. I feel phsycal pressure on my brain. Ps all this made me realise what a priviledge my ex's support was. This is me today. Waiting time to pass, may be everything end up not so bad.
i need to learn how to be more humble  i tend to brag and try to be better than everyone because im insecure. it has a negative effect on people.   plus i need to learn to be more positive. im too negative
I honestly just don't see the point of living anymore. I feel completely worthless, unlovable, and so lonely. I kind of wish I just fail this next semester of college so I have a good excuse to kill myself. That's all I think about anymore and how I'll never amount to anything. I don't understand what's wrong with me, I just want to feel happy again.
I'm in a rutt. I lost my job due to my executive dysfunction getting the best of me. The only two options is to find another one, or go back to school. I hate both, and I really would rather die than work or go back to college.
You know that feeling when realize the people that you consider close friends don't feel the same about you? I know better than to call them best friends, but just close friends. I feel so alone. Another birthday came and went and nobody cared. I know people who celebrate their birthday month. I can't even get anyone together for an actual day.
It's all my fault. I wasted hundreds of opportunities to do better, be better, put myself in a better position and be around better people. These are the consequences of being a waster.
Memories of my life when things were better makes me passively suicidal on a good day.
I know it's not much.   But I cleaned the house, did the dishes, changed bed sheets and pillow cover, put them for washing, only need to make food now, which I don't have the energy for at the moment, but I will eat home cooked meal today and do all the things planned
why do I lose my motivation to do anything? Somedays I complete my goals and it makes me feel good, I think I'm finally catching up but after some times I fall 10 steps back. This makes me so demotivated I don't know why this happens I fucking hate my pathetic self. I want to cry so bad
I really do just feel destined for suicide some days. It's like I can fool myself most days into thinking that's not how my death will likely go, but every now I get a terrible reminder of just how not cut out for this I am.
it’s been almost a month since i broke my arm and all the people that i thought were my friends abandoned me. which i didn’t really understand and none of them would give me a reason why when i tried to talk to them. i’ve been trying to fill my time up with things just to keep me busy to take my mind off of what’s happened to me but it hasn’t really gone well. i feel completely alone
It's so surreal that old friends I grew up with are out here building careers and starting families while I'm just struggling to finish a semester without withdrawing.
I have a weird habit of oversharing. Attempted to tell one of my coworkers (I’ve been working there for ~5mos) that my stomach lining is deteriorating, I have a failing organ, and I’m on a rocky slope with a DPH addiction. What in the world would make this person want to know this about me?  Anyways. Slowly got back on the DPH train. It’s pretty awful. But it feels like safe? It feels like, normal. As if being happy is too hard or incorrect for me. But misery, sadness, and an inability to wake up is correct. Like it’s how I should feel. Oh, and I keep taking too much DPH, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen in hopes an organ fails, or my stomach lining will be completely destroyed so I can’t eat, or maybe even just like — I’ll die.
I tried a coding test but failed. I should've copied the code that I found online but I wanted to write it myself for fear they'd see I copied and pasted in the submissions. Basically afraid I'd be caught for cheating. Didn't finish the last question in time. It was a tough one though.    Parents went on about things they didn't understand like learning a problem I'd never see again. I'm inquisitive and reflective so I looked into the problem. But it was more for fun as I'll never see that exact problem again.    Dad thought I was saying I wanted to cheat when I brought up that cheating was common in these tests. Then started to try to tell stories of how he's not a cheater and he's so much better than me. Rather not listen so I left and ate. Now I can't sleep.   I need to apply for more jobs. It was only one test and even if I passed I'd have to do an interview with a person.
I'm so tired of everything. Of trying to find a path to happiness. Of telling myself that maybe tomorrow I won't feel so bad. There is always another tomorrow but they are all the same.
"We are just depressed kids telling others like us that suicide isn't a good option"
Every time I try to get my thoughts out of my head I just can't. Is there something wrong with me? Am I an idiot? It's so clear to me when I'm alone what I'm dealing with and how I feel, but every time I try to communicate that it's completely different. Your own mind really is your worst enemy...
Feeling better after panic attack as I'm curled up on floor currently. Praying I can get through this day without any more anxiety triggering events
just got some honestly horrifying news. I don't know how I can ever show my face again. god. someone please cut off my head.
The rest of my life is dependant on a number I get in a class when I'm 17. How the fuck is that fair?
Hi, idk what i feel half the time. Everything is going downhill as always but I'm feeling lonely this time and i really want to curl up and die. Though I know it is not the solution.
I've been in a new relationship for about a month and I keep having days where I slide into depression and it's been getting worse. I have doubts all the time, I can't smile at them without feeling sad, I don't even know what my feelings for them are anymore or if they're still there. It's hard to have good daydreams about anything, they fall apart too fast to hold on to. All I do is go to work, go home, sit in my room and pass the time until I can sleep. I feel worthless
My mind always feels like its about to explode. I can't even study properly fuck this shit. Just give me peace for some time. I don't remember when was the last time I felt peace in my mind.
I’m just not sure what to do anymore. I’ve tried so many medications. Tried therapy. Tried better help. Tried a leave of absence from work. I honestly just hate so much right now. I want a baby so badly. We’re having fertility problems. I hate my obese self. I feel like I’m now just too old to get back to where I want to be and enjoy what life has to offer. All I’ve ever wanted was to be a mom. Seeing everyone so happy and moving forward with life while I sit here and do nothing day after day is all too much. I’ve been on edge and just moody/angry about everything since about September. Last night I broke down. Told my husband maybe I’m better off not living. What’s the point anymore? I’m just numb. Idk. I’m not sure what or who can help me anymore. The last few weeks have been nothing but bad news. I want just one thing to work out. Work or money or baby or health. Thanks for letting me vent.
I've got so much anger inside me, towards authority figures in my life. I just hope it doesn't boil over and result in a tragedy.
Woke up feeling ok, called my boyfriend and realized I'm incredibly sensitive again today, and now I just feel really terrible again and like my day's ruined.
14 days completely off meds.   The "i dont give a flying fuck about anything" has crept back in  Got a therapy appointment for Wednesday.   Am I doomed to need meds to survive? Stay tuned to find out i guess
Feel like sleeping but not sleepy. I slept 8 hours last night, tried to nap today earlier. I just didn't feel like doing anything productive today. Which shouldn't matter. I should do stuff even if I don't feel like it.    I just want to lay in bed.
I have so much to say but I'm too scared.
I'm at my limit. I've had enough of this life.
New years resolution was to be more social. I've barely left the house so far
Emotionally drained.. Unmotivated
Im horrible, I shoul die, I want to erase myself
Stuck in a toxic friend group who continuously takes advantage of me and when I've finally gotten the courage to call them out on it, they group against me and insist they're trying to help me. They believe it themselves. If I had any pride or any semblance of care about my wellbeing, I'd have left them a long time ago. But I can't find the courage to do it. They're all I have, and I am too afraid to be alone again.
It's 3:33am. I haven't done anything productive since my nap.    The whole day was spent playing games and making a trip to the bank. I need to get up early because my parents keep making comments about me getting up late and I hate it and also they say stuff about how I'm not married basically aimed at my brother and how I only play games. I need to get out of this toxic environment.    One way to do that is to get a job. One company I'm interviewing for, the recruiter asked me for referrals. I lied about a role on my resume to cover a gap so I'm worried about the referral. It's stressing me out.
im so unhealthy and unhappy all the time. i doubt im gonna make it past 20
I'm living in a toxic household. My mom micro-manages me and is emotionally abusive (i.e. saying my anxiety and depression is self-induced after my great grandma died in October of last year). She thinks that I shouldn't have the internet because of her belief that everyone on the internet is evil. She heavily restricts me on my electronics to the point where I can't make friends . Everytime I've asked her about me doing art commissions, she just walks off. I have no irl friends to speak of and the only person I hang out with is my dad and my dogs. My sister cosigns on everything my mother says and doesn't care about my feelings at all.  My ADHD and asthma have been exacerbated over the past couple of months and it's been getting harder to get out of bed in the morning. I constantly feel lonely irl even when I'm around family.
I can’t believe I’m here but I was just checking the symptoms of depression on healthline and I feel like I can tick every single one. I’m feeling unmotivated, at times embarrassed about my past or just about my general existence.I feel like there’s been too long since I last felt passionate about something. I don’t remember what connecting to a person feels like anymore either. I have friends and a loving family and completed all my studies and I still crave more from life and I’m unhappy if I don’t have it. The journey is so hard to get everything you want and my constant craving makes me wonder if I’ll ever be satisfied. I look at my friends who are doing 10 things at once, are always busy and so very organised and just ask myself why can’t I be like that? I barely have enough energy to make myself food.
I'm doing ok everyone. I'm here to try to stop feeling bad before I actually do. I've been dealing with a lot of body image issues and fears about being compared to my boyfriend. He gets more attention that I do from others and I worry I'm not good enough for him.   He sends me shirtless pictures and I immediately feel down when I receive them. I wish I just didn't have to feel like I'm not ok. I just can't get myself to believe him when he compliments me.
Recently, I feel like I've relapsed back in to the cold dark abyss. Cant't seem to get anything done and got no motivation on anything. Sorry if this doesn't belong, but just felt like I needed to share.
I’ve been depressed for months and last ten days have been real bad. I’m so tired of this feeling. My life was turned upside down from covid on so many levels. I’m Trying to recover. Trying. With depression it is like pushing a Boulder up a mountain. So tiring all the time
so i ended up with no friends or anything no direction in life just a dysmorphic issues, eating disorders, gender confusion, zero self esteem, and just overall sadness. someone has a cig for me? teeth are yellow regardless and i seem to be extremely ugly anyway so it doesnt matter how much every puff ages me. i just wish to be dead. there is simply no reason for me to be around. i am not important in anyones life. bitch i dont even know how to socialise. i hate my brain so fucking much. i am so incredibly lonely and i have nothing to do about it 😃
Okay maybe moving wont cure anyone of depression, but is it not worth a try to escape cov**
And I thought I was getting better. Last day of break before I have to go back to work and I know for sure that's not the case. As I suspected, I was only doing better cuz so wasn't doing anything. I was spending all day everyday playing video games, listening to music and hanging out with my roommates so I never had anything to be anxious or sad about. Now I know that's over and I'm going back to work tomorrow and all the anxiety and misery comes back immediately. I've been working there for almost two years, why am I nervous?? Apparently I can only be okay if I don't have any responsibilities or commitments at all. Doing nothing is the only thing that I can handle. The main reason I could handle it is because my roommates are here too. We're not gonna live here forever, what am I gonna do when I'm living by myself and working a job that's actually stressful? Even if I'm not working, I won't be happy doing nothing while alone. This month was great, but I should've known it wouldn't last. I guess I'm just destined to never be okay.
Living in America in my early 30s.  AKA  Waiting to die.
I thought that after this semester, I'd stop feeling anxious. The day after I submitted my last assignment, my stomach wouldn't stop cramping up and my chest was hurting. I haven't had a depressive episode in a long time. But I feel like I took too long to notice this time and I find myself caught in a rut. I haven't been able to sleep for the past three days and my chest always hurts. I hate feeling like this. I hate this ongoing battle. It's so difficult to keep going sometimes.
I can’t go on, I’m so sad and lonely, I don’t want to cry anymore but nothing eve changes, no one tries to be friends with me no matter how hard I try, I’m blessed to have like 2, but I hurts seeing all these people congregate. I hate majoring in theatre, no one talks to me but a few. I can’t imagine going on anymore. If only I could die or stop existing. This why I cling to idols, they’re all I have
thought today would be manageable, if not good.  ended up getting bad news about a family member's health, fucked up at work, got belittled by my mom (who relies on me to support her but treats me badly) and finally scoped out a place to kill myself.  sometimes it just doesn't get better.
I think I've given up. Not in terms of wanting to die but given up to feel things like I used to.  Just feeling numb about things now and I'm tired.
[deleted]
I'm thinking of ending things. I've always had these thoughts, but I think about it a lot more lately. While I'm working, eating, bathing, etc. I'm married with no kids, husband is well great in all his ways but I still want to leave him all alone in this world. I don't have many friends, I don't think anyone actually likes me enough anyhow. I think I'm more of a tolerance. I hate my mother, she's one of the many reasons I'm like this. Yes, I've done the therapy, and on the meds but the feeling never really goes away. I used to have a best friend, but she turned out to be extremely toxic. I try to be optimistic and think hey it could be a hell of a lot worse, I could have a freaking flesh eating disease orrrrrr a missing limb, something horrendous, but the thought is always there. Taking up space. Maybe things will be different on the other side.
Everyday I just keep thinking of something that happened 18-19 years ago. Many many times during a day my thoughts are drawn to that incident. I keep thinking about how unfair it was, different ways I should have handled it, revenge on the person who caused it. What happened was not egregiously bad, it was just a run of the mill graduate school experience. Why I let my graduate advisor live rent free in my head is beyond me. I just want it to stop; but I don't expect it will.
Still feel like shit
My mother calls me "damaged goods." I don't know what it means.
Do you think I will want to die forever? Its been a long time. I always thought I would kill myself before now, yet here I am.
7 1/2 years give or take a month or so into a job I hate, the work isn't terrible just repetitive beyond belief (doing the same thing roughly 500 times a day) my work hours are usually 50-60 hours a week i work overtime to keep up with bills I won't get a pension so retiring at 30 years in isn't really plausible, and every time I try to work on improving myself or building skills I just get overwhelmed, I get maybe an hour or two in the mornings to try to study programming (the time I get just depends on how hard it is to get myself out of bed and accepting of a new day of monotony) though without a degree I wonder if ill ever be able to leave my current job. I hate every second in here and honestly it hurts my soul, I take no pride in my work and what I do, I just think about how stuck I am all day long and it just hurts so much, im tired of being here, im tired of struggling with depression every day out of work i remember how happy I can be to the point where I debate just getting fired and losing my house....i just want to be happy
Been crying on and off all day. I have no motivation to finish my dissertation even though everyone's been pushing me to, given how much time I've spent on it despite having very little actual progress to show for it. I hate every step of the process and the fact that I've wasted so much of my life angsting over it. I feel so ashamed and wish I could disappear, but I don't ever want to put my mom through something like that again (she's already had a family member go missing, and I won't do that to her).
I've had a horrible day. A dear friend was talking about how unhappy he is and i fucked it up by saying that im surprised he's in the state he is. I've always thought he's happy because he seems like he's got his life sorted out from my perspective. I apologized but i still feel like it rlly shows how much of a terrible person i am. I went out to get groceries to clear my head but when i walked down a quiet alley some racist lady took off her mask to cough at me and called me asian slurs. Then when i bought my dinner home it spilled out of the container and into the bag. Now my parents are demanding a reason for why i didn't call them today. I'm just.. tired. I don't know why i'm still doing this. I wish i could stop. I have no purpose to live. I don't see how it gets any better.. i don't think i even deserve any better. All i do is take advantage of and hurt people
Was at a dinner when people started asking about my work... I lost my appetite after I had to explain that I had quit my job. So yeah  Everything's tough. I wonder if I could ever find a job that is not miserable.
Hey guys! Back again for another round of absolute dogshit luck running all of my efforts so far into the limestone below the earth's surface it reaches the mantel. And there's not a god damned thing I can do about it. Best part. When I think the pendulum has reached the bottom of its swing, it cocks back and drops even further. Fucking fun! Isn't it? Oh. And it's FUCKING RAINING WHILE IM WORKING OUTSIDE ON A DAMNED SUNDAY AND I JUST WANNA GO HOME!
People like me more when they don't truly know me. They like the facade I make for myself, but when they start to get to know me as a person... They pull back. I don't understand what is wrong with me that nobody wants to stay around, even though I'm careful never to even breathe anything negative for worry that it'll push people away... Seems that doesn't matter after all, people back away regardless. What's the point of trying
My depression is at an all time high. Seeing everything going on in the world. The pandemic, fires along the US west coast due to climate change, politics, the world in chaos. It’s hard for me to see any light through this darkness. I’m terrified of the future and death is constantly on my mind. I feel like if I take myself out of the equation it’s one less human damaging this earth. I just feel like a burden to everything. But I’m too coward to act upon it
I downloaded a nice game to play to clear my mind last week. But the novelty wore off soon. Now I'm back in a rut, not wanting to enjoy anything and unable to be productive.   I hope I hear back from either the part time or full time jobs I've applied to. Job search is a long dark tunnel
Whole family is super deep into esoteric stuff and that was also part of what made and kept me ill for such a long time. They also allow zero criticism of all that so you just have to keep your mouth shut and just make it through some way.  And I couldn't/can't go to actual doctors for various other reasons so it's just a whole mess all around.
I moved out of my moms house because I dont like things her boyfriend says to be and my brother and actions he makes , she never listens , and now I'm always worrying about other people's mental health and it's really gets to me because I feel powerless and worthless. I  dont feel real and life seems so not worth it. Ive been trying to get a better head space since I was 11, I'm 18 now and I'm still depressed. I dont think I'm good enough for anyone,  I'm scared for my future, I dont think I'm going to get anywhere , ive never had a job before because the thought of putting myself out there makes me panic, and it makes me feel even more shitty seeing my boyfriend do everything he can for me and I dont know what yo do with myself.. I feel like I'm terrified of everything. I cant even hang out with friends anymore even though as much as I want to I just feel so not normal. I dont even know how I feel anymore , I hate myself and my life but I just want to be happy. I've done so many different things I dont know..
I can't tell if I'm depressed or angry (at things I can't change).
Anxiety  is killing me man and I cant do anything except just suffer. No one cares about me I hope something kills me soon  I just cant
I’m paralyzed. I have so much I should be doing, so many people I could be talking to and hanging out with, and I just can’t do any of it. I’m stuck falling deeper and deeper into this hole.
The future gets more uncertain with each passing week and the only constant prediction I have is that we probably aren't at the lowest point yet. So far I have been correct.   Despite the uncertainty I'm still managing to stay curious and hopeful about the future. It's still possible for things to get better, for me and the world at large. I dont know what's gonna happen and but all means it could be awful, but I still wanna stick around and find out. At least for now.
I haven't left the house in a few days. 17 days since my last post here.   I'm just going to go out and grab a burger at bk since it's whopper Wednesday. Maybe get some vitamins at the pharmacy.    I'm very self conscious on these trips. So many students. They work harder than me, and I'm old enough that I shouldn't be alone at school. Though I doubt I'd be recognized by anyone.    Rest of the day I'll try to find a cafe. It sucks though that there's so many places with students. I hate taking up spots. Like I don't deserve the spot for however long I'm there. But I can't be productive at home.
Not doing well today. Hope things will look up once I regulate my food and sleep a little.
I just dont know. Nothings wrong in my life and I might just be overreacting but everyday os slow and boring and im tired. I think about suicide and Im trying to get clean from sh right now. Still in my head its a battle between nothings wrong im just sad, and maybe I need to talk to someone. I hate this. A lot. Im so confused and tired.
It's kinda stupid, but my friends said they don't like my D&D game, and well it was my main tool to keep in touch with them and get out of the house, so now I'm afraid I'll lose contact with them
I think I'm getting a better grasp of what I have to do to stay sane, basically monitoring cravings and accepting them without giving in.  I've cut my parents out for 1.5 years. I'm 5 months free of self harm, 1 week free of weed, next I want to give up porn.   I still think there is a demon inside of me that can come out at any time. I think the self hatred goes way deeper than I've managed to see yet. I got some psychedelics that I'm going to be trying in the next few days.   I've got basically no support system, I'm doing this on my own. The downside is no one to say they're proud of me. But I hate when people say that anyway. In the end I'll probably always be alone. But maybe the psychedelics will break something and allow me to enjoy company again. We'll see.
I am fucking terrible I want to die I am fucking terrible I want to die I am fucking terrible I want to die I am fucking terrible I want to die
I got shadowbanned from a sub I'm guessing because of all the self-loathing I do there. But the reason for that is the nonstop bullying I get there. So many mean people there love fueling my self-hatred and suicidal urges. I've never been banned from anywhere before :(
Can't believe that I have to come back here so soon, but my sisters both had a mental breakdown thanks to my parents and now they're off in a hotel somewhere while I'm trying to mitigate the damage at home :')  Despite my father agreeing with my advice on better communication, he immediately went off the deep end by saying he hated how my sisters talked about him to their "mutual friends." The reason that's in quotations is because it turns out, my father _doesn't_ believe in the concept of friendship, and that everyone will backstab you at some point or another. "WHY DON'T THEY TELL ME THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ME" he says, as he continues to do things that make them distrust him and turn to their friends. Because if you need advice on how to approach a certain person, you need to get advice from that particular person in question; that's his logic and it boggles me on how... Wrong it is? How the fuck does that work?  The thing is, my dad _is_ a good person; it's just that he's so painfully unaware of what he's doing, and so insistent that he's right. My sister thinks he might be bipolar and in hindsight, I think she might be right. Considering that I take after my dad somewhat (down to having the same birthmark in the same spot even), now I'm worried that I might be bipolar in some way too, how fun!  TL;DR - My sisters are breaking down, my dad's doing too damn much, and now I'm worried that he and I are actually bipolar, please end me
Frustrated and tired of everything. I fucked up, it fucking hurts
First time posting here. The lockdown coincided with a fall out with my ONLY friend which kicked off severe depression.  Went on Viibryd but reduced dose on advice from Dr 2 weeks ago. Went downhill from there, burned the last bridge I had with former friend and cried myself to sleep last night. Feeling like there is no solution that will relieve the pain.
My sleep's been shit lately. I can barely even walk in a straight line. And yet I still can't fucking sleep.  I wonder if this breaking down is causing this sudden dive into the depths?  It's a very surreal drowning at the moment, I'm not fighting it. I know I ought to, but I just want to sleep
I moved to a new city with my family in the midst of this corona BS and I’ve been here for almost three months without making any friends. I feel so low and alone. I’m coming to terms with the idea that the only steadfast companion I’ll have is my loneliness. All my closest friends were on a Zoom call to celebrate a birthday and I couldn’t bring myself to say anything at all. I just sat there in silence until I had to hang up so I could cry. Nobody noticed when I left I guess. I’m so lonely.
It keeps getting worse but I think I'm at my limit of tolerating it. I went for a run tonight because I was just so sick of the brain fog and apathy and feeling horrible. It kind of helped?   I'm mildly afraid I'll be like this forever. After my run I thought I was fine but then the weird panic/heart palpitations showed up which wake me up when I get them.   Maybe I should see a doctor lmao
Trying to study. Gonna work hard but where’s my motivation at. Sigh.
I know there’s people I can reach out to for help, and I know they don’t see me as a burden. But I see myself as someone who doesn’t deserve help. I feel like I deserve to suffer.
I’ve been crying almost all day everyday this week and I just want it to end. I’ve been drinking more water and trying to get more sleep but nothing is helping and I feel like I’m only going to get worse. I begin crying at work and thank god for the mask and I tell customers I have allergies. I have no allergies and have no idea if this is even allergy season.
Trigger warning  New here, but it seems like this might be just the thing I need.  Lately I’ve been spiraling lashing out. Forgetting to eat barely sleeping. Everything feels like a chore. I moved from Cali to VA and my parents lost their home. I keep telling my mom everything’s going to be ok that I’ll move back home to help. She refuses my invitation to come home and help. So I send what I can. I feel like a failure. I feel like I should’ve been there to help, that maybe I would’ve convinced them to do things different to help evacuate. I know realistically I would’ve been just as stressed. I’m told it’s some kind of guilt. Idk. My parents home was always my home, I always knew that no matter how hard life got I always had a room. Now I just feel like I’m hopeless. I’m barely hanging on. I’ve recently started vividly imagining how it would feel to hurt myself. I dream about it to the point it’s making me not want to sleep when I can sleep. I how ever did  make myself an appointment, to see a new counselor, hurray making small steps. And I’m down 15 ish pounds I’m trying to look at some positive side of things... so right now I fee like a mess...
I’m so fucking drained. I just feel so tired of putting on a fake ass smile. I don’t really wanna be here anymore. The only thing I really wanna do now is take a bunch of sleeping pills and try again tomorrow. But it always just makes me feel worse. Idk what to do I’m stuck. I’m always stuck. Bruh I’m just so alone and taken advantage of 24/7 I don’t know why I do it anymore.
I'm gonna meet my old classmates for a retake subject and it irritates me a lot. Those old bad memories cannot be erased inside my head.
I get crazy upset about stuff I'm not even sure is real. Gotta ignore it, and get better. then get paranoid about my manic episodes online.
When you finally notice you don't actually know how to talk to other people at all. All you know is pretending you're listening and saying the right kind of reactions at the same time so the other one is happy. This works flawlessly with older adults who expect absolutely nothing from you and just want to endlessly talk to someone. Nobody expects you to be an active participant in a discussion so everyone is happy, right? Except for you who suffers more and more every year.   All this shit doesn't actually work with other young people because they're not so shallow, not so full of lies. They're simple just bored of you and look for someone else instead who is actually interesting and can engage them.  Can't express how bad all of this, being trapped in this awful personality, being this spineless doormat, trying for years to develop better social skills and having barely any progress, stuck in countless discussions where you're trying _so hard_ to contribute something and your fucking brain isn't able to generate anything no matter how much you try.
tbh one of my biggest problems that I create for myself is that I crave validation and I want to be liked, but I'm an inherently unlikeable person who most people don't want to associate with because they find me annoying or embarrassing. which I am, of course. I've tried to change over the years. to be better. but I've never been able to figure out exactly what it is about me that people dislike so much, so I haven't been able to fix it.  it's probably the desperation. or just the general air of how pathetic and boring I am. I don't know. I just always wanted to be a good friend and have good friends in return. never worked out that way, though. and I'm tired of trying when there's no point. it's painful to end up alone every time.
I suffer from cervical syndrome for 2+ years and I never fully recovered because I can't afford medical treatment (I'm unemployed and don't have any health insurance, also because of this coronavirus situation). When it's acting up, I feel an incredible pain from my neck down to my spine and my whole right arm. Today was the day when it gets really painful, so I went to see a doctor just to ask some painkiller. That doctor was being an asshole and doesn't acknowledge my pain. I'm so angry and I can't stop crying because the burst of emotions and my pain.   I can't really do anything about it because due to the pandemic I'm stuck with my toxic parents. I had to clean the whole house and cook for them. Meanwhile I myself has to do job-seeking stuffs where it gets very soul-crushing. If I complained about the amount of chores that I have to do, they're always gaslighting me. So I just silently hide my pain all the time. This time I just can't, and my parents told me to see that doctor despite they knew he is a huge jerk. I really regret that because now I feel more miserable than before.   I already have suicidal thoughts for a long time, and now I'm thinking why am I still alive, why I have to suffer like this... I really want to put this to the end.
It just takes the slightest most pathetically insignificant thing to send me spiralling into an abyss of self loathing again.
I feel so empty. I’ve always felt so empty. And then I get this overwhelming feeling of sadness and my head tells my everything is so pointless. I just want to sleep and never wake up. I hate life. I hate everyone. I hate me. I go to sleep and wake up everyday and say damn, I woke up again, and I know I should guilty because some people would die to just be alive another day where I want the complete opposite. I used drugs as my outlet the past year and a half but I’m trying to stop since it was a bad coping mechanism and I ended up telling my dad I was addicted. But my body is craving them hard right now especially since I am so depressed. I workout to help it also but drugs always make me feel better. I’m so tempted to get some but I feel guilty cause I don’t want to have to hide taking them especially when I’m going to see my bf. I don’t know what to do I just want to leave.
I spend most of my time when I'm on my own fantasizing about being someone else. There's just nothing in like that I want to do anymore. When I'm not with friends, I just sit and can't being myself to do anything but listen to music or just sit and fantasize about a better life. I was able to distract myself with a video game today, but that doesn't always work. I'm actually worried that I won't be able to do my school work. I increased my meds and felt so much better for like 3 days and now I'm even worse than before. Everyone around me is so happy and has so much going for them despite the pandemic and I just don't want to be alive anymore. All I can ever do now is go for walks and listen to music. Why does life have to be like this? Why can't I just be okay? I'm so fucking sick of this why the fuck can't have a life I'm so fucking miserable
Having a family but them not being anything like a family really hurts. I wish they’re dead. Then I could properly mourn them then move on with my life. What’s left of it at least. But they are alive and well. Doing way better than me but practically disowned me because I wasn’t what they’ve wanted. I’m a nuisance. You do whatever possible to be loved. Good grades. Good job. Steady job in this age at that. Not bringing home ridiculously unfit partner. Independent. A good person. I’m that. But I would never be enough to compare to that golden boy. Oh to be a boy. To be a man. How extraordinary. And how extraordinarily misfortunate I am. I wish they were dead. Then I could mourn them and close the case. But no it’s not possible. I’m the one who’s poor and rotting, they are prosperous and thriving. It’s like I am an orphan. Alone. Totally. Anne of green gables had a home. She had a parental figures who are generous and kind. My blood parents and sibling are alive and well and it seems to me that they are enjoying my misfortune. They never call me or text me first. I am rotting here. Rotting away. In this tiny studio apartment. And they ate living in an extravagant home, which would cost my life times 10, then still not be enough to purchase. The equivalent of that house has been bequeathed to my younger brother, when I’m just set aside with nothing. How can I live like this. To continue this life. I’m not sure.
Is my depression even real when almost all of the causes are just environmental. Mostly concerning money. I’m not sure. Maybe it means that I’m a loser with no real prospect in financial independence. It’s bad. I’m tired.
Every time I have episode, my family looks at me like i’m crazy. I can’t help but feel more and more alone—no one, not even my family, can show me any compassion when i’m already going out of mind. I hate it. I want it to go away.
I just want someone to be proud of me
***Blegh.***
found out im just a temporary feelings for him. how wonderful
Struggling to focus in school and at work. Can't eat, can't wake up on time, chronically late. I'm so disappointed in myself.
Why does long walks with my dog make me even more upset. They said exercising is gonna help. What’s gonna help. I feel so hopeless.
I hate weekends so much. My friends always seem to have plans with their significant others . I’m so thankful I go back to work next week but I’m also dreading it . My sleep schedule is going to be a bitch to adjust to.
having a bad night emotionally. it's hard knowing that I can't talk to anyone except for a therapist, and I don't have access to one. there's just no hope anymore. hasn't been for a long time. nothing is going to get better. I'm ready to be go away.
I’m done with all of it. I’m sick of being hated, I’m tired of being treated like shit. Why live if everyone hates me and I’m alone forever
I really feel like I'm alone now. The world is quiet except for my thoughts which don't have any outlet. I wonder if that will make it any easier for others.
I am worried that after restrictions are eased and all the stores and places I go to reopen, that all they won't be open anymore. I just feel like there is nowhere in this world for me offline or in real life and there is no point to living because of it.
I am lonely and I don't know what to do. I can't eat and I feel so tired and weak, I've lost a lot of weight and I don't look well. I have to walk a mile to go to the shops and I really don't have the energy. This is the first day living by myself and I didn't expect to feel so abandoned and socially isolated (i'm in uni halls).
I feel like I'm dying. My body feels as though it's growing more and more numb with each passing week. I'm speaking in terms of emotion. My joy from reading, watching tv, playing games diminshed, then joy from eating, listening to music, sleeping doesn't feel refreshing and I feel annoyed at having to be awake. Just being conscious is painful. My life is going nowhere and I'm throwing away my future. I don't have the energy to go on.
Had a bad 3 weeks. Suicidal ideation is ramping up and my Cymbalta 40mg just stopped working for me. Got in with my family care doc and got a different med but also referral to psych dr. Haven't seen one in a long long time. Hopefully in a couple of weeks my mental state will be improving.  Sometimes to make to the next day it's all about surviving hour by hour. And if that's what it takes, that's what I'll try and do.
I keep self-harming. there are people that love me and people I love, and I know that I'm lucky bc of that, but it just makes me feel guilty about this sadness consuming me. sometimes I think I should get as far away as possible from all of them, that way I couldn't hurt them. I feel so worthless and pathetic, I don't deserve anything. I think I'm not gonna kill myself for now, because it would affect those people too much, but it's hard. I don't wanna talk about it to anyone, I'm glad this place exists.
I did not work the whole week last week. I am afraid of going back to work today because we have a meeting where we basically report what we've done, but I have nothing to show. I told my manager last week that I have a family problem and he understood. But still I feel guilty for not working. This is also the first time that I acknowledge that I maybe suffering from depression. I deactivated my social media accounts just to lessen the things in my head and started to reach out to friends and family... Still it's not getting better for me.
I haven't been able to sleep well for weeks now. I go to bed early and end up getting nightmares and waking up at 4am and not being able to sleep again. My new job sucks. I don't know how much longer I can keep going.
Fuck me i suck at everything and I have no motivation or self discipline whatsoever, i feel like a failure everyday
I have no one else to share this with.  I brushed my teeth for the first time in over a week. That left me exhausted but I'm proud of myself for taking that step.  Next: taking a shower
i am numb. so numb. i am exhausted for no reason. i just want to scream. and cry. i know it’s pathetic but i’m really fucking tired. i’m sorry
No sleep. Mind racing.   I'm stuck in a hotel on a work trip. I've had a completely shit day. I cried to my mom for an hour on the phone. I just fucking hate looking at myself. I'm worried I'm just never going to be good enough.  To make it worse, having to see my boyfriend post a picture and get thousands of upvotes here and people shower it with comments; and then if I ever do, I’m overlooked. I never used to care this much about what people think, but it’s eating me away.   I’ll never post another picture again.
I must be lying to myself. This "depression" is just something I want to suffer with so I have something that makes me "special". Because it hurts too much to accept that I am below average and it is no one's fault but mine. So in my daydreams I created a depressed person, to be special, and I adopted her into myself. It's just a sham like everything else I imagine. Just pathetic wishful thinking from someone who will never amount to anything, from an idiot who thinks she can be special, from someone who is no one to everybody, nobody to anyone. Pathetic.
I was feeling so much better until an unscheduled phone interview made me instantly depressed. The HR already made me not want to work there even before I even got any offer. I'll follow my heart.   Nowadays I see a lot more posts and comments about how depressing work is. I still suffer from the trauma of my past job. Hated it to the core.
As days go by, depression is getting worst but I have to fight through it
I'm 15 and I don't think I'm gonna be alive within a year.
[deleted]
I thought maybe today I’d get out of bed. Maybe I wouldn’t wake up crying and everything that’s happened had all been a bad dream. Nope. Back to bed.
i want to beat my head in with a brick
I feel insane. I'm so dead inside that I can't even bring myself to do anything but lie down, but then I get up and go to work and I'm so happy and confident. It's the first time in so long that I remember being happy to be myself. It was an EXTREMELY stressful shift too, but I wasn't stressed. Now I'm home lying on the floor and that's all gone. Once again I'm dead inside and wish I was someone else.
[deleted]
I've been depressed and extremely stressed out for the past couple of weeks. I didnt think my senior year of high school would be this stressful. But between having 50 assignments and 30 assements and an ongoing graduation requirement project and applying to colleges ive been extremely depressed and stressed out, I've cut multiple times and I honestly don't know what to do anymore, I feel like i can't do anything and that I don't wanna do this anymore.
Anybody else has family members you don't get along with but can't live alone because your mental health will definitely be the end of you? I'm currently in this position and i really don't know what to do - business has fallen flat, investments sitting there collecting dust, not qualified enough, rent taking away all your savings, etc. I'm fed up of tv and the media in general, all my instruments are getting rusty because playing them brings me no pleasure, neither does art or anything else, i'm even tired of sleeping because the more i sleep i get physical pain. Pain awake, pain asleep, pain inside, pain every bloody day you can't escape it.  I just feel like going to sleep and never waking back up.
i need to catch up on a shit ton of missing homework and it's all just washing up on me and everything is due in like 2 hours and i need to do an entire essay, do two quizzes, and a literature exam. it's so hard. and i'm having a bad grieving day over my bird so today's rough.
Yeah i have put most of her stuff in what used to be the bedroom and have the door shut and i just sleep on the couch in the living room and try not to go in there for now thanks for the advice ill see if i cant figure something out for the rest of the stuff as well i need to do something.
For the longest time I hated Ellen and David Dobrik but then someone asked me why ? And I couldn’t respond didn’t have a reason , I hate them because there happy and if there so happy then why have I felt the way i have for so long it’s not fair I’ve had be an adult sense grade 5 that’s unfair I never got to be a kid , I was making sure my dads still breathing at night after at his house so that in the morning he could yell at me for ruining his life and how he should have stopped at 2 kids and then at my moms having to deal with a woman who hates the fact that I can’t be controlled and used as a weapon because I’m to old and I know her well enough, none of my parents like me and No girl has ever found me attractive all of this had lead to me being a Miserable and depressed so lonely that I’m poring my heart out to strangers
Dealing with an existential crisis after seeing some family posts.
This afternoon I’ve been having thoughts of I wanna die. Now I’m having vivid images of death. What a day!
Everything is dull and doesn't matter
My sister has made me feel ill because she did something so shitty.   I want to disappear and be forgotten about.
hi im back again life feels dull, i feel alone, wandering as an empty shell in a field, wanting for life to mean anything, feeling like wasnt meant to exist or to feel happiness, it all feels off, and dumb. catch myself sinking myself back in the past as it sinks its teeth back into my soul, didnt mean to do things that happened, wanting to apologize for the billionth time, wanting to make things better but its been so long. might be just loneliness and the emptiness in my chest. i want to mean something for someone, want to believe i am worth something. i am not. i hate my job i hate my mind i hate how i look i hate everything about me i hate the way i acted i hate how i toss my friends away i hate how i treat people i dont know why i am the way i am i am so fucking tired i am genuinely going fucking insane screaming like a banshee in my car every day to work to let some of the energy out im so ...    out of it   im not meant for this planet.  im not meant to exist amidst the people here not for this society i am useless. a joke. someone who can be exploited, someone who will just be living an unfulfilling life. its okay. i just want to go instead. disappear. i am simply too tired to think anything better is going to happen. i have no idea what to do anyway.
I want to cry
My SO fucking hates me and I don't know how to be a better person for her
my bones feel like they’re sagging. I feel empty and cold and i try to make jokes to make others laugh and make me laugh but they’re just bland and i can tell people are sick of me. i’m just so tired. i say this to people and they tell me to get some sleep but it’s not sleep tired. it’s emotionally tired. i’m drained i physically can’t keep doing this anymore. i don’t even want to kill myself anymore i just feel empty, no happiness, no sadness, no anger. my body can’t take feeling anymore and just shit them off. but i can’t be alive without them. if i do feel emotions it’s sad i’m just so done with this.
nighttime is always the worst. im just here with my thoughts. my thoughts of isolation and loneliness. sometimes i cant sleep because of just the sheer sadness of it. atleast i have the sounds of cars honking to accompany me as i lie awake thinking about how sad my life is
My therapist is now severely ill and i need to find a new one. The last one dismissed all my worries as me overthinking it. She's not even answering my question about at what point do i need medication, and whether it helps me to be better.  Yesterday i felt really lonely and disconnected, and those suicidal ideation keep coming back. I'm so tired.
Should I continue living and be a burden to everyone I know?????
Therapy doesn't fucking work. I hate life, I hate myself. I don't have anything to live for I just wish badly that I wasn't afraid of death
I feel... pain and grief and jealousy.  I wish my feelings were understood, I wish I had friends.
I was at a high point for a while, but I'm getting dragged back down. I'm still trying to keep going, but little negatives are getting magnified. And the good things don't have the same impact as they did. I thought i was climbing up out of the hole, but all I did was grab hold of the edge with another hand.
i dont know whats happening
Feeling really depressed and heartbroken I dont even know why I try anymore. I just want this hurt to stop. I got played and humiliated bad now I feel so worthless. The anxiety and the fact that I cant afford medications or therapy does not help. I dont want to die I just want to run away from all my problems.
I want to bang my head on the wall
I am tired. And I snapped at my family today. And I feel like I don't care and it would take a lot of energy to talk to them and fix it. But I will becaudr I have to and it's expected. Sometimes I feel like I pretend that I care when I really don't. I think I will show remorse that I don't even feel. They tell me I should care about my situation otherwise why should they? They love me but I am tired. Sometimes I don't know whether I even want to get better. If I don't want to get better why should they help me? I want to sleep and not wake up. I feel like I want to get out of my own skin. I don't want to live with me. I have been having chest pain for a week or more and headaches every day. I laughed while talking with my sister about how I snapped at them and told her that this conversation was funny. "You have to care" but what if i don't? Maybe I am being weak and I just can't fight it but I am tired. I always ask them: What do you want from me? What do you want me to do? Just tell me, I will do it, and then this conversation can end and we can skip all this talk.  The only psychologist I saw kept talking about how I have to get up, I have to do it, I just have to. So I stopped seeing her, it felt like she was saying things that I already know and that my family already tells me.... It basically felt useless.  I will sleep again, maybe I will wake up not feeling sad or numb, maybe I will wake up as someone who feels remorse or care...
Man, I have a shitty personality. Always assume the worst in other people. Just not good for other people.
I dont know if I'm in the right place, but here it goes..  I've always had anxiety issues since I was a kid, mostly fear of crowds and constantly worrying about people close to me wellbeing. Over the past 2 years or so I seem to be getting worse, Im increasingly easy to annoy, negative and maybe partially due to Coronavirus, much more distant with my loved ones (although I think this was starting to happen before Corona).. I just dont know whats wrong with me, Im starting to get even scarier feelings like Im literally going to fall off the face of the earth and viewing everything around me like some grey cloud is keeping me from enjoying it(if that makes sense). I don't know what's wrong with me and why it's getting worse, I dont have suicidal thoughts, but I do view life with an almost indifference now. Do you guys think this is still anxiety? Or am I becoming depressed and just going to keep getting worse?
i recently got put on antidepressants and i don't even know if they're working that well. my sleeping schedule is so fucked because of school. it's a morning pill, which means i have to wake up. my sleeping schedule was already bad before i started. i didn't know i would be prescribed right away. i stay up late at night. then go to sleep at 6 am then wake up to take it around two hours apart so far. it's maybe been about a week and a half.   i just need to do my work and then my schedule will be good again. but, i am 26 and still in college and it's taking me literally forever to get a ba. (i have an aa already with a low gpa) i am just not seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. it's bleak and dark and it feels empty. i still don't know what i am going to do   i feel like i should have never went to college. i should have given up a long time ago. i could never concentrate on anything. i wasted years and so much of my mom's money. i had jobs too and paid my way through some of it, but mostly it was her. i don't know why i never had the motivation. there was never a feeling of anything hanging over me like "this school is expensive and your parents are paying for it, try really hard to make them proud", it was always like me and thinking about the next day. i never thought about my future the right way.   idk. it's just a really low down feeling .
Well, I've been unemployed for 2 months now. I left my last job because suddenly they had no work in the middle of the work season, it was such a toxic work environment I removed myself because it was effecting my mental health so negatively. Legitimatly had a huge mental break down before working on my last project for them because they were asking so much of me but refusing to acknowledge or compensate me for my effort, experience and qualifications. They even promoted a few people with less experience and fewer qualifications than me. I've had a couple interviews but nothing has even come close to a job offer. I have a B.S. and is starting to feel like I wasted 5 years of my life to not be recognized for it.   I'm defeated.
what do you guys do on weekends? I'm always just so bored, not interested in doing *anything* and it sucks.
entering into another episode and i don’t know how i’m going to stay afloat. no health insurance so no therapy and it’s putting a strain on my relationship. i wish i could get help.
I’m so done with everything honestly. I struggle to get anything done, I have the attention span of a 5 year old, I cry every day for absolutely no reason, family doesn’t even believe in depression, wait, I’m not even clinically diagnosed, so I guess I can’t say I have depression. But yeah, everything feels like it’s falling apart, I don’t even know what to make of my life anymore, I hate everything and I’m pretty sure everything hates me, my will to live is so far out the window I wonder where it went. Good gosh, I’m so tired of all this. How do you make it stop?
Wow haven't typed heree in a fucking long time but i just wanna say im in progress of getting better i distract myself from pain as much as i can i accept being alone finally that's destined to me i just fuck up everything anyway so why not stay alone as i am am not gonna lie to my self i know that if i have someone it would be better but am not thinking about it as much as i used to just thank good that my health is kinda back right now after long time with illness slow progress but noticable atleast i am not crying 24/7 hope everyone here gets better too
I'm so weak
Everything hurts, things don't give me as much pleasue as they used to. I feel so drained all the time, despite me sleeping and taking naps. Im trying to get my IT certifications but i couldnt focus and i put it off for a while now im so behind. I already feel like ive done nothing with my life so far. It just doesnt feel worth the effort to keep going on.
everything is so fucking boring now. everything i used to enjoy doing just seems so pointless and i'd rather die than live a boring fucking pointless life
Got locked in my dorm’s stairwell, sister didn’t even notice/care, told my mom just to yelled at. Yeah it’s my fault, do you think I don’t know that? Regret calling her. Just need time to cry
I had a few breakdowns this week as I lost control of my life. I am so embarrassed being a server for 3 years with a masters degree and a full page of publications and presentations/awards in my field. I feel like I have zero control of my life or my externalities, except through drinking. I am so tired of being gaslit, especially by politicians. I have really hurt to come to terms with being excited for once over the prospect of T-bag dying. I am so exhausted from policing people to follow C19 regulations.  I dont know what else to tell you all. I just keep putting out fires and am trying so hard to break the cycle. I need a win, somewhere.
man, i wanna die again
i feel miserable.
I feel the suicidal thoughts creeping back in. Trying to plan what to do with my life and realizing just how much the world and life is set up against you is hard. I don't think I can really make it in life, at least not in the current way life is supposed to be.
Spoiler alert + TW  Hi everyone :) October is made for ghost stories, so I sat down with a cup of vegetable soup, my cat and a copy of Shadow over Innsmouth by everyone's favorite weirdo, Mr. Lovecraft. I never thought I'd take to his stories like I have, but there's something about them that speaks without words, ironic as that may sound. This was especially true for Shadow. I really connected with the main character and narrator. I haven't with a HPL character before. I've come for the curiosity and stayed for the rich atmosphere while often feeling alienated (no pun intended) by the characters themselves. Shadow was very different for Dagon knows what reason. Reading it, I suddenly felt as if watched by a horde of inbred fishpeople myself. The MC's despair and confusion as he's hunted is palpable and the pages smell of dead fish and seafoam. The ending was the best part, though. I was actually quite touched when the MC decides not only to embrace his origins, but also spring his cousin from the asylum so they can go live in the sea together. Aww. My cousin would never do that for me, that's for sure.  After 19 months of crippling depression interspersed with psychotic episodes, self harm, suicide attempt  and appetite loss to the point where my hair fell out in clumps and my friends had to help me eat, I'm finally at a point where things are good. I'm gonna wake up tomorrow and it's fine. That's nice. That's all I ever wanted.
I wish I could just disappear for a while. Like *blip* I am erased from everyone's minds for a month or two. So I could use that time to try and figure myself out.
I don’t like coming home to myself. I just got back from my boyfriend’s and once i got home i couldn’t help but cry because I couldn’t shake the sadness off this time.

Recently have been dreading hanging out with friends, haven’t been hungry in the mornings, eating less in general. Last night I went to sleep at 8:30 pm because I have nothing to be awake for. Woke up at 7:30 am and am still tired. I just want to sleep, it’s my new favorite hobby.
Does anyone do self destructive things like overspending or disordered eating as a form of self harm? I have days where I feel angry about everything and think "Well it doesn't matter, I'm gonna die miserable anyway" and throw my money away shopping. I also have this thing where I binge eat nothing but cookies for two days in a row and don't eat any actual food - meat, vegetables, etc. I buy junk food, or I receive it as a gift in christmas stocking or something, then as soon as I have it I feel like I don't deserve it and need to get rid of it, and the way I get rid of it is by binging. But sometimes I will throw it out. I feel anxious and overwhelmed having junk food in my presence for some reason. I can't stand having it, yet I love it.
God, the world was already shit. The pandemic just made it worse. And it's never going to get better.  I just want to give up. Not die, just stay in bed forever.
I am depressed af. Everyday I think about suicide and how good it would be to just stop it all. Yet I cant, I cannot make my parents and best friend suffer, even if they cannot help me in my current state, nor they have any idea what I am going through, that is the only thing keeping me alive. It is exhausting. I hope anyone reading these lines understands that you are not alone, I embrace you and hug everybody dealing with this horrible condition. Please take care. I love you all.
I always put too much faith into people being empathetic. I’ve tried to mask my depression with humor, so reaching out in a serious situation results in a lot of shittalking about how I’m not a good person, and I deserve it. These aren’t things I would say to anybody. The fact that I have received it makes me know that the creator of this world will continue to punish me for as long as I live. I must deserve such pain in some way. My self is nobody, finding that is beyond anything attainable. Everything has gone wrong, nobody wants to help. I am drowning.
Really feeling depressed today. Been a rough week,  anxious because of outside factors, depressed because I can't control my emotions and anger like usual, resulting in me raging at those I love the most. Currently tuning out listening to some music trying to find my centre 🙉
Today is not good.  I'm really struggling to feel anything good about myself. I'm sitting here at my desk staring at the screen, not doing anything because I can't concentrate. Nothing I do matters, and I don't understand the point of keeping going any more. I want to die. It's too difficult to keep going.
I've just realized how self-destructive I am. I often use my self care and health as a bargaining chip against my parents. And I'm 22. I say this like "If [something] doesn't happen, I'm not taking a shower," as if it affects them. Maybe it does to some extent, seeing what kind of person I've grown to be. I hope that now I'm aware of it I'll stop doing it.  Also, last night I tried staying awake for some game and failed. I was literally gagging, shivering, and tearing up. I really need to respect myself more.
Old friend finally wants me back in his life cuz he needs support again. Or at least that's how his message comes across. I really don't like people who do that, once you unfriend / block me at all our meeting sites you're dead to me. But sure, come crawling back asking for help again. How about no fuck you.  Meanwhile I feel bad even thinking about doing that, because I just know I'll let him back in and be used yet again. I can't help it.  Being me sucks.
my hygiene’s gone out the window since my college classes started and i got tiny acne on my elbows and knees and even one on my throat?? how does that even happen
Fuck, I wish I was dead. Why am I even still alive? It's not like I'm doing anything even remotely useful or successful with my life.
I just feel awful today. I haven’t felt this terrible in a long long time and I don’t know how to make it stop.
I can slowly feel my mental health slipping away again. It's been years since I've felt this way and I'm familiar with the path and where it leads me to. I'm trying to stop and fix myself by doing things I enjoy but again they don't bring me any satisfaction. I feel like shit constantly, I try to regularly hang out with friends but nothing changes and its a constant nagging feeling in the back of my head the whole time. I just want to feel happy and motivated again.
Discovered edibles, they help in numbing things out. But do they change the thoughts no.  Got high today cuz I’ve realized I lost the respect of my little brothers, the last people to actually see me as some proper, grown adult. Now I’m just the most pitiful member of the family, which is fine, I’ve always been a pitiful person.
I've been doing EMDR for the past 3x weeks. Began wellbutrin and TMS on Monday. I've moved from thoughts of wanting to kill myself to being upset that I was born at all, which I think is an improvement.
Feeling so much pain in my chest since morning. I can even move properly. Fuck just kill me already. Every day when I make my mind to do some thing productive some shit happens with me last two days it was anxiety attacks now Its this fucking chest pain. What the fuck in supposed to do now.
**Trigger warning suicide:** What am I still doing here? I'm disabled, a failure and alone. I told myself that I'd kill myself by now.   It occurs to me that other people get vacations, happiness and a constant stream of good things. My life has been misery since the start. I haven't even been able to properly exist. Why can't it end. I just want it to end.
Action support thread  I’m not sure if something like this already exists, or wether it will be immediately clear what I'm talking about.   I find a lot of use in things like accountability threads, public todolist etc. I find it gives me more traction when I say something, or write something out, publicly.   When I’m depressed though, like right now, I feel ridiculous because of the tiny things that would constitute achievement.  Ie. Tidying for five minutes, brushing my teeth, making my bed, showering etc.   But if I’m posting in the context of a community struggling with mental health, it’s different.   It’s now 4pm where I am, for the rest of my day I will track tiny tasks (or a bigger if I catch a thermal) knowing that I will post them here at the end. I will post tasks and little journal entries as I go.  *wasnt sure  where to post this.
I think I deserve it.
Pretty stupid, but I cried a little after the watching the blackpink documentary today, I felt so idk. Also this dude trying to be my friend texted me today and I felt so fucking sick to my stomach. Maybe it’s because I was anxious, but when my female friend texts me I feel fine, am I a lesbian or something? Now I have to see him in class I wanna kill myself. He’s a senior anyways, I just have to deal with this for my sophomore year. So fucking sad, my life
I cant even cry anymore
Well, I fucked everything up again as per my usual cycle. Everything sucks. It gets better and then it gets bad again and it goes on forever
Tine for my compulsive acknowledgement that I'm a shitty person and not that bright, just in case anyone is reading my posts, I don't want them to temporarily think I'm not aware of this most of the time.   I have no idea what in doing in life. I can't stick to any mindset. Eventually some decision is just gonna have to be made on a whim because it gets hard to try to discern what's me being mentally ill and a shuttle person and what I'm actually right about in my perceived threats.
Parents "aww we just talk about it! It's just a piece of advice. Just listen to it once". Also parents: "we have a right to dump this bullshit on you. You're not allowed to mention a single word of criticism, how dare you, how fucking dare you".  Parents pushing their super-esoteric-homeopathic "doctor" down my throat. You're not allowed to say literally anything against us, while they yell at you for months. But "iT cAn'T hArM, rIgHt?". Man I can't wait to try some stuff out from the antivax doc that's in the best case useless and a scam and in the worst case outright dangerous.   All of this is extra bad because I had to deal with all of this all the time when growing up and having no spine. Real help? No. Telling me what I've been in a past life? Oh yes, always!
Man these passed few weeks have been rough. I’m no stranger to depression but I feel like I’ve been drowning in it. The worst part is I know me. And I know me when I’m not feeling this way. I really like that person and that’s all I want to get back to. I hate feeling like the smallest most mundane tasks are extremely difficult. I hate not having any motivation. I hate getting these small windows of time where I feel like myself only to fall back into this depressed state again. It sucks big time.
Today is one of those days where I’m incredibly frustrated. I’m stuck in the middle of these four walls. There’s no escaping my misery. There is no one to sit and truthfully discuss my problems with. I’m lying to my family about still working my profess job when I haven’t worked there since July. I have been working a tiresome (physically and mentally) jobs since late late August and now they don’t need me. This was after dealing multiple encounters with entitled customers last week. I did need a break, but not one like this where I don’t know where my next paycheck is coming from. Honestly just sick of life. This is just a reoccurring theme. My life is just déjà vu at this point. I have been feeling the same emotions for 5 years. 5 years of asking God why, cursing him. It’s crazy to see so many FB posts of people thanking God and feeling bless & highly favored. And I’m wondering why God don’t do the same for me. I’m about to explode. I just want to get rid of this feeling, but I can’t. I can’t shake it off.
Wednesday was an amazing day.  I was on a high.  Everything felt good....but I knew it wouldn’t last☹️ why???? Then boom sad, paranoid, back to feeling like everything is falling apart. It’s like my mind enjoys playing this sick twisted game.
this pain will never end
the pain will come and go, but there's no solution.  but i'll still look or solution... bc my brain makes me positive sometimes...  &#x200B;  f this  world
Haaa with lifelong social anxiety it's like I'm living in a cave and every few years I manage to meet other people of my age and look what they're doing. "Ooh you're having kids now? That's nice!" Apparently people do this at this age, I wouldn't know.   Not talking down on anyone having kids or doing anything else, it's just everything is so alien and foreign and distant for me and I barely have any idea what one is "supposed to do" at a certain age. When you're just busy with mental healthy care, progress, stops, recession, breakdowns, whatever.
I’m so deep into my depression that I’ve been neglecting my friends and family. I feel that I’m not doing enough to maintain my friendships, I’m not caring more about my parents and my sibling.  I’m in too deep I forgot I have a dog to play with. Why am I so fucking depressed. I wish I could find the root cause of my depression. I just can’t accept that I’ll have to live with it for the rest of my life. I’ve put too much hope in medications. Now I’m feeling so disappointed that nothing really helps at all.
I got sexually assaulted August 30th at a party and i’m making it seem on my social media that everything is okay. I say “im fine” on a daily basis. I am afraid of reporting. My life took a huge slope after that. I felt like I deserved it. I have terrible thoughts and smoking weed and drinking alcohol is the only way to make it disappear. I’m only 20 btw. I had intercourse with a guy I knew and was comfortable with. His friends were in the room while me and him went to bed but left when we went to sleep. I was intoxicated and I wanted to sleep before driving back home. I fell asleep, i couldnt move my body & everything was spinning but i felt the sensation of something in my vagina. I was telling myself this cant be happening right now. I tried to move my body as much as I could so (he) can get off me, (he) stopped but continued 2 secs afterwards. I then felt something warm. After that (he) stopped then layed down. I had a anxiety/panic attack. I grabbed my shit as quick as I can and ran out the room. I started to breathe heavily in the hotel hallway, nobody heard or saw me. It was about 6am. I couldnt find my car. I was getting dizzy, I pulled myself together & after me driving home w a blank mind wanting to crash my car. I went and called the sexual assault hotline. I went to the hospital and chose the medical option. I didnt know what to do. I told my bestfriend and he said im not innocent. i didnt know what to say. i was hurt as hell. he said i wasnt that drunk. he said “you drinking with them but dont drink with me?” like WHAT. ugh. i just hate my mental state. i am still traumatized. i am not okay. i have a little bit of support. but no one comes through all the time. i get triggered everytime i see this person/group & i dont follow them. i told the guy i had relations with about that morning i went back home and he didnt say anything to anybody.. he didnt get upset. hurt. pissed off. its an abuse of trust. i cant forgive rn. i will never forget. karma will run up all of them.
Brother's family came to visit my parents and me today. Sister-in-law, their children, her mother. Everything being so ridiculously idyllic, people playing with the small children, food and stuff. Watching old family videos from my brothers childhood. It couldn't look more like "loving, functional family".  What's not so nice is twenty years of mental illness and abuse which lead to years of therapy, I guess. That's something people can't imagine somehow.   Whenever my brother's family comes over I feel super awful. I don't even want kids but it just reminds me how I tried for years finding at least some social contacts and defending myself from my parents and failed. At those family gathering everyone expects me to fulfill a nice "role" (as always) and play with the children and everything. It's like I'm supporting cast, a background character who is just supposed to give other people whatever they need. The smallest inconvenience of others is more important than me feeling awful, my needs don't matter at all.   All of this is so stressful. The moment they're gone my parents also start yelling at me again. Not so idyllic anymore, I guess.  Also haven't checked email in days despite waiting for an important one. Tons of anxiety. Therapist hasn't written back in a week either. Maybe too busy, maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore. Suicidal thoughts every day.
Running up the walls from anxiety. Extremely bad right now.   Wrote my former boss a mail if I could talk to him. At friday I asked him again when he had time for a talk, told me a date on saturday but didn't see his answer cause I wasn't able to read emails all weekend due to anxiety. Wrote him I'd call tomorrow. Anxiety is only getting worse. I'm extremely torn, there are so many "you have to" and "you ought to" while also tons of "I literally can't", "I have to lie about that". Torn between asking him for a job and not wanting it at all, having suicidal thoughts every day.   Former therapist finally wrote back, like a week later. Doesn't have much time reading emails. We had a phone call last week, but it's _again_ just her listening, repeating what she already offered me and also saying that besides that she can't tell me anything else.   I'm running up the walls, can't cope at all, can't go to another therapist, basically running around insane and selfharming the last three years. Three years ago I thought "oops someone should look after me a little bit cause I'm a bad influence on myself but at the same time I don't trust anyone, don't have anyone, can't talk to other people and can't deal with any loss of control and also want to destroy myself so much" and guess what all of that was really true.   No idea how I'm ever supposed to be able to work. Therapist's answer didn't help, every time I talk to her (which is already difficult enough) I just more get the feeling that there isn't anything to say at all. I feel like she's either super indifferent or helpless or both, I say things and they have no consequences (but I also have huge problems with any consequences soo...) and I'm endlessly playing mindgames because on the one she always offers a (free) phone fall on the other hand I get the feelings from above but those don't have to be rational right?  Same therapist absolutely destroyed me three years ago. Just wanted to help but it was wrong. Wish I never would've done back to her that day. Three years of suffering and an even more destroyed life because of that. Every say suicidal thoughts.

Been awhile since I've gotten this drunk this late. Fucking stupid. But fuck life whatever idk can't think too drunk. Good luck a d God speed all of you. Kick ass.
I hate how the symptoms for body dysmorphia still rings true for me even now. It was terrible for me like years ago and I'd like to think that I've become better now. But I still feel like I don't know how I actually look like. Sometimes I think I look pretty cute and then a different mirror ruins it. A photograph. My reflection on car windows. Or different versions of my self-image. I hate it and I'm having a breakdown because of it.
I'm dipping my toes in the water today. I think Ill make a plan agsin to kill myself. It got better for a minute but now I've come to see the senseless existence life has become. It's rediclous how we lie to our selves about what life is or can become. It holds so little when you really add it up. At the end of all my spent potential I'll be so close to where I am today. Seems pointless to put forth the effort. I'm alone again, I'm bored again, I'm going no where again.
woke up from a nightmare, it feels horrible
I cry so frequently now. I didn't used to be like this. I feel rejected and unloved way too easily and unjustifiably now

Today have been a slow and rough time feel a bit better after a shower and a little chill out time.   Maybe I'm feeling this way because I have my birthday coming up and I've been trying to work through some of the issues I've been having and hanging on to for a very long time. And also work havent been great lately but hopefully it will get better.
Memory loss so bad I don't recognize the drawings I made last week.
I got left on read and they all left the call to make a new one but i wasnt invited... Worst thing is thos was like 5 mins ago
I’m so tired and no one understands. I can’t come to my family with it because I don’t want to make their lives harder. I can’t do my school work half the time I can’t eat brush my teeth or hair or even shower. I just sleep. And then I get yelled at for sleeping. I get it tho I deserve to be. I do nothing all day I’m a waste of air. I hate myself so much.
this is going to be so gross...but i'm scared. i felt a weird texture on one of my teeth which might be a cavity. i've never had one before...i just struggle so much recently with even such basic tasks like brushing my teeth, i feel so gross and ashamed about this, and i know many people have cavities and it might not even be one but i just hate myself so much right now. and i'm nervous. dentists are fucking expensive, and i already need eeg and blood tests done for a chronic illnees (routine check-ups), and an ob-gyn visit, and the ob-gyn also recommended i see a dietetican. honestly? all of this is not worth it.

I’ve recognized that I’ve had a relapse in my depression over the past week. It started with loosing interest in things and being tired a lot and tonight it has turned into that feeling of bottomless sadness. Recognizing is the first step. Hopefully I can climb back up the hill soon
I don't want to exist. I don't want to exist. I don't want to exist.
My wife told me my idea of what love is, is warped. That hurt and the constant fighting is taking a toll on me. If I didn’t have kids I’d probably do something stupid. I just want to be happy for once. Idk how I’ll ever get there. I have no friends. I have no life outside my kids and they both will be out of the house in two years.
I’m not sure how long I can do this I’ve been trying so hard to be the best that I can be I keep hurting myself and my loved ones and it hurts me even more to see them upset with me I can’t fix anything I don’t know how all I say is sorry and now it’s just a useless term to them I can’t do this
Anyone else feel like no matter how hard you try, you fail, for reasons out of your control? Does it lead to people getting mad at your for things you can't help, which leads to more depression? And whenever you improve or feel good about things, life finds a way to prove you wrong?
exhausted AND hyper - bored, lonely, etc etc
Jealously is a bitch. Why can't I just be happy for other people? Right, because I'm a sad lazy sack of shit
i can't do this anymore
I am so f\*cking terrified of the future. :( I turned 29 recently and am so scared of aging, of my family dying and of potentially becoming impoverished or homeless. I think this existential terror was triggered by recently when my parents got me a new tv, and I was thinking about how I can't afford to add any decor to my space so the tv isn't sitting in such a blank empty space. I love halloween but can't even afford any halloween decorations and don't have the energy or motivation to DIY anything, and am too scared and overwhelmed going to the stores when I do have money...so now I'm thinking about death again and dying painfully and poor and homeless, and devoid of halloween decorations. Ah good old depression.
Just had an almighty breakdown and sobbed into my pillow for a few minutes (afraid of waking up my housemate). It's been building up for a few days. I'm glad I had these few minutes of unrestrained, well, almost unrestrained release of emotion. I've been trying to pin a reason to why I cried. I don't know if there are too many reasons or none. I tried texting a couple of friends but the time difference makes it difficult to get in touch with the few close-ish friends I have. Now that I think of it, I think I'm glad no one responded, I don't know what I'd have told them. I want a hug, but it's going to be several months at least before I would get one. Writing this out is making me calm, especially the part about the hug. As corny as it may sound, the fact that at least one other person might read this and acknowledge my state of mind gives me a glimmer of hope. I'll try to sleep now. Goodnight.
've been battling this addiction for about 10 yrs now. In the past few months I've adopted my dad's take on sugar. No more than 4 grams per serving and no more than 30 grams a day. Its been extremely hard and had to work my way down to those numbers but it has been extremely rewarding! I used to get hot flashes, started back when I was 17, plus the usual fatigue, asthma attacks, crazy stomach pain, depression, adhd and a whole host of other symptoms. Now I can go 10 days without any junk food. My mood, my optimism, my complexion have nearly been restored. Plus I've lost 10 pounds! I've crashed in the past but, each time I get my mind ready to change my diet it has been much easier!
i am so sad. i am so sad. i want her here. she should still be alive. i miss her so much. i am so sad. i am so sad. i am so sad. i love you so much my forever baby. and i really need you all the time and right now
i just gave up, i love my parents so much i think im going to join them once theyre gone. Its just so simple
I've fucked everything up. I cant even keep track of how long it's been. I've fucked everything up, including the amount of small successes I've had.
I've been crying for the past hours. I want to kill myself tonight. I just self-harmed. I'm too old, a failure; life has completely passed me by and I'll never get validation or 'healing' from the abuse that I lived through. My early life was destroyed and now it's too late to do anything. I've been obsessing about the ageing lines on my face one more indicator of failure.
Heya, I've been feeling pretty low these past few weeks and I'm honestly pretty terrified of slipping back into depression again (I was really depressed without really knowing it when I was a teenager and a lot of those patterns reemerged...)  Anyways, I wanted to share a podcast that has really pulled me out of some pretty dark moments: the DTFH (duncan trussel family hour) he's hilarious  Sending y'all some love <3
I want to make friends but I don’t even have the energy for the 2 friends I have now. I want to change, but I literally can’t do the change and it’s pissing me off
I have a legal call in 2 hours. I need to review some questions but I've been delaying like everything else. Past few weeks have been spent on a video game. I need to set blockers on it.  Nvm I missed it messing that up just like everything else.
been messing around with this boy since april, and today is the 11th time i’ve told him i don’t want to be messed about anymore, because it seriously upsets me. idk, i miss my friends, i have too much work to do and life just sucks right now- it’s getting colder and more bitter
I'm feeling really anxious right now. I am terrified of dying. I have attempted suicide twice, and those were impulsive attempts. I don't have any friends or really anyone positive in my life right now except paying to see a therapist.   Sometimes I really want to talk to a person I used to date and was friends with. Now, she hates me, and I don't blame her. I miss her dearly sometimes. I wish it was 2018 again, and I wish I could do things over. Maybe we would have continued seeing each other and became each other's girlfriend.   Everything feels so overwhelming. I'm stuck at home with an abusive family. I hope this doesn't lead to me completing suicide. I really wish I had friends to talk to, but I only have Reddit. I don't even know how to make new friends right now. I'm too scared to talk to people, even online.
Feeling doubly useless on the job and in life.  Can't do anything right on the job, feeling just numb to it now, like I couldn't really care as much as I used to about it anymore.  Wanted to pursue my dreams in art initially but I'm feeling that I'll never be able to match up to the standards.  Everytime I get upset or anxious I start overspending on things that I shouldn't. Just to make myself feel slightly better for that one moment.  I just want to sleep now more than anything.
Life is garbage.
I'm jealous of my friends falling in love, but I know that me being unable to love is a boon to the rest of the world.
I've been doing a lot of self help. Some days I'm unstoppable but most I'm so depressed because of how far behind in life I am that I wanna die and it's embarrassing and lonely having no one to vent to without freaking them out or being a burden
I feel terrible. I hate my life.
i finally started taking antidepressants and i no longer get bogged down in the hopelessness mental spiral.  but i still have no energy or motivation even though I've been sleeping a lot and eating better. uuuggghhhhh i know it isn't overnight i just want this to get better faster

I haven't eaten yet today. I'm gonna put away some clothes and go buy some food.
My friend told me to share but I told him I don't like to share things and perhaps that is why I am constantly in this downward spiral.
I'm such a failure. 40, unemployed, no prospects either. I try to be like Diogenes, but sometimes it's an impossible act to follow. Especially, when one sees other people doing good and succeeding in their life.
Procrastinating really badly, have an essay due tomorrow 9 am. Been feeling really lonely recently, like i have friends, but not one of them feel like they really care. Having a crush, at least i put my heart somewhere, i don't need to look for someone to love. Also wondering once we're suicidal, is the only way only to die or live with it, having ideation every now and then?
I want to die I just cant do anything i feel so weak.
Technically I 'have it all' (family, education, a job - even though it isn't that good, a roof over my head, etc) and yet I'm reverting back to a place where I wish something happened that could have been 'accidental', such as a train wreck or getting hit by a car, if not wanting to just hurt myself and make it seem accidental to get away from everything.
I worked a bit today, ate well and now time to go to bed. Yet the intrusive thoughts won't stop, my desire to just disappear grows and I don't know what to do.  Well, I do know, I'll see my therapist on Wednesday but I sort of find the uncertainty comfortable. I'm feeling like shit, the thought of everything being over sounds to good to be true.

Im not having a good week, im focused on a dead relationship and havent been eating or taking care of myself.   I feel more alone and isolated everyday, even staying on my friends couch.  I want to save myself the trouble of going through this, but i feel like i at least owe my ex trying to live, as i told her id try.  Crazy how you can promise someone who made you feel unwanted and left you alone after lying in your face can make you promise you wint hurt yourself.   Someone who hurt themselves just to make you look bad, but they want you tk carry on alone.   I hope i can just sleep through today.
My depression sets in worse with each new relationship failure. Every time I think I'm ready, I realize I'm not.  I wind up over eager if a date goes well. Then I get the "not ready for a relationship" text. Then I spiral into thinking I'm not worth it. Nothing's worth it. Work is stressful. Nothing seems to get better. Why did I get drunk and send texts asking to hang out again so soon?   Just ruminating over everything and feeling sorry for myself. I can still get through everything and I work out and go to work but I must just give off so many red flags. I want to fix myself. I don't know how.
With being lonely and having no distractions come the bad flashbacks. Today it has been two years since one of my worst attempts of 'putting myself out there' happened.  I had a day off work and was scanning Facebook in the morning. A post for an event popped up, I decide to go. Everyone there was younger, more sociable  than me. I felt like the odd one out. If only I turned away and didn't go. This is why I don't bother trying but people keep hounding me with their normie lectures and don't believe what I say when I HAVE tried.
Rough day.  Not going great.  I’m jobless at the moment (thanks COVID & the lack of government response) so I don’t even have the grind of a daily schedule to keep my mind off things.  I just wake up at random hours and dwell on everything.  Every day.  All week.  Doesn’t help with the loneliness I already had before the lockdown.  Autumn, which I usually love, is in full-swing here, meaning that my bed is as cold as ever each night.  Not sure why that detail has such an effect, but it sure doesn’t help  Edit: oh, I’m also back to not eating again, so that’s a riot too
Not doing great today. My anxiety has been out of this world for a while and today something feels like it just flipped and now I could care less about anything. I can’t get out of bed.  I don’t want to be awake. I hate existing some days and I feel like I’m doing it for everyone else bc I have to. Anyways.
I’m so embarrassed,  how can I live, I’m such a loser, I should die. My resume sucks, and my department saw
I’m tired of working hard for something that isn’t ever going to come. I’ve been at school for all my life. And people can see right through me, my absolutely pathetic nature.   I’ve never been interesting, attractive, worthy of anyone’s time or attention. I’m everything you want to run away from, hell my own family want nothing to do with me if they can help it.   Now I’m having trouble at a class, and it’s whatever, I can get myself back up if I push myself. But I don’t care for marks anymore, I don’t care anymore. I’ll just learn whatever I can learn since this stuff is interesting and they’ll kick me out when the time comes.   I have nothing beneficial to offer, both in the personal sense and the professional sense.
Having a mentally ill parent is so much fun. I'm hard enough on myself, but sure Mom go ahead and keep harping on me about things. Something wrong with my having to feel worse being the only way she seems to feel better.
I'm slowly getting better, been going through my possessions and getting rid of things I dont want or need. Haven't done that the last two times I've moved in the last 18 months. Feels so much better not having all these things around. If i only could do that to my mind I would be way better off.
I'm generally fine except when it comes to dealing with friends and stuff. Complicated friendships make life worse. I rarely log on to Insta anymore but it seems like the only way to make yourself relevant to your friends are through social media. I hate that the entire generation is wired to be like this.   I need to keep reminding myself that it's okay to be alone most of the time. I do have a couple of close friends and a partner, and I am comfortable with this arrangement.
Life is overwhelming right now. I’m tired of COVID. I’m worried about the future. I have nothing to look forward to. I hate my job. My life is stagnant.
I'm going to be honest, life has been pretty good recently - but I've had some big family situation changes happen at the same time as a few really bad violations of First Nations peoples sacred sites in my country.  Long and short, I'm really battling with my climate grief at the moment... it's just so hard to keep and grow hope for the future knowing how little some care about it and how actively others will destroy it for their own sake. It really hurts and I don't know how to deal with it without giving myself up to the feeling/that modus operandi...  Sorry for taking space here guys - just needed to talk this out, make it less abstract. Failing that, just put it out into the ether.  Take care out there, everyone.
Hello everyone. I’m new with this so I’m not sure how it works.   I’m just feeling so badly. Lifelong depression.  Try very hard to keep relationships going but it’s always very one sided.  People just don’t like me.  Even the non depressed me. I don’t much either. So then what do you do?  I’m an extrovert and like connecting but I clearly am not good at it. In the past I’ve been too critical of people and have been trying to improve that. Just feel unlikable

my heart goes out to everyone here I hope we all find our own version of peace in this lifetime. let it all out, feel what you need to feel to heal the way you need to heal. we’re in this together. if anyone could use some laughs i suggest searching up Theo Von on youtube. he’s one of us. peace!
Gahhh. I feel so much shame and embarrassment constantly. Had an in person day of work (I’m freelance) which has been rare these days and I’m just feeling soooo much embarrassment and shame about things I said and did during the day. It woke me up in the middle of the night and is keeping me up. I’m feeling it sooo intensely right now. I’m so nervous everything I did and said is going to stop me from getting booked with this client again, and I feel they are all laughing and talking about me behind my back about how weird I am. I can’t help myself from being so weird! I feel too weird!!! My brain is on fire right now and I need to get back to sleep but can’t.
Still here. Still lonely. Could do with help with a guy problem I’m having. If anyone’s willing.   I don’t have anyone who listen than isn’t already annoyed with hearing about it. But I honestly don’t know what to do  Help.       Please? I’m really lost
I feel like I am losing any confidence that I have built up. I believe I am either screwing up or just spinning my wheels. I just wish I would get some affrimative confirmation every once and while. However, that probably comes off as too needy.
A new thing to feel bad about: Comparing myself to younger women streamers on twitch.   I just learned what video games were three months and now I'm feeling new pain about missing out.   Logically, there's no way I can possibly stream - even eliminating all the psychological barriers, I don't even own a PC, nor do I have any friends.   But it just feels like there's no place in the world for me. Sometimes I think I just need some encouragement, maybe a friend, but all that has been is a pipe dream.
I had a really good stretch in September.  Then about 3 weeks ago shit started to get really stressful at work.  And I started to get a bit depressed.  Holidays are always bad since my marriage ended, and here's Thanksgiving 2 weeks ago and Halloween this week.  And now the woman I'd started seeing seems to have ghosted me - we'd only had a couple dates, although we'd been chatting since September, so nothing serious, but being ghosted is always harder than just being rejected, because you don't know what is going on.  This week I've felt worse each day.  Hoping I can turn it around but 🤷‍♂️
I miss everyone today. I feel sick
Feels like in a downward spiral right now. No one loves sad people who cry all the time. But that’s why I’m sad - I really need the love and affection from someone who genuinely likes me for who I am. I really don’t know how people live alone happily. Like, what’s good in life if you don’t have a significant other to share your life with... that’s my take anyway.
Got scammed today while trying to get a ps4.  Starting to thi k god is giving me signs that he wants me gone, and im not worth the effort of him killing me man.   I wonder why, my so called friends use every chance to take jabs at a broken man that was asking for help 7 years ago at the age of 17  Why my mom keeps trying to use me knowing good and well i just want to move on with my life   Why everyone who loves me seems to have to leave....   Cant even get a ps4 and be alone on my own.
This is long, but I don't wanna make my own post. Less likely people will see it this way. This is a general rant post about LGBT made by a queer person. If you not LGBT or familiar with queer theory in general I advise you not to read this because it's gonna sound like a whole lot of gibberish nonsense and I ain't a textbook that's gonna explain every little detail for the uninitiated. I just needed somewhere to express my frustration where I don't think I'll be judged by other members of the community. I'm not attacking anyone in particular, I'm just frustrated by circumstance. Why? Because I am so incredibly pissed off that I'm not a woman. And yes I know "you are who you feel" concept I came to grips with that a while ago.   It just PISSES me OFF to no end how I wasn't born a women into the role of a woman. Not only because I LOATHE being a man, but because nowadays women and afab have more freedom to explore and express their gender identity however they want (and OBVIOUSLY I know that isn't the same everywhere I'm just talking about where I live). Like I've grown up surrounded by women and afab people (friends and family) who were more or less free to experiment with their own gender expression at least during high school and beyond. And at worst they get mistaken for lesbians. And trust me, there are MUCH worse things to get mistaken as. Which it annoys me so much whenever I see trans men complain about getting misgendered. Like I know it sucks but at least your not being misidentified as a SEXUAL PREDATOR. At least you have MASCULINITY on your side! At least there's a pretty damn good chance of you living a life where no one is the wiser that you were afab due to the nature of ftm hormone therapy. I do not get ANY of those luxuries. And I see them moan and complain about "not getting represented online enough" and it's like, well yeah no shit you're less likely to be murdered in a hate crime in public and are free to gallivant about. So what if some people think your a butch lesbian? Beats being murdered!  And I feel bad complaining about this because I know we all go through our own shit. Hell my younger brother is a trans man who really encouraged me to understand this whole thing. I just cannot keep in these things I feel. I don't hate afab queer people. I just envy some of the freedoms that they get that I do not and probably will never have. Like my brother has a good chance of living a full life. I'm lucky if I live to 30. Not like I've enjoyed living thus far anyways. Death doesn't sound so bad sometimes. If only I could get rid of that little spark of hope in me and step into the goddamn noose already. I mean, what good is a useless mentally ill freak like me in patriarchal capitalist society AMIRIGHT FOLKS?
Just a suggestion for someone, but in a few days this sub is going to see a lot of people regardless to the outcome of the election...  Should we.. Like do something about that? Like make a stickied thread?
I feel so weak. I want to do things but I just physically cant do anything.
I cleaned up my room today. Tomorrow is my birthday. My stomach hurts and I feel lonely, but maybe a little better.
I'm really sad yesterday me and my girlfriend were attacked be someone throwing us things and calling us homophobic slurs. The worst thing that I have spent the whole week inside the house and was hoping for a romantic evening (no lock down in my country currently). Now I'm at home again eating takeout watching Netflix and hoping things will get better for me in this shitty country. I'm studying anthropology and have an online class tomorrow (To end this comment with something positive).
I wish I was stronger. I wish I was smarter. I wish I was braver. Instead, I only constantly screw up. Thus my most sincere wish is hoping that I could just disappear or die. At least, it would be all over then.
Online friend is back to kicking me when I'm down. Like dude, I do not care about you anymore now that you've cut contact with me five times as some kind of weird punishment for perceived wrongs I don't remember committing and which you utterly refuse to name. You've shown, just like everyone else, that you'll not stick around and only keep me available as a sounding board for your own problems.  I think he needs to find out my block button works different than his.
thought maybe I was doing a little better because I hadn't felt the need to come vent here in a while (by my standards, anyway). but here I am again.  lately I've been thinking a lot about what a pathetic attention-seeker I am. I hate this about myself. I combat it by withdrawing and isolating myself, which is less embarrassing for me and less annoying to other people.  I just want so badly to feel like people like me and consider me a friend and want me around. I want to be able to tell someone in my life that I'm in pain and be comforted. I want to receive the same support that I've given and seen given to other people.  I know I can't have any of those things but I still want them. is that so wrong? I don't know. I guess it must be.
I've been sober for 4 days. I still hate myself, that seems to be the only constant in my life. I'm cresting 29 and I've done nothing useful yet, also I haven't been in a relationship yet either. Wish I had the balls to kill myself. I want to get better, I just don't think I will.

Lately I've been having trouble concentrating and I just feel low even though I got good news this weekend. I just cant stop feeling down this week for some reason.
I don't like the idea that just because I'm depressed, I should lower my standards and accept whatever anyone else thinks is "a solution to my problems, or it means you're not really trying".  No, dumbass, you're just suggesting something I know for a fact doesn't work, and your presence doesn't help because I don't like you.  As if depressed people don't get to have standards...
I feel awful, I feel frustration and grief and anxiety and things that I don't know how to convey.  I'm living a nightmare.
For a long time I thought was doing good and was making such an active effort to be a better person but recently hearing stuff from people in my life/ family about how much they dislike dealing with me has really made me question any progress I have actually made. I have tried super hard to climb out of the quicksand of suicidal thoughts, sought out trauma therapy from a therapist and been trying really hard to be happy and mindful and build passions to help me keep moving forward but now I've fallen back into the pit of self hate and can't help but think about how easy it would be to just end everything.   I know I shouldn't think that way, but I've reached the point where I don't care anymore, I just want to be OK.
I can't sleep. It's so damn hard having to watch everything unfold.
This year has been all downs in my life with no foreseeable ups in my future. Every day im fighting a loosing battle and I can't seem to care anymore.
Maximum of dysfunctionality + throwing all my energy against it + therapist doesn't say a word + no progress at all = total breakdown.
So my psychiatrist of 5 years prescribed me vvyanse today. One of the 2 biggest sources of why I lurk this sub is because of how I look. My insurance doesn't even cover it. It changes my perspective on people who can't even afford prozac etc, but it just makes me so so upset.
I've reached out to two different psychologists, several times, and both of them ignored me, today my mom said to me that it's about time I kill myself like I always say, I just can't hold anymore
I was looking through some old notes from ~6 years ago and it seems that my agony hasn't changed all that much.
Welp next appointment with my therapist in a few hours, I hope it won't sap every ounce of the energy I mustered for today.
Almost everyone is using smartphone to cheated in today's exam except me and maybe few others(only today's exam)... the sub teacher didn't care, and I can't really tell anyone otherwise people will hate me for it, I feel really horrible right now, I worked really hard for a good grade, it doesn't really change the fact that I'm certain I have good grade, but still, it's not fair.  Something good happen today tho, I heard from one of the teacher that my favorite teacher said I'm one of the best student he've had in years, and he's the one that can decide if I can get in a program that I want once I'm graduated, this news does make me smile a bit now that I'm thinking about it, I hope I can go to bed with the smile now and forget about today's exam.
I applied to a year abroad in November last year. In January 2020, I got the confirmation and started to prepare for my exchange year, being the most excited and happy in a long time.   Then this whole pandemic started rolling and yesterday I got the final cancellation of my exchange. I fell into a hole and have no motivation or drive to do anything, I feel like just quitting this semester and uni (and life honestly) in general.   This has been my dream for such a long time and I got so damn close and persisted but still couldn't go. Just fucking breaks me
Nothing like spending Friday/Saturday night being disrespected by hoodrat trash, dealing with a certain pathetic customer and screamed at by a loud ass druggie :')  I'm genuinely thinking I'm actually a misanthrope now, but am I really since I think they're edgy wannabe intellectual tryhards? I don't know, I'm tired and depressed and wanna go home
My mother's family are against me because I was honest about her behaviour during my childhood. Multiple psychologists referred to her as an emotional abuser but I'm a bad daughter for being "rude and cruel to someone who'll love you forever". I feel like I lost half my heart.
I think I must be in hell.
I am (now was) a part of a penpal group on Facebook. I barely posted or commented because I was too scared and everyone in the group was a normie with normie hobbies. I haven't done any penpalling in years because like everything else I've had drama with it and end up giving up but I miss it a lot sometimes. Anyway, there's this post in the group and it's from an ex friend of mine. I had to leave the group. I seem to have more ex friends than actual lasting friendships these days and it makes me feel even worse about myself.
I just want the pain to stop, but I don’t want my parents to feel heartbroken
Haven't posted in here, but my mood is plummeting again. I have major depressive disorder, had it for about 20 years.  When it gets bad, I don't want to do anything but lie in bed and cry.  My meds have been keeping me from hitting that point, but I'm losing motivation to do anything.
Boy fuck circlejerks. The only time you percieve your own intelligence is when you're trying to make inside jokes, chances are your conversations aren't worth joining in, and you aren't a person worth talking to .   And you wonder why "everyone has blacklisted me"   Probably tired of that shit youre never held accountable for...
A course I had to get approval to take is draining any motivation still left in me. I want to throw my books out of a window. It’s so pointless but confusing that I wish I never took it. It’s worse because my favorite prof is teaching it and I don’t want to hurt their feelings or opinion of myself by admitting that I have no idea what’s going on or what I’m supposed to be getting out of this besides more triggers of my depressive symptoms and public speaking anxiety. I just want to pass and I’m so afraid I’m failing but I’m afraid to ask and I can’t see my grades
I feel like I'm sad a lot of the time.  I feel like I am pretty much just living in order to make others happy and things that used to make me happy don't anymore, if they do it's only for a short while. Mostly a mellow yellow mood. I don't like hugs anymore because I feel like I'm giving them, not receiving. I don't get that feeling where I want to give hugs, I feel like that warm feeling is fake.
I feel really tired and lost.
I did everything to try and feel better today. Good coping mechanisms and bad. Nothing works. I've been here too long.
Had a great morning, then slowly started thinking of my ex again. Fucking anxiety. I hate having to live through this.
Extreme stress and despair every single day. Luckily I can use what my therapist teached me to successfully cope:  "It's fucking nothing" and "just suck it up, man", combined with my favorite "just try not to think about it"! Things keep running downhill but always remember, quote: "it get's worse before it gets better". (Serious: a notion one self-help book explicitly warned me about because it's actually a dangerous trap)  Me being angry on everyone and everything probably came from me trying to sort out what's actually helpful and what's not. But on nobody as angry as I am on me.
I'm sad I want to die
Some days I am really at my breaking point at keeping it together. I know I have to push through but I have so little to motivate me, no positive reinforcement in my life. Bad grades, no friends, no close family, no accomplishments. I've only ever worked minimum wage or near minimum wage jobs, and the only reason I don't live in grinding poverty is because of handouts from my dad who feels sorry for me, and I can't stand his pity but I need it to survive.  I just need one break. One. I feel like that I'm not asking for much. One test where I get a grade over 65%, a nice compliment or acknowledgement about how I'm making a genuine effort to make something out of my life. I am running on very thin reserves of willpower and doing everything on my own is exhausting.
Fucking god I wanna die again. When the fuck does it fucking end?
Everything is just so weird. I still have the same awful and miserable thoughts all the time but I'm practically numb to them at this point. Is that good or bad? They no longer affect my ability to function, but is it worse that these thoughts about how much I hate being alive don't even phase me much anymore? Is it because I know I'm never going to do anything about it? Like it's just some ridiculous fantasy that'll never come true, at least not for a long time? I'm only living for my family and friends at this point and I still just feel like an inconvenience to them. That's what gets me.The thoughts that always break me are when I think about how much I hate the way I look or how I talk or the fact that I'm so pathetically awkward and dumb sometimes that I feel like there's actually something mentally wrong with me outside of the 3 mental illnesses I already have. I haven't gotten any better at all, I can think about how badly I wanna die a million times a day and feel nothing but recalling one slightly awkward memory is enough to render me useless for a day. Life is so stupid and weird. I don't even understand reality anymore. I don't know what to think or feel about anything. I don't even know when I'm okay or not anymore. I'm not capable of thinking and I wish I never had to again.
really funny in a sad way how i end up here every single november and yet it's somehow still a surprise to me. i don't know what's going on anymore. it feels like for the first time in my life i just don't know what's happening next and it's terrifying, it's so so so so fucking terrifying i can't describe it. there was always a definitive answer and i always knew what was going to happen next to atleast some degree. now i just can't even tell anymore. i haven't even so much as thought about applying for college yet even though i should but i know no matter how hard i try i wouldn't be able to do it anyways. i can barely get up anymore and i've been too scared to even check my grades a single time this year because of how much i've neglected school. i hope i have atleast one class i'm not failing if nothing else.  feels like i've done everything there is to do at this point. and that there's nothing left. and it just makes me feel more and more like there's only one direction left for things to go, there's only one direction things were ever going to go. i've known it for so long. what else is even left to do at this point? i've drank, i've smoked, i've fallen in love and out of love, i've found things i have passion for and exhausted them to a point where i don't have passion for anything anymore. i don't even know why i'm going on at this point besides habit. there's no future left for me, there never could be. i don't have it in me to handle life and all the responsibilities that come with it but i can't take being so much of a fuck up that i just sit around doing nothing all day. i don't know what's left for me anymore.  funny how i thought things were changing for me at the start of the year. i was happy, actually happy, i didn't want to admit it to myself but i was, and i'm an idiot for not appreciating it while it lasted like i do for every single good thing in my life. and now here we are, one year later, nothing is different. i'm the same emotional wreck, i still can barely function, i still want to get my fucking head ripped off. but hey, i have a slightly different music taste if nothing else. what a fucking victory that is.
“Can you tell me what I did so wrong that you hate me”. I can’t say these words to my ex and I feel so desperately helpless because he told me to not contact him. He told me that his mother and one of his friends would let me know if he dies.  Why am I so hurt. Why am I so hung up on him. I hate how much I want to hold onto him. And I hate that I can’t move past him.
Just hate myself for self sabotaging my career, for self destroying my career. I know it was probably depression that caused me to do it, but I still can't come to terms with it.
Lost my job and the government is being a complete pain in the ass about paying me the money I am legally owed. My job was literally the only thing I was consistent about besides showering, I didn't even eat well consistently. I don't think I have it in me to better myself until I find a new job, and I the thought of needing to find another job just seems completely  overwhelming.  I've got an apprenticeship test coming up, and it doesn't matter how much I try and study for it because I just end up sitting in my chair staring at the page because I haven't been able to study since I was a kid, and it's only gotten worse. Same with my mental capacity, I don't think I matured past 18, and I feel like I'm dumber than I was then.  Can't fucking afford therapy and never have been anyways, and I'm trying to get to a doctor about the half dozen physical health issues I have that I will probably have until the day I die. Fuck this, I'm too young to be in this shitty of shape. I can't even work out and it's hard to sleep.  Cut a bunch of friends out of my life a couple days ago because I'm sick of being treated like shit so that's probably a step in the right direction.  Anyways sorry for the rant, but this is one of those rare moments where I'm mad at the world and not dead inside, so I figured I'd use it.
Feeling super awful. Nothing helps. Trying to distract myself with no avail. Tons of anxiety and despair. Every time I drag myself to my last therapist she's like "man, you were really right in expecting nothing of therapy". Super disappointed. I'm fighting for every single hour. Can't even plan tomorrow. Expecting nothing of therapy anymore. Don't have the energy to move me _and_ a therapist. It's like trying to shove a rock. My life as dirt.
I got cheated on while I was already falling back into a depressive state, now I’m in so much mental and physical pain I almost had to go to the ER and I just want the suffering to end.
Does anyone get this weird taste in their mouth when really depressed? I have a lack of appetite but also anything I eat will leave this weird aftertaste which furthers my desire not to eat...
I’m trying to figure out what the point of life is. Honestly I’m debating it right now. I’m at a dead end and there’s no light. I’m not even like sad or anything just sort of numb. Damn I really should’ve gone back to therapy huh...
My depression makes me doubt every social interaction, every word out of my mouth, and I just hate myself so much for it. Is that normal?
I've been feeling a bit fragile and on edge lately over various things. This afternoon I had kind of a meltdown, and in a fit of rage poured an entire bottle of paint stripper over something I've been painting and totally ruined it. Not one of my finest moments.
If I can't succeed at this new job then I've decided I'm officially done. Not done as in quit trying at life, but done as quitting being alive in general.   If I can't even do this right and I fuck it up like everything else in my life, then what's the point of hoping for anything to get better?  Some people are good at things, others like me have no fucking reason to exist.
Just been extremely exhausted and want one person to genuinely ask how I’m doing
Life has always been shit. Shitty family, no friends, unemployed and a botched education. I don't even know if I can get a minimum wage job. And I have no energy to start school all over again.
It's been awhile since I've gotten drunk and come here to post. Pretty much 6 drinks in I think. Done for the night. A bit of a binge is enough. Feel pretty good but I know that anything more and I'll be hung over as shit tomorrow. Being a fatty means it takes a bit more to get to this stage. Just gotta remember to hydrate up before bed.   The wife has taken over the house. I realized that earlier. My pc has like 8 sq ft of space for usage. The rest of the main floor is her shit and spare bedrooms and shit. The basement is useless space all covered in storage for mostly her shit and some of my shit. Attic is unfinished and useless for anything other than putting shit there and forgetting about it.   So I have no space to call my own. I miss that. I miss having a good big place for pc gaming. But instead I just fume and bitch and moan inside my own head and don't say anything. I'm such a pussy.   Haven't had sex in a month. Fucking hell I didn't realize that till I wrote it. Fuck. That's bad. I've gotten to be such a fat fuck that I don't think she's physically attracted to me any more.   Idk where this started but now my drunk ass is worried she will leave me for a younger fit fucker. She's hot for a middle age woman and I'm as pathetic as it gets for a middle aged guy. Fuck me.
I'm finally home from work in bed, and now I'm trying not to break down over being sexually harrassed during my shift 🙃  Genuinely thought the dude needed help, since he was supposedly suicidal. But I guess fucking not, huh? This'll teach me to stop being a idealistic idiot, people are _trash_
Really sick of being dumped on at home all the time. I'm not the one freaking out over imagined food shortages and other Covid related crap, probably because I dgaf if I have anything to eat when I get up anymore. But sure, keep dragging me into your weird delusions Mom. Never stops to think the reason I go for so many walks late at night now is to get some peace, even if I have to deal with knife wielding crackheads sometimes.
i truly cant stand my parents anymore. every call always turns into a fight. i share one tiny thing that has made me happy and it's always replied with hostility. it's like all they want out of me is to marry into a rich family, send them money, and raise their social standing. my Ndad keeps bringing up the fact that he sent me to university and somehow expected me to be the keeper of knowledge of all things tech. when i tell him that i dont know something it's always replied with insults saying im fucking stupid like ??? who's the one who can't navigate through a zoom call?? and my mom is always commenting on my figure like i'm not even remotely near unhealthily fat but she's acting like i'm one meal away from a heart attack.   i rlly want to just end it all. i hate living knowing i owe money to these people and will have to live up their expectations. the only thing that makes me somewhat happy these days is logging into my favourite online game and saying good evening to the friends i made online. i suck at my degree and people kept teasing me over the fact that i'm a single jobless adult playing an online game in my free time instead of socializing and looking for a partner. sometimes before i fall asleep i wish i wouldnt wake up for another day. i hate knowing that i will be a disappointment for another day in my pointless life.
Was at the doctor the other day and I just couldn't bring up my mental health concerns again. I went in planning to do it, but I just wasn't able to. I've tried to bring up my depression in person probably 20 times in my life and I was only able to talk about it with a single doctor. I just can't talk about it with other people for some reason.  I have to go again next week for a follow up and I hope I can bring it up this time, I finally want to start meds and if I can't even do this I'm never going to get better.
I want to die right now. I thought someone cared about me. They really don't. I'm useless. I don't want to wake up tomorrow.
I was taken to the clinic yesterday and staying here for a while. Going to the ER and asking for help was scary, but the ER doctor was very understanding. The clinic staff treat me very well. They don't force me to take meds but they sedate me morning and night which is fine. The diagnosis is depressive psychosis. I'm malnourished, so they give me meal replacement drinks. I'm very weak so I hope it helps. Tomorrow the doctor wants to talk to me. I'm nervous about that.
[TRIGGER WARNING] I think I have to say trigger warning cause I will mention suicide  Last week a guy at my school tried to commit suicide in the middle of lunch break (some of my classmates went to his house and helped him before he did it). He was at home and put out his suicide letter on Facebook.   This just triggered something inside me and I can't stop feeling horrible, even though I don't know him so well. I dont know whether I have depression or not, but my older brother have been dealing with it, and it started around the same age as I am right now. My parents had been very helpful when my brother went to therapy and so forth. I'm just scared about coming out to my parents, and I have been for a long time, and making them feel bad about both their sons dealing with depression. My parents have been speculating about me having depression, but I'm too scared to tell them, and always trying to seem like I'm doing just fine.   I'm about to crumble under all the pressure, and I dont think I will last very long.  Sorry if this comment is badly made, its 1 am and I'm trying not to wake up my parents.
After nearly a week of severe anxiety and procrastination I managed to check my emails again. "Luckily" there wasn't an email of the job I applied to, something like "respond tomorrow or forget it".   I'm having so extreme anxiety and nothing helps. Fighting for every hour. I don't even 'want' that job, I can barely stabilize myself now, I have no idea how I'm supposed to do it. Crying my eyes out for weeks, if I actually could cry.   There wasn't an email from my former therapist either. Didn't really expect it. Still bringing me down. Had a phone call with her around ten days ago and one email exchange. Never know when she'll stop responding though.   It sucks cause I spend so much energy writing any email and I never know if it's even worth it. Or I'm just annoying her. For me it's like "either set the bar super low or constantly be disappointed from therapists". Doesn't really matter what I say, "hey I'm looking for a reason not to kms", "well keep looking, you won't hear anything from me". Seriously what am I supposed to expect.   Haaa I'm so pathetic. I have no spine, when someone looks at me the wrong way or utters one word of criticism I get a new trauma. I'm super on some people but I absolutely can't confront people, and ofc I can't just forgive them either (did I mention that I also tend to make up excuses for people who damage me and also happily let them walk over me?).   So it's just walking on eggshells all around. Super disappointed by everything and everyone and those believes seem to be reaffirmed constantly (but that's just because of my mood and selective way of thinking? Who knows!). Too brain damaged to walk to just another therapist once again. Constantly screaming in every wake moment, can't imagine going through the day without suicidal ideation.
I'm just so tired of everything now. I don't want to handle work, plus school, plus family responsibilities anymore. I've been having to jugle everything for years at a young age and it feels like my life is being wasted with nothing to show for it. I need one for semester to finish college but i honestly dont care anymore. i just want any full time job and to be able to come home and not worry about anything. Just enjoy the peace of not having responsibilities for a while. I'm burnt out. I dont think i have it in me to keep pushing and it makes me feel irresponsible, lazy and not worth anything. Not wanting to care so much about others and things makes me feel like a selfish piece of crap though. So unmotivated to do anything anymore. I have Midterm due tomorrow that i haven't even started.... Idk how to get my motivation back

There was a time, a rather embarrassingly long time, that I thought depression doesn’t exist. The power of will is all you need, my mother has been saying for decades. It’s almost a prayer. As a dumb child who wanted to be loved, I unquestioningly copied her mindset, carved it on something deep in my being. I’ve been taking antidepressants but never have really believed in the effects. For me, it all seemed to come from my circumstances and my lack of will. Nothing wrong with my hormonal balances or my brain pathways or whatever. It’s just me and my lack of will. Because it started innocently enough. First it’d felt like a letdown that went on for a bit longer that usual. A sprinkle of will power would’ve taken it away surely, but it haven’t. Then it would turn into a weeklong valley of numbness and disappointment, followed by several weeks of hollowness and bouts of crying, culminating into a pathetic and ineffective attempt at my own life which at that exact second I may have really wanted to die but honestly it was just a cry for help with no one listening. After that I would magically manage to return to normalcy with showing little to no consequence. Some bandages here and there, but nothing too big. No one the wiser. I go to work. I look fine. The cycle’s complete. Now I’m yet again at somewhere around crying and trying to fill the hollowness with whatever that will take my consciousness away. This is the point I realized that it’s a disease. This is a disease of mind which cannot act on what’s already known. I’ve read so many books on metal health, serious scientific ones to anecdotal essays. All the remedies are strewn around everywhere, but a diseased mind cannot act on any of them. The diseased mind chooses to sabotage self, would rather go down the predictable hole in the ground fully knowing there’s only dust to bite down. Then the second after resurfacing, the disease eagerly begin the cycle again. This would not end until it beat me dead. I’m sure of it. There is a fundamental flaw in my being that’s defying all reality and obsessing on self destruction. I don’t think I can fight it off. With this disease, a life is but a delayed death. Somewhere in my brain I’m telling myself that this is bullshit, you’re being overdramatic, go exercise it’s only acceptable self harm, you know how to get out of this you fool, you pathetic fool. But I can’t. I just can’t.
Today, I woke up angry. Somehow I dreamt of him and this feels like the first dream where my dream self was aware of the real life situation.  I was hurt. I am hurt. Funny how the person who made me feel so loved could also be the one to make me feel bad about myself. When did I give him this power?  Is it a game? How do people trust like this? Sigh.
Yikes, I wanna die.
i'm so useless and ugly why am i still alive even
Still having depression and ptsd so 🤷 nothing new
My depression is kicking me while I’m down and I don’t feel like I can get up.
I feel a peculiar sense of longing for the world of my dreams. A couple nights ago I dreamed that I was walking through the streets of Johannesburg with my family. I've never been there, but it felt so realistic (probably based on the trip I took to Colombia). We sat down in a streetside restaurant, and I got in an argument with my brother. I walked away for a bit, and when I came back, my family was gone. A stranger told me I should be proud of myself for standing up for myself. I had to find my way back to the hostel, and everyone I passed by on the street felt so real.  Then I wake up and I'm just isolated. I can't see my boyfriend because of Covid. I want to see him so badly. Everything feels just...kind of halfhearted in the concrete world around me right now. I'm glad my mind can create these dreams, but I wish I could experience more of that vividness in real life.  I had to call my therapist today because I got so anxious, yet dissociated at the same time, that I couldn't really function. He's very helpful. But when I'm alone, I fall back into the same places in my mind.
Therapy is the place I died.
been watching youtube videos of people sharing their experiences with getting help for depression. I guess I thought it would make me feel more hopeful, like things can really get better?  but all the folks I've found so far have had experiences that are totally removed from mine - people who have families and partners who can support them and help them access care, who live in countries with socialized medicine or who are on their parent's insurance, who are in a position to take extended time off to do inpatient, etc.  meanwhile I can't even find a therapist who's willing to work with me.  it's hard for me to believe these people when they say "it gets better :)" considering the huge difference in resources and accessibility.  I don't know. I'm just feeling hopeless. I'm ready for all this to stop.
Feel like everyone hates me. Feel like a failure. Feel like I never get it right. Feel like it’s been ages like this. When does it get better? My mind keeps fighting itself. I hate myself. I got help. Five or so years of it. Still struggling. Meds were no help. Still struggling.
It’s hard being depressed and being around someone whose negative energy just makes you feel more depressed. I get it, the world is shit and there’s no point. Fuck my life.
Idk depression really but examining how i consistently feel outside work or mindless activity is this..... i dont give a fuck about myself, then i hate that feeling, then i hate the fact that i hate it... let this multiply against eachother till it hits a point i say something online like right now.... then i hate the fact that i am typing about this online on reddit and on a depression forum where i hear about broken homes and abusive familys then i relize i am bitching and moaning online as a cry for help...... geee what a pussified cowardly falure of a male i am(20) i hope someone sees this and dms me so i can have a convorsation cuz i dont want to harm anyone else.... well fuckit might as well die here but im to cowardly to live any longer AND/OR face physcal pain of death and cause extreme problems for anyone in my fam or friends or ive come into contact with
While it's stating the obvious that many people feel, especially those with depression and other mental health problems - but I'm increasingly getting tired of the fact that no matter what you do, the other person(s) win. I'm feeling this way about my current job, family, and just in general. I'm tired of being at the lower end of the totem pole and feeling like nothing will ever change and go in my favor for once. Why keep doing what I do, then? Just to witness other people succeeding if not living comfortably as they are while I can only be on the outside looking in?
So I’m pretty sure my family (at least my wife and daughter) hates me now. When I go out to get myself soda in the morning, I always get my wife’s tea, except maybe when we’re fighting, yet my wife never offers to do the same. This past weekend my wife and daughter went out for brunch (something I’ve wanted to do forever and she knows it) and didn’t even tell me where they were going, let alone ask if I wanted to go.   I’ve got no friends, nobody to talk to, nobody who likes me.  It hurts. Yeah my wife and I are having issues but that’s no excuse to make me feel like I don’t even belong, like I’m not even loved.   If I didn’t have kids I’d probably do something bad to myself. I feel so sad and alone. This pandemic prevents me from even getting out and going to my office which I’d love to do at this point.   At least I know where I stand with her. Any decisions I make going forward I won’t feel so bad about them.
I hate myself so much like no matter what i do, even if it's something good for me, I flip it to fit the narrative that I'm an awful person. I can't let myself do anything without regretting it, being embarrassed or being angry at me . I feel awful since I have people around me who care but I feel so disconnected and keep on suspecting that they actually hate me ( even if there's zero proof for that) so I turn into someone who's either really mean or just ignores them. I feel like noone understands me but I can't even understand myself. I feel like a useless thing taking up space. I wish I could just die tbh
FUCK, I'm having small anxiety attacks about my situation. My apartment feels like a prison, nothing I could do inside here brings me pleasure and I can't go out either. Every time I try, I feel like a robot trying to blend in. I have no friends and wandering around outside, alone makes me just more depressed. FUCKKKKKK it's afternoon and I have nothing to do. A couple more hours and I'll still be sitting in this chair, almost crying until I finally just have to go to sleep and wake up to the same shit again. I'm currently in military service (conscription) and these vacations are the worst. The time spent in service itself is okay - but I am losing my mind when I get back home and have nothing to do. I'll just push through this service and then seek therapy, get on medication, do whatever to fix my life
I'm so tired of my mental issues. I hate how I am so socially inept that all the people that are actually willing to talk to me are pushed away by my personality. I try so hard to be kind and compassionate but I over do it and push people away. I feel broken. For over a decade I have been trying to mold myself into being on the same level as everyone else. Socially and mentally. I am tired of making friends only to lose them for one reason or another. I have never been anyone's best friend. I have always been in my best friend's outer circle of friends. I fear they only kept me around out of pity.
I'm struggling and have been for longer than I care to admit, but this month so far has kicked my ass. I'm feeling ashamed, guilty and I've been really hard on myself.   I find myself going back to old behaviors and have been having a hard time implementing coping mechanisms that I spent years in therapy practicing. It's been over 2 years since I've seen a therapist or taken meds and feel like maybe I need to start again, just to find some additional support, except I feel like I don't deserve it.   I hate feeling so hopeless and defeated and like I need to be punished for being broken. I'm afraid to reach out because so many people have real problems and need care more than I do and I don't want to add being selfish to my list of sins.
I honestly don't know what I'm living for..
Recently I’ve been watching disasters on YouTube. I watch people who had so much to live for lose their lives.  I feel guilty that I’m alive man. Why do I want to die so much I have no fucking idea. I wish to have more will to live. There’s so much to live for but it seems like I’ve reached a point where I can’t enjoy living anymore. I guess I’m really mentally ill.
I was transferred to the secure ward and have been here for two days. Tomorrow I'll be sent to the open clinic in my hometown. Aunt E has taken my cat home with her so he can be taken care of while I'm gone. Dad is cleaning my apartment. I ate a cup of yogurt and a handful of peanuts today. It was nice to eat something other than those drinks. I'm tired now.
I’m feel so drained lately from constantly arguing. It’s like no matter where i say things on. I get hate for my own opinion.
I need to get my shit together before I tell you to get your shit together.   But I don't know how.
I don't want to live
now how if he will never recover
After 24 hours on suicide watch, I was transferred to the clinic in my hometown this morning. The facility is open, but I'm not allowed to leave the premises unescorted, as they call it. The open ward is much safer, ironic as that sounds. It's nice to be able to express your feelings, good and bad, without being talked to like a kid or dragged off to your room. It's almost dinnertime. Mine consists of fruit tea and round crackers with cheese and jelly. I asked for that.
I have nothing and no one.
If there's one thing I could use right now is a nice big hug. Can't even remember the last time I got one...
I cut myself again. I made wayyy more cuts than I normally do... I have razor blades now. i broke them out of a pencil sharpener. I am that desperate... at least the razors are painless when I slash them across my wrists, oh maybe that is just me being used to it after a year of hurting myself, hm. a year? it couldn't have been that long... oh well, bye
Even after new medications and therapy I don't really feel any better. I would've maybe done better with a different therapist, but I didn't really get any choice.  It feels like my life is so shitty and I hate myself so much that nothing can make me feel better. My problems are things that can't be changed, and trying to 'challenge my depressive thoughts' won't fix any of that. Besides, the depression wins every time.
Again I have to go convenience store to go ATM and pay bills.Wish me luck.It's already 20:15!
I made stupid decisions because of my depression. And I got depression because of my stupid decisions. Chicken and egg, dammit.
I just want to cry right now. Idk y but I've just been feeling really sad as of late on and off it's weird.
I’ve been hurt because of my job since July and it’s looking like it’s going to be another 6 months minimum before I can even begin recover. I got a concussion at the beginning of the month, self inflicted due to a feeling of being overwhelmed, and my job is currently trying to fire me even though I have medical documentation that I was not allowed to return to work. My bills are starting to pile up and I feel like I’m sinking. I can’t talk to my wife about my depression or my suicidal thoughts because of her PTSD about suicide. I feel alone and that I’m failing. I’m on the verge of losing my home, my car, my job, and everything that I feel is binding me to the world. I’m not sure if I can continue this fight.
I'm still insecure whether I should try sharing my experiences and feelings in this subreddit. I've been in other support groups before. Frankly, I got judged, berated, belittled, and bullied more often than getting help.  But well, never stop trying, they said.  So basically I'm pretty much annoyed by my family. I'm an agnostic and they are a proud Islam supporter, fanatic, fundamentalist, conservative, Karens. Almost every day they keep blabbering about their so-called righteous values, promoting Islam and religion as a cure to mental illness, and constant prayer reminders that really bothers me, among countless other shenanigans.  But there's one thing that I will never forgive them.  In March 2020, I was a curriculum staff and a Sociology teacher in a Christian school, been three years teaching. My family found this out and they schemed in such a way I was fired with a bad rapport. Their reasoning was because they are worried I would be converted to a Christian and that they don't like people with religions other than "their" Islam (I said "their" Islam because even among Muslims, there are different beliefs because of different Quran interpretation, and my family regards anyone with different Islam belief as heretics). To this day, I am haunted by heavy financial debts, debt collectors...and my family barely even help me seek a new job. So much for being "responsible".  I had been admitted to the mental hospital for two weeks for suicide attempt in April because of this. But my family just make my depression worse with their constant bullshit coming out of their mouth. Basically, they blamed me for teaching in a Christian school, and they thought God is punishing me so I should deal with my problems myself.  Even today, none of them helped me. My mother basically gave her shit up to religion. I rarely talk to her anymore since April. My parents have long divorced, and my father didn't do much help because he now has his own family and his own problems to deal with.
My mom asked me to come back because her abusive ex had been showing up.  It's been hell even since I got here, and I see why I left.  I just want to go back to my already shitty life.  Superhot is the only thing filling this hole, and it's starting to take over eating and drinking.   I dont want to protect a shitty mother anymore.  I dont want to be around the negative enviroment.   To summarize how I feel about life.  "I want something new.  I need my fix."  Addict- Superhot MCD
The world doesn't want me. I'm going insane talking to myself. I don't know why I'm here
TW: Eating   Day 3 at the clinic. My fluids are getting better but food still makes me sick. Today I tried a bit of beef stew which I spat out immediately. Disgusting. That made me sad. You'd think that after basically starving for six months you'd welcome some food. It's not that simple. After dinner today I thought that I'll never recover like this, also, the staff here keeps record of my food and water intake. The doctor is not gonna like this. Now I'm hoping this is one of those things that get worse before they get better.
I wish I could move forward, but I am too filled with doubt and self-loathing.
I'm not doing good. I don't feel good. Nobody really cares and neither should I, but I do. What good is an existence when the brain is ail with so many problems that are beyond redemption? Not like people take me serious when I'm open about this fact to begin with. I have no help.
We are in lockdown again and I'm so glad my work is not closed because the isolation is terrible.
I'm tired of constantly being gaslighted by my parents. I wish I can get out from this house.
I feel like shit, thanks. Woke up everyday wanting to kill myself for a week. I have nothing to look forward to. My birthday is in two weeks but I'm dreading having to talk to people. And I am slowly losing hope of getting better.
It's been literally years. About 7 years. Since I've been genuinely hugged. Im one push away from crumbling down emotionally. I wish someone would notice... the fake smiles,  the strong front and funny guy mask.   At least crying about it helps me sleep at night.
Why the fuck am I still depressed at this point??? I thought things would clear up as I got older and my situation became less chaotic.  I'm gonna take a moment to silently scream in frustration   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I just want to feel good about myself just for once. No matter how much i try toget better i still feel bad. I complete my study goals i still feel bad i just feel like a failure , pathetic worthless shit all the time. This feeling will never go away i will never be happy i hope i die soon thats the best thing that could happen to me.
i really wish i believed in an afterlife. i feel like it would make coming to terms with everything so much easier. dunno why but the eternity of death is just so indescribably terrifying and the fact that i can't bring myself to believe that it's anything but just like.. nothingness really fucks with me. it's clear to me by now that it's the only option that's left. but fuck man if it isn't scary.
I felt so happy that I achieved something on Sunday. Woke up Monday morning still happy. I didn't get to bed till like 4am in the morning and didn't feel like cleaning up, would just do it when I wake up in the morning. Then got put down because I didn't throw out the couple of water bottles I had left out from the night before. I had just woke up too.
I'm really not sure what the point of trying to improve my life was when I still want to jump off a fucking bridge every single day.  If I had known what my life was gonna be like not 5 years ago I think I'd actually feel pretty good about it and assume that I would have few reasons to be depressed.  Well..nope.
i can’t sleep and don’t feel well all the time. it sucks.
I feel surprisingly ok for everything that is going on in my life right now. If this were a few years ago, I wouldn’t be able to function right now. Progress hurts but it can happen
I'm feeling lost. I think I might be having an episode. I feel empty. I passed all of this semester's subjects with good grades and I just don't feel anything about it, it feels like an empty accomplishment. I don't feel anything about my family or my boyfriend. The only thing that doesn't make me feel completely indifferent right now is my dog. I hate feeling like this.
Upset. Just learned I need to pay my school back $3,000 or else I can't register for new classes. I dropped out this semester because something weird was happening. I filled out my fafsa like normal, but then there was some sort of verification form I needed to fill out because I'd been "selected". It took me like a month before I could complete that file and send it in because I didn't have a printer to sign the document and they wouldn't allowed me to fill out the form digitally. I needed to complete this form or else the government wouldn't give me financial aid, but after I did so I waited for my aid which never came and the people I were in contact with basically stopped replying to my emails. I had to drop out this semester because no financial aid ever came through for me. And now this $3000 is still looming on my account, like wtf? I'm just upset. May seem like chump change to some people but my dad is retired now, we only have his social security checks coming in, which are not much. Hell, if I could afford 3k right now, I'ld be taking a trip to Europe (well, not now because of the pandemic, but you know what I mean).   So I have no idea what to do now. I guess I can try applying for scholarships to clear off this debt? I don't really know what to do. Also thinking of finally caving after 3 years and getting a loan which I really don't want, or I could try to find a job, but I don't know how fast I could find one in this climate. I don't have money saved up since I never had a job before. I wonder if I could scrounge up 3k by January from just working... it's practically already December. :'/   I feel awful. I dropped out specifically because I thought it would remove the fee or at least lower it somewhat since I didn't finish the semester, but it's the exact same amount it was on my first day of classes.
I been dealing with suicidal thoughts for some quite time. But through those dark days of voices battling  in my head I still have this small part of my brain telling me there’s still light and hope. I have days where I’m hopeful and days I’m dreading to be over. Does anybody know what this is or can relate? Sometimes it feels like these two opposite thoughts that are fighting my head can overwhelm and shut me down. I’m in mid 20s haven’t done anything accomplishable in my life and I just feel like a total failure. I know there’s hope but at the same time it seems like it so much work to climb that mountain.
I finally called the cops on a customer who made me extremely uncomfortable, only to be told that he's a regular and harmless 🙃  Well he sure wasn't harmless when he intimidated me into a elevator only to grope me nearly two weeks ago! I can feel my mood sinking into the pits, this job is _trash_
I can't stand group projects not because I'm afraid I'll be doing all the work, but the exact opposite. I fear I'm just dead weight and everyone has to carry me through.  I just had a second zoom meeting with my group and we're sharing our results, and it's obvious despite the hours I put into my side of the project it's the weakest, and someone else is finishing my part. It's humiliating and I feel like a fucking burden. I feel so bad for everyone who's stuck with me because they all have their own lives to attend to, and now they have to pick up after my mistakes.  I am now relegated to the most easiest part, writing an intro to the report and doing stupid busy work, and I feel like my group members resent me even though I put a genuine effort to do my best. I just want to fail this project on my own, not drag a bunch of people with me.
Its exhausting trying to please everyone when I don't have anything to give, I wish I could take myself out of this life. I want everything I feel to just go away forever dude.
i finally am trying to get better & get a therapist but no one will take me because they’re packed from ppl sad about covid and my insurance sucks. my medicine isn’t working. i feel like i’m just another problem. i don’t want to be here anymore. a little part of me has hope & im trying. but each day i get more and more comfortable with the idea of dying. i don’t want to hurt my dad tho. i dislike almost everything. talking to people, but i still complain about being lonely. i hate getting up for work. i have no passions or goals. i feel like such a burden.
I'm having some spasms of existential fear or angst, i don't know what you call it. But I heard a scary thing that some brilliant scientists have a theory that we are a simulation, and I also found out we have a giant astroid on route to either hit us or pass us and. I mean it's the same old story, they've done this "we're definitely gonna die this time from astroid" thing countless times. But it never fails at scaring me. The reality is a simulation theory also scares and depresses me. Sometimes I have thoughts like what is the point of living if these things are plausible or even true. But I've been having a really good drawing streak, and I don't want to stop working on my art just because I might be a video game character made by a sick god, or because of a dumb astroid. The pandemic is scary enough already.
I feel like my depression isn't consistently as bad at the moment, but now I'm way less stable. I'll be almost happy and then crash super hard I also get angry which has almost never happened in the past X years I've been depressed.  I've had that hopeless I'm never going to get anywhere I need to give up feeling three times today, but it hasn't stuck around which is weird. Maybe this is just what normal emotions are like and I'm so used to being numb? I feel like 15 very strong emotions a day when I used to average maybe 2 a month outside of hopelessness.  Anyone else get this?
For me it's just my self image. I despise my entire body and no matter what I do I can't love myself
Was excited about this thanksgiving. Had this cute picture in my head of how it would have turned out. Yeah well depression got in the way of that. I’m an overthinking mess and I just want to go back to my bed and sleep this day away and the upcoming days as well. That would be really nice.
Making my family as miserable as me for thanksgiving.
I’m extremely burnt out from school. It’s supposed to be thanksgiving break right now but I have 60 more pages of dense reading that I need to get through and present on tomorrow. I also have 9 writing assignments due Saturday and a project due Monday. I hate how the professors say “have a great thanksgiving haha :)))” like they didn’t assign all this. I’m trying to focus, but I just keep getting lost in my head about feeling sad, and wish I could go into the living room and play video games with my sister who is only in town this week.
I should just walk out and kill myself tonight. I have no other way out anymore. If it hurts people, good. They deserve it for not trying to help me while I could still be helped.
im just really tired. i feel so alone. i really just want a girl i can hug. being a person is hard i just want someone to go through it with. talking to people is tiring. job applications are tiring. trying to not be bored but also have energy is tiring. i feel tired from applying for jobs andrunning around recently but i dont know how to relax. i think what would relax me would be to hug with a girl. man im so fucking tired of trying. i mean im doing better and ill get it one day. I just want someone to go through it with. side note: should reply to my friend and tell him i dont want to instead of ignoring the message. feels better when someone replies even if dont feel like interacting.
Why do I always set myself up for failure. I had many days to study but I can’t get out of bed.  Now I’ll have to cram so much content in 4 days and I’m having a mental breakdown again. I’m so disappointed in myself.

I feel like shit. I shouldn't exist.
I’ve been pretty burnt out and fighting depression for months now. Just going through the motions... trying to stay afloat, but everything changed two days ago when I was let go from my job the day before thanksgiving. The fact that I had been able to keep my job was the one positive thing that I was clinging to this year, and now that’s gone. I’m in a deep hole now. Trying to prepare my resume and apply to other jobs but goddamn it, all I want to do is just disappear. I didn’t ask for any of this. I will never hurt myself or do anything bad but at this point, I really just don’t want to exist anymore. I’m exhausted.
I've been in such an awful depression spell for the past few months and it's showing no signs of getting better. I have a psychiatrist appointment in a few days so hopefully I can at least get started trying to fix my meds for the fourth time. Feeling hopeless and exhausted.
i feel so shitty right now.  the person i love the most in this shit world feels so distant from me, i've done everything for her, helped her through some tough shit but can't do the same for me  call me whiny bitch i don't give a shit isn't it supposed to be 2-way   i can't even talk to her about how i'm feeling or what's in my mind 'cause her mind is always somewhere else or she's so fucking mean to me
I’ve checked all the boxes.  Depression. Anxiety. Drug use. Suicidal thoughts. Mental breakdown - leave from work. Involved in abusive relationships. Loss of a parent. Debt. Divorce/humiliation. 3 nearly fatal overdoses this year. Nobody to trust with 100% of what I’m dealing with. I have a Dr. and Therapist, but I cherry pick what they know.  Too much shame. Starved by affection, care. Friends living their lives and moving on.  I see no other way for this to end for me.  I will die.  I don’t have plans to do anything, but I feel it’s inevitable.  It also appears nobody reads these or comments.
i cant stop crying
I had a pretty good stretch of days where I felt balanced...now I’m miserable and in bed all day. Fuck this
Well I’m in the middle of my last family trip and just like every other trip, my wife has to control everything and puts me on edge.  She’s incredibly selfish and doesn’t appreciate me and makes me want to kill myself sometimes. She doesn’t love me and I don’t know why I keep hanging on. Maybe I think I deserve this. I somehow deserve to be treated like a second class citizen.  I keep trying to be nice and she can’t do the same for me. Fuck COVID. Fuck thanksgiving. Fuck life
I just can't take this job any longer.  Been at it for 20 years and been through so many permutations of my position.  Currently I have more responsibility than ever and I feel like I'm whiffing.  Lately I've been finding it difficult to concentrate and retain info about projects.  We're about to have a very busy week and even though we were supposed to be off Thursday and Friday, I should have done more work to prepare.  I have some to do today.  We are also onboarding three new people and I don't feel prepared to do that.  I'm shutting down, just not with it.
I'm hurting so badly and getting back on meds is making me feel even worse. I can't catch a break, please let me end my life..
I can’t I can’t I can’t I can’t I can’t. I want to yell and scream and cry but I can’t, I’m so exhausted and my back feels like shit, and I have to somehow come up with a 30 minute presentation by midnight tomorrow. This whole semester has been hell. I tried working for 3 hours and got almost no where my brain doesn’t work anymore but if I don’t get this done I can’t complete the program and finally get out of my parents house. I’m so priveleged and “everyone is going through it” but why does it hurt so fucking bad for me, I just can’t pull it together. I wish I was dead I haven’t enjoyed living for at least five years now it just keeps going. If this was an individual assignment I would probably have just accepted a 0 or turned in BS but people are counting on me and I’ll be publicly shamed if it isn’t good, I fucking can’t this professor wants to kill me. I wish I could pass out or get sick so at least I would have an excuse and at least it would make sense that I feel this bad. I’ve been saying “I just have to get through this week” for MONTHS now and I just can’t anymore, this class is a fucking moving target and nothing I turn in is ever good enough, I never get the benefit of the doubt and any possible detail that could have been included gets scrutinized and I lose points. I haven’t gotten a positive comment ever, every thing sucksFUCK YOU  that is all
What’s the point of living a life where I’m doomed to fail?
I don’t feel anything except anger at the fact that most of the things that are wrong with me now were never because of my decisions. Single teenage mom who never did anything with her life and physically abused me, no role models to follow and a drowning sense that nothing mattered other than avoiding punishment. I got a full ride to my dream college and I can only focus on how everyone went home for thanksgiving and I was left in my dorm to starve because I haven’t spoken to my parents since February and all of the food places on campus were closed for most of the week.  I can only feel anger, nothing more. Just bottomless anger at everything and everyone. From the people who I see on social media that have it all to my friends who can live normal lives with supportive households and the appropriate amount of stress. If they ever have some depressive moments, suicidal thoughts, anything of the sort, they have access to someone who loves them unconditionally. Who knows how my life could be if I just had that very simple thing.  Anyway, life is pointless and I’m only alive because I have a few friends I cannot disappoint by taking my own life, but I keep considering more and more that I should just push them away completely so I can just end everything. Not existing would mean an escape from the incessant pain I feel every day.
Fuck this.  Y'all take care of yourselves.
just broke up with my boyfriend of three years and best friend of 6 because i'm so depressed and i feel so empty and alone :')
I feel like I'm one bad day away from a full mental breakdown
My insomnia is off the wall lately. Love how now is when friends decide to check in, after I've mostly given up messaging them because they never replied. But is it asking if I'm okay or words of encouragement? Nope, just blame for the things they did being actions I supposedly caused. I really wish I knew why I keep trying to make friends, being afraid of having none seems real dumb when the ones you've got are total trash.
Today i messed up again, this time real bad.   Why am i so fucking stupid and useles?   I hope some freak accident happen to me, so the world can get rid one more trash and be a better place...
I fucking hate myself for the things I can't do, and I'm so fucking sad tonight, I'm crying and I have my beautiful supportive fiance in chat and I can't tell him how down I am because it's not fair, and I can't hold him for god knows how long. I tried so hard to fix my brain but how can I do it if I don't understand what's going wrong. I just know I can't do what other people do. I'm not fucking human.
finally got my ass off the bed. Last 2-3 weeks went so shitty. All I did was cry and stay in my bed. But yesterday went good I did some productive things I hope  I don't lose this vibe soon.
I wish I lived alone. I feel like my family drag me down.
I'm so broken and tired right now. I finally made a psychologist appointment today. Something to look forward too
Lately I feel like I’m loosing it. At times I can’t control the waves of frustration that hit me. I feel like my brain is going to tear into two. And I have this feeling like something bad is suppose to happen and it puts me in sort of a standby mode.. just waiting. Walking in the cold sort of helps and I’m waiting to get a job so I can get help or something but I feel the harder I try the less luck I run into. I just feel like yelling and pointing fingers and telling everyone how wrong they’ve been around me... but I know they’ll all just leave or but me in a crazy house. But then I don’t want to do that because they do have good traits. Just sucky ones too. And for some damn reason I can’t see a middle ground it’s good or bad and my brain feels like I’m just fighting it all the time.
Haven’t felt this bad in a while. Just wish somebody close would check in today, even with just a hi.
I wish I could pray to god, anyone, any being that could help me. I hate when I know something bad and inevitable is coming. It's horrible, it's horrible.
Libido is down due to depression.
Been a tad down due to fatigue after recovering from Covid. I tell myself that nothing matters and I don't need much to be happy, but sometimes it is hard to maintain this attitude.
I hate myself. I can't do anything good. I was feeling good for awhile but now the thoughts are back.
I have small house projects I should do at the house I live at, which my partner owns. but I have trouble actually starting it, and then when I start, I think, “why am I doing this? I’m not wanted here anyway. I know she’s going to criticize me on how it looks, and I’ll just be disappointed at how shitty it looks.”
i'm so lonely but i hurt anyone who even wants to be there for me.. why am i still alive anyway. i wish i just never existed
I wouldn't say I feel numb, I'm just feeling a little of everything but not enough of one thing.
My family and friends love me. I know how blessed I am. So many things to be thankful for in my life. I have to keep it going.
I stopped taking my meds. Not on purpose but originally out of forgetfulness and then eventually just not caring. After about a week of being off them, I start getting cocky and think I don't need them, I'm fine. I'm not fine. I want to die. I have been having these thoughts every day for the past few weeks. Had a big breakdown tonight and admitted to my husband that I haven't been taking my meds. Took a dose just now and will try to be better going forward. Sometimes it kills me to think about how I can't function without my meds. But I guess it's better to depend on meds than to be consumed with thoughts of wanting to die every day.
Was not able to work yesterday because I was not well physically. And today I'm probably well physically, but I'm 'comfortably numb'
dont know what to say anymore, its just very hard
I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I've been home all week, it's hard just to go to the Couch, eat healthy, drink enough or just don't feel like useless shit and make my loved ones worry. Occasionally I lash out, because I hope they leave me and I can finally find peace. I don't even want to feel this way, I used to be so active, do what others can't, run 10k, I used to laugh a lot, I used to be outgoing. I am a shadow of myself and I don't recognize the person starring at me in the mirror. I just I don't have to live like this much longer, I just can't keep it up anymore.
I can't imagine a future without my family. I'm the youngest with older sibling. My parents are seniors now, and my depression is already bad while life is still somewhat good and I'm doing alright. I see my life quickly deteriorating after my parents die. I imagine myself becoming homeless, becoming gaunt and my teeth getting destroyed. Or having to go to a home for disabled people or something.
I’m pissed.I went to GP (changed GP because I don’t want to go GP,but I need meds.Changed to clinic accepts online) As I love on fixed income and my medical expenses are all covered,I asked to my case worker to send paperwork all they need.But they(actually,one fat nurse)said she didn’t receive one! In this situation,as she was blaming me,I figured she lost the papers 🙄(same with fart) I have to wait to get my meds until monday...as a disabled,I expect able people do the job.But they don’t.If they blame others,like “supposed to vulnerable “me,(sorry, I’m not)They should quit. Sorry for the vent 💕🌹
Well my week has been absolutely horrible. The alternator on my car went out. It was a struggle to get a replacement and I’m waiting on a mechanic to come to my house to switch it out. I’m also having interpersonal conflicts with a difficult coworker. I’m not coping very well to say the very least.
Friend has time to help randoms online with their depression, yet his only time for me is reserved for complaining I've put up walls between us. No dude, I just don't feel like talking to you anymore because everything you say to me sounds like you're talking down to me. I don't know what the hell happened to our friendship, but whatever this is...I want out. I'm so tired all the time without needing this crap whenever I come online, yet I keep not dropping him because I still care about him on some utterly stupid level.
I know I left a lot on the table. This makes me wistful and sometimes depressed.
Oh my god I could fucking punch a hole in the wall. My brother pissed me off so damn much!! OCD FREAK!
I just feel super alone and frustrated at myself for not being better
the only thing I look forward to this time of year is listening to all I want for Christmas is you cover by mcr with an excuse💀
Could use someone to reach out to me
My post was removed, but I really need support, can someone reach out to me please?
I'm struggling pretty bad right now, it seems like I can barely function lately. I used to be able to have lows and just kind of deal with it, but right now, it's just so hard to ignore, it feels like I'm super numb, I just want to disappear for a while.
My birthday is today. Spent it almost like every other day as I have taken the day off from work. I still don't have much going for me and I hate how much I'm ruminating to the point it's making me sick. At some points I feel like I would break, for various reasons, but the underlying being as to what I'm doing to make use of this pathetic life after 27 years of wasting it. I'm not that young anymore when it seemed like it would last forever when I was. I am pretty much at the point that maybe the best thing is to be reclusive and accept that 'making it' is not designed for everyone. I think I'll slowly be okay with that.
I’ve tried so hard at so many things but I really feel like in the end it’s leading to nowhere. There are things I want to do but I don’t have the energy or motivation left to achieve them ... and every day gets worse and worse. I want to succeed in something, quite literally anything but I’m not brilliant at anything. It hurts so bad. The only reason I feel like I’m still living and somewhat functioning on a day to day basis is my family at this point.
It's starting to feel like the facade of digital media I've created for myself to not feel so alone is starting to break. I'm realizing that I'm just looking at various screens through out the day. There is no real connection. Even with the few friends I've managed to become acquainted with. It's shallow at most.
Been a while but here I am again, distracting myself could only last so long 😎 2021 will thankfully be the last year, I can't delay it any longer. Might try even before new years if I can't pick myself up, this episode has been building up 😎😎 Then my pathetic worthless life can be forgotten by others and myself as it's always should've😎😎😎😎😎.
i went out to buy a floor fan today because the weather has been unbearably hot but i didnt know the fan was so big in size.. so i asked the lady working if she could help me find a plastic bag for it. she took it down to the cashier and they didnt have a bag big enough. i felt bad that she already brought it all the way down so i purchased it and carried it all the way home. my arms hurt and i just thought.. i wish i weren't alone. i was walking down the street hefting the big ol box and i saw couples walking past me, parents and their kids walking past, friends hanging out. i just feel.. really lonely. yet i also would like to just live alone the rest of my life. no one deserves to deal with a trainwreck like me. someone who would break down over buying a floor fan
i feel sick.
Feeling anhedonic, unmotivated, hopeless, and lonely today. Hopefully this unpleasant phase will be a short one
Last weekend I fell through my ceiling from my attic. When I told someone who I thought was friend of mine what happened to me she completely kicked me out of her life for what reason I’ll never know. Practically all the people that I knew have done the same as she did. People that said they cared about me when I spoke about to them about being depressed. Come to find out during the surgery to fix my arm that I completely smashed the top half of my arm into many pieces. I have so much metal in my arm now. I’m at a loss for words how I feel right now. I feel completely abandoned. What mental issues I have been dealing with seem practically insurmountable now
The loneliness is excruciating. I have nobody. I feel so empty and alone, but there is nothing i can do about it except endure, as per usual.
I don’t know where else to go. I can feel people get uncomfortable with my negativity when someone finally asks me how I’m doing and I just unpack everything that’s going wrong in my life and my head. I’ve started to pretend to be happy and positive to make my friends and family comfortable again. They seem happy, but now I’ve ruined my relationship. I just feel so worthless and I’m so tired.
My day be extra sad because my cat died. I never lost anyone I've loved to death before. This feels so strange but the absence is too much. I wanna cradle her in my arms again ;-;
I’m not ok. It’s getting harder and harder to hide how bad things are from my husband. I hate the way I make him feel, like he’s failing in some way because he can’t fix me. I hate it. I just feel so alone. I dealt with depression 8 years ago and it’s come back hard. I’m having the same urges again, to hurt myself, to get in my car and just drive away (like somehow that will help). I’m terrified because this is the same time of year I was hospitalized in high school. I never want to go back there. But I feel so trapped and so lost. I’m just so fucking tired.
A few months or weeks maybe? Ago I started to get close with a friend of a friend. We got around to talking a lot and even hours on end. I kinda knew we were never going to be more than friends but I think at the back of my mind I still hoped we could even a little closer.   Fast forward to a couple of days ago I think I made her uncomfortable and she stopped replying. Earlier I sent my apologies and told the person that I'm sorry and I'm going to back off.  Everyday that I don't see a reply fucking kills me, part of that is why I said I'll back away. I removed the application from easy reach from my devices but one of my devices popped a notification sound.   I can see that the icon is from what we use to talk.   I angled my phone in such a way that I can't read the notification but can still clear it. I disabled the notification after that. I don't think I can take it if that wasn't the person that messaged.   Right now I think I made peace that I will not be talking to that person again. I say at peace but I'm practically crying right now. At least with this I've come to terms with it..  Edit: I checked the messaging service.. it was not the person.. i kinda prepared for this that’s why I only did it now on the weekends, so hopefully my job won’t be affected. It still hit like a fucking truck though.. crushing my heart.. sigh..
I don't know what to write. I've just been feeling lonely, distant and isolated from everyone lately. I feel like everything is shallow, and there's no point in maintaining anything.  I'm getting all my thoughts tangled up.  I think all I really need is a tight, warm hug.
Here I am, in a fairly new place of realization, acceptance and making attempts to get better. Have a therapist, may be starting meds soon, unable to see my children...all coming pretty rapidly over the last 3-6 yrs....with a huge slamming in the last 2...and have just recently found this sub...
Hiding at home. Outside is so scary.  Oh, and independent from that there's a virus going around.
Friends are bullshit and all they're good for is leaving you when you need them.
Wow I’m so burnt out from work. Not even thinking straight. Hopefully it doesn’t fuck up relations with people.   I’m putting in my two weeks tomorrow no hesitation.   The stress and anxiety of life got me wildin
I keep having to go through the pain of re-realizing that my friends don't really care about me. I was the first again this year to ask my different groups if they wanted to meet up for a Christmas meal. I posted a story on instagram, asking if anyone wanted me to post the music that I've been working on for the past week. No one voted.  I think the only people who actually care for me are my online friends, and even so they care for everyone who is in the server. It's nice to be somewhere I can feel appreciated at the very least, but I don't feel special to anyone. I regularly see all my friends going out or having good relationships with their family but I'm just here, desperately wanting to move out and a reason to get out of the house.  And when I say that I have no friends, everyone's there to shut me down and feel insulted. What the fuck.
Yesterday i found out my crush had a girlfriend. I’m just now getting all sad about it for some reason.
I will use an offensive language sorry in advance! I am far away better than some other suckers under this subject.  However, my thoughts on life are becoming closer to not desiring to live.   It hurts and there is no remedy for the pain, if the pain itself is me.   I do not want to die until I have my Worst and most dreadful nightmare. Moreover, I do not want to die before I experience the maximum degree of a human being can feel within his existence. Thus, I do not want to die or am not thinking of making it faster. However, I want the worst pain ever that It has not found me yet. I will suffer till I hit the real and ultimate rockbottom.
Last night I had to say goodbye forever to my dog Cooper on my schools test night. Despite me desperately trying to contact my schools director about my situation they are refusing to let me retake the test at a later time and now it’s looking like I have to retake the course next year. Cooper had gotten me through the worst parts in my life and now I don’t know if I can go on without him.
Feeling lost and alone more than ever in life. Not sure what the point of anything is.
I started transitioning (gender-wise) months ago, and realistically I have succeeded...socially. But my body and mind have failed me in the process. I got terrible side effects, and now have permanent physical and mental issues... I descended into chemically-induced depression, but by the time I convinced them I couldn't take one of the prescriptions, I came off them and flew into hypomania instead. Now I feel damaged, and I bounce between states of extreme depression and chaos. I'm very worried I'll never be normal again...My ability to handle life itself let alone further transition steps, and to progress from this new state of multi-week stagnation is crippling me.  I'm so off the rails I ended up breaking down at work multiple times, and today I flipped out on my boss. I have hardly slept in the last few weeks and I sometimes just don't even eat...It just seems like my whole life is spiralling out of control.
my will to live is rapidly depleting. everyday i have a little less hope that things will get better. theres not one good thing in life right now. oh my god someone save me
I have.  He refuses to try anything and he is having meltdowns weekly.  I'm afraid for his safety when he does lose it.
He went to the Dr on his own,  twice.  Both tried to prescribe same thing.  He won't take it.
I hate not having energy to do things when my mind is actually in a good place. The lack of energy sucks, I feel like my body is weighed down with lead.
I WOULD NOT MIND HAVING MY HEAD RIPPED OFF :)
Why do I isolate myself so much? Why do I not yearn for human interaction? I wish I could care more about socialising. It’s like nothing really matters to me anymore.
I reached out to find a psych + therapist. I also used some crisis hotlines, which were disappointing.
I am currently in the hospital with fever and my mom for the first time in a long time genuienly seems to care about my well being.
Everything and everyone is so empty of meaning. Even my own family members. If I find a reason to live it's not gonna be with anyone.
I'm wondering if I have the fortitude to handle what life is certainly going to throw at me.
I'm overwhelmed
Hating myself once again for the way I look hmph
I didn’t travel like I wanted to.  And now I’ve missed the opportunity. I hate that I’ve just let that happen. Travelling will never be the same and there really is nothing I can do but try to accept it.
had 3 nightmares, woke up believing they were real. I don't know what is going to happen to me.
I've gotten to the point where I'm just crying for no reason now. I've been getting crushed by this massive wave of misery for the past week, it just came out of nowhere. It's never happened like this. Even if I can keep the negative thoughts out it doesn't matter anymore. My brain has just decided that every second that I'm not with someone I have to be miserable.
is life just suffering? I feel like im always trying to get something and hating life because I don't have it. its always been the same thing though so maybe when i get it i wont feel bad. friends and gf is what i want. and now a job. I've gotten better with people which makes me feel better and my depression is mostly better. just hard sometimes because I want a job and feel like a failure because of it. plus I just never get a rest. everytime im doing anything, like taking a day off, i could be applying for jobs. so fucking sick of it. also im a virgin and my 25th birthday is coming up. just feel like a a failure because of no job and i feel in this culture people are made fun of and put down for being a virgin. plus i feel that loving/caring for someone will make life feel like it has more of a purpose.
Exams are finally over, I thought I would be in a better headspace now. I'm tired of feeling like a failure and unwanted. I guess it's kind of stupid to feel like this, but I just wish I had some friends that would check in and ask me how I'm doing.   I know I have people in my life who care about me, I just hate feeling like I always have to be the one who reaches out to them.
Sold my home, left my job, and left my friends be hind. Me and Mom threw everything to the wind to be with our family all the way across the country.  We're being kicked out of their house. We have the 15th of January to find a place to live that allows pets.  All because my sister-in-law wants her house back.  I've got no friends here, I've no longer got any family but my Mom here, My girlfriend isn't really helping me either.  I've no one to confide to, no one to release these emotions. Some times I wonder why I even bothered. Work is wearing on me, as well. God, I hate the holidays.
I did go to the bank today. It wasn't the worst. The teller did not seem judgmental and helped me as much as he could. It was worse in my head for some reason.    I need to clean now.    The worst thing that could happen is I don't clean at all. I go home tomorrow when my parents come pick me up. I don't pack. The best way to avoid that is to just start cleaning now.    If some people see me throwing trash so be it.  The worst case is actually what happens after I move back. But I can always return by flight.  It's hard for me to clean and I need sleep. Instead of cleaning I spent 5 hours mostly browsing while caffeinated. I suppose if it were easy I'd have done it already.    Please just let me die. It's easier than admitting that I'm such a fuckup.  Found a post it note that said "you're going to lose her" and I did.
Unemployed and depressed. Losing interest in my career goals. I have nothing to look forward to. Desperately trying to find new hobbies and games to occupy my mind only to lose interest in them after a few weeks.  Depression is really fucking up my life and I don’t know how to live anymore. How can I live when I think about dying almost every hour.
I can't finish in time. I started cleaning around 3am. Maybe 3:30 and haven't really stopped though I took short breaks. But my room was such a pigsty that there's still mess. I don't think I can finish in time. I only have an hour. But at least I tried. And it's better than it was before.    Trying not to beat myself up over it like I do everything else.    I procrastinated too much the 2 days prior.
The only thing keeping me going anymore is the thought that my dog would never understand why I never woke up or why he would never get to see me anymore.
I don't think the ECT worked; I feel constantly sad only a month later...  but I'm scared to tell my doctor, I can't handle staying in the psychiatric ward again
I know my family wants the best for me but I hate it. I hate how they judge the people that I've been in a relationship with because of their financial status and their appearance. I hate how they know I'm currently in a relationship and yet they still want me to be with this dude who is rich. I don't want to be with a person just for the money. I want to tell them but they will definitely say that I'm an idiot and will remind me until I break up with my boyfriend. I want to get out.
I've recently started therapy which has been good, but the process of opening up has also made me vulnerable. I'm starting to feel the full weight of having wasted much of my life. This, coupled with the holiday season, is giving me something of an existential crisis. Usually I think of killing myself due to self-pity, but now it's coming from a different place.   At least I have some hope that next year will be better.
I fucking hate the holidays just another reminder of loneliness and misery.
I feel drained and don’t know what  to do I’ve never been like this I fell like I can’t anymore my depression and anxiety just gets worse and this pandemic is never going away. I just wannna be done with everything and I can’t open to anyone.
The holidays are so tough for me. My entire family are extroverts that love to spend every second with one another. I need time to myself and they all take offence. Either I feel shitty because I’m socially drained or I bypass my feelings/needs and spend all my time with them, still feeling shitty. It’s a lose-lose.   But the hardest part of the holidays is the reminder about my depression. Everyone’s so happy and excited and loving. And I just don’t feel any of that, even when I try. It’s just... well... depressing and honestly makes me feel like a failure for not being able to feel the same way.
I am trying to against my nature of introversion and be someone I am not so that I do not overthink by going out and partying hard. I know I need to recharge my social battery but I rather not overthink and lay in bed crying. I am forcing myself everyday to go out with someone. It is hard because when I am out I am very moody I don't even fake it anymore. But I have to slowly overcome this, I have overcome it before and I can do it again.
feels really really really fucking weird to be at my dads house for the first time in so long. i think the last time i was here that i can even remember was last christmas. i don't understand how everything went by so fast. my memories of back then are still more vivid than most of my memories of this year. i would give anything in the world to go back even if for just a day
Laying in bed today. Don’t have the will or energy to get up.
Woke up again early night due to powercut. Thought I'd sleep peacefully tonight.      Then I started thinking. Kind of composed a suicide note whenever I do it.      Dear mom ( it's for everyone who considers me family but I felt like addressing to mom).      I don't know what you expected of me, what you thought of me. You may think of me as strong, living alone doing all the things which you never thought I'd do because of the careless attitude I had.      But your outlook is wrong. I'm living a lie, I don't eat properly and just lie to you about my food. There are days where I'm living in a dirty home because I don't have the will to clean it.      I know you have certain expectations of me, but I can't meet up to them while being alive. I have no friend s with whom I'd feel comfortable talking to, I feel like a fake, faking everything and people just being nice towards me.      I'm sorry I couldn't be a good son, brother, friend and leaving you when you need me the most. I'm sorry that I'm being selfish, but this is what is needed. I'm useless for you alive, atleast me death might be of use to you in some way.      Bbie If there's any reincarnation I wish I get to be with you again, but where I'm not this broken and can live upto all your expectations, and make you proud.
I slept all day, had no energy to get out of bed. My parents didn’t check on me. No one called or texted. I feel so alone and like everyone hates me. I just want to cry and cry. And I think about suicide and just let my brain explore a life where I don’t have to feel so much pain. Then I shift back to reality and realize I’m trapped in my body and can do nothing about it. So I sit here and cry

I was doing surprisingly well until the 24th came in, haha. My anhedonia's come back and it's been particularly tough because I have so many things to be grateful for, yet I can't seem to find happiness in them. I'm taking it one day at a time, making an effort and never giving up. Keeping Joshua 1:9 in my mind has helped tremendously.
I'm no longer suicidal, I haven't been for a month or two. But I'm so bored of living, I'm so exhausted and sad and I'm stuck with unsupportive people who guilt trip me and neglect my feelings. I want mental help so badly but don't know how to get it. I'm so tired. I'm so sad. But I'll just ignore it
I feel pain in my chest and stomach. I built up a fantasy with someone, and now I am trying to live in the reality, so I told him, that we should stop talking. Now I am feeling this pain in my chest. It feels so heavy.
Alone. Very alone. I have maybe 2 friends that will talk to me more than infrequently and whenever they aren't here the days go so fucking slowly. One is in America and rarely appears which makes it nice when they do, the other I'm used to talking to near 24/7, so not having them talk for a full day when I know they're online stings. I wanna know what I've done wrong, or why they hate me now or anything like that, I don't get it. I wish I knew how to make other friends or do anything so I didn't feel like this so regularly.
Hanging in there. Making small progress day by day.
In all support groups I visit often (smoking, drinking, studying, health etc),  there are regular posts from folks who managed to overcome their addictions or obstacles and seems to have a happy life. I don't see anyone here posting: "hey depression is over, and if I can do it you can do it". This scares me a lot, I dont think reading others suicidal thoughts would help me anyhow.
No one on this worthless rock can be trusted. There isn't a soul alive that will ever live that will understand and can be trusted. Everyone and everything is so selfish and entitled and cruel. Fuck you all. Kill me.
Why am i still alive I want to die so fucking bad
The one person who care so much for and can make me happy simply with a text saying “hi”  is now avoiding me in every way possible and I don’t know what to do with myself I’ve never felt more alone and worthless
Hanging in there. Just trying to make little progress everyday.
I want to die. I thought things couldn't get any worse but I'm falling apart. My body is breaking down due to a lack of self care from years of depression. Just when I thought I could fix my life and try to be happy for once, it's too late. I have much too many problems now that its probably easier to kill myself. It's too late for me. I wish God will just end my suffering. I'm so sick of this. This isn't fair.
i hate the holidays. i'm jealous of everyone i know. it feels like i'm stuck. nothing is fun anymore. idk lol
I can't stand that I have to go to work in ten minutes. I am feeling sick and want to cut myself. I have so many bills and chores to do. My parents only want to give me another bill. I am so excited that I will have less excuse to talk to them. I wish that I can never talk to them again for the rest of my life, I will need to find reasons to talk to them and erase them one by one. I hate them. They said I was not abused.   Okay, so today I have to pay my credit card bill as it is nearly maxed. I  also have to pay my rent. I have to get dressed and I feel like shit. Wow I just accidentally charged my credit card 5 dollars extra buying breakfast. I am so fucking stupid too.
I've been on antidepressants most of my life, I've been on them longer then I've been off of them. If anything I feel worse when I regularly take then. I've been on more psychiatric medicine then I can remember. From Abilify to Zoloft, none of them work for me.  Currently on a daily regime of Wellbutrin XL 150mg, Celexa 40mg and Abilify 10mg. All it does is make me feel worse. Whenever I mention that to my doctor they assume I'm not taking them regularly and remind me to do so.   This all just feels hopeless. Ive been told for years that I have a chemical imbalance. But the medicine designed to treat this stuff doesn't do anything but make me feel worse.
I'm so tired. So tired of everything. I am hated in my house. My kids. My husband. I'm ruining all their lives by being here. I don't want to exist but I'm also afraid of not existing. I'm tired of repeating all of this and nobody hears me. I've been crying out for help for 5 years and its only getting worse.
Since i haven't achieved anything ever, I've decided to quit nicotine.  Pros: i'm actually feeling things again, great antidote to apathy   Cons: am losing my fucking mind bloody hell
I'm fighting dépression, getting up early lately and try to work (write stuff, mostly). Little success, but still.  Aaaand then I saw that the women I really like is now in a relationship with a friend.  I bought a game on steam and spent 14 hours straight on it today, so as not to think about anything. Didn't eat, not hungry, didn't even take my medication.   No one wants to hire me, so I can do that without bothering anyone. Yay I guess ?

I thought I was doing better, I've slowly been cleaning up the house and even showered and shaved a few days ago, but I just realized I've been sleeping in the same shirt for three nights straight. I also have no actual sleep schedule; I think I'm slowly becoming nocturnal because lately I've been afraid of the dark. No job anymore because covid and all my applications are getting rejected despite having 9ish years experience in the field I'm applying for.   Not that it even matters at the moment because I'm back into quarantine due to my SO coming into contact with someone who likely has the virus (still waiting to hear results).  I tried sharing my feelings with him and was met with tough love, which I'm usually a proponent for but that's the last thing I need right now. I did communicate that to him.  But whatever I guess, I'm just going to keep playing animal crossing and the sims in the middle of the night and hope I find the motivation to at least change shirts tomorrow. Luckily my real animals motivate me to at least get out of bed.
I don't know what to do I'm getting worse everyday. Everything seems too hard to do. I cant push these negative thoughts away. I have  been having suicidal dreams lately. I need help but I'm really scared I don't know how to reach out I dont want to bother my family but outside of them I don't have anyone. I'm alone I feel scared and  anxious all the time I still try to complete my productivity goals  but I'm only able to complete one or two of them. I'm feeling so down. I get urges to hurt my self I always feel like I'm about to lose my mind I just cant think straight man. I just want some clarity and peace in my mind. I don't know what the fuck will happen to me I cant think positive these negative thoughts of failure will never go away.
I'm scared to leave the house and I can barely walk around the house for the last 8 months. Anyone else having this problem and if so any advice? I can't even go to the grocery store. Logically, I know the likelihood of something bad happening is low, but my body has shut down. I don't know if I'm dying or it's just my depression and anxiety. I just sit in a room most of the day.
I've been reading but not at a good pace. I'm on the do-nothingism chapter of Feeling Good, a CBT book about self help for depression.    I always feel like procrastinating and doing nothing so I'll just try to follow the worksheets.  I had a call today and the recruiter said "no worries" followed immediately by "that's actually a big problem" in reference to my resume gap. I feel like I don't deserve well paying work.
it's officially treatment-resistant severe depression now    why did i fucking read the medical notes again    it all just enforces the belief that i'm not gonna make it for that many months longer   next week i'm starting ECT    time to score all the negative side effects and still obsessively dream about killing myself     👉😎👉
Another year gone. Another year lived with depression and failure. More of the same to come, I suppose, in the new year.
I feel like I'll apply for uber eats and call center work since I'm not confident anyone will hire me for more demanding work.    And my parents want to give me money but I don't want to feel like I owe them.
I just want to give up but I also want to keep going....I just don't know how to keep going anymore and it scares me. I feel like I can't discuss certain things with professionals and I don't know what else to do about how I've been feeling. I just feel like the entire world and everything I felt was stable is crashing down around me every day and there's no way to stop it. I'm starting to go numb because of the stress anxiety and pressure to find a job that will keep me safe and that terrifies me. Any words of encouragement will help bc I feel so alone with this and I don't know what to do anymore, sometimes I just want to give up but that scares me more than anything. This is the last way I want to be feeling on New Years Eve but there you have it I guess so far that's just been how this year has been going for me. Im on antidepressants but with this level of terrifying depression and anxiety not even Sertraline 100 mg a day is reaching it. I just want to crawl under a rock and die.  Edit: I am a freelance writer btw and I have a lot to offer. I have the experience and the skills to prove myself- I just wish I had better connections.
I’m extra exhausted. I have headaches from a DPH addiction withdrawal. I’m so tired I can’t binge-purge and I get extremely guilty.   Lately I have had a really really hard time getting up. I mean, I wake up naturally but I literally have to fight to wake up. My entire body is numb, my limbs hurt, I have to communicate extra hard to get up and sometimes I cry because I’m so concerned I can’t move.   It feels like I had a heavy night of drinking or taking DPH/APM pills but I go to bed completely sober and it is impossible to get up in the morning. If I’m in my bed for more than 15 minutes I get really really tired. I was so tired on the way home I could barely function and yet I only was out for 3 hours. We were driving home and I had to stop for a (really long and slow) train. Felt like I took a two day power nap.   I feel like no matter what I do — exercise, healthy eating habits, caffeine, sleeping pills, just sleeping more, etc. I’m ALWAYS tired and I’m always more tired than before. I kind of thought it was COVID related, since sometimes all my food tastes like chemicals and I’ve had a dumb cough for like three months now. But I don’t have other symptoms yet. Considered diabetes because of food issues, blood issues, but I keep circling back to my long standing depression.   Idk. This year killed me. And I’ll be honest, I’m a little upset I’m seeing the new year, and thinking about working and going back to school is physically painful right now. I don’t understand why I’m so tired.
I fear the new year. I fear the unknown and fear never connecting properly again. I fear I will just be haunted by the hurt and the uncertainty for years and I will never be whole or comfortable again. I fear alot
You know what, opiates are the best thing that ever happened to me. Im the happiest I've been in a long time. Thanks America.
I really hate the stretch between Christmas and New year's Eve. I don't live in a christian household, so we don't celebrate Christmas, but all my friends (like 3 or 3 people) do resulting in me being lonelier than usual. But I thought that I can push through it this year, by just being productive given that I have my finals at the end of January. I started going to bed at around 9/10 pm and woke up at 7 am a couple of days in a row and really got going for a bit, but since last Wednesday I just crashed man... I suddenly got so tired out of nowhere, couldn't get out of bed anymore before afternoon and I can't concentrate for shit no matter what I do. Only thing I can do is feel lonely and depressed... fml
Lost my Apple Pencil, I know it’s stupid but I cried. Happy fucking new year to me
I'm falling into bad habits again. A new game update is causing me to stay up late. Yesterday I couldn't sleep but it was still unproductive. I'll fill in a sheet and go to bed.
Just checking in because fuck it why not. Decided to drink because fuck it it's Friday why not it's not like I have anything to do tomorrow. Or later today now that its 0245 am. Got a beautiful wife in the bed asleep alone, so I might as well drink and watch YT early in the morning then go to bed and sleep till noon. It's a new fucking year and big fucking whoop. I've been off since Thanksgiving because I had so much use or lose leave built up and what did I do with my time? Jack fucking shit cuz I'm an old loser. So now my vacation is gone and I've got 2 fucking days left before "going back to work" on the computer in the dining room because I've been working from home since the pandemic started rampijng up. I'm such a goddamn loser. Should just hang myself or blow my head off or jump off a damn bridge or buy some helium weather balloons and fly high till I die. Fuck me.
I just got diagnosed with depression a few weeks ago. I've been on antidepressants and just recently started sleeping pills. I haven't done schoolwork in two weeks and I've been busy with college applications. Haven't really had anyone to tell this stuff to aside from my journal and my psychiatrist. I'm hanging in there.
I'm starting wellbutrin next week and so stoked to get the hell off of lexapro 😮‍💨  i think lexapro is an incredible drug for anxiety, but not MDD.  fingers crossed. i need a new hope; I need some stability.
I keep promising the next day will be different. But it isn't. So about time to reflect on my cbt worksheets and make that same promise.    I tried scheduling a block to work with someone on focusmate but they didn't show. I'll try again tomorrow. It's normal not to show. I don't all the time.    I am setting up blockers too.    I felt bad applying for work since the roles needed more experience than I had. So I started practicing coding on codeacademy. But I was slow since I haven't done python in a while. It's normal to not have the experience needed for the majority of jobs and also normal to be slow when relearning.
I have no idea what happened last night. I have no idea how to even explain it. I may have alienated a lot of friends as well. I have accepted that I need professional help, but also realize I can't afford it right now (especially if medication is involved). I don't know what to do or how to do it at this point... At least I am now being open about myself and my situation.
i wish i had someone to share with about how bad i feel. i’ve been suffering so much the past months and no one ever takes the time to listen. I have so much pain. Everyday I feel worse and worse. I can barely help my mom with bills, my dad died, I ruined my relationship, I’m constantly so tired and mentally drained... I’m so tired, I want a hug, I need money, I hate my job. I went to school got my degree and I’m still so broke. I can’t succeed in life because I’m so tired. I’m mediocre and I want to disappear but I have to help my family. I don’t know how to muster up more strength, I feel like I used it all. I just cry and cry.
I feel fucking insane. I want to die. I self-harmed because everything is too overwhelming. I can't take this. I'm awful. Everything is awful. I can't do this. It won't get better. Please let me die.
So much anger, about (possibly trivial) things that happened in the very distant past. Feelings just don't die.
Rejection sensitive dysphoria meets learned helplessness and hopelessness on welfare. Thought in 2021 I can put the forced job searching behind me because I should be on permanent disability. But I don’t trust the system.
I hardly sleep, I'm rarely hungry anymore, the negative thoughts are creeping in, I don't want to go into work anymore. Seasonal depression is hitting me hard.
I know. I’m probably in love with who he used to be, who I remember him to be. And even though common sense says I should let go and forget him, I keep thinking he’s someone special. I want(ed) him to be someone special.
I don't know how to describe it.   I've never been diagnosed with depression but I think I've had it all my life.   It drives every action and clouds every judgement.    When I have a success my brain replays my greatest failures.   I fear waking up every morning cause something bad might have happened.   Lots of thoughts I have that plague me where I can't fully enjoy anything.  &#x200B;  Something has changed.   What was negative thoughts have been replaced by nothingness.   Bad news doesn't send me down further, good news doesn't elevate me.    Like the peaks and valleys have been cut off.    That ability to recover just seems.... gone.    No food excites me, I can only bear to bring myself to watch at most 3/4 of a tv show or movie before I bail.   Music I used to like does nothing.   I'm not suicidal cause I have commitments I would never ever bail on.   I really can't frame who I am right now, but I know it is not good.
I don’t see myself going back to work. I’ve deleted all my social media except for reddit & twitter. I just wanna stray away from everyone. I feel so unloveable, and I feel like I’m too much. I just wanna lay in bed but I know it’s not healthy for me, my thoughts can’t stop consuming my head
hi everyone, i just got rejected for the first time. havent been here in a while because i wasnt doing too bad but its gna be rough for a bit now.   we started talking about a month ago, some may say thats too fast but my emotions just come quickly like that and i cant help it. there were all these little things he said and did for me, i couldnt help but think we couldve been together but something happened today which lead to me asking him how he felt.   he told me he was never interested in me that way. its hard because i cant even hate him, but why did he have to message me and shake my life up? i was doing just fine. ive forgotten how many times i cried today, i think it was about 11. i feel that this is karma, ive rejected a lot of people and some of them i didnt treat completely like a friend.   i feel emotionally unavailable yet wish someone loved me, its gonna take a while to get over this despite how shortlived it was. i already miss him
Most days are better than others. On my bad days, I just want to curl up in a corner and stop existing. If I never existed, then I wouldn't have to worry about disappointing or hurting those who have known me on my good days. Today is going to be rough.
I used a text messaging hotline today. I feel so lost and afraid of the future. This pandemic is making job hunting such a pain in the ass. I still want to live. I hope I live long enough to land a full time job.
no one ever listens to me. i want her to hurt like she hurt me. no one listens no one listens i wanna die i wanne kill myself you wont miss me you never knew me
Today absolutely kicked my ass. I woke up exhausted after getting a full night's rest. During my drive to work, existing felt wrong. Like I had somehow woke up in the wrong dimension. I felt out of place. Like I didn't belong. How could I not belong in my own vehicle? Driving down the road in which I live? Then I felt the weight, it was as if the weight of the world was slowly settling onto my shoulders, as if Atlas himself had tenderly placed it on my shoulders. My legs are getting weak..
After weeks of trying to work up the courage to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist, I get denied by one and sent to voicemail by the other. I had a break down shortly after.   Yesterday I took cbd gummies hoping it'd help my anxiety, it ended up giving me a horrible panic attack. I took off work today and somehow I don't think it made much of a difference, I still feel really awful. I feel like I'm losing it.
On paper my life is a million times better than it was growing up. I have a lot of potential and I’m looking forward to a few things in the future. But still feel incapable of being happy. Even though I’m empty I will continue to try my best
Tfw you get scolded for something you forgot to do and your mind and mood decides to spiral downwards  Great fun
At least crypto is going up. I need to sell now before it crashes again. My depression continued partly because of the last crash.    I worked on some programming questions today for fun. But didn't apply for enough work. Tomorrow! Tomorrow for sure. A recruiter said he'd get me an interview but I didn't reply quickly enough.  Also I'm sleeping late again. Hope I can deal with it tomorrow.
Today I just broke down and cried for no reason. I think it's the depression building up over the past few months because of the pandemic finally catching up.... It wasn't this bad before, I'm a bit baffled by myself. I remember being happy, actually glad, at start of the pandemic to have some time to spend on myself, an excuse to escape all external social obligations, a way to nap during work day..... I was also super busy the first few months which probably helped to keep my sanity (though hell in it's own right)..... But starting September, there was a sense of ennui, then November, December comes and the hopelessness and desperation really sets in.... It's surprising because I'm actually forcing myself to live healthily these days, but somehow getting more depressed than ever. It's as if there's nothing to look forward to, not motivated to get out of bed and "do" stuff..... Everything seems pointless. Whereas before, picking up a new hobby or learning something seems like a productive way to "take advantage" of pandemic quarantine, now just seems pointless. I don't even feel like doing it.....even with a meaningful and pressing goal. Maybe a good night's sleep will fix this.....I certainly don't want to spend another wasted year in 2021......
I think I’m giving up. I’m failing school this year and I don’t think I’ll be able to catch up with school works any time soon. Even though doing well at school was the only thing I had in me. I was always around the top of my class but now I’m just falling apart. I’m giving everything up. Now it’s just me, someone who has nothing in his life. All my future and everything. I see nothing but me putting an end to my life
I've been trying hard over the last several months to improve, but I have been hyper depressed this last week. I realize that none of my family loves or even likes me, not even my own mother. My future looks bleak, I am alone. I wish to die in my sleep, I wish I was not so cowardly that I could take my own life.

Since she reject me 2 days ago, i felt so broken. even if i said to her “it’s ok”, it’s just a disguise that i actually don’t wanna make her look bad. this leads to a frustration that clinging to me since long ago. i already have a job but i couldn’t focus on it since i’ve been lost interest few months back. i have friends but all they did was “man up, move on” thing. they couldn’t understand that i just wanted to he heard.
I keep trying to write cover letters for jobs I’m not qualified for”because that’s how the tech industry works”, but realizing how undesirable I am to companies is also probably why I’m so undesirable to partners. I guess I’m just proud I made it to lunchtime before giving up today. Hopefully this stimulus check comes in and gives me more time, because I haven’t sent in an application in almost three weeks now.
Have had a constant migraine for 2 years, spend every weekend alone..there is absolutely no point in my life what so ever. Hate struggling from day to day, live with my unhappy family.. can't afford to move out and will be on disability for the rest of my life..
I need to sleep. Nothing else. Just sleep. I didn't apply or sell crypto again.  I had an interview. it didn't go well. But it's fine. I just needed to refresh my memory.
kinda want to see if i can go back on my old meds from the start of last year. i remember being so unsatisfied with how emotionally repressed they made me and i remember wishing so badly that i'd just be able to cry for once or that i'd feel genuine joy or sadness or some kind of strong feeling. but i don't think i ever really realized how fucking horrible it is feeling this emotionally intense all the time. i miss not getting angry at trivial things, i miss not getting so upset that it makes me feel physically sick, i miss just feeling like a regular fucking person. i miss being able to zone out completely and not let every little thing that happens to me destroy me mentally. i miss not having the random urge to lock myself in my room and stop talking to everybody i know. no amount of passion that i'm experiencing again is worth the lows i'm also experiencing again. i just want to go back
I can never forgive myself for my mistakes.
I was considered such high risk at the clinic that they waived the waiting period for getting a therapist. I have my first appointment on Wednesday and I'm terrified.  I dont know how to talk about any of whats going on in my head. It doesn't feel real, and I feel like im losing my mind. I'm worried that I won't be able to express myself properly   I know that I won't survive If I dont get help, but I'm so so scared to start
not really a depression post. just tired i guess. still. just feel bad because im a virgin. im so horny recently as well. masterbate like 2-3 times a day. also still need to find a job. i went on a date with a girl the other day though so that was ok. she doesnt appeal to me that much though. idk she just seems pretty boring. and she arrives late to the date. just ruins the mood. she is attractive though. idk she is also that type of person who only hangs out with people of her own race (shes indian). idk id like a casual relationship with her. nothing crazy, but i feel she wont go for that. ill just see how the second date goes. maybe go into it with more energy.
now im scared to go outside. Need to avoid high caffeine content like the plague;kicks negative thoughts into overdrive.
I'm very unwell today
i’m sleeping all day instead of finishing work that i’m nearly 5 days behind in. I feel helpless and I don’t want to disappoint those around me but i’m not sure how to adapt to everyone’s high standards. I’ve been able to repress a lot of my emotions recently but that means all of my emotions shut off and I feel nothing, but it’s better than crying and having my parents tell me to shut up.
Either I’m feeling depressed or it’s just too hot.  Feeling very ‘meh’ today.
I'm just tired and overwhelmed. Pre quarantine I managed to keep up with school work and deal ok with my emotions, tho after quarantine I just kinda fell apart. I think the stress on me from in person school kept me "together", atleast kept me distracted and masked my problems.  It feels like I'm running on a non stop treadmill that is too fast and I'm falling behind, letting people down in the process. I keep a positive sort of mask with everyone so they don't worry about me, and keep to myself. I also manage to lie to myself that I'm a-ok.  I'm just stuck in a unmotivated, exhausted cycle, with constant stress, and swirling thoughts weighing on me. I feel numb/extremely overwhelmed at the same time.  I just want to be able to wake up, and not feel heavy or irrationally stressed. Yeah, a feeling dump/vent...
I felt so tired and exhausted today idk why I couldn't do anything. Didn't even sleep. Well I will try to get some sleep and start doing the stuff I was supposed to do at day..and hopefully actually do it instead of procrastinating. I feel so weak why am I like this ?
I try not to care about my being a failure. But then some random event happens and I am reminded of it. And it feels like a dagger through the heart.
Sigh. Here’s my weekly check in. Forever in limbo between being over my ex and questioning why it didn’t work out.  At this point, I wonder if I’m mentally making his person / character better than in real life. The last time that I had to move on from someone, I met him and straight up told him I wasn’t ready for a relationship.  This time, I really have no motivation to date again. I did recently finish my degree program (this year) so a bit of a happy accomplishment for me, but it also means that I’ve lost part of what kept me busy. Sigh. I’m taking things slow because I can’t move any faster than this right now.
My family had a fight tonight and a thought occurred. Is that all there is to look forward to? Just repetition of labour, monotony, and fighting?
LMFAO SOME WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT THREATENED TO SHOOT ME AND HARRASSED ME TWO HOURS AGO BEFORE I CLOSED THE STATION, AND THEN HE CAME BACK TWO HOURS LATER TO DO IT AGAIN  I CALLED FOR HELP, ONLY FOR THE ASSISTANT TO BLAME ME AND PLAY SMARTASS WITH ME AT 3 AM  I'M SO FUCKING LIVID AND FILLED WITH HATE, PEOPLE HERE ARE TRASH, AND PEOPLE IN GENERAL ARE TRASH  HATE HATE _**HATE**_  EDIT: TFW YOU FORGET TO WRITE DOWN VITAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION  TFW PEOPLE'S PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT YOU BEHIND YOUR BACK AND CALLING YOU STUPID AND A PAIN  I WANT TO GO HOME AND DROWN IN MY BATHTUB, I HATE EVERYTHING AND MYSELF
Had an interview for a job I really wanted a couple weeks ago and it was honestly the best interview I ever had. Got the call today that I didn’t get it. I just wish I could get one fucking break god damnit man
Started a new job last week because my mom is the boss and got me hired on and its been stressful as hell and very taxing on me just trying to prove to the people there that I'm not just there just because my mom is the boss and that I can actually do the job. When I get home from work after working 10 hours a day nobody ever takes the time to ask if I'm ok or how was work and the stress of it all is only making things worse but at least when I get home I can see my dog after everything is all said and done and that's what is keeping me going.
First check-in. The last year has been rough and I’ve constantly battled with my self worth and my “direction.” Ended up basically losing a job right at the start of COVID and attempted to break into a new industry a few months ago. Between the anxiety of not having work and battling feeling trapped inside in an unfavorable living situation, I’ve somehow depleted all of my self worth. I’d really just love to land a job and feel some sense of stability in my life but the constant rejection has made it harder and harder to keep pushing forward. I also feel incredibly guilty because I have a great SO who encourages my little successes throughout the day but it’s just so exhausting to keep trying to do literally anything.
I just wanted one time where I didn’t have to compare myself.
Schools has been closed where I live. This is what sent me in to depression in the spring attempting to watch little kids and work a demanding job. I had to leave my career where I was making a great salary as a partner and was finally over my depression and starting a new business and now one of my kids has been home for a month and I feel myself sinking again. Today was just a series of rolling anxiety attacks all day long. I feel like this is the one place I can complain and dump my thoughts without feeling like I am just this total negative Nancy on my family complaining when everyone is going through some shit right now.
I'm in a tough situation right now in terms of my living situation with my housemates, and realizing some things about how my family members have treated me and still do to an extent, and also that my therapist is very passive and hasn't helped me in the ways I need. I'm realizing all at once that I've put my faith in some people whose actions don't seem to add up to their words. Luckily my boyfriend is great and so supportive, and I've been doing my best to take care of myself and reach out to a few friends. It's still stressful, though. I'm having a hard time not being critical of myself for everything I do, even though I'm trying to do the right things.
I feel like I can't go on. I get mad and upset over such small, trivial things, I just trashed my room because I didn't like the new phone I got, which I only bought because the first phone I ordered was taking too long to come, and now I don't even want it anymore and am going to send it back, but then I'll have to buy another new phone. I know it sounds silly but I feel bad spending so much money on phones when my family is struggling so much right now with my dad being retired and my mom's medical bills. There's also the issue of social anxiety I have to face now as well because I have to visit the store that I was just at the other day to get a new phone. Seems kind of embarassing. I don't even know what I'm writing. I realize how stupid the things I get angry are but I just can't control it. Everything feels out of my control. I can't have one good thing happen to me, like getting a good phone. I hurt myself, I smash the walls and slam doors and feel like my head is going to explode and like I want to kill myself. I'm so overdramatic. I wish I would just drop dead. The world doesn't need scum like me. I'm just a waste of space. Complaining about a phone when so many go hungry each day. Maybe if I die it means more happiness for others, I know I would certainly be happy. I just feel bad. These thoughts and feelings are so stupid and I have no one to share them with. Writing it out used to help but not anymore. I just keep casting my voice into the void hoping the universe will have mercy on me but it never does. I'm going to feel bad all day and there's nothing I can do about it.
The longer I keep going, the more scared and challenged I get. Comfort is becoming too ephemeral.
I’m so fucking screwed. I had a 8 am class during a production meeting. I’m scared of losing my job of being a sound designer for my play. I’m so fucking screwed and scared. I’m a damn loser if only I checked my email. I dont know what to do but I do want to kill myself
I wake up everyday extremely tired. Today is no different. I actually feel slightly better than I usually do and want to go out and do things but I still don't think I can handle it. I feel really sensitive to sights and sounds and my head hurts. I am not ill but this just seems to be part of the package of these physical crappy feelings I've been having with depression.
My mental health is all over the fucking place this week
Finnaly started coming to classes, but hey the semester is over veeeery soon so im not sure it matters. I just feel so irritated, maybe im angry. Its this weird nagging feeling I have in my head. It hurts vaguely, it feels somewhat like a scar. Like an artifical feeling in my head. Does anyone else get this?
I’ve been diagnosed with explosive mood disorder or IED disorder trynna process my diagnosis which literally sucks
I'm an asshole. Wish there was a better word for it that wasn't an orifice. In any event, that's what I am.
I'm feeling terrible today. Thinking about give up everything. Feeling alone, empty. Feeling nobody cares truly - people only care what I can provide to them emotionally or financially.  I'm feeling hopeless about pandemics as well. So much suffering. So much pain, anxiety. Uncertainty.  I wish I had someone who was able to look me in the eyes, and empathize. But I don't.
I freaked yesterday for nothing. It was ok. He told me to like have more confidence. I must
i am unbelievably hollow i wish i could tell one of my friends everything that is going on in my brain but im just too afraid. why did i have to be depressed this fucking blows
This is probably the worst time of my life.  I don’t know what to do. I don’t talk to anyone about it. I hide it. I keep it hidden. And day by day I feel worse.  Though I want help I can’t seem to bring myself to Ask for it. Since March of last year things seem to have continued to get steadily worse.  Just when I thought maybe I could break free from the sadness a few months ago things went back to getting increasingly worse and all hope I had of feeling better as time moves forward is pretty much gone.  I have many siblings and parents so although suicide is something I’ve contemplated at varying levels of legitimate consideration (more so during the summer) I view that as the ultimate act of selfishness and would not want my family to experience permanent grief and sadness on my account. I don’t know where I’m even going with this i just can’t seem to catch a break and the people that I care the very most about ln life aren’t even a part of my life much anymore if not at all.  Reddit has done a lot for me since 2012.  So I guess that’s why I’m here right now talking. I don’t know where else to say this.
Today's my birthday, and at 21 years of age I once again realized how truly lonely I am. What do you do when that close circle of friends that you enter your birthday with does not even remember it ? None of your friends bother to call you, everybody you have around you just needs you for something school-related. Except that, noone gives a flying fuck about who you are. I am so fucking tired of going through the world all by myself for crying outloud.
I keep slipping up on self-harm and it’s not..working(?) anymore. There’s just nothing. I can feel myself pulling away from everyone and trying to push my partner away because I’m just so tired. I just don’t know what good it’ll do to say how tired and done I feel.
I wish I could resist comparing myself to others. Yesterday when I had to go to another business to help set up for an event, I looked around at all the people there who are around my age and felt like a total slob troll. Their hair was all sleek and shiny, skin clear and glowing, clothes pressed and tailored. My hair is wirey and dull, skin pimpley and oily, clothes wrinkled and shabby. They all looked to have lives that were put together talking about what married life is like and how their babies took their first steps. The differences between me and them are wide.  Then it came time to make their presentations and they were joined by their bosses. While I was putting mics on them they started talking about the challenges they’re facing in their businesses. One of the challenges being how they’re having a hard time finding good employees anymore. Then it devolved into them wondering what’s wrong with my generation and saying things like we just want to stay home and not work and leech off our parents or the government. This touched a nerve in me because I still live with my parents, though I wish that wasn’t the case, and only work part time because I’m trying to deal with my mental health issues. So if I told them about my situation they would include me as being one of those slackers they were just talking about. Like, thanks I was already feeling shitty just being there. I just wanted to leave so badly at that point but I had to stick it out and pretend to be a happy little assistant. I hate my existence.
I've always wondered why I've often felt so alone and unloved. Especially because it does seem like there are people who love me. But then it hit me the other day, it's because their love is conditional. There are things I can do, ways I can slip up, and then they're allowed to bring on the pain. The "tough-love" so to speak. Not really love but hatred and disgust. Temporary contempt, but still hatred of me all the same. I have no one in the world that I can feel comfortable turning too, knowing that they won't ever hurt me no matter what.
I just wanted to find a place to post.   For everyone who lives with or has a spouse who isn’t depressed. We’re sorry we can’t help more.   Had a bad day with my spouse. They said something along the lines of I’m so bored and I offhandedly said well we gotta find you a new hobby or get a new book.   To me and those without depression this was a nothing statement, to them it was me being condescendingly dismissive.   This isn’t some post to suck up, those of us who don’t have depression won’t understand. But today was a day where that sense of defeat letting someone you love down just crushed me.   I’ll never know how rough it is, but I wanted to just say hang in there and those who love you really so love you and support you even if they can’t find words to say it or don’t know how.
Feeling so overwhelmed and stupid during my undergrad research program. I’m legit stupid-stupid, not imposter-syndrome-stupid and everyone around me is so smart and accomplished. Only reason I got accepted was because no one applied and I got a B for a related module.   There’s 12 weeks left of this pain, I hope I can push through. This is my toughest semester yet and the next 3 will be so much better. Idk I feel like that’s the only thing pushing me through school......
I decided to stop seeing my therapist, and told him. Just feeling kind of bummed that our sessions haven't been helping for a while and in retrospect a lot of his advice was unhelpful. Hopefully I can find a better therapist to see...
I feel better than I did three weeks ago. Three weeks ago, after Christmas, I felt genuinely sick. I was crying every day for five days, no appetite, very low sex drive, and I was eating oranges and vodka all the time. I just rode it out.  This isn’t coping. Simply waiting the storm out won’t help when the next one inevitably comes to pass.
I came across an article "signs of emotional exhaustion" and I ticked off most of those. I'm just so tired...
No energy just want the pain to stop
All of the sudden, I feel like I want to disconnect myself from society. It’s hard to face people everyday. I want to feel small, be small. I shouldn’t be feeling this way, I have a perfectly healthy relationship, family, stable job. But I’m confused as to why I feel so empty and my bad thoughts are coming back to me. I haven’t had these thoughts this intense for several years now. I wanna be happy but I dunno how yet
I have just been feeling exhausted. College is opening and I am so too scared to go. The socialising aspect is terrifying. Added with the prospect of jobs and grades have depleted my energy.  I wish I didn't feel like this. I wish I wasnt me.
the truth is I'm just not cut out for life. I'm not strong enough. I'm weak and pathetic and incompetent and nothing I do is good enough. please god let me die in my sleep tonight.
I really want kids, but I know I’d just fuck them up like I am.   There’s nothing for me, nothing in the world that gives me joy. Ya Allah, just take me out now
Honestly no, fuck 2020, fuck new year.  I'm so fucked in collosal ways in 2020,why should 2021 be any different? Fuck 2021 already. I don't have any hope, I hate everything, I hate myself, and I want to just die.   If there's any resolution for 2021, it will be telling the people around me to go fuck themselves.
My friends have moved on and left me behind. My gf doesn't want to have sex anymore. Our relationship feels pointless and bland. I need to do amazing on my college applications to stay in the country, I'm already late and kinda doomed. I also need to find employment so that I can eat. I feel so low that it's physically painful. My stomach hurts, my head hurts. I'm tired of this shit. I deserve a better life. I worked for it. I just want to start fresh.
I can't sleep but I just wanna sleep forever. Also people who don't know you at all have a lot of fucking gall just deciding to suggest that you aren't a shitty person when you, who knows yourself better than anyone, knows for a fact that you are indeed a shitty fucking person. Like fuck this you aren't helping anyone your just patting yourself on the fucking back.
Nothing is fucking working. I can't be fucking fixed. I'm just unfixable. I'm fucked. I dared to be born in this world and I'm fucked.
I don't even know what to say anymore. It just sucks not having someone to talk to. Not even about my problems and depression but just like... Someone to talk about shit. Just for awhile talking about things. I used to have my sister for that but then she moved out of the house again and she was probably the only person I could talk with for hours and not get bored. I prob could with my therapist tbh but it's only an hour at a time and every other week. I'm just so tired of having no one.   And I've already become so isolated and weird that I just don't think I can make friends anymore. Not like I was ever good at that in the first place. When you grew up in a small town school you eventually get to the point where you don't even have to make NEW friends anymore because you'll get introduced to someone you didn't know by someone you already know. And you're safer in that environment because there's always someone who will go to bat for you because they've known you since you were 5. Not in the real world where you're at the mercy of strangers. People who will judge you on every little detail. Who will tear into you for being different or going against the status quo.   And conversely internet relationships never impact me. Don't get me wrong I appreciate my online anonymity, but the downside is that it's impersonal. Nobody is aloud to be genuine and have genuine thoughts and feelings without a hefty coating of "irony" to sweeten the deal. Nothing feels real everything is just strings of text sitting in a void. I try to pretend that there are people present in the moment but what are these lines of text if not imprints typed out by people who are no longer present sent away onto a server god knows where. And nobody listens. Nobody who actually cares. Or people who act like they care but if they got the chance to know me they would think me a freak or hate me or a combination. Or more likely people who only care in the moment because they want something out of me.
still depressed as fuck but for the first time in forever I'm motivated to get out of my comfort zone.  Or at least try. I also cried more than usual which is good because I seldom am able to. I'm going to try!
Work’s been hard and unsatisfying, family’s not good, and I just failed my driving test today.  I want to throw myself against a car and just end everything.
I just cant do anything
Ramones: “I wanna be sedated”  Me: I wanna be se-FUCKING SHOT IN THE HEAD POINT BLANK WITH A SHOTGUN
Well it would have been yesterday now that my brother would be celebrating his 31st birthday surrounded by friends, instead he’s gone and instead I’m alone here in bed drunk thinking of what could have been. I’m not strong enough for this, maybe I’ll be ok when I wake up but I don’t know. Life is stupid.
Sent back an email cursing out the financial aid office because they were taking too long to respond to my emails, and each time they did, they did not give me the information I sought. Hmm. Hope that doesn't affect my chances... :/ lol
im becoming actually braindead... once again can't get anything out of my head i just feel terrible l ol :(
Some rough days. After a long time I believe I found the main source of my pain. All my traumatic memories are coming back like a hurricane. I just cry out of no where when it comes to me. Trying to rationalize everything, but It’s too much.
For the first time in a while I was actually feeling good. I had met up with someone with the expectations we’d just be friends but it went so much further than that. We had some really intimate moments and for the first time since my last relationship I felt like I finally met someone who I could form a deep connection with. The best part was they seemed really into me and were the one who made all the moves.   That was two days ago and today they message me saying they still need time to heal from their last relationship and just want to be friends. They apologized for giving me mixed signals. I totally respect that they still need time to heal, I’ve had to say the same thing to people myself before.   But fuck. I really thought I found something amazing. And now it’s gone. I went from being on cloud nine to being back completely in the gutter. The heartbreak from dating just feels like too much at times. Like it’s not worth it. I don’t know why I keep putting myself out there.

Still in my same career, programming type stuff, still wondering for ways to get out, still have no other interests. Tried drawing on and off for a few years but never really felt it. Made a YouTube channel to make whatever ideas I had and I did have a few fun ideas but it sort of petered out. Just wrote a short story which I did enjoy but now that it's done I'm just stuck again. I don't know what to do with my life. I hate everything
I’m frustratingly depressed right now and I hate everything
Each day is getting harder. I feel so weak I cant do this anymore wish I could just leave everything and die.
I feel so sad today all of a sudden. I am not sure why.  I had 2 quarrels with family today and yesterday. Small ones. Usually they wouldn’t bother me so much. I’m still not sure those are why I’m sad now. Or was it because I’m in this state that those quarrels happened in the first place.  I am a mess. I’ve been crying so much for hours and I don’t know if it’s getting better. I have no one to talk to, and all I can think of is “help me.”
I had to force myself to get out of the car in my garage. My brain keeps telling me to just kill myself, that I’m worthless and unloveable. I’m so scared, I need a hug but I don’t have any family or friends near by. Nobody outside of this group know I’m suffering with depression and suicidal thoughts, I refuse to be a burden. Did anyone ever watch Buffy? The truest thing I’ve ever heard “the hardest thing in this world is to live.”
I feel like self-harm is such a teenage thing to do, and yet, I've been slipping up recently for the first time since I WAS a teenager. All I can think once I'm cut and bleeding is that I want to do it again, deeper, bigger than last time. It makes me feel better for a few days before the overwhelming self-despising urge comes back again. I deserve the pain, the scars - I deserve more than that. But I feel nothing but shame for doing something that society says I should have grown out of... But it takes away the strong suicidal urge for a few days.

I feel so depressed and sad today.  I have had this condition for quite some time.  I’ve been taught some coping skills but none of those seem to work. I feel like I am at rock bottom.
winter is coming in and i’m starting to fall back into my depression. i’ve been cheated on for a year and only know a handful of the times. i feel like i am beautiful and have my life together. i have land and a 2 stall garage and small trailer owned at 20. I have my own money. i’m nice, funny, i feel like i am almost everything i have everything and i’m just not enough or something? it really hurts.  i feel as though working is such a waste of life and that’s just unfair of me to think anyways so that makes me feel selfish. i have no friends because i’m scared they’re going to try to take my boyfriend or just be mean like girls are sometimes. or mostly they already have their own friends and i don’t know where to meet anyone new that’s like me. my mom has bipolar disorder that she raised me with and i think it’s starting to effect me and i’m hoping i’m not too far gone at this point. my car just recently died at 140,000 miles and i’m just so depressed about everything. everything is too much. i have so much to take care of and at the same time i’m lucky for what i do have at this age and it makes me feel selfish to be depressed. i just want a boyfriend that won’t cheat on me that i vibe with and i push away the ones that would give me the world. i don’t know what’s wrong with me. i have a lot but i’m so sad. i’m starting to lose motivation again and i want to sleep forever. this maybe helped. thanks for reading and i hope everything that is going on with you in life gets better, seriously.
I found out the ending of Bird Alone game and I feel devastated. Cried all day. It felt good to cry again but it felt so painful. Maybe the game ending triggered a trauma that has always been hiding all these years.
When I’m bitter and angry, I lose all self-awareness and control and go off on people. It’s not healthy and it’s not good behavior whatsoever.   I’m getting better at taming myself but I still need to go to therapy to resolve underlying issues I have within myself.
Even though I am depressed most of the time, I do ocasionally find that thing that makes me feel happy and peaceful in my life.  I rarely record good things in my diary, since they'll most likely just get crushed by a feeling of hopelessness later, but today I did write something pleasant with conviction.
Why is everything so hard  for me? When I try to study I just cant concentrate
set myself up for disappointment. again. tired of being a joke to everyone. tired of living.
I seem to have no dopamine. I have no motivation left. I'm stuck lying on my back all day. The thought of doing anything is giving me huge anxiety and panic.  I can't live like this but can't change either. It's like lying here is the only thing keeping me sane.
All my stress turned into a depressive episode lol  Still feel stressed out. I don’t really feel so good.
Been self medicating for the past month with melatonin to combat night time intrusive thoughts and anxious episodes. Turns out I’ve built a tolerance to it, and high doses are paradoxically counterproductive and can cause you to feel more awake. So now I’m left slightly nauseous, at 2am, having to actually face my issues. I wish I could sleep and pretend they didn’t exist.
I feel like my brain is on fire. So much self hatred. Why can’t my mind settle? Just constantly tearing myself a part. It’s so exhausting. I’ve been filling my days with nothing and having a hard time being productive.
This morning I woke up at 5:20 and got up at 5:40 plus got ready to go to tafe at 8:00. I will be late but the depression simply hit so hard today so hopefully I get accepted into class if I am not too late. If I am too late to enter class it is not the end of world, and I will just take the day off. As I do need it, for on Wednesday night I just cried the entire night. Only got 5 hours sleep or less. So doing much better since then.  Edit Despite bing late and not having my buttons or proper neckerchief - doing cert 4 in patisserie at tafe - the chef found me buttons and a proper neckerchief and allowed me in. He is very understanding. He is the only chef that I know who is not too passive aggressive nor yells at us for how slow/incompetent we are l that I have had.
I’m done. No one in my family believes in me anymore
Celebrated my bday (33) for the first time in over 10 years with a small group of family. I said maybe 10 words the whole time cause depression. I know it’s not my fault but I still feel bad about it. My mind just goes blank, like I’m a zombie.  I’m extremely envious of my younger brother- he doesn’t even have a concept of what depression is. He thinks I spend all my time alone cause I’m just a jerk with a bad attitude  Anyways, gonna hit up WinCo for dinner soon, hope everyone here has a good evening 🥪🥨🍕🥗🌙
Finally bought new running shoes, ran a couple miles, they seem to fit well enough. So I guess that like hour-long session of indecisive shopping in the local shop was worth it, though I felt awkward taking so long that like 6 customers came and bought something in the time it took me to finish and get mine.
I used to message my ex when I’d wake up in the middle of the night to nightmares. Obviously that’s not an option anymore so I’m going to post here instead. I’m still reeling from the fucked up images my brain decided to conjure up and force me to watch. I have an 8 hour shift on ITU today but I genuinely think I’m far too traumatized from this to go in and actually do anything of value.   Brain - what the fuck?
I’m really truly alone. No one ever contacts me first. I have to contact them first. And talk about their problems. About their life. And I provide them of my empathy. Then they would move on. Leaving me alone again. Because what I am is just a service that had come to them voluntarily. Free service at that. I should’ve never reach out. I should’ve never ask them how they were doing. But I do. It’s like a curse. I would ask them of how they are doing and they would pour themselves out for me. But no one does that for me. I’m totally alone.
Can you believe, self. Seeing what you see. That I had some sort of ambitions. Hopes. Confidence. What has used to be. But not anymore.
It’s 8:23 in the evening where I live. I’m four shots of vodka deep. Watching enola holmes. My sights are swimming. My brains swishing. I almost want to hang myself and be done with all of it.
I wish that all the parts of me that make me me would die so I could be lost in blissful ignorance.
It’s so easy to get distracted and forget you’re even depressed until it hits you like a fucking train. Why did the drugs just stop working? Cutting is like the only thing I want to do now, but I don’t have the house to myself until after the weekend. I wish it was Monday so I had the freedom to be myself. Alone with my dark thoughts and able to express my pain.  Reflecting on my life it’s all so amazing, but I don’t believe I should be here. I can’t feel the love everyone says they have for me, but I can feel even the slightest hint of disappointment and frustration. Is the love a mask over the exasperation that I’m such a burden?
he make me depressed
What happened to me
Tomorrow I'll drive to the city to buy groceries. Parents aren't at home, they're on holidays. Hey maybe I use the opportunity and drive by the city hospital which also has a psych ward? Perhaps going in and seeing how far I can go while being completely out of my mind and not really knowing why I do this at all? Like that time I already did this once?  Just some fun activities while you spent years running away from mental hospitals and therapists while having suicidal thoughts.
I'm sad. I'm useless. I'm a lump. Even though I know differently this is how I feel. How long will I feel like this....
Having serious suicidal thoughts for the first time in a few months. Trying to keep busy, productive and achieving something but all i think i've done is fry my nerves and burn myself out.

As grateful as I am for the opportunity to get good therapy, it's so expensive. A month of weekly therapy is close to double my share of the rent for my apartment... it's so frustrating to know all the long days I've worked and savings I've made are being thrown at a malfunctioning brain that barely deserves it.
I feel miserable and scattered and dissociated.
I’m alone. I’ve never been so alone and isolated. I only have my family. I’ve been an outcast because my true self is either too much for everyone else or too “different”. When I try and leave that behind to be more like everyone else, I feel dead inside. There’s too much back and forth, that when I finally get comfortable with a friend, I’m more of my true self and ultimately they leave. Then I get mad at myself for being so weird. I can’t keep going on like this.
I feel pretty crap most of the time but like a couple months ago me and an exfriend fell out ... he did something extremely in appropriate... claimed im being over reactive about it. Im not. My feelings matter. So i cut him off.. tried to fix it but he was steady about what he did being nothing. Its pretty bad what he did... but sadly no one seems to want to do anything about him being around. Reason why im upset about it is another friend in the group was being bothered inappropriately by another friend in the same group and he got kicked never to return. Another friend kicked someone from the group for being a dick to them. And when it comes to me i feel no care/loyalty but im expected to care about them and their feelings/wants but i should 'suck it up' and continue to exist around them when someone makes me uncomfortable because they pass judgement and deemed my thing to be less. I feel like just leaving.. i need to find a new online home.
I’ve gained weight due to stress and depression lately, the heaviest I’ve been in my life. It’s made me so unhappy because I can’t fit into my clothes anymore. I know I just have to eat better and start working out and take it day by day but I have no motivation to start or maintain it. I wish there was a quick fix to this, I know it’ll take time, but right now I’m at a stand still and I have nothing to help me move one step forward.
In all honesty I hate my life I feel worthless, and I feel like there’s no point in going on. I’m not happy where I’m at life wise and I’m not happy relationship wise I feel so disconnected from everyone that I’m slowly starting to feel like it would be better if I’m not here I just don’t know what to do I’m so stubborn that I hate asking for help but it’s just I’m so miserable I don’t know where life will take me
I’m kinda scared. I don’t know half the emotions I’m feeling and I don’t know how to begin letting them out. I’m trying to force myself to cry but I only feel worse afterward because then I have to try and work out why I wanted to cry in the first place. Insomnia won’t let me sleep so I get no escape and I haven’t been eating more than one meal a day. I just lay down because getting up hurts to bad.
I hate my job so much. It makes me want to kill myself so much more. But I’m afraid I can’t do any better than it.
I feel nauseous now. All the time. Just another problem to deal with and i know its depression related
i am not coping with my step dad's death last month. cancer is fucking shit and takes the best people from us. i hate life.
Last night I dreamt. I dreamt of someone I can't see or speak to anymore. We were riding our motorcycles and they were ahead of me just flying, bobbing their head along to music they were listening to looking...at home on their bike. They waved once to me to catch up, but no matter how hard I tried, no matter how much I twisted my throttle or how I tried to streamlined myself, my bike would not catch up to them. I could only watch in awe as they rode.    I woke up wanting to be back in the dream, but this morning I had made a promise to try something new- paddle boarding.  Paddling was...different. I was in a river that weaved its way through a forest. It was so quiet, it was so empty and for a couple of hours...I felt like I didn't exist at all. I could not think of anything as I tried to keep my balance and move slowly forward against the current of the river. There was a few seconds I thought of this person and that I hoped one day they could do this....  We may never see each other again and I wish I said "To the moon and back" one last time before I said goodbye. I wish I said "The door will never close" no matter how many days, months or years may pass...even after it all
Hehe I feel really numb but there is nothing I can do about it so I’m just smiling like a maniac
I'm afraid of running out of things to learn. I know it's irrational but there we are.
I hated everything. I feel like being drawn back to the old me again
I have chosen the spot I will kill myself in, should I find the right moment. Right now I don't feel ready to kill myself, but the calmness always feels temporary and flimsy. At least the scenery will be lovely.
I wont do it but that life crippling addiction I've been denying myself this whole time is looking really good today.. Also side note am I the only one who sometimes thinks it'd be nice to not care about anything but finding drugs and doing them but won't give themselves the "easy" way out by doing that because they possibly hate themselves that much they believe its better to punish themselves by forcing them to just survive the nightmare that is their mind?
I’m struggling hard. I got a health diagnosis I didn’t except, for my heart broken, can’t go back to one of favorite places for speaking up about racism, I’m work full time, have an LSAT in Jan, and I just want to die.
Last week I got a new laptop. It already had McAfee anti virus installed, which took me forever to uninstall. But I'm stuck with the McAfee firewall, which I cannot remove because it's not showing up on the Control Panel. I tried the removal tool several times and it was just too slow. So I got to the desperate stages and tried chat support, but it was just arguing back and forth, 'we can't help you' 'have you tried the removal tool' yes i did it never works. I got suggested that they would hack into my computer to fix my problem but I only just got this laptop last week and I am scared it won't work afterwards.  All I seem to do is argue and snap at others, and no wonder everyone fucking hates me. I don't want to live anymore.  I had a similar fight on chat support for something else a few weeks ago when troubleshooting and fixing an app that didn't work.
How depress can one be? ☹️
TW: Suicide Once again, I'm at a crossroads in life. I'm starting a new job with no idea what to expect. This year has been beyond horrible and people and things that always seemed so reliable have been taken away from me. My boyfriend cheated on me ('kept his options open', according to him), my best friend of four years tried to extort money from me (turns out she was a drug addict), three good friends died (of natural causes, but still) and I attempted suicide during a psychotic episode and only narrowly avoided being hospitalised. I used to be a part of a small community of local artists, musicians and writers. But recently, the project leader has decided to advertise herself rather than the group even though we're the ones doing all the work. Since our town's defunct industrial park became a World Heritage site, she's become so tight with the local WH committee. Our art used to have substance, individuality and purpose. Now everything we make has to be WH-themed or benefit the committee in some way. There's no dialogue anymore of any kind, she's quick to silence any dissent. I couldn't take it anymore, so I'm out. It's hard - after all, I invested five years of my life in the project while at rock bottom, and now, my life is really going to hell. Barely out the door, I get picked up by a designer who's been hired to convert the old auditorium at the library into a youth center. This summer, I made a comic book. She's hired me to turn page 40 into a mural. Well, not so much a mural as a big fiber board painting that'll be installed into the wall. Apparently, I was the first choice. Which is flattering, but I've come to not trust hope anymore. These are very serious and driven city people, not amateurs. I'm nervous. Whether I trust hope or not, I'm afraid of what will happen if I fail.
Today is another tough day. As always I am forced to deal with it. I’m forced to put up that smiling face and take care of those that need me. I feel less pain when I’m doing something to help heal another. Sometimes I wish I can live at my job but that isn’t durable.    My therapist called me earlier trying to book a section with me before our departure. Due to my health insurance I am no longer able to keep my therapist and doctor as my support network. My therapist has been kind I thought my doctor who I constantly refuse to cheat on with another doctor I though she was kind as well. It’s at our lowest moments we see through the real people who actually care vs the people who are just there just for a benefit. Sad truth but this is all I ever seem to attract into my life. The people who are just there for a benefit until the benefit has ran out it’s course. The world is unkind, we can fight so much for another being only to later understand that it was a totally waste of time you were fighting for a invisible person who never existed to begin with.    I called my ex to check in on our daughter. He got through me he smart he is really smart. He found out the info that he needed out of me. I just got hired at my new job to which I’ll be making a little more to be able to save up for my own place he found out and now he is requesting more money from me from child support anyone who has ever had to pay child support should know by now they basically leave u with nothing to live on.   Today I found myself at a peeks end. Begging the guy friend I desperately am afraid of losing to not  leave due to my stupid mistakes. I found myself begging my therapist to call me back just so we can figure out a way for him to stay with me. Today I’ve been spending more time begging rather then anything else.     I woke up with a great amount of abandonment feeling I have never felt before. Yesterday was a day of peeping on saying goodbye to this world. I even told my best friend that I was gonna add him on my bank account for anything happens he is the only one I can rely on that would look out for my daughter. My family would clear out my bank if given a chance. I need to start writing a will soon cuz God knows how stupid I’ve become. Anything can happen.
Fuck I hate being able to function.  It's so fucking bad that I still can get up and go to work but yet still can't get the basic job done.  What the fuck.
I've become tired of over analyzing my past actions. I've come to realise my troubles were because I was naive, trusting, idealistic and willing to stick up for myself.  At least, that's my interpretation of it.
I feel ... sad, but also that's basically I feel right now. I just played a few rounds of Among Us with my closest friends and ... I didn't feel anything. No joy, no fun, I didn't giggle like yesterday.  Some minor things happened, but they depressed me greatly. I don't want to go into them, because I don't want to get pitied- My pets and me are otherwise healthy and well fed. So yeah. But I feel so...  empty.

stop fucking trying to make me feel shitty for not being able to deal with being your emotional crutch jesus fuck can i be fucking sad for once without it being my fault all the time like dont fuckinf be all “”yeah i just csnt risk talking to u rn”” fuck off?? “”you broke my heart last night”” you sound like your mother do you know that?? cant something just be about me?? “i’ve been thinking abt leaving” this is literally a fight abt me wanting to leave don’t pull that?? and don’t get upset when i say ur free to go if you don’t want me anymore??? like???? i’m not going to fucking beg you to not leave me??? sorry i didn’t pass your fucking test
i’m so fucking tired of this just be fucking straight with me or just fucking don’t tell me don’t do this melodramatic dangling it in front of me but oh no i’m not gonna tell you because you’re not fighting for me enough bullshit like i’m fucking sorry i cant deal with you never believing i love you and having to reassure you 100 times a day and i know it’s taking a fucking toll on you but like man that’s not my responsibility
"I hate this."  "Why do you hate it? You know it's just your brain being chemically screwy, right?"  "Yes, I do know that. And I hate it because of these various reasons that hold up even when in both a miraculously good mood and intoxicated, and have held steady for many years now. Your self therapy is garbage and it's still four thirty in the morning despite not sleeping well last night either. I'd say at least we don't have work in a couple hours, but that's a pretty piss poor silver lining, mate."  "Well fuck."  This has been an attempted therapy session with Tor-Fura. Tune in next time for more obnoxious self-misery while we debate the importance of things like breathing, healthy coping strategies, and maintaining relationships.
I make dumb mistakes but that’s life
Is it ok to post about a non profit mental health resource that people can reach out to for support?
My anxiety is just unbelievable now
"good things comes to good people," karma, god. if any of those shits are real, then why am i in this shithole but the people who put me here are living their best lives?
School is the main reason I’m here and I want to grow up to be a writer but I don’t see myself living past 11 years

Just when I thought I was getting over my extreme depressive episode.. I just wanna die. I'm such a disappointment and embarrassment to my family.
My friend (who i love) had her father pass away about a month ago. And ever since she hasn't been contact able on social media and I'm going crazy whether she is ok or not, and every day I stray closer and closer to suicide
might ask to ge ton medications but im afraid of being numb gaining weight and then triggering my ED a level beyond what i already go on
[deleted]
I woke up depressed, feeling that heavy weight and agony again. I hate my life, I wish someone would redesign my soul, my body and my mind.
no matter what I do I still feel like a pathetic weak loser. I feel like crying all the time, my chest feels so heavy, my stomach aches, my head aches,my eyes feels like they are on fire. I cant stay awake I cant even sleep I just lie there like a lifeless corpse I dont even want to eat anything i just want to die everything is shit. Things that used to distract me from my shitty life makes me more miserable now I don't know why i keep trying when nothing is gonna help me.  No one gives a fuck about me... no one.  fuck everyone fuck everything.
The loneliness is deafening
Oh, can you tell me, can you tell me the way the story ends? A monster in my heart A ghost inside my chest I'm broken down, the world around us Surround my suffering You smile and laugh at me But you don't see a thing  Damaged and broken as I am I'm trying not to breathe Unraveled, I'm not unraveled by The truth I finally see, freeze  I'm breakable, unbreakable I'm shakeable, unshakeable Unraveling since I found you  And now I'm turning to dust in a world that's twisted Don't come searching when I go missing Close your eyes or just try to look away Don't want to hurt you We live in a world someone else imagined The ghost of what's left of me all but vanished Remember my heart, how bright I used to shine
i want to stop feeling so hopeless
aaeueueududjfgghhhh i hate my entire body !!! i dont know what i am !! i feel os sickly and disgusting please just fucking kill me
I've found myself in the depression hole again. I typically resort to substance abuse when this happens. Last time it was oxy, this time I scaled it down to booze. I'm now drinking at least a half a pint a day of crown. My wife doesn't feel like she can talk to me about her concerns,  and she's not willing to talk about the issues I have within myself either.   I don't have any friends than can really help, and after so many years of therapy in the past, I'm more than hesitant to try again.   My wife just told me she expects me to die early from alcohol abuse and she won't know what to say to our 6 yr old daughter.   I'm lost, and all I can think about is making her prediction come true.
Hi everyone, privileged to join. Passing through depression since few years. It is what it is.  But I'm on my journey to reboot.  Depression sucks, but there's a message in it. For me it is self blame and blaming others. In short angst for loss of control.  Can I get out of it, surely I can. This is just a few pages from a chapter of my book of Life, it's not me. It is a symbol of my strength. My resiliency. I'm proud that I am having this wonderful opportunity to pass through depression. Not everyone is that fortunate.
I’m so fucking depressed today I feel like hanging myself and stabbing myself multiple times till I bleed out to death. How can I concentrate with such disturbing thoughts. I’m very frustrated.
I spend all week looking forward to the weekend and when it comes i can barely look at myself or drag myself out of bed. The fact that this is a long weekend only makes it worse i have 2 more days of this to look forward to.... And i adamantly refuse to impose on people i know. Drink and sleep, on repeat
Fucking hate my life as always
I have know idea, I'm never be sure about how i feel
The demon of depression is creeping back up into my life.  I have had been doing slightly better lately.  But recently I felt that my struggles are just getting heavier and I don't feel like I am doing much better.  Meanwhile, others seem to be breazing through the same obstacles that continue to challenge me.
Having to relocate to another, much smaller, city has really done a number on me mentally... My entire childhood id make really solid best friends and networks and relationships, only to uproot and leave them to rinse and repeat.  I’m 20M and DIDNT think it’d happen after graduating high school in Columbus Ohio for 5 years. Met my lifelong buddies there and now I’m back to square 1.. all alone in a small town.  No friends, boring job, idk what to do anymore. I’m afraid I’m gonna look back at 30 years old and feel like I wasted my “best years”.  Nobody to vent to or anything.. so I guess I’ll post the tip of the iceberg here for now. Thank you to anyone reading. I’m just real lonely and homesick. My depression was completely under control with medication and healthy living until covid forced me to isolate once again and my job as a life insurance agent began to spiral downward and eventually left me broke, alone, and sad... forcing me to move to Tennessee where I do not belong. I just want to post my feelings somewhere and I guess this thread is the place for that.
Been a while, but I'm back.  Moved in with gf but in actuality I'm just trying to push her to a better life where she has a good job. Of course we both hoped beyond that, but now that I'm living with her and all her issues I can't stand her. I just want to see her do well and get a good job and be safe, get a career going for her and I can bounce. Of course I have to sacrifice a whole bunch for her to get there. Fuck. Oh well, it's only like 15-20k spent or whatever lmao. Like bitch, I'm helping turn your entire life around, please at least help pay for a tiny fraction of the rent.  Just getting fucking bodied by nostalgia and sadness again tonight. Typed about suicide on some other site but that's stupid. There's too much interesting media that can come out. I know this is temporary, but god damn is it uncomfortable. The amount of times I've thought of putting my gun to my head is abnormally high.  I wish I had good friends. Just normal fucking people. People who aren't severely riddled with problems or "friends" who constantly put me down to boost their shithead egos and cope with their insecurities. I just want to be loved by someone who isn't massively fucked up and isn't co-dependent on me. I go through instagrams of people I admire and their lives just look so much better. So much fucking better. I know it's a highlight reel but god damn I don't think my life even had highlights.  I just want love. Normal love. That's what I want more than anything. Just SOMEONE WHO FUCKING CARES AND DOESN'T USE ME OR FUCK WITH ME. IS THAT SO HARD TO ASK? I know it's my fault. Dukes of our own destinies and shit.  Going to start with my artwork again to try and cope. Try and survive through these coming months.  A plus side is that I will hopefully get a pick in where I can move in the future. Somewhere to start fresh. Maybe.... rework myself from the ground up. This current experience has taught me a bit about relationships and standing for what I want. So maybe it doesn't all suck. I can choose the snowy coast, or hell I can even throw a hail mary and go for the west coast, but I know that's just a dumb dream based off of a few interesting people I saw over there. Not like I'd join there circle and be happy. Maybe a more rural area... it's not like I do anything in these mid-sized towns anyways. I live rural and drive to the city for fun. Or maybe the city itself? I don't know. I'll just apply. It'll be kinda fun.  It's not about the place though, it's the people. And I don't know how to fix that. Maybe I'm the shitty person. I don't know.  I'll try to sleep. Maybe I won't have these stupid suicidal thoughts in the morning.  Just keep fighting. Push to the next objective.
Today feels like one of those days where I curl up into a ball on the floor and cry. Things feel surreal in a bad way again. I feel like I'm not good enough and I feel like I can't relax.
Tear drops running down on my face and my chest starts to feel like being stab again. Sucks when someone you like live so far away and only one understands you well. I have everything. I hate this stupid corona
I big sad boi rn😭🏳️🐺
As I’m driving home from all I can think about is how tonight would be the perfect night to come just slit my wrists and put myself out of misery
I'm still alive. Still alone. Still wondering why the fuck I put up with my shitty life and how long I can put up with the constant battle
Man don't you love when people start begging you for free rides before you even _start_ your shift  The average person are shitty entitled brats, and I'd give more context which also would tie into my depression, except I don't want Reddit crucifying me :')
I’m feeling so sad right now. I wish my doctor could put me in an induced coma and wake me up a year later.
I saw a friend yesterday and it was so nice to visit with him after  a couple of months or so. I felt better while I was there and then sad on the way home. I was sad because I didn’t want to leave and because our talk, while good, also brought a lot of sad and anxious feelings to the surface. Today I’m so tired, having trouble focusing on or caring at all about my job. I just want to crawl in bed and take turns sleeping and crying.
finally found a therapist who's willing to do a 30 minute consultation with me. made the appointment at the end of September for the end of October. which is a long time to wait, but I thought I could push through.  the office called and told me they need to push the appointment back even farther. I explained when I made the appointment that I'm having suicidal thoughts and really need help. but sure, I can just keep waiting, right?  god.  it's like a bad joke. I keep trying and it blows up in my face. what's the point? the therapist is going to take one look at me and decide she doesn't want to help me, just like the counselor at the crisis center.  at this point, I'm looking at rejection as permission to kill myself.
If I could do one thing I wish it would be to stop hoping for things to get better. Like, I already know what's going to happen so why the hell do I always delude myself with false hope that literally anything about my situation will change? Things only get worse, that's always been the trend my life has followed. Wasting energy on hoping something nice might happen is just plain stupid of me.

i can’t help but feel like a burden to everyone i know
Idk what I'm doing
[removed]
Got thrown out of another 'support' Discord again for fighting. Being stuck at home, restrictions keep getting extended and I can't go out. It's been weeks since I lost the online friend I was once close to and the loneliness is unbearable. And all anyone can say is get a hobby and make new friends! I can't do that, because every time I do it's instant failure but noooo NO ONE FUCKING BELIEVES ME. 'you have to put the effort in' 'try new things' blah blah blah and this causes an argument and I get thrown out. I could be here all day mentioning all the things I have tried, all the hobbies I have had to give up because they only made my loneliness ten times worse, but nope, I just get the 'keep trying' garbage thrown at me. I'm going to have a mental breakdown at the end of the year and nobody will fucking give a shit.
I think today’s the day I finally hang myself. I’m sorry mom and dad. I love you.
Starting to feel numb to things. Like "acceptance" but for a lack of better terms it's basically running out of fucks to give.  I'm supposed to be sad/upset/anxious about something like I used to but now I just feel nothing. I still laugh at videos and smile at things that I like but when it comes to negative things it's just numb.
Better days really make me feel like nothing's wrong with me or my brain. And when the bads happen, I'd be feeling crazy again and realize that I'm still fucked up and that I can't avoid it. I feel stuck.
I don't know why I made myself believe that I could do it. I know I'm gonna fail. Why do I always let myself get on things I don't know if I could handle.  I just really hope I die soon.
The family I live with treats me like trash. I've lived with them for 7 years, and I'm just now realizing it. Is fighting depression out of spite a thing?
I ended on bad terms with someone who was going through a crisis. I hope she's okay. I love her, and I hope she is alive.
no matter how far i travel, i cant escape myself. i cant escape my problems, my fears, my loneliness. i feel like ive just become a worse human. i am more insecure than ever. i am more depressed than ever. i am more lonely than ever. life just wont throw me a bone. im genuinely so lost in life. i dont know what to do. i have nothing to look forward too.
"Because one of their organs fell ill that person was never able to live up to their full potential and was severly hindered for large parts of their life."  Society: "oh my god that's terrible"  "That faulty organ was their brain."  S: "just be happy instead :)"

I don't even want to eat anymore. The feeling of hunger comforts me.
I started to realize I might be depressed when people - even people I like or love - start to seem so far away from me.  Like I'm a ship pulling away from the pier and they're standing there, waving...    I feel it happening with my family now, too.    It would be so easy to sink back in the warm bath of just letting it go along as it has been.  It's harder and harder and harder to connect with people.
Any tips on how to not get bad looks from my mean uncle for looking at a spoon cuz it was dirty?
Just don't want to live anymore. Banned from another Discord for arguing, since I don't belong on any other Discords I just deleted my account, got called names on another site as well. There's just nowhere for me.
I took the initiative to do a difficult chore I've been putting off. It was nice. I hope I'm starting to get better. Last week that would have been unthinkable.
I wish I could have relationships, but I'm too broken and no one should have to deal with someone like me who gets anxious over little things. I honestly cannot imagine living past 30. I dont think I can make it. I really fucked up and ruined a friendship. Even if the other person hurt me, I honestly deserved it and shouldnt have reacted the way I have. I was just selfish. They honestly deserve better than me. I'm just not good. I'm trying really hard to just not desire relationships anymore since I always end up ruining things to not hurt people anymore and it's difficult. I'm so lonely. I always wanted a family but I dont think I would be a good parent. I deserve to die alone. Hopefully sooner than later.
**\[Just have to vent for a moment about popular culture and 'activism'\]:** I feel so alienated from pop culture. Who am I supposed to be mad at? Who am I supposed to hate?  I'm tired. And confused.  I've checked out of feminism, politics, all of it even as it could potential help 'heal' and give me the validation I always craved growing up.  I'm terrified of saying the wrong thing and being accused of something I'm not. I'm generally considered a kind person in my every day life by those who matter and who weren't unreasonably cruel. I just don't care anymore, about all of it. Maybe that makes me a bad person, I don't know.  I've been torturing myself by reading the tweets of 'activists' and letting my inner and outer critic run wild. I'm also not living in the United States anymore, and not a citizen that has to live there, ever. I don't know if I have the mental or emotional resources to fill out an absentee ballot.  My therapist just started me on a meal plan that's been going for two weeks. I'm fastidiously recording my meals; trying to eat every three hours. She said that I've been physically depleted for so long I might need extra. This has consumed much of my energy and time. Will I be forgiven for being "complacent" or shamed again? Sometimes popular discourse reminds me of my shaming parents. Not good enough, not kind enough, just judgements under a different, more "compassionate" guise.  \*I edited this a bunch of times and originally posted it somewhere else because it's hard to get these thoughts out properly but I felt the need to say something ugh sorry
I can't fully come to terms with the idea that I'm depressed. I know I need to talk with someone. My husband can't listen to me anymore. It's not that he isn't caring, he's been so supportive and he's truly doing his best. It's just too much for him to handle. I get it. I've been very dark lately, I'm wearing him down. My friends don't reach out, but I helped isolate them. Everyone says "you can talk to me" but it isn't that easy. An open invitation means I'm doing the work. I can't do work. I feel so alone. I can't bring myself to actually do it, to try therapy. I made an account. I'm afraid of medication and hearing things I don't want to hear about myself. Everything is so uncertain.
I hate the fact that I have to take medication. I know it works, and I know it's necessary, but it's just how I feel about my situation. I just went up in my antidepressant dosage. At 300mg Wellbutrin and 40mg Prozac. Is that a lot?
I'm just so sad, but I don't feel it. Its hard to explain. But I burned myself a lot today and it helped my suicide ideation....wtf.
I was told by my partner that I have no goals. It’s true. I’m directionless and aimless and have been since as long as I can remember. I’ve existed to make other people happy and other people proud. I don’t have any goals for myself. The only thing is to eventually get a better job and just exist without letting anyone down. I wish there was someone who would accept me just for me. Or somewhere that I could go to just be accepted as I am. I’m tired of pleasing others. I’m tired of walking on eggshells. I’m just so tired of not being enough. I’m never enough and never will be.
Why can't I feel love for anyone. Why can't I be the person I want to be? It seems like every person on earth is more than me.
I think I might hate my life, and I had a suicidal thought today. I’m stuck at a wage job I hate , living with my mother who’s mentally abusing. I thought after I graduated university in June my life would finally be what I wanted it to be. But I’m stuck. And I feel like the only way I can get people to stop stepping on and over me is to hurt myself. Even though I know that’s horrible. I’m so lost. I don’t know what to do and I’m scared
I wanna kill myself I suck at presenting all I do is recite shit like a robot and it’s so embarrassing I just can’t. 2nd time Ive cried after doing one, and I thought I was employing. I’m so embarrassed I just can’t go on, if only I could just decease
Oof I wanna disappear nice
2 months ago, 2 months ago I was happy and enjoying my life. I had a girl. I treated her like the queen she was. But that wasn't good enough. She lost interest in me. And now she has moved on to another man while I still sit here and suffer. It hurts so bad :(
I saw some Quora, where men are vilified for watching porn in india. Just because females are not males they're talking whatever they want to. I am feeling depressed because of that. I don't want sex nor do I want anyone for me just because I am feeling helpless. But why should I be shamed for watching porn. Why the mentality of blaming all men and alienating them , isn't it exactly what  makes 'men' mysogonist. And isn't it one of the reason for violence against women. It's like they're shaming a normal guy to do violence against women. I feel depressed and very upset because of this. I just want to lie down a silent greenary and pass out from this hypocritic world of 'men'.
i feel like im going downhill. nothing really gives me joy anymore and i go to bed at 8 at latest because i can’t stand being awake. i sleep like 15 hours a day then go back to wishing i was sleeping. i got a ticket to go the museum tomorrow during a hopeful moment but i think im going to skip it and sleep some more instead
Random person going to Convenience  store on Sunday here.Gotta pay water bill! 7-11 here (part of Tokyo)closes early because of Covid.Wish me luck!
Sunday evening, managed to read my emails. Literally at the last moment before going to bed. Procrastinating it and having so much anxiety.  Former boss who might offer me a job (luckily) didn't call but (also former) therapist wrote back. Quickly reading her reply and it didn't really help. Was already feeling extra terrible today and I feel so let down when it takes me 6-10 months to crawl back to my former therapist again cause I'm too dysfunctional to do anything else and then I _again_ get the feeling that there's nothing she can say or that she doesn't care or whatever. Calling her is like the objectively most healthy and reasonable thing I'm doing in all this time, talking to a professional about my problems, and so often it's just making me worse. I'm running up the walls rn. It feels so dismissive and meanwhile I can't be more direct about having suicidal thoughts every day, despite everything I did there's nothing else on my mind all the time.
Yet another Sunday night where I feel numb about the upcoming week, yet thinking in my head for a slight second that something will change and I can look forward to something. What's the point on trying to get through the week, let alone day by day, only to dread going through it again? What type of life is that?
Almost forgot here. I have been through ups and downs much fast circle now. Funny I prepared time for break down, then I'm fine. When I need all energy and focus for the damn homework, I broke down. Guess never tell me the odds.   It's also interested how tolerance or disappointment numbs over time too. Yesterday's hurt is today's norm now. I don't know if it's good or bad. I desire less and less now. With adaptive shrinking myself, I honestly feel squishy now. I hope I can find a way out. Maybe future will be different... maybe once graduate and got my license,life will change. Or maybe just another disappointment.   Either way. I guess today I am still alive. And planning for tomorrow. Baby steps. One day at a time.
What do you do when you don't want to do anything? [The post removed]  I quit my job a few months ago. Left my apartment. Visited my dying mother but won't be able to again due to covid.  Now I'm just staying in hotels with no where to go. There's no place for me in the world and there is nothing that I want.  I feel like flying to Mexico and being buried in the desert - poof, gone.
Just typed this out on a Youtube video comment section and decided to post it here instead since Youtube is a lawless land of filth.  &#x200B;  Checkpoint or whatever.     I'm 21, fresh out of community college. Got my first job in March of this year. Nearly killed myself due to the grueling nature of it. Quit in June or July. Almost killed myself again twice in August. Closest I've ever came, but don't worry that experience taught me that I'm too much of a coward to do it. This is the loneliest I have ever felt in my life. I have no friends. I'm an outcast unable of making voluntary human connection. All previous connections I once had were chance passive encounters that have now since lost meaning. I have no one who loves me unconditionally in this world. Started therapy recently but it probably won't help me since my problems aren't entirely internal which everyone tries to lie to you about. Some of it is in my head, but not enough to make healing a realistic possibility. I just don't think I can do another winter. I'll be lucky if I die in some kind of freak accident before winter hits it's peak.
I didn't feel this way, say, a week ago. But the last several days, I feel discouraged to try to connect with anyone, including my wife or coworkers. I just feel this sense that trying to connect won't go well and I'll regret ever opening my mouth. But while I'm not expressing myself, I feel stifled and lifeless and without much of anything to look forward to. I want to be more transparent with my wife, but one of the things I'm thinking about has made her upset on numerous occasions in the past, and I don't want to be cruel to her or make her feel bad.
Been struggling with really bad anxiety and depressive thoughts surrounding myself, my eating disorder and such and i started medication for the first time ever for my depression and ADHD and it’s been hard for me to adjust to that but on top of that, my boyfriend also struggles with anxiety, depression, and ADHD and as much as i love him, i want to support him as well because he doesn’t really care of himself all the time unless i remind him or ask about him but i’m also having trouble. and he checks in with me all the time but sometimes his anxiety adds onto my own esp since my new meds make my anxiety a lot worse than it’s been in a long time.
I’m really not doing good. Decided to take a gap year for college to save up some money bc of corona so now I’m stuck at home all day. I’ve been looking for a job for months but no luck. It’s hard to get out of bed most days. I’ve been taking a few free online courses just to do something but am having a hard time staying focused. It seems like all my friends are doing amazing things at school and I haven’t even left my house in a week. Just feel extremely sick overall.
Tw: animal death.  I've been so fucking sad since my kitten passed away. Everything feels so dreadful, ngl. I still have my 5-year old cat who has not left my side during this whole thing. But i just feel so, so sad. I dont wanna do anything at all. Nothing feels like its worth it.  In top of that, I have spent so much money this month. I'm just barely, barely making it.   I fucking hate this situation.
Things are so hard lately. The future seems so dismal and hopeless. All of my bad thoughts are creeping back and I just want to sleep forever. I don’t know how much longer I can handle all of this
I have been doing well lately. However, I strongly feel that some of my friendships are a one-way street and that makes me feel lonely. My friends only want to vent. When I brought up my struggles in hope for a listening ear, they reply in an absent-minded and dismissive tone.   Today I received another text from a friend who seems to be complaining but lowkey bragging about her job. This friend went through some serious relationship issues lately and I told her she could confide in me. But when I told her about my job search burnout (+bad interview experiences), her reply was along the lines of "oh, sorry, too bad".  I am rather tired of keeping up with friends like these. Maybe I should just learn not to care too much about them and start replying in the way they replied me. Empathy saps away energy and should only be used sparingly for people who deserve it.
I had such a good week, even though work was just as shit as usual, and it feels like today just erased it all. Not even for any particular reason, I just felt like shit most of today, and even though I woke up at a normal hour I was exhausted all day, and then I crashed around the same time the work day was over (having not gotten any work done for most of the day because I could barely stay awake) and slept til 10pm... and now I need to work all night just to not fall behind even further on my work. Goodbye to any dreams of fixing my sleep schedule. And there are some important errands that I've been delaying forever and it's causing friction with my dad, who I already have a frustrating relationship with. I should've moved out months ago but even if I had the time to spare from work, I don't have the energy to do it when I'm depressed and anxious all the time. Fuck. FUCK.
My life is spiralling so quickly. It's 3:00 AM and I'm nowhere near done half the work I have to do for tomorrow. I'm a senior in high school and I have no clear path and no ambitions. I just want to fizzle away? If that makes sense? I don't want to live knowing I'm such a failure to myself and my family.  I had a lot of work today but two things that always make me feel better are taking showers and journalling. I did some breathing exercises and made sure I did both. They weren't too effective and I think I'm severely sleep deprived. Things aren't really shaping up and my meds are pretty ineffective right now. I wish I could just be productive and make myself (and my family) proud but I'm just so overwhelmed. On top of a really bad episode, my anxiety isn't giving me a break and I just want to stay in bed for as long as possible. My room truly feels like my only safe place.
I was diagnosed with depression yesterday and I’m feeling very overwhelmed. It’s not really a surprise to me, but for some reason it’s a bit hard for me to process. How did you guys start making behavioral changes that significantly improved your wellbeing? I feel like nothing motivates me, which just perpetuates the endless cycle of misery.
Watched a few videos about depression, toxic behaviour etc.      Related to some of them, but now I feel like I'll use them as an excuse to justify myself to me.      I hate making excuses for things, makes me feel like I'm escaping reality. I don't know what to do ....
I dont have anything going for me. I tried going back to school after staying away for a year (i went on leave due to lack of motivation) I was supposed to have changed. I was supposed to have practised socialising and gotten my shit together. skip to now where i skipped the day even tho i have a deadline tommorow that i have no way of completing. I feel like im getting older, fast, and everyone around me seem to be doing well for themselves. my friends have girlfriends, some are starting families. Im too unlikable both physically and personally for that. Im immature as hell and i dont feel like i evolve socially like people around me. If i could at least do well in my studies, or if i could enjoy things somehow it would be enough.
Its painful and i cant even sleep. Sometimes i wish i could just od or something. In just tired.
Old memories are flooding my brain. I keep replaying the stupid decisions I look which led to the loss of my career.
I had a really hard day today. It’s been a few weeks since I finally got the diagnosis from a psychiatrist that I am clinically depressed and honestly it’s hit me so hard. Struggling on and off for 5+ years with this and now I feel like it’s real. And on top of that I’m failing at college and I just feel like it’s all just piling on. I can’t catch up with my school work, I can’t fix myself, I have finally stopped suppressing my emotions (because of therapy) and all of this is so new to me. I just have been feeling like EVERYTHING lately and now I know I’m a failure at school too. My professor emailed me saying I have one of the lowest grades in the class and it just sent me into a downward spiral.
anyone intersted in being an accountability buddy, kind of like a sober buddy i guess? i want to get some support and want to provide that as well and don't want to get it from judgy and mean people in my life. im looking to move it soon and away from my family and while i would never characterize them as a support system, i def depend on them in some ways and want to start depending less and less as much as possible. i want a fresh start and think others do too. id like to try my best to do something and fail and suck but have someone just to tell about it all so its not something i feel ashamed about anymore.
Shitty week, the usual. Just waiting for any part of this miserable cycle to get cut. I even showered and cooked for myself today. Nada.      I wasn't strong enough to call the health center today. I can still salvage it by taking a walk but most boba places are closed at this time. I don't feel safe crying, so instead I try to stay numb all day.      All people see is that my mom cares but what they don't see is that she doesn't love me. She is simply bored and following her usual ritualistic obligation as a mom.
I’ve struggled with depression for a long time. Only came across this group more recently. I was bullied for a long time, had two friends commit suicide, and I was on a positive outlook of coming back around and being in a healthy state of mind before Covid. Now it’s only been going to work constantly since July. I spent time traveling prior and I wanted to find the significant other in my life. I had two toxic dates and Covid happened. Not sure I know what to do now. Other than going to work.
I have every reason to feel happy today. Everything has been going really well and today is my husband and my anniversary.   I'm feeling depressed and moody. I wish I wasn't, but I cant seem to pull myself out of this funk.
I find being alive so painful today and I don't want to do it
Bawling my eyes out. Finally managed to check my emails again after a week of anxiety. No reply from my therapist. Of course.  All of it is so wrong. I feel like it was wrong to ever rely on her. Their indifference is killing me. I spent years running around trying to do anything about my life and it was so fucking irrational, exhaustive, pointless and damaging and therapist was just watching me. Therapy is just like "man do whatever you want, Idc".   Three years ago was like "oh it looks like I've been ill all my life and sometimes spend years doing really irrational and harmful stuff, my family is actually abusive, I don't have any social contacts but at least I got a trained and objective professional who-... woops, made me much worse multiple times and it's entirely my fault in the end cause I picked her or didn't go to anyone else".  Suicidal thoughts for years. It fucks me so up to scrapd all my remaining energy together and talk to a professional and then they just shrug and are like "there's literally nothing I can tell you". And for me it's like any other therapist isn't different to this. I went to another one and it was just as bad. I constantly feel like I don't have the energy to move a therapist, it's like you have to shove a stone until they might finally care but then again it's six months later and they're like "man, this was _suuper_ pointless. It was really dumb of you expecting _any_ kind of help from me, you know?".  I'm so in shambles. I suffered so much for years just because I thought "going to therapy + trying to do something on my own and discussing it in therapy" would do anything when actually both of it just made me worse.
everything hurts and i want to die. a sudden and steady stream of medical appointments, trying to figure out this pain. im so depressing to be around, i don't know how my bf stays and puts up with me.
I have lost all hope. I spent all last night imaging different ways I could just die or disappear. Now today is even worse.
Suicide is a right
I’m tired of feeling the way I feel on a daily basis. I just want to be normal, without any anxiety/antidepressants..  I decided to stop smoking , so maybe I’ll start to feel attractive again + also start saving more money . Maybe even some actual happiness .  Instead of sitting in my sadness & comparing myself/my life to others on social media, I decided to come here & look through stuff that interests me .. I’m not happy, but I feel way better than I did an hour ago .
DAE do something or notice something really simple, something that anyone would do or see immediately but you've just left it for months or an inordinate amount of time, and when you finally do it you immediately notice how it's so much better and wonder why it escaped your notice for so long?  After three months of living here I just moved my lamp from across my room to next to my bed. I didn't even have to move the plug. It instantly made my room warmer, and I don't have to physically get up to turn on/off my light when I go to bed or get up in the middle of night.  I also picked up some of the old recycling and trash in my room. I had about a month's worth of empty milk cartoons and food that my landlord gave me a month ago that had a dead fly in it. I feel so much better and more in control of my life. I realise that I kind of was vaguely ashamed when I left the door of my room open to go to the kitchen because someone might see in and see how gross it is...
Maybe I try to ignore how people see me. But today I cannot escape it. People look down on you for earning less in a poorer currency. Tbh my quality of life is still okay and I don't have a lot of unnecessary needs. Still, it feels horrible to be judged. I rarely talk to friends who are earning US dollars anymore. Idk.
May not be a valid reason to be down but i posted in a few like-minded communities after months of holding back and it was all for nothing, i thought i'd at least get *some* support online since i have none in real life but apparently not. Yet when i sorted by 'new' in those same communities everyone else got some type of support while it was like i didn't even exist. I didn't care about upvotes but i was hoping that at least one person would reach out like they did everyone else.   I was always the invisible one whether it was online or in real life but i guess some things never change. I don't know why i even bother sometimes.
Feels like life is just going down. Thought i was doing a tad better and fhen halloween came and just thought back how fcked up i felt last year. Got guilt tripped by my ex because i didnt want to go to some halloween party.  And here i am still not over her while shes had fun with her parties.  Im really just a fcking mess. Too scared to even kill myself
I'm still processing the fact that halloween is over. My favourite time of year when I feel the most creative and closest to happy. I kind of wish Halloween were similar to Christmas where you have a whole week to celebrate. I mean I guess September and October are "spooky season", and offers plenty of time to celebrate. I just really like autumn, it happened too quickly. I'm not ready for winter.
I couldn't stop myself from crying today. My chest has been unusually painful today, too. Couldn't breathe due to both of which.  So lonely. And sad.
I love that I can have layered emotional breakdowns, bounce back, than have another when I realize I'm physically incapable of crying
I'm reminded again today how tenuous my hold is on good feelings. My kids are severely autistic, my husband turns out is Aspie. My marriage has been on the rocks for years, he will not do any kind of therapy. I can't really rely or lean on him in any way. Haven't shared a room in years, we function like strange roommates who occasionally collaborate on child care. But mostly I'm on my own rearing them, he can't deal with them without resorting to yelling or making it worse, so I honestly prefer it when he just bails on the weekends. Better than him sitting here angry sulking.   I bury my depression. I am so busy playing the happy/resilient mom role I don't think people realize I'm struggling. My husband is too in his own blackhole bullshit to care. But sometimes one thing will go wrong and there goes my house of cards. I'm exposed.   I had a nightmare the other night that I needed emergency surgery.. the hospital said, "you can't have your kids here." So I just left in a gown, was desperately calling everyone I knew to come help me but I had no one. Sadly real life isn't too far off.   I would love to divorce but have run all the numbers and there's just no way without fucking up the next 80 years for my kids.   My periods are suddenly super irregular, I'm guessing stress (pregnancy ain't possible).   Every day I wonder what the fuck I did to my life and how it could end up like this. And there's no way out.
Sometimes I think I should get infected with Covid and die.
Constant reminded that nothing matters, nothing is worth it and no matter my efforts they'll all be pointless. Nice.    Please kill me.
4:30am and I haven't slept. Just fighting the urges to hurt myself but at the same time wishing I'd just do it. I sincerely wish I had never been born. The world is cruel and evil to everyone and even if I wasn't depressed it wouldn't be worth living in. I only wish any of the times I almost killed myself I had just actually done it instead
[deleted]
After contemplating, I’m realizing that the reason I’m so upset with my ex wife moving on is that I feel like I will never be happy enough to love again. And my anxiety loves to make me think about how she’s with him when I have my kids.
It's like any mental health professional is like "don't you want to be happy?" and all I'm thinking about is "I wish I would've been a person".
i realized and noticed the negative feedback loop, everything i posted only strengthen my bad condition and reality, so i decide for today, this one day to break all my patterns, both in thoughts and action, all reboot.. just post this for myself.. a much better me.. have fun me..
[deleted]
I spent hours today watching a stream. Seems like 5 hours on twitch. It doesn't feel like progress anywhere since streams are daily. I'll never finish it like a TV series or movie.  I just don't do anything. I've been trying to be more productive by making a spreadsheet tracking what little things I do and giving myself points I can use to get rewards. But it's not working.  I think it's because I'm setting the cost of rewards too high at the beginning so there's been no redemptions.
[deleted]
I feel depleted and depressed. I went for a bike ride with mom. It's hard to get out of the house with agoraphobia, so i go with mom to feel less anxious. It should have been nice, should have felt like a victory but instead I was just aware/paranoid that some guy called me an ugly f\*\* or old f\*\* and thought someone threw a rock at my back.
I’m.. really tired. I keep repeating to myself that I’m ok, but deep down, I know I’m still trying to convince myself this is true.
I just was looking through my younger brother's Instagram from when he was in middle school and realized that......ive been such a bad sister to him. Ive never been present or there for him really. Now he's 16 and is going thru his own mental health stuff im sure, but our relationship isn't at a place where I feel like he'd be receptive of me reaching out...when I try he gets standoffish or like aggressive (in a memey/non serious way but still offputtingly so)...I just feel so awful bc I think I was supposed to be a role model for him but bc of my own depression and anxiety I don't think we've ever really connected..........we're five years apart which i guess is substantial  I'm turning 22 next month and I feel so old. Ik 22 isn't thatt old but like.....ig im an adult now?? Will be graduating from college too.....and will be returning to my parents house hahaha..guess I can try to connect w my brother then......I don't feel at all ready tho....like my GPA is good and everything but my college experience wasn't that great bc of my constant struggles w depression and anxiety and now im feeling really sad..grieving my college experience and what could have been :((  and entering a world that remains so uncertain..with a cinema studies degree of all things hahahaha not even production just studies.............hmu if u ever need an essay about Taiwan's or Tibetan New Wave bc that's apparently going to be my undergrad legacy lol......and I know I should be working rlly hard on everything bc theyre my last classes of undergrad but im just..sad and tired all the time  Tldr; bad sister, useless(?) degree, on trajectory to land right back where I started 4 years ago
Pretty sure not related to depression.      First day at new location of job. I hate the organisation mainly because of their ridiculous policies which takeaway freedom of people.      I don't see myself settling at a single place in future, cuz of the job.      Preparing for switching to another job, but with each passing day I feel my chances of getting the job are reducing.      I just want to take a week of, do nothing, order in food, icecream , just rat and waste time watching something, in a dark room.      But I'm willing to go through all this until I have not failed at switching the job.      If I fail to switch, I don't know what I'll do. I'll be devastated, I won't care about corona or anything else.
I'm a stupid fucking idiot who needs to die.
I don’t even feel like eating. Just kind of want to not exist. Can life be paused? I need a break from being a human. Not suicidal, just tired of living.
I feel like I’m living life on autopilot. I don’t feel anything, just emptiness. I don’t know what to do - the future scares me to death and life is just too exhausting. I want a break.
I'm tired of thinking about the career I lost because of depression. I am tired of thing about how much more financially secure I would have been, if I'd held on to my career.
I know I'm about to get bad again.   Especially after everything I've been surpressing. I've gone through new traumas I've been staying busy since. I've been staying busy and it's catching up to me almost like i can't outrun it. Fuck fuck fuck
This overwhelming pain of emptiness..will this ever end.
dreading work tomorrow. I'm behind on a project and I'll get in trouble for it. my workload is honestly too much but I can't change it. dying would be easier than this.
I have bipolar depression. We are in a pandemic, my town was hit by 2 hurricanes, and I am in nursing school through all of this and just found out that I missed the deadline for clinicals by 4 days and now I won't be able to reapply for another semester. I am already behind in school. I think that this is my breaking point and I'm not doing well. I also don't have a therapist or councilor at the moment and I don't get much support from my friends. This is definitely the hardest year of my life
I fucked up my whole fucking career guys!!! I ruined my fucking life. This is it. Like can I die now? I would much rather die than deal with the fact that I’m a fucking idiot for torching my whole fucking career. I hate everything and I don’t want to live in this world anymore because there’s no goddamn point.
I’m such a fuck up it hurts. I always end up in embarrassing situations even though now-a-days I don’t even leave my fucking house. I wish I could disappear.
Because of being stuck at home due to COVID with loneliness and no distractions, my bad flashbacks are getting worse.  I did not start using the internet until I finished high school in the mid 90's. I really thought it would take the pain away that I had with being bullied at school etc  I did have a few friends at the time in real life, but I had nothing in common with them. I also had penpals and I did have things in common with them but I wanted more. But as soon as I went into chat rooms (in the era of servers like MIRC, Yahoo Chat etc) and talked about my interests, I just got picked on like I did at school. And it got worse from there, all I had was drama no matter where I went. Ignored, rejected, having fights etc just like in real life. The last time I tried to connect to likeminded people was at the start of COVID using Instagram and I lasted a week before I deleted my profile. I got lectured recently by a normie on Discord that 'oh there are friendly (the word friendly was bolded) communities out there, you have to find them!' Bullshit. I have run out of places online to go now. It's worse than in real life, where I don't fit in anywhere at all.
Just an overwhelming sense of hollowness and dread. I don't know what to do with this feeling. Sometimes I feel as though all my relationships/friendships are meaningless and I should burn all my bridges anyway. Nothing I'm contributing is valuable. I just want to disappear.  I hate typing this feeling out, because it always reads as an insufferably angsty Tumblr post, but wow, I just feel horribly alone
I've been under immense pressure at work over the last few months it's getting to me. I've cried so many times - in the bathrooms, on the drive home, on the train, in the shower and in bed. When things are going well at work, things are going really well. But when things get bad, or stressful, I feel like the whole world is collapsing. Sometimes I just want to close my eyes and disappear from my life.
At the point of self destructive anger.  Not much to do from here on out.   I dont want to hurt myself, but bettering myself seems a mile away with no motivators.
Had to stop ketamine treatments just because of a temprature check that was high enough for a fever so they suspect i have Covid. What awful luck i have and now I can't continue the treatment I had so much hope for.
Hey I'm relatively new to Reddit so I'm kind of awkward sorry~ My depression (I'm not properly diagnosed but that's the best way I can describe it)  began about 2 years ago now, I was going through some not so great stuff at the time, and it got to the point where I just wanted to kill myself. I didn't act on my feelings but it just felt so surreal.. I was so scared because I'd never felt anything like it. It sort of got better after a while and last year wasn't too bad, but the last couple months I've started getting those horrible feelings back and I just want to die all over again. A week ago I started self harming but my friend convinced me not to do it again, so I'm doing my best just hanging in there. Sorry for the long comment, is there someone who could help me, maybe point me in the right direction.. I just feel so lost and confused..
Emotionally abusive ex-girlfriend really fucked me up. Not saying I was perfect, I definitely made unintentional mistakes that hurt her, but man I wish I didn’t have to go through that  She keeps on posting on Instagram and if I ignore it she gets very depressed and angry. She’s even threatened to harm herself. I’m scared as hell to not interact with her but I need to do that.
i was diagnosed with depression a few months ago, and for awhile things seemed to be going okay, i was medicated and had therapy sessions weekly. recently however my therapist had to leave and i won’t be assigned to a new therapist until December at the earliest. which i know isn’t a huge deal but recently i’ve been spiraling out of control, i’ve turned back to abusing substances to try and feel something and nothing seems to make me happy. i don’t know what to do or how i can get out of this slump i feel like i’m letting down everyone i know and care about and i feel so alone. i can’t talk to anyone i know personally about what i’m going through but it’s been affecting my relationships significantly and i’m afraid i’ll loose the one person that makes me feel somewhat normal and happy
Sheesh it's been rough. Having a hard time coping, really. It seems like quarantine and impossibility to go anywhere will never end, and even going to the office regularly won't be a thing until at least March.    I feel despair honestly. Not constantly, but often. Just too many things at once - a critical and snappy manager, death of a family member (not immediate family, but close enough), mother constantly unloading her emotions on me, eviction of my building which would mean I'll have to move again, and I did already twice this year and hated it... And loneliness. Just this loneliness in this city which never ends, and makes me feel like I've lost all sense of direction, there's just loneliness left right and center. And better times won't come.    I hope I'll find strength somewhere to move forward and just continue - I've been doing it for so long and haven't gone crazy so that's good. Just would like to know how to navigate towards "happy" instead of... well, where I am now.
I don't understand other people at all it always frustrates me. Usually I get my ass ghosted like over and over and I don't know why, maybe it's the average reddit user being a selfish piece of shit with no self awareness. But yeah it's been a tough year trying to meet like-minded people and 2020 doesn't help that cause whatsoever
I need to cry and have had the urge to several times over the past couple days, but I just can't. I can squeak out like two tears and then my tear ducts just blue-ball me essentially. I don't know what to do
I heard this dude say he was going to leave and transfer to another school for “his mental health” and that ppl weren’t with him all along. It makes me sad that the program is like this. How can you be a bitch to your students, how can you be an ass to your peers. When someone leaves it feels like they’re failing their jobs as teachers and supervisors. I hate this feeling I’m dealing with
Feeling really shitty lately. I have some severe mental health issues. I moved to Chicago four years ago to run away from my family in a way because their is lots of trauma surrounding them and I can’t have a conversation with them about it because well They won’t listen and everything is a joke. I moved back recently because my dad has Alzheimer’s and my mom broke her elbow but now I’m having to face all the issues and being back has caused me to want to just kill myself.
Getting over how i threw away my life for someone i loved who doesnt care.  We had our last argument today, and she gets to have a perfect life while i pay for being there and she still is lying about cheating.   Now im just really lonley (even after an 100 upvote post where so many people were just asking me to reach out if i needed it)  I couldn't tell them that im just broken and rotting away, and that im sad, broken and lonely at an age where everyone is disgusted by someone like that.   Now ill be alone forever probably, and i still gotta find a way to keep pushing.  Im so stupid, i deserved all the cheating and lies for trying to love after god has shown me i will always be the hopeless romantic.   Just tired of being alone.   Im so fucking tired....
Feel unmotivated. In a slump. Trying to work my part-time job while finding a decent full-time position. Dealing with thoughts that I'm not doing well enough. So-and-so earning more in a developed country while I'm stuck being a wage slave here.   Can't sleep. Always fall asleep around 4am. Essential oils and meditation helped a bit.  When will this get better? I don't know.
well, not doing the best actually. i'm holding back from hanging myself. All I can imagine is what it'd be like to go back to when I was 6. any time before 9 tbh, because I had so many choices of what to do in life, but instead of trying to achieve my goals, I fail, I can't focus. I wanna die, And the only way to feel something is to inflict pain on myself. but by doing so the same happens to the people around me, I want to feel again, I want to feel real pain... nowadays if someone close to me dies i'm not even sad..  but i'm starting to catch up on my work..? well my teacher told me if i can't focus I could take PILLS to help me?! I'm at least making some kind of effort...
I...at this point i can only feel sad...my feelings have been rejected time after time and my family doesn’t help either...im lonely as hell..therapy isn’t helping....i just feel like maybe i should just stay alone and do nothing....
I feel like stopping all my medications and run away from treating myself. It's exhausting. I don't want to be medicated anymore. They don't really help me anyway. Wonder what's gonna help.
After like a month of trying to get in to a doctor I finally have a meet and greet tomorrow. Here's hoping I can start medication after feeling like shit as long as I can remember.   My dad told me not to end up like him the other week, so I don't really know if I have hope for the future at this point, but if anything can do it meds can.  I just feel like my tank is completely empty, if this doesn't work I don't think I can keep scraping by.

Really really don't think I can make it much longer. And ultimately don't even really think there's a point in trying anyway
It's one of those bad nights again.  Fuking God just end this pain. Just end me! End my life! This is such bullshit!! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
I was in a habit of beating myself up for running late all the time, then I realized how much more excruciatingly hard it is for me than it is for other people simply to get motivated in the morning. I realized I’m not weak or lazy or a slacker at all, I’ve just unfortunately got it harder than people who manage to get places on time and looking put together. No one else has the same determination and perseverance as a severely depressed person who can drag themselves out of bed in the morning. It is by far the hardest thing I do on any given day.  Minor mental victory! I can celebrate my determination instead of completely thrashing myself for fucking up something that seems so simple for everyone else.
Love makes us blind. I felt something was off, but didn’t want to accept it.  The relationship became long distance and I was even more desperate to spend time together.. until my ex couldn’t stand to even hear from me now.  Sometimes I feel a bit crazy, being head over heels for someone who wants nothing to do with me. Where did it go wrong? Why don’t they love me...  But I read a Reddit post a while back about how everyone in our lives are just passing through at different paces. Some, we’ll have many years with, others, we’ll only meet briefly. The only thing we can do is enjoy the time while it lasts. I don’t feel bitter, just a bit sad - but hey, I’m working on myself and hopeful that eventually, we’ll all meet the right person.  Hang in there, everyone.
Crying and triggered bc of my parents emotional abuse. I thought they wanted to check up on me and my health.... and first thing they do is scream and go on the 'warpath' bc they want money from me, a 20 dollar bill. That is worth making their only daughter that will still speak to them cry and think suicidal.  I am changing to zoloft trying to curb my suicidal behavior. My parents don't care that I'm suicidal or anything about me. Just what 'I can give them'. Been like that ..my whole life.  I know if I give them money they will scream for a different thing bc they have been emotional abusive my. whole. life.   I want to protect myself. I want to never have to talk to them again. I want to feel safe for once. I changed their skype username to bully do not interact. I will look into ways to block and reduce voicemail. I am happy I have a lock on my door but I will look into buying mace.  I want to know I am more than a fun thing to hurt. I care about my health. I'm proud of myself getting a good rest and focusing on healing. I want myself to know I am healing and building up for a reason, not to just be another thing my parents can tear down. I'm not here for that and worth more than that.

i need someone. i'm falling
ahhhhhhhhhahhhhhaahhhhhh i’m so sad for no reason!!!!!!!
I guess things haven't been that awful lately. Nothing great either. Just gotta see how things go. I know life wont really get better for me but I can atleast dream about it. Some good memories as well. I guess you could say that's what iv been doing lately. Day dreaming a lot.
I feel like I’m useless right now, I want to throw myself in a meat grinder to end this fucking physiological torture.
High school sucked so I threw my last two years away to go to a community college to get extra college credit in hopes that my university experience would be better. Ultimately this just shortened my time at university because the general credits normally required for my degree have already been completed so I only needed 2 years to graduate instead of 4. I’m at university four hours from home and am set to graduate next winter but my first year was cut in half because of coronavirus.   I feel hopeless. University was supposed to be a fresh restart but it has left me lonely and exhausted. Talking to people to remain connected gets harder every day and I wish I didn’t throw my educational career away because I wanted to rush and get out of high school. I wish I took a gap year to find what I’m truly passionate about instead of going for a career I see me hating in 10 years. Corona has spoiled spring semester and if things don’t return back to normal over the summer then my last semester will surely be the same. I feel like a rag doll being tossed and dragged through the motions of life. I’ve never felt so exhausted.   People preach that you find your people in college and about how you explore your newfound independence. I have never pushed myself this hard yet I somehow always find a way to convince myself that I’m not pushing hard enough.   I have no room to complain though. People are going through the same pandemic and there are others who are upset about their “university experience” too. I probably sound like someone who complains too much but I just needed to vent.
Killing myself in a couple days, maybe tonight depending on how unstable I become between now and when I fall asleep. I’ve been formulating a plan for a month now and I have everything ready for when the time comes.My “friend” who I had plans with decided to cancel with me and go with someone else, which has been happening consistently this year . They were the last thing that kept me around, and now that it’s been made abundantly clear that they don’t care about me as a friend, I don’t really have a reason to stick around. If nothing changes in a couple of days, here’s a peace out in advance ✌︎('ω')✌︎
no matter how hard i try, it seems like i just can't not hate myself. and it's like this hate is spreading everywhere, because my body can't contain it all. im so angry and sad and frustrated because im getting the help everybody says i need, but then i tell myself its not fuckin worth it because I am not worth it. noone seems to understand that, but everybody would be better without me. if only people could read my mind, they would understand it, but they can't and i dont tell people the horrible things that cross my mind about them and about myself, so everyone keeps loving me when i dont fucking deserve it. i dont deserve anything. i dont deserve to live in the first place. sometimes i really wish i didnt exist, but i cant end myself. i just cant.
been talking to a nice girl, shes super radical i hope things work out
I emailed my doctor my suicide note. It had a nice feeling of finality, at least.
I'd always thought this was a relatively recent venture into the Dark.  But nope, apparently my seven year old self also liked to sit on the roof at one am wondering why. Nice, now I have one more point against me
How do I get over you?
I think I'm on the verge of seeing failure before my eyes. And it's not like all of the other times I've experienced it in some way. And I don't have anything or anybody to hold onto during the process. I'm not suicidal, but the repercussions with what I somewhat saw as hindsight for this failure is hitting me now. I felt no other way than to just break down. I'm just yearning for a hug to let me know that it's going to be okay. I want it to be okay. I'll accept it but I need to know that it'll be okay.

I feel like I need to talk with a therapist. I just want an outside opinion on things
Old guy across the alley from us is once again shoveling all the snow out of the alley and into the one area in our yard I have to put snow off the driveway. I'm so sick of ignoring that, his dickery means I have to spend way longer outside carrying it into our yard instead. He only does it at night too so he knows what he's doing is wrong. Man, I really hate people sometimes. I could call him on it, but they're friends with everyone around us so we all know how that would work out.  Just feels so fucking personal sometimes. I'm so tired of being walked on and having to let it go.
I'm gonna try to start meds for my various issues. I tried everything else I'm supposed to do, and instead if feeling better I'm just burnt out. A year of cutting out bad food, not drinking, and exercise has done nothing but complely fuck my knees up. If this doesn't change anything or if I get turned away I'm not going to be able to keep going. I've been faking happy for 7 years and it hasn't done shit.
I wish I was the one who walked away
what are you supposed to do when your parents are having financial problem while you yourself is currently unemployed and mentally fucked up
I want to self prescribe wellbutrin Any advices,,?
The fact that I ever was such a terrible person is unforgivable.
I think the problem is me. If only I could get rid of myself.
how I wish I could die or just disappear completely and no one is going to remember me

What do you do when you can tell you're about to slip? Out of nowhere, maybe even after weeks or maybe months of progress I can just wake up one day and notice that I'm in for a rough patch. It might not even be that bad that day, but I can feel that it's about to come, and for some reason it feels unavoidable and that the only thing I can do is trying to ignore it until it sets in a couple of days later..   Just a week ago I felt great, relatively speaking. Had a fresh piece of ink added to my arm, super excited and inspired for how to continue working on it, but just a couple of days later I hated the thought of why I even bother doing them because the thought of cleaning it for two weeks felt too overwhelming.   It feels like my brain is mocking me. Letting me have some good days, signaling than fun-times is over, then smack me a couple of days later with crippling depression.   Anyone else ever feel like this, like that you can tell before it sets in that it's coming?
I think the light in my life is about to get extinguished. I’ve finally got back into a routine, which used to be the only think holding me together since 2016 but i don’t feel better. I’m stuck. I wake up and the rest of my day is clouded in a haze. I’m dreaming of better days but my birthday is so close I can smell the loneliness a the beginning of my decay.
Me and my GF recently moved because she got a good job offer. It is kind of a remote location. People keep telling me there are good jobs here but the only thing I could get was crushing rocks. There is nothing in my field. I have only been here for a month and a half but my hopes of getting a good job are dwindling.
My boyfriend's gotten a bit mean lately; he says things that are reminiscent of what my dysfunctional mother says to me. It's nothing too bad on the surface, but it makes me worry that underneath the exterior he really does think poorly of me.... This isn't even to say neither of them don't have valid criticisms of me, it's still just upsetting to me to be talked to like this. I'm supposed to visit him next month for the first time since we went long distance in July and part of me is worried things will feel different
Using all the distraction I can, especially any digital devices. Escapism as a drug, probably even worse than at any point in my life. Any moment I'm alone with my thoughts I'm constantly screaming. Can't grasp my life.  People would probably tell me "you can't just keep running away from your problems" but (next to other things) I did therapy a number of times during the last years. I spoke about my problems as much as I honestly could. But it didn't help anything. Therapist doesn't really say anything, she's practically been done with me years ago. Told me best thing would be to go to a mental hospital and _that_ is something I can't do. It's like the absolute worst place for me, I'm just escalating with anxiety. Like you're afraid of fire and they want you to run straight into a burning building, without any help. And when you can't do it they're like "well, it's like you don't _want_ to get better". Or they just don't care, at all.  Slipping into cynicism again. But failing to make any sense out of all this otherwise. Talked about my problems to get help as well in therapy, didn't help. Maybe it's just the wrong therapist, maybe it's me, maybe both. Moving in circles.   Super disappointed from therapy. Asking myself if I even _want_ to get better. Trying to find some will to get better for years and haven't been able to. Did so much "selfcare" and healthy activities as well, didn't really do anything. Literally screaming at any wake moment and I can't move.
Been doing alright for awhile and the second the semester ends and break begins I'm miserable again.  Yay. I already have absolutely no idea what to do with my time and it's literally the first day. Things I easily could do I just don't wanna. I guess I'll just lie on my bed and stare at the ceiling.
I don't feel like I have emotions, I just feel empty. I react to things how I think I should react to them and whenever I cry I just force myself to continue else I feel like I'll stop and if I do then I'm doing whatever I was crying about a disservice.  Whenever I try to write about how I feel I feel like I'm full of crap, just trying to say shit for attention to make myself feel better.
Well I didn't get help. Maybe next month...
Maybe I wanted him to replace my ex. But today made me realize again that I’m not interested in him. I’m not. Sigh.  I hate when people gift you something that ships to your house and you can’t refuse it because it was shipped. Now I feel like I owe him. And if I send him a gift, he might get the wrong message. Ughhhh
I'm tired of the trial and error nature of antidepressants and how bad the side effects are for me. I had withdrawal symptoms (stroke-like) tapering off of the last one a couple weeks ago, and my psych said she's never had anyone have such bad side effects to a medication. That's really reassuring...  The problem is all antidepressants are like this for me. I've tried so many in the past. My old psych has the worst organization and hasn't sent over records even though I've been pestering her office for months, so I've restarted this trial and error process.  I see a therapist regularly, am eating my vitamins, exercising, have a support system, am eating well, etc. but I'm still severely depressed. I feel like I really got the unlucky draw with my 10+ years and counting of treatment-resistant severe depression and all my other physical chronic illnesses that have developed in the last couple years.
Everything is fine or at least not as worse as it was before. Preoaring for my PhD exam in Dec. but still feel as a failure that got a slap of humbleness in 2020. Trying to sort stuff.
I hate myself so much. I don’t like people seeing me because I’m so self-conscious. Nobody understands what I go through inside it’s so much.I’m so broken I don’t know who I am anymore or what I wanna do. I have nobody to talk to. I’m so lost. I only have 1 friend now because everyone left me after I lost myself. That’s crazy. My confidence use to be out this world. But I completely lost it. I barely sleep and I can go 2 days without eating but I believe that’s do you depression. On thanksgiving it will mark a Year since I been going through this and since the break up that lead everything here.I lost so much weight from Depression. I barely eat. I started smoking so much marijuana to feel better. It was working for a couple months now it’s not anymore. I Tried committing Suicide Twice which landed me in the mental hospital twice. I’m Diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and ADHD. I’m haven’t seen my family or friends since November 25, 2019 because I’m so embarrassed to let them see me at my lowest. I’m only 24 years old my life use be so great. I been stuck for months. All I do is Sleep and go to work. I’m not into my normal hobbies anymore. It’s hard to get Myself up. My moods swing on very crazy.
I want to die so bad but I can’t because people would be sad. If only I could die without making people feel sad. Fuck living.
Life can't be a simulation, or I may be a goddamned masochist (or is it sadist?). I guess I could've been punished and forced into a headset or something
This week has been one with alot of bad news just piling up  on each other. As everyone has been freaking out, I have been trying to be a voice of reason. I feel so numb and so exhausted by it all. I am alone in my place just wishing to be hugged and knowing I won't be
I am a useless failure piece of shit and nothing that I’ve done matters. Nobody cares. I had a panic attack at work and almost passed out from hyperventilating. Nobody cares. I am a broken human being and it’s not going to get better. I am alone and I’m going to be alone. Nobody cares. I just want to stop hurting. I don’t want to feel like this anymore.
I really want to go. It's getting really hard to stop these thoughts and I'm getting closer to doing it by the day. The only thing that's holding me back is that I'm terrified I don't succeed and have to live with all the consequences.
People who've called me handsome, studly, or model-looking:  * That lady who wanted money outside CVS * That car salesman * My mom * edit: redditors who have no idea what I look like (thanks fam)  People who haven't ever said those kinds of things:  * Anyone I've been attracted to  gah
I feel lost and tired....
After almost 3 weeks of finally feeling hope again I’m back at thinking I’m just a waste of space that will never achieve anything at all
I'm pretty sad. This week has been hard because my partner started a new job that is super exhausting. We have an active kitten who wakes him up at 4:30am for food and is draining him even more. I told him I'm trying to help him by waking up earlier, but it's a work in progress. He lashed out at me, which I also understood because he is stressed out and exhausted, but we got into a huge argument that made me realize how incompatible we are.   It saddens me because I don't want to start over again, especially when I'm in the middle of applying for nursing school. I feel like I can't control my life and that things are falling apart over things that could be resolved with some patience and persistence. I feel like I need to get out, but my mom isn't in a place to support me and I can barely support myself. I don't know what to do and I'm scared to act because my future is so fragile that any wrong decision can set me back. I'm just so lost and unsupported right now.
Life is like a game that I keep failing at. I honestly can’t find much of a value in life, at all.   I want to end it, but the ramifications would be too much
I'm crying out of anger. Why didn't I get to be human? To be reacted to, basically? To be whole? My life is emotional neglect. And then this country perpetuates it. And I went back to it. How can I recover from my own bad choices?   I had the first conversation with another person in almost a year. It was with the person that works at the convenience store. I sensed we had some connection.   It hits me that I talk to no one. Am seen by no one. Had no other friends.   How can anyone live like this. I don't exist to anyone. I'm terrified. Is suicide the only way?
Went to bed early last night and had one of those nights of weirdly disjointed sleep/dreams. It was so nice, however now I have to get up and face reality.
I can't sleep. It's 3 am and my heart feels sick.
I’m not happy, I hate this feeling
i will never be happy i want to die i will never be happy i want to die i will never be happy i want to die i will never be happy i want to die i will never be happy i want to die
I completely forgot about a therapy appointment yesterday (over Zoom, yay for that bullshit excuse for medical treatment), and my office never called to ask why, or if I was okay.   I've had two appointments with this therapist now and he's a joke. I'm pretty sure he's playing Minesweeper while I'm talking, he barely responds. And yet, if I ask to change, I go back in the pool and have to wait months for someone else.
I wanna disappear again
I feel like I'm going insane. Thoughts getting worse. I can't sleep
Man, I'm an asshole. I'm like this cat I got from the shelter. Yeah having a good home has it relaxed but it will never ever be able to act like a normal healthy cat. I'm never not gonna naturally be an asshole. Too neurotic, anxious, negative, weird, and so on.
I feel like shit and don’t wanna do anything. Not even sure why i feel this way. Would be nice if everything ends now.
I really think I want to die but I’m too scared. Scared of what will happen after but more so worried about hurting the people who “care” about me. My dad and sister both attempted suicide recently and it made me think “well obviously they don’t care much about me and how I’d feel if they were gone, so why should I worry about how they’d feel?” Idk i feel everyone else in my life is aloud to be selfish but me. If I do much as think about myself for a second I get called out on it. I’m constantly called selfish yet I feel like everything I do is to not upset other people. I’m also like super tired of trying and I’m really worried that nothing will work out in the end and it would have all been a waste of time. I also have so many sad and scary thoughts all the time and I want it to be quiet. I wonder if death would make things quiet? I’m scared there will be even more noise. Idk what’s worse.
Lately I have been doing leagues better with my depression but I find myself trapped in a job where I keep getting hurt and don't feel supported by upper management. HR refuses for months to help people so I don't even bother wasting what little energy I have to fight them to make them do their job. Today I found myself unable to actually work properly. I was just going through the motions and went from one pprtion of my job to the next without being able to put the effort what I was doing. I can't help but wonder if black Friday helped to do this to me.
I wanna disappear so bad. I have no motivation to go on. I'm so fucking tired of this fucking life. Please, please, please take me now.
Experiencing a loss of appetite. I feel like shit.
Fuck all the happy people
I feel so guilty staying alive everyday, born privileged and not doing anything but sit around.  I wish I could give my position to someone who’s struggling and has motivation and talent. I’ve been labeled “gifted” since young but I’ve done nothing of worth and I just feel so guilty.
I hate these few months, it used to be my favorite months due to having my favorite holidays and bday all together. But now it only reminds me of my greatest failures each year like an anniversary   My parents think I sleep more in the cold. But it's more of I want to skip these months asap to avoid bad memories
Why did I wake up.
Maybe the world wants me to commit suicide. Maybe people want me to go
[deleted]
i thought of ruining my life as much as possible before i end it all but i dont even have the energy to do that. i dont want to do anything at all. everyday im just reminded of my mortality when my body needs food. i really wish i dont have to live the rest of my life.
Yo, I'm nearing a breakdown haha
Having some emetophobia anxiety. Ate a thing with chicken and it had been sitting out for a while before I put it back in the freezer again. Talked about this on the emetophobia sub and got responses like “Well I’m a vegan so sorry for you, peasant” and “you’re gonna f\*ckin die”.       I’m hoping I will not die, I feel doubtful so far cause I feel completely fine right now just really scared. And annoyed that I bought a thing with chicken like one time, only to be called out by a vegan like “you monster”. 😂 I'm scared, why do I do this to myself. I panic every time I eat chicken. I was doing so well, hadn't eaten chicken in months other than my parents homemade meals with chicken, their cooking is the only food other than frozen food or vegetarian food that doesn't scare me. My friend also has this phobia so I trust their cooking as well.
I need to go back to therapy but I have to wait until my health insurance kicks in.  Honestly what I probably need is psychiatric medications at this point because my depression is that serious but I don't want to end up being fat and sleeping for 14 hours a day again like last time.   But what does it even matter? I'm such a fucking nobody, I'm barely even a human being. I don't have that spark of life that other people seem to, even if I could be happy I'm not sure I would know how to handle that since it's such a foreign emotion to me.
Constant night shifts + fatigue + being painfully self-aware of your flaws 24/7 = current hell  This job blows and I wish I could make a friend that wouldn't judge or backstab me. But life's not fair, and I need to accept that's just how it is
Somebody threw one of my shoes down the apartment hallway. I've really no interactions with anyone here.   Gotta get more sleep. Been acting different lately. More mean-spirited to people at work. Usually I'm better with restrain, but litle less inclined to care for some reason. It's not good. Then stress about it. Don't really know how I come across to others, but I know historically it hasn't been good.
I think I'll never be happy.
Holy shit I want to die so badly
been asking friends to play games with me because i been feeling down lately, but they rather do anything else. been asking them for their choice of game but they just ignore me  they only ask me to play if they have nothing else to do lately, i am sick of being everyone's last resort
I’ve been having visions of trying to jump off a building. Landing head first, breaking all my bones. I wish to live a long life but having depression is making it difficult to achieve. I should knock myself out and wake up from a concussion. Maybe I’ll get better after a blunt force trauma to the head.

I'm tired of myself and my family. We're all shit. We treat each other like shit. They should've thrown me away when I was born because I'd take being parentless any day over being raised by them. I just want to die, I don't want to deal with this anymore. I should never have been born, and I'm sure they would agree with me.
The simple act of being alive makes me want to sob in agony. Death is going to be so great, I can fcking taste it. Honestly, I'd take an eternity in hell over this any damn day. At least the suffering in hell has a purpose.
Was trying to study for a test and throughout it all I would dry cry at random moments. It's getting worse
This season is like a rollercoaster. Once you think you are getting stronger and better able to handle the lack of social activity and steady income, something as simple as a stress dream kicked you right back into the hole. It’s exhausting. Hopefully, coming out of that hole will be easier this time around.
I've been having many calls with my school friends, which is cool, cuz a few months ago I didn't have any friends to talk at all. But, when the call ends, I'm left with a empty feeling, and the only thing that's in my head is "I wanna sleep, and luckily I won't wake up tomorrow". Started to think seriously about suicide, having an overdose with my medications, but it doesn't seems worth to make my mother's life a hell because I'm always bitching about my life. When I try to understand why I'm feeling so bad, it always comes to this one person that I really like, but that I feel they doesn't give a f*ck about me. When I try to talk to them, i always feel so f*cking stupid afterwards.  Most of my days are filled with this anxiety, like there is something very wrong happening in my body, like my heart is just too heavy for my chest.  I recently fixed my sleep schedule, that was f*cked because of some medications I was taking on the wrong time, but it looks like it was useless, cause now I'm taking the medications correctly and I still sleep too much. I honestly don't know what to do anymore, just want this to end as soon as possible.  Sorry for the long text.
Man things suck sometimes.
I’ve had an amazing week visiting family but the reality of going back home to my lonely hole upstairs in my grandparents house makes me sad.  I’m depressed. I’m anxious. I’m sad. I’m overwhelmed. I know I’m very loved and I don’t know how to deal with this anymore.  Lying to everyone and telling them how amazing I’ve been since I’ve moved has been one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, considering most of my suicidal thoughts have come up more since then.  I’ve made the solid decision I’m moving back, and hopefully things will start to fall in place and maybe the cloud that has been on me all year will lift.
tonight is the blue moon and I'm here again. not a frequenter but still a "here again." sorry for the cryptic nonsense. I know I dont have it as bad as others. a tiny part of me still wants to say something, though. my friend is on his way to graduate after 6 years of grueling work, and I'm proud of him. I am happy for him but thoughts keep nagging me and comparing me to him and others who have finished college. 6+ years for me and I'm not even halfway done my degree. I know I dont have it as bad as others. there's a lot I could vent about but I don't want to take up a lot of space, irl nor online. I dont want to get in the way and I dont want to be noticed. sorry.
All things considered, I'm feeling ok right now. I got a bunch of work that's making me anxious, but other than that it's ok. It's still there. All the things I've done and felt over the past few weeks when things got bad, that's all still here, just sitting there. I got into a uni a few days back, been getting decent grades in a few classes. Why do I still feel empty?
I'm going to try to practice basic self care for the rest of the week and see if I feel any better, already having second thoughts though
PTSD and MDD with melancholic features I feel so terrible.
I guess I'm doing okay I just need to make sure I'm not drinking caffeine, getting enough food,water and rest taking my meds and not isolating myself and having some social interaction. You know, having the right chemistry in my brain this goes for friendly advice for anyone Male or Female who's having difficulty.
I’m feel mentally drained last week I felt so good and this week it’s one think after another over and over I just can’t anymore. I go to therapy twice a week he has me about my secrets I told him everything except one sometimes it haunts me and I think about it more and more. I’ve contemplated and had some minor attempts of suicide for the past 4 years but today right now I feel like maybe it’s right. I already know what I was gonna do, but small part of me doesn’t want to give up hope on the one thing I want
I am not doing that well. Have been out of a job since may, I quit my job that was so horrible and now I am kind of afraid to go back to work. I have been living with my mom since june and I am 26 so it feels pretty shitty. I had a job interview at this health food store that is an hour and a half away that I have to take public transit to get to, and they want me in for a second interview tomorrow. The first interview was so intimidating and it took everything out of me. Today I feel soooo sick and weird and generally just unwell. Its 3am and my interview is at 10. I do really need the money but I also have been cleaning a ladies house each week and am going to be helping a friend with renos. I feel so burnt out from working full time and alot of the time two jobs since I have been 18, they have all been like customer service jobs so I just feel so tired. I am not sure if I should call in the morning and ask to reschedule the interview or if I should just go, but I also want to make the best impression of myself. I also don't want to go if I am feeling unwell. My depression has been SO bad since moving in with my mom that it feels normal and regular and most of the time I don't even acknowledge it. It can be so disabling. Im just not sure what to do. I am on effexor and I have a therapist that is rarely available. This pandemic is also weighing on me because I am so overly anxious and cautious about covid and its been so hard to find a job that is decent and not two hours away. Despite not having gone to uni or college yet, it seems so discouraging with everything being online. Just want to cease to exist.
she disappeared, I knew it was too good to be true, everyone does, I hope she feels better n does n finds happiness she deserves  I wonder where I fucked up, reality is painful  radiation today was good though
when I started to self harm initially I had to build up my courage with small things to big acts and my family situation is getting shittier and shittier that it's making it worth going through that again bc self harm helped in some way. I really need help with what's going on but even my therapist agreed that there's no hope for me.   my family and the environment, mostly the staff at the psychiatric facilities I stayed in made me fear the consequences of suicide and self harm which really hurt cos that was my escape but right now I'm at a place where I'm on the line of deciding whether or not I should just give in or try harder to avoid it. this hurts my head and I feel like I'm going to explode.
I feel like there’s something I should be doing or should have done by now but I can’t figure it out
i just want to die all over again. maybe mixing alcohol with some pills would work.
I feel so broken. Just everything is been getting to me. I wanted to make a post about it but I don’t how to phrase it right.   From feeling like that I’m an a magnet for some people who mock me to landing in situations that’s pretty strange. And get shit when i try to mean well. Sometimes I really wish i could fade away into nothing.
I could be in a room full of people yelling for help and I get none. I feel constantly alone in everything. Everyday is just a struggle and everyday I wonder if today is the day I lose it and call it quits. I feel so close to the edge.
I am sad.
this week has been a wreak i’ve put off so many assignments that i’m just now doing, i haven’t had a full nights rest in months. i really need someone to be there for me but i feel like i’m too selfish for wanting help. Today was a bit better then others but it could be a lot better.
I’m done with the semester but unfortunately my anxiety has not gone away at all. I have one tasks that has been looming over my head since august. Of course it’s a task I could knock out in one day, but the pressure of it and the anxiety it’s caused has prevented me from doing it for.. ah let’s see 4 months now. On top of that I experience depression year round but it’s really hitting hard rn during the holiday season. I feel like my connection with my family isn’t as close as I would like it to be in an ideal world, but there’s so many things preventing it from becoming what I would like it to be, and too many traumas in the way of full reconciliation. I’m just really feeling down and in the need of some kindness tbh, or even a hug I really miss being around people that care about me and I’ve been in the house for the last week due to me quitting an unnecessary job. But working was an outlet for me and now I just have all the time in the world to feel this way. I’m hoping I’ll feel more up to things in the coming weeks but just wanted to do my weekly check in. :/
at this precise moment, I want to fucking blow my brain out. YAYYYYYYYY I don't feel empty I just feel the urge to deepthroat a gun.
Why is it so hard to get up in the morning? I have no purpose to live anymore . I just want to be normal. I can barely talk to the only real friend i have left when they called , feels like i've lost my talking ability.
If there was an easy surefire way to commit suicide I'd probably have taken it. But I've heard of people surviving after taking a bullet to their head. It's not easy I guess. Jumping off buildings triggers flight or flight but at least bullets aren't something I think my primate brain would recognize as being a threat.    There's just so many times I feel like not dealing with shit anymore.    I didn't apply for covid relief because I didn't qualify. But now I'm learning that even people who didn't qualify got it. Now I'm hoping that they have to pay it back eventually. Not because I want them to suffer but because I was an idiot missing $14k in free money if they didn't.
My grandpa just died and all my friends just decided I’m not worth there time like this one girl I used to talk to all the time every day she was my best friend and I told her everything but about a couple weeks ago she decided to block me on everything with no warning and this is following a trend where every girl I’ve ever loved has hurt me at least once I’m not exaggerating at all every single one of them idk if it’s me or something I say or do or if I’m too ugly or what I’m just so fucking lonely and I have nobody to talk to so now I’m turning into a fucking alcoholic and I’m scared
Why do I feel sad about everything?
My girlfriend of five years dumped me nearly three weeks ago and it's definitely triggering depression I thought I was over years ago. When we first started dating I was depressed still for over a year, and one day it just "went away", or so I thought. We broke up because I was exhibiting depressive tendencies that were inhibiting her fun in the relationship, and I didn't even notice they were depressive tendencies until afterwards. I have no idea why I get out of bed in the morning, and the only thing that makes me not want to absolutely cry is playing guitar. I finish undergrad literally tomorrow, I should be so excited about my life and the new things coming for me and I'm just... not. My parents don't understand me, and scheduling for a therapist is not as frequent as I need. I feel like a burden to my friends and weak for not being stronger than this. What's the point of even commenting this?
I feel like shit. Like I'll never be alive. I'll never be free. I'll never have dignity. I hate all of those things.
I don't want to try anymore because just reaching "happiness" is stressful and makes me cry a lot. I feel like giving up on trying to be happy and just trying not to end up in the street. It just makes me sad that THIS is what life is and that I have to deal with it- i don't know what to do anymore.
I don't think life is ever going to get better than this and this isn't even a life.
How did it all go so wrong...  You were the one who didn’t tell me another girl kissed you. You were the one who didn’t tell me you fell out of love. You were the one let me fly across the country for you, for us, to see each other. I was hoping things changed. But it seems I was just wishful.  And although I thought I was over you, I can’t help wonder why your last words to me were so.. full of hatred. What did I do so wrong? Love you?  I don’t know how to move on or if/when I can see someone new. I’m such a fan of happy ending stories and some (foolishly) wishful part of me believes you’ll come back. Like how you came back when it didn’t work out with person you tried to use to get over me. But something tells me this time is different. Well, *we’re* both different. I don’t know how to trust you anymore even though some part of me still thinks of you with a bittersweet.. sadness? I wish I could just hibernate. I do. And if I could forget you, I would.
I need to face my fears. Today one thing I want to do is deposit money. Then I'll downgrade my chequing account type.    Most if not all of my problems in life can be fixed by facing my fears.  What's the worst that could happen? A bank teller who's seen it before 100 times or will in a month gives me a weird look?
I'm tired. Need to clean. Need to pack. Don't feel like it. Played some video games today to keep my mind off all the shit. That was nice. If Dad has to help me clean and pack. So be it. It's his fucking fault I'm going to be homeless and living in a camper. A fucking camper.  No worries! It's only temporary. If I don't get back to work soon, I'm sure I'll be kicked out of that too.
Hi, new here.   My life is a rollercoaster, and I’m tired of it. Thanks to my medical treatment, I’m lucky enough to have my good and peaceful days, but they just highlight the violence and pain of the other days, the painful ones.   I’m tired. I have an urge to die, yet I want to live. Because deep down I know it can only get better, I just have to keep pushing, right? But it’s so exhausting, I’m exhausted having to experience these painful depressive episodes over and over again. They crush to pieces everything I try to build, and they just let me wonder : will I ever be able to accomplish my dreams and projects ? Those things that kept me from giving everything up ?   Today I tried to get up early, it didn’t work out unfortunately. I played some Smash, took a shower, got out of the bathroom still feeling sleepy and exhausted. Put my clothes on and went out because yesterday I didn’t and I know staying home doesn’t help me most of the time. Right now I’m sitting on a bench, in the cold. I could sleep on this bench I swear, my body craves for naps, all the time, all the effing time.  Anyway, thanks for reading this sad text lmao and I wish you the best in your life.
the humbling thought that the world would go on without self  would be the softest thought in the end
I hate when people yell at me. It wasn’t my fault, I know. They were in a bad mood, I know. But it doesn’t make the behavior any more excusable. Legit, I feel like sh*t and still haven’t gotten this mood out of my system so I’ve been snapping at other people and trying to refrain from messaging anyone.  But seriously. Watch your attitude because it affects other people too. I get you’re impatient and want help but don’t f*cking yell at me. It’s not going to make the situation magically better. So dumb.
Barely got anytime off this week, barely got any sleep, yet I'm scheduled for a early morning shift which I haven't done in months  I dread the next two weeks, if I get another 14 hour shift because some slacker pissed off due to the holidays I'll cry. Well, cry more anyway. Doesn't help that my parents are telling me to "be grateful", "adapt to change", "look on the bright side", and "you still have a lot of years to work, so buckle up buttercup". It's so hard to see any positives, I hate nightshifts, I hate that I'm letting my parents down on such a simple request, I wish my stupid brain was normal so I could act normal and not be miserable
I cant fix myself :(
I used to be likable and depressed when I was younger. Now I'm unlikable and still depressed.
Ive had more severe depression In my past, but rn I am having some severe fatigue, and non-stop sleepiness... I have a huge exam coming up in a few weeks that will decide the rest of my life and I can't fail it... I'm just at a loss (which makes me even more depressed).. I'm in therapy and was just increased from lexapro 20mg /day to lexapro 30mg/day... I was just throwing this out there. I love you all, stay strong and let me know if anyone has any tips or links <3 <3
so it's actually holidays already. usually i'd spend my day (like any other days) playing video games but i especially feel like a loser this time around.. everyone's got places to be and friends and family to visit.. i don't have anyone. i want to just log in into the game to forget how lonely i am but i don't want my online friends to see how much of a loser i am.. no friends no family just a degenerate playing video games all day. yet the more i spend my time doing nothing the more thoughts i have about how much of a disappointment i am.. at least in game i get a "quest complete" achievement to help me ignore the thoughts
I feel stuck in a loop of both wanting to be a better person, and then thinking that I'm not worth the effort. I'm stuck in some bad habits, and I'm going crazy. I don't know how to help myself, and I feel like everytime I go to get help, the best people do is throw some pity, or sympathy, but I just want to be a functional human being. It truly feels that some of my problems can never be answered by anyone, and the only people who say life is good, and they have answers are just selling snake oil. I just don't want to be such a fucking loser anymore.
Started therapy for the first time this year. Had about 15 sessions and decided that this particular therapist was not working for me anymore. The last few sessions I felt like I was being more judged than supported. Still need to find another therapist...soon..  2 1/2 weeks ago my parents (who I don't have the best relationship with) got covid and gave it to my husband. I'm currently pregnant and got super depressed and still feel trapped in it. I tested negative and recently did a second test and waiting for results. We weren't telling people we were pregnant yet but after a week we ended up telling our family.  Everyone is doing okay and recovering...  I feel like a piece of shit. I'm not working, I have a hard time keeping a job. I'm pregnant. We can't move out right away because of financial debt. I don't think I love my parents and we live with them with my brother who I hate. I feel dumb for not trying to leave the house sooner.
I’m not doing well. Everything I always knew about myself is true. I honestly don’t know why I bother. I am not going to make it through this year and that’s ok.
Never thought I would progress to becoming an alcoholic but that's where life has taken me. I feel like I can bear through this awful existence with it and no longer without. It makes me feel normal and able to communicate with friends who I haven't talked to in so long.
I'm not sure what to think. I was given several competing differential diagnoses upon discharge from the psychiatric floor, and I'm not sure which one to trust. The first and most common that I've been told is **depression**, but then, the same discharge papers list my principal diagnosis as **schizoaffective disorder.** But then again, the pamphlet I was given upon discharge, which was confirmed by psychiatrist on my first outpatient check-up appointment, is **severe recurrent major depression with psychotic features.**   Does the *exact* diagnosis matter? I'm on two antidepressants (*Remeron* and *Zoloft*) and an antipsychotic (*Risperdal*) to treat my symptoms. It just seems like I have a shit-swirly of mental health afflictions that can't be boiled down to a single term. I feel like if I just have that one term, that one unifying diagnosis, I'll better be able to cope.
YOU. ARE. GOING. TO. BE. ALONE.   **FOREVER.**
I still fall asleep with the lights on without brushing my teeth.    Feel tired most of the time. Trying to use music to stay awake for a bit.  I wish I were focused. If someone else said "I'm going to read for 6 hours" I imagine they'd do it. But for me it's like 2 minutes of reading followed by an hour of reddit.
there it goes again.. the fam calls and keeps drilling it into my head that i have nothing to be sad about. like i didnt know that?? if anything it just makes me feel worse?
Game I've gotten back into a few days ago after a big update is starting to get kinda grindy and I'm finding myself losing interest and when i lose interest in whatever is distracting me then there's nothing to stop my thoughts oh god:)
I feel the end of a friendship coming on, but this one is extra hard because he has been someone that I enjoyed spending time with. I’m too toxic of a person when I’m depressed, so I don’t blame him for not coming back when I push him away.
I tried to kill my self.  I don’t remember being in the hospital for ODing on klonopin and booze. I guess my brother said he’d take care of me? Something something all the sharp things out of my apartment? Not sure what order this all happened in.  I OD’d on my klonopin and alcohol again but this time was in the psych ward. I feel like I let my brother down doing it the second time. He does so much for me and I keep trying to kill my self. Got out of the hospital in 3? Days.   Sometime before all that I cut the shit out of my arm. Guess that must’ve been why the sharps were taken out?  Oh, I broke a glass to have something sharp.  There’s blood all over my apartment. I remember a brief moment of paramedics.   I’m trying to turn my life around. Banned from benzodiazepines and abruptly stopped after using klonopin / Xanax of some kind for the last few years. And OD’n on them.  Right now I ’m feeling sick and shaky as hell.  Being put Antabuse and Naltrexone.  I’m never drinking again.  I think people think I’m fine? Idk. I still want to kill my self. I feel so gray and emptied.  My 31st birthday is tomorrow. I hate my birthday.  I feel so alone. Being social via video chat is numbing me to all real social interaction. I just want to hug my loved ones. I’m alone. I have barely any emotions right now yet a heavy deep set grief. I’m upset that I am in the state of mind that I’m acknowledging different ways I could off myself. Life is a giant tidal wave of being a burden on others. They support me, help me, love me. My parents, brother and friends have given me their world and unconditional support. I love them so much. But I’m still suicidally depressed. I want to reach out to you right now but I’ll just post my psychotic break online.  Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you “my week” check in
With life seeming increasingly stagnant and feeling increasingly pointless, it just feels like some social event or group that is disorganized and not going anywhere and something I'd like to check out of sometimes. But it's frustrating because I have loved family members and friends that I care more about and know I'd be hurting them badly if I did anything. Doesn't help the pain, but it's something.
A part of me wishes I were never born. Then no one would be sad because I never existed. Life is so fucking frustrating.
I just broke off a six year long toxic friendship and I believed it ended on good terms. Her father passed away three days after we did. I was her closest friend aside from her boyfriend (who is not good for her). I feel like I left her to be with just her toxic boyfriend and now that her dad died, I feel terrible because I feel like I need to be there for her but we aren’t talking anymore
i wanna stop eating because i know i’m not hungry, but i can’t stop. even if my tooth starts to hurt and my stomach hurts, i can’t stop eating. i was doing so good for the past 6 months but ever since thanksgiving, it’s been downhill.
I'm just a shitty person. It's not intentional. I don't really do anything to anyone besides be me, which is a shitty person. I'm reminded of it all the time. It's why I'll be alone all my life until I die. I can't fully grasp it, but I am. I have to remind myself of this, or I think the world wants me to know. There's just no getting out of it. If I don't think I'm a shitty person, that just makes me more of a shitty person. So I just have to accept it and be more unhappy.
Feeling shitty this week, or month, whatever.  I need some outlet, and I think I'll try planting some catnip for my cat.  Otherwise, I'm kind of going insane.  My best friend isn't talking to me as much, we live across the country from each other so it makes sense, it just still hurts.  My mom is a total alcoholic and has been for years, recently switched to gin instead of vodka I guess lol.  My parents got a new cat but I don't even know if they'll be able to keep it because of their dogs and idk everything about their life and my brother who still lives with them.. I just can't take any of it anymore.  I guess I have supportive people around, but no one really listens anymore.  hell people on reddit don't even really listen, it's fine, I know people have their own shit.  I just wish an accident or something would take me away, sooner than later please lol.
Feeling unsatisfied
I just want to end my suffering. My mother doesn’t seem to care about anything.
Been feeling pretty tired and kind of numb. Honestly not sure what to do about it. I guess venting helps a bit.
just a random revelation i had earlier: everyone in my family has depression. 4 out of 5 were officially diagnosed and the last one most certainly does. i am really surrounded by the wrong people.
My head is in a haze. I just browsed youtube aimlessly last night. I got into an argument last night with my dad. Now I don't want to eat near him. I'm afraid for some reason again. My mom went to mediate.    I'm ok leaving.   I'll try to confront my fears on paper.
Pretty numb, making small progress but the day is still so young and I don’t know what to do with myself, my mind and body are betraying me. Gonna try a walk
Feeling like a drone. I’m behind at my incredibly demanding job due to so many things out of my control. My SO is hundreds of miles away. I’m stuck in my miserable living situation.   I feel stuck. Haven’t been depressed in years. 2020 kicked my ass.
I have a really bad headache and for some reason, I’m thinking about you. What are you doing? Who are you talking to?  This sounds like the start of clingy and maybe I was. But you said you liked the attention. It’s funny how we interpret behavior based on how we feel about / see the other person.  When we were together, you liked that I crossed lines, that I was a bit weird. But now that you found a new group of friends, I’m “creepy”. Isn’t that something.. I wish I wouldn’t have thoughts like this. I wish I could forget how you’ve hurt me. I wish...
is it really so wrong for me to want to kill myself because i don’t  think i can survive even faking being a peasant forced to maintain the  unrealistically high standards of labor to serve the interest of the  american imperial core let alone weather the very real reactionary  violence that will inevitably spring up en masse leading the the  balkanization of the mainland u.s. that could potentially destroy the  entire world in my lifetime? because im sick and tired of pretending  like i wanna keep doing this i can’t keep doing this anymore and no one  seems to fucking understand that i literally cannot see a feasible  reality that is worth living in. and i will not be able to feasibly survive the violent times that will prelude the birth of a new world that is worth living in. i dont give a shit how  anyone feels about me not existing if i wont get to have a world thats  worth living in
Decided to take a weekend getaway by myself. Let some old friends know if be in that area, got myself hyped up only to find out today they have work engagements. I just wanted someone I know to give me a hug without asking. I’ll go anyways because im stubborn. But I feel more broken than I did before.
I am a horrible person. I know that. I have good qualities that I think are good, but others don’t notice. I’m now realizing this might be because I’m such a horrible person. But It’s incredibly hard to do something about. I’m an asshole because I’m so fucking depressed. I hate taking care of myself because I’m just so fucking ugly what’s the point? My relationship is falling apart because I’m putting zero effort into it because I just don’t know how anymore. Shits so much easier when you’re not depressed. And after this depression episode I’ll just put this all to the back of my head like always, and I’ll go back to my shitty mediocre life. The life I would love to change, but I can’t because i hate myself too much.   It’s so much harder to deal with myself when I think about my issues. Like I can’t do it without breaking down type hard. And what follows after every breakdown? Months of these thought buried in the back of my head and living angry and ruining my relationships. I need fucking help but I’m too much of a piece of shit to get any. I would need someone to bring my grown ass in for help. Every time. Like the pathetic piece of shit I am. What’s the fucking point of trying to live a life if you know it’s just gonna be shit because you’re too much of a pussy to even tell someone you need help? I only ever think like this during a breakdown. Too many breakdowns too close together and I’ll fucking kill myself. It’s the only thought that brings me peace in these times. What a selfish piece of shit, eh?

Happy. New. Year. I can’t believe it. It’s been.. a year now? Do I miss you? I want to be so done with you that I want to feel angry at you. But I’m so tired. Too tired to want you anymore, too. Bye bye bye. 2021 will be a better year for me.
Anyone tried Spravato? I am at 0 out of 10 for a while now and am trying it. Not sure what I think.
So much anger towards the people who I don't think were fair to me. It's been so long since the unfairness that I can't tell if they were really unfair or I was dangerously naive.
Extremely afraid of opening letters and emails. Managed to open a letter I got ten days ago, super afraid it was something negative which was almost certain. And it was, my bank sent my data to a credit bureau watching people in danger of becoming insolvent/in debt.   I guess that just happens if you're unemployed for a really long time, don't open mail, don't call your bank back, don't pay money into your account and what else.   Even talked to therapist about all that last year but she doesn't want to talk to me, can only tell me to talk to someone else. I'm too afraid for that, she can't tell me anything about that either. I'm so disappointed of therapy and have so low expectations, every time I drag myself back it gets worse.   Managed to check my email account as well, first time in ~four weeks. Was afraid I missed something important but nothing. Former boss didn't write back about new job I was offered (and super afraid of all of this, I'm extremely dysfunctional and no idea how I'm supposed to do this, I'm just living in the moment and trying to distract me as hard as I can cause I can't cope).   So no answer is relatively "good" for me I guess? Oh and also no answer from therapist. Alright!   Despairing so hard.
I wish I can just walk out of situations I really don't want to be in. I am tired of my job but at the same time too scared to go elsewhere; on top of it is that I don't know how my job pace will be by the next month or so and the stress is not worth it with the pay I get. I'm old, miserable, and apparently desperately lonely. The things I do want with my life I feel has had the opportunity sail a while ago and/or I'm not fit for it. At some points I have to feel zombie-like to just catch a break, and even that can only go so far. Not like anyone wants to hear what I have to say and would be ridiculed otherwise.
I kind of wish that I could end it without the worry of traumatizing my family.
I just want to disappear to be honest. I am so alone because it's hard to get a friend. My parents are also emotionally unavailable. I'm not good at anything and trying is extremely difficult because of my MDD. I am back to square one again. Feels like I wasted my parents' money for therapy
very tired... my kid is the only thing keeping me going... tbh not sure how much longer I can go
I don’t see myself living past 2021, and that’s okay
I'm a Junior in college and I have been falling apart. It started last fall when I failed a class. Spring was looking up until COVID hit. Now I haven't talked to any of my friends in weeks. I joined an online group therapy group but it hasn't helped at all (I just lie to them about being fine just like I do to almost everyone else). I had to drop two classes this semester and I didn't tell anyone in my family. I'm letting down one of my school clubs by being negligent about our finances. I need private therapy badly but I'm too scared to talk to my mom about it.
I always wondered why anyone would quit school when it most likely decides their future until this. I’m only 14 but I know for a fact that I’ll kill myself if I ever quit. I’m hopeless. I don’t know if I can keep going
Lately, I find myself struggling to take a bath. It's too tiring.
Your mom may end up doing the same thing or may not be mentally there for your sis and niece if you do it.  It's not fair to your sis if you did it. Yall both have a rough life she doesn't deserve to not have her mom there for her.  Your niece need atleast one good male role model throughout her life, don't let her be without one.
I wanna be out, and be inside all the time. I wanna talk to everybody, and nobody. I feel so massively depressed. I don’t want to go back to work, but I need human interaction. I only talk to two people consistently and that’s because they’re the only people I really enjoy the presence of at the moment.
Checking in Saturday  Hoping to spend the day cooking and cleaning up.
sometimes all i can think about is suicide. I feel so weak and pathetic
Starting a new job Monday after being unemployed for 6 months. My anxiety and depression are in full swing though. I hoped to be excited but all my brain is doing is thinking of all the ways things will turn out badly. My last job ended horribly and I'm just worried about ending up in that dark dark mental state again.  I'm going to try to do productive stuff tomorrow I guess but I'm struggling.
**Contains medications and not in any way an indication of seeking professional advice, let alone for anyone else to see this post as a means to be advisable.**  I feel like anti-depressants are holding me back while ironically being depressed at least half of the time anyway. I don't take my prescriptions everyday,  which of course will throw me off since it wasn't advised by my doctor, so it's stupid to complain when feeling like they don't work. But throughout time I've noticed the pattern of going by the books to take them, feeling numb and unproductive for any ounce to have a hobby, then when finding myself taking them less I would have bouts of actually wanting to do anything. But when I do go to my doctor's once every three months it tends to be the same thing and I'm likely back in my numbness state. All he ever does is to try increasing the medications.  It seemed to have worked with one sedative increased to help decrease the weeks worth of anxiety I've been experiencing but that's just one of the four that seem to actually work. Contemplating on experimenting to see how long I can go to tapper off my anti-depressants before finding myself needing them again, or maybe that I didn't need them for as long as I had and it went to waste.  Because I'm tired of feeling like everything is going nowhere, with this just being one contribution.
My parents kept asking why i dont care that much for my siblings and i have the urge to just yell out at them to think when's the last time i proactively cared and gave advice to my siblings. Coz the last time i did that nobody fucking cares and i just stress myself out worrying about other people's business. Then they call me selfish for only thinking for myself. Oh the things i would do to myself if i were as selfish as they think i am. They also kept saying that i have no reason to be so stressed out ever because i can still eat good food and sleep under a roof. It makes it so much harder for me to talk about my depression because i know they would never accept that i've been feeling like this for years. Everytime my parents call it felt like a gaslight session. I'm so afraid i'm growing to be scared of phone calls because i know i'll start crying again once my parents call
i don't feel much anymore. just numb. honestly i kinda miss the days where it was really bad. where it felt like i was constantly drowning. at least then i felt something.
I cut myself again after an argument with my brother and a failed attempt made by him to make me become Christian again
I fucking hate some people that are shitting on your lifestyle while NOT KNOWING ANYTHING about you. Geez. Coupled with my anxiety, the remarks cause me to spiral into this really dark circle where I feel meaningless and worthless.   Like I hate my brain too for making these remarks stick when they come from people I don't even care about.   Fuck these people who think they have all the answers while being complete messes themselves. No, you can't save me. In fact, your remarks just made my day 10000000x worse and made me feel like crap. I was doing fine! until that. Now I'm afraid of reaching out for help.
i feel so sad these days idk why. i don’t have any reason to be sad my life isn’t bad i have a job i have a family i hate feeling this way like somethings wrong with me. i go from crying to just feeling numb ugh idk
Advice is too confrontational. People who face my issues with this have no shame. Trying to overwhelm a force with a more powerful opposing force is the last thing I need since I'll just push them away. I just want time to mellow out and compassionate ears.
i've wondered many times before why i don't feel like doing anything to improve something - even if i clearly know that it'd be a benefit, it's not that much work - and after a quick google search of this feeling, maybe it's a bout of depression. or something.  i thought i was past the days where i felt depressed every day for months, i thought it was just waves of depression like my psychologist mentioned. but even if the depression hasn't been so in-my-face for the last two years... have i always had this depression just lurking in the back of these two years? when i thought it was over? and on top of my anxiety? oh my god.  i'm really glad that i've found a name for this feeling. or at least, a potential name. i keep berating myself for not doing anything, i keep telling myself, "why can't you just sit down and improve yourself like a normal person?" and that "you're such an awful human being for not improving yourself, when it's *so clearly* going to benefit you, how are you this stupid and lazy?"  i know i'm sounding really negative right now, but i think maybe this is a good thing, finally finding out what this feeling is. i'm not inherently lazy for not doing anything, or selfish for not improving, or egotistical or whatever... maybe it's my depression. whatever my depression is.
I've been doing well recently. Like, really well. Cut to today and I'm up at 6am, spiraling into a complete mess for no real reason.  Ugh.
My friends literally forgot to invite me to an upcoming birthday celebration within our friend group for 3 whole days.... I know I know, I should be grateful that I have friends that “kinda remembered me when they realised that the total participants and friend group size didn’t tally after 3 whole days”, but still, being the least well liked person in a group sucks.   Everyone around has someone to talk to and you realise you’re just there... in between their groups of 3 and 4... I think I rather be lonely by myself than be lonely surrounded by people. Worst of all, I act like I’m a happy go lucky person that’s not bothered by anything but I’m actually a sad mess. Just gotta know how to hid the SH away I guess :(
Feeling genuinely ill about the state of America tonight. Truly, in my heart of hearts I hope it works out, but I'm not optimistic
[deleted]
I realized that if I'll die someday and whoever is in my family who is still alive would be sad or whatever so it'll happen someday inevitably so what the fuck is stopping me from killing myself
I really want to kill myself. I feel like everything would be better if I was gone.
Had very first anxiety attack and got some new alters
Hey, I don't see a point in living anymore
I'm nonbinary and my boyfriend just said something that implied he thinks nb's don't exist and/or that their existence is inherently eyerolling and oh dear. . . :''')
Fucking kill me.
Tbf, that just sound like an asshole of a person. I'm sorry if she is your friend, but that is a pretty shallow and dishonest relationship. If she told you that you could talk to her  it's pure bs the way she treated you. It's so hard for people to truly open up, and I'm so sorry for the way she reacted. It is not ok to do this to someone. 😔
That's fucked up dude, I'm so sorry.
It's not your fault :( most people just don't know how to deal with people who are dealing with depression. It doesn't at all justify anyone lecturing you about it.
What's been bothering you?
I'm having this same issue. I went through some really bad stuff in my private life in June. While it was going down I texted two friends of mine that I've known for over 20 years. They were there for me in that moment but....  Neither one of them has checked up on me once. I've talked to them since and it's like it never happened. It's very frustrating. I'm the type of friend that would message you every so often and ask how you're doing if you're going through some shit. I expect the same.  It really hurts to know you're not valued and you're just inconveniencing friends you've known for 20 years.
Sorry to hear that. I know it can make things harder . I've learned the hard way more than once that it's not something they mean. It's said to make themselves better. This is why i trust no one.
When it was really shit last year I took a few showers a day cos I had an en suite in my accommodation. It made a change from tired numbness.
I’m very proud of you. I know I’m just a stranger on the internet but I know how hard it can be to even get out of bed some days.
I'm proud of you as well ❤❤❤
I feel you so well. Showered yesterday since 2 days, and changed my clotes too ( :   grocery i done last friday. Of course, it's nothing earth-shattering, but who knows what it is like, 30 minutes before the alarm goes off, is already awake and is afraid of the day.. They know how much energy you have to spend on everyday things..  Love you all
yup
I'm sorry you feel that you're dumping toxic garbage out here. It must be horrible feeling like you shouldn't speak here at all. I wish you could :( if you don't mind me asking, what makes you day that your problems aren't real or tangible?
I want to wallow in toxic garbage with you, so you will have some company. Let it spew!
I unsubscribed from this sub for the longest time because 95% of it is people complaining about how they have no friends and can't get a girlfriend. I'm in my 30's and can't really empathize with that.
Same
This is a place for people to vent and your feelings are just as valid as anyone else's. I am sorry things have been like that and I hope things get easier for you.
This! Seriosuly this is exactly how I feel. I don't know how other people enjoy each day. I want to do other stuff or enjoy things but it's ruined by just waking up everyday and working and praying for the next day off. It takes every ounce of energy to get uo and make it to work I feel I have nothing left.
Sorry you're feeling like that. :( I like your name by the way, it's my favorite flower! I hope you feel better soon. 🌻 💕
I dont think I've ever had a very good birthday in my life. I would have loved to have celebrated them more, but my childhood wasn't great and I didnt have friends in high school. It really shaped my birthday into an event I dreaded... nowadays I struggle to imagine any group of people wanting to celebrate something on my behalf so I just avoid it, lmao.  How did things get like this.
I have not celebrated a birthday with my family in some years and is becoming more of a normal day, nevertheless happy birthday
I always end up crying on my birthdays( atleast definitely have for the past 6 years minimum) so I kinda get you. Nonetheless, here’s to having existed so long, carrot-addict. I hope you get some carrot today(:p)
We didnt ask for this! Haha its funny and its not, ya know
This made me smile. It reminds me of some of the nicest days when I was at my lowest; hanging out with people I cared about even if leaving my bedroom was a near impossible task.
Great job! That's such a good feeling. You got this!
Getting treatment for a disorder does NOT negate all the work you did after taking medication. The effort, and the outcome are still authentic. Happy for you!
Hi u/mustardwall666 . I’m sorry you aren’t ok right now.
I see you❤️
happy birthday.
Homie, you dont even hold a candle of strangeness to crack heads I've met at work. What makes you feel out of your element?
People like you are what makes the world more joyful. It's like driving along a road where there's nothing but the same kind of plants and bushes lining the road and there you are, a big beautiful purple flower. And then you make someone smile an unexpected smile. :-) If you're having a good day and feeling confident shoot your shot man, people can suprise you. And if they turn you down there's a good chance out of the billions of other people, your person is out there somewhere. Be well.
Believe me, the things you think will bring you happiness rarely do.  Things WILL get better.
Spot on...
I feeeel this :( you're not alone
God I felt this in my soul.  I'm sorry you're going through this. I know it sucks. We're here for you.
Great job on getting some tasks done!
Just a hunch, but check out r/emotionalabuse
Or when I think I finally found a good friend, they turn out to only give me so much attention because they want to be romantically involved with me and don’t actually care about me at all...
Wow, that is SO amazing!
I hear you. I’m off and trying to get stuff done before the holidays, and I’m stuck to my couch.
Yes. It's way too much.
I just need to grab the wires and plug in my piano so I can practice but I just can't, every day I wish I could play.
Decluttering helps. Be patient with yourself, decluttering is HARD, rewarding, and worth it.
Oh my gosh i love this x) i need to do this. Thanks for sharing 💜
Good job setting up the psych appt, that is sometimes the hardest part.
I wrote the final 100-150 pages of my first novel while being so depressed I had suspended my studies. It was an escape, but it also became an outlet for my darkest thoughts and feelings. It was intensely therapeutic to finish. Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever finish another one.
Congrats! What changed?
I AM SO SO SORRY.   I get you. My psychiatrist is the only person who really cares. I see him every week and he’s the only person I talk to and have seen the face of in 4 months (via digital platform). I feel no emotional attachment to any real life friends, but i always feel reassured and comforted after a therapy session with him.   I know it’s like a once in a lifetime thing to find a psych/doc with whom you connect with and feel like they care about you. But grieve and then don’t give up. With telemedicine, we have access to far more people now. You’re not replacing him, his spirit will always be there for you, I am sure.   ❤️HUGS. I can’t imagine what I’d do if that happened to me but I’m terrifed because he’s older in  “high risk” for Covid.  I hope you eventually find somebody when you’re ready.
I’m sure that is excruciating. I tear up just at the thought of losing my therapist... I’m so so sorry!
100% I dont want to wake up, and I dont want to be awake.
[deleted]
absolutely. my friends call them depression naps, but i dont think they know how on the nose they r
Yep. Getting out of the cozy, safe bed in the morning is the hardest thing I do in my entire adult life and I have to do it every fucking day.
I feel the same way dude.  The same exact way.  No one gives a shit until you’re gone.
That's on them if they take people for granted.
I know that feeling. I often wake up thinking the day will be productive and good, then I get like one thing done and am drained or see something online that sours my mood
> because medical professionals think people who are "really" depressed or suicidal can't hold a job like that, so they don't take you seriously  Any medical professional who thinks that is seriously ignorant.   Depression is enormously variable and there are no ways that every single person with depression is impacted.  And high-functioning depression is a real thing, and people who are suffering from it deserve treatment as much as anybody else with a serious mental illness, even if they don't need as much help with instrumental needs.
I know several medical professionals who self-pay for therapist appointments so that the therapist doesn’t have to document everything the same way they would for insurance purposes... they do this out of protection for their careers of anything ever happened and mental health was called into question.   It should not be this way, but it is.
I get you dude. I am trying (being urged ) to go to college and I really just have no real aspirations or plans. Life has just become so boring
I'm happy for you that you hadn't self-harmed up to the time of your post, mysteriouspyramid :) I know about a month has gone by since then, according to Reddit, but it's never too late to tell someone something nice :)
The kind of tired sleep can't fix.
I’m fucking tired too. I feel like there are weights chained to my feet and I’m dragging them as I walk. The weight pushing down on me.
Yes. Me too. I am exhausted in my soul.
I hope whatever is going on works itself out. Stay strong friend.
Take care of your self ..this looks like a lot of toll on you...your past may or may not get caught up with you but this lifestyle is definitely hurting you..hope things get better
Same. I’m disappointed it didn’t.
sorry dude. fwiw I was always behind and always felt like I was on the verge of failing out (and did essentially fail 2-3 courses) but was still able to graduate. got lucky in some regards and eventually found something that worked for me so I ended up with a not-terrible GPA but the feeling of disaster was there all the way through til my very last exam.
nothing at all. happened to me, barely got by in four years. what's does your routine (if any) look like? \*i can assure you, my routine was worse\*
This started making me cry and I can’t really pinpoint the reason. Maybe it’s because it resonates with me and I’ve never been able to articulate it, and i thought it was wrong of me to feel this way. I don’t know what to say... I do hope it gets better for all of us.
yes. a recurring theme.
I felt this. We can struggle together lol
I feel the same way
Felt 100%. But apparently it gets better so i guess we’ll see
I just try and laugh at it. It works about half the time
At this point I think there’s something wrong with society.  And my depression is a reasonable response to it.
Relate.
I can relate to this so much. Just 2 months ago, I felt the exact same thing you did: I felt trapped, alone in a dark room, trapped in side my own head and thoughts.   While this is extremely scary, let me tell you this: you have recognized a major problem there. That this feeling of being trapped, is actually the way your brain convince you to feel. Your brain wants you to think that you are trapped, and you have no power to get out of it. But I believe this is not true, for a lot of people (I don't dare say this is the case for absolutely everyone)  What you need to realize and internalize right now, is that YOU are capable of change. YOU are the one in charge, not your brain. YOU are so strong to be holding on, even though it is so difficult right now. Just realizing that change is possible and you have the power in your hand to make that change happen, is the first step to conquering your depression.
im proud of you
I’m sorry you feel this way but I have to say, it makes me feel very comforted knowing I’m not the only one.
Dude, me too. I wish there was something else in my life that added meaning instead, but it feels like a whole lot of just going through the motions of being alive. I don’t expect it to get better any more, but the disappointment of what my life has become versus what I expected still hurts. And I don’t even have it that bad, which makes me just feel more guilty and confused.
Same with the job search.   Plus i'm dealing with a breakup and as a consequence of it all, now alcoholism too.  Man, shit is brutal.
Glad you were able to take that step, man. The job search is a painful deal and it's so hard to break yourself out of the mental rut, so things like that definitely count as victories in my book.
i won’t be happy anyway. i dont deserve people, relationships. i lack goals, ambitions, drive. i managed to spiral myself so hard since the beggining of 2020, i undid all my efforts of being normal again. all for nothing. and i dont even remember what i had done. memories are somewhere in this thick fog, i have vague recollection of some events but i cant remember snything in detail. my brain is increasingly becoming more and more useless. only thing its good at is in making me feel terrible, driving me to shitty habits and then dealing with consequences, rinse and repeat. im gone. im done!! i have nothing to live for. ive lost the fun in life anyway whats the point of me dragging this out for as long as possible. im alive for nothing. im just a shitty depressed insecure wage slave whos completely alone and doesnt fit anywhere in the world. i want to cry i want to release something out of my brain i NEED to FEEL something i am just nothing. its just nothing. but a heavy feeling about everything as if im tied down to giant boulders. im such a terrible person. im awful. i want to go. please family let me go. this life is unbearable. my life is a fucking joke. i am not normal. i will never fit in anywhere. i will always feel shitty and insecure and just fucking TERRIBLE LIKE I HAVE ALWAYS FELT IM TIRED OF IF
Also, I get that nobody owes me anything. But like I said, when you're used to one narrative for so long, you will do anything to try changing it and have some hope of a better ending than predicted. I wish I can speak to somebody about these issues, but the people who do care are dismissive and I cannot afford a therapist or trial-and-error for a good one.
I feel exactly the same. It finally got a little better with my self esteem and I thought I was ready to date again. I was wrong. Everything I built up is gone now and I feel worse than ever.
Happy Birthday dude. Your feelings are valid.
Happy birthday, my man! Break-ups are some of the hardest things you can go through in life. Take it easy on yourself.
Happy birthday! We're all here to distract you :)
You have a stranger, probably across the world,  cheering for you.
I'm sorry that happened to you OP. I wish that you'll reconsider therapy. It might help regardless of what she says. It's not weak to get help.
I feel this so much. I’m sure u have much more work than me but as a first year undergrad I already feel behind and overwhelmed and I’m going to bed late.
Keep going, you can do it!
I feel you, I've also been trying to get my shit together with meditation and therapy for years. It's really depressing that you can do everything right and still feel miserable. I guess all we can do is to continue fighting and hope for the best.
I’m so glad you’re reaching out for help <3  Please, never stop reaching out. It’s hard, and I hate it when people tell you to just “fight it” when you agree with the thoughts in your head, and the fact it’s a mental illness but your so brave for taking that first step  I’m proud of you :)
glad you're able to find some personal space that way!
This probably isn't much coming from an internet stranger, but you are worthy of love. Someone's gotta tell you since no one else apparently is. Thank you for sharing.
Same here. I always feel like I am not good enough, incompetent and worthless.
I hear that, I had months of days like this before they started to feel like something. Today most days are good, and even after a great day I can easily find myself laying in bed thinking it'd mighty grand to not wake up. But the weight has recently shifted towards more time feeling hopeful than not. I hope you will find the same happens.
I am seeing this.
I am seeing your post and I can identify 100%. I’m sorry though, Bc that means I know just how miserable you feel. I get it. SI is the worst. Do you have a therapist to talk to?
Have you ever tried online support groups? I do aca (adultcildren.org) and there's also one called LiveWell specifically for depression.
Good for you. I've only recently reached that state. It is liberating.
How do you achieve that? I wish I could exist in a mental state where my self worth wasn't tied to anyone but myself.
Hey I feel the same. And external things aren’t supposed to make us happy. Its all about the mindset. But there is a bigger issue and thats the whole dynamic of life itself. Why do we exist, who are we, why are we here, who created us, what is anything. And so many things remain unanswered. But for u, u need to he strong for ur kids. They need u. And u need to focus on things you have control over.
Relate to this. Sending some inner peace.
I totally feel you. I have an amazing family, great friends, a great job, a beautiful home, and honestly plenty of money to live a good life, and I'm still depressed.   My therapist always reminds me that depression is not logical, and that I don't need to have some sort of trauma to "deserve" to be depressed.
How long have you been taking them?
First of all, you ARE worth it and you are NOT irredeemable. I've been here - everything feels too overwhelming to contemplate. So just do one thing. Go into the bathroom and brush your teeth or shower. If you have to go back to bed for the rest of the day after, don't beat yourself up. You owe it to yourself to take care of your own needs, even if you are just going through the motions for a few days, even if you don't feel that you are worth it. There are people who will miss you and would be devastated if you were to leave. It's so tempting to give up, I know, but it does get easier if you take it one day at a time. I'm rooting for you!
I’m trying to be okay being alone as well.  Loneliness is safer, but loneliness is also really sad.  Deep in my chest sad.  Looking for relief.
I know this feeling. 😔 Fellow disposable here.
F#$k failure. Try to convince yourself it doesn't matter. Just keep doing what you want to do.
I’ve experienced this exact thing lol. It sucks. Wishing you well.
You are clearly on a downswing, and I don't know why it's happening in your particular case, but I do know from experience life is extremely overwhelming and sometimes unexpected factors can just set you off. I hope you will talk with someone about this, because generally as critically dark as it get's, most of the time there's something or some way to reduce some of the chaos.
oh man.. im here for this, and im here for u. it gets better, for us both.
I feel this in my bones and, although I know a lot of people out there are struggling, I’ve never heard/read this from anybody quite in these words, like taken out from inside my own head. Fading away is what I’d like to do as well, and most days none of my hobbies, friends, plans manage to tip the scales. I wish I could tell you it will get better and easier, I still hope so, we can hope together. Just know you’re not alone in feeling this ♡
I just can't believe how the holidays are still able to make us all feel somehow even worse this year. Somehow the corporations were able to make ads totally depressing and promote, for me, unrealistic ideas about holidays.  I don't have anyone supportive in my immediate corner either, even though I have a relative I live with. They spent the entire morning on the phone with a friend and are just ignoring me....
happy birthday!!
Everyone gets lonely, and many have burdens or a dark side they would NEVER share with others. I thank you for being honest. I'm sorry you're realizing your dreams aren't coming true. People will say you can do anything, but there are realistic limitations. I hope you continue living until you love yourself and possibly find others who love you too. At least until you're comfortable with yourself and what you do.
I love you, Im sorry you are feeling this way. I dont want to exist either and I think I would be too scared to go through with it but ive never tried because I also think I would just go through with it... what gives...
I was in exactly the same situation three years ago, ditto same. I wish I could help you not be as miserable. I eventually applied and went to a university I had hardly considered before, for a program that was the opposite of what I'd dreamt of doing. But just having finally gotten in anywhere made me feel not-worthless for the first time in years.  Once you get into a college/uni, even if its just your safety, it'll be a big burden off your back trust me. I realised (after a while) that it doesn't matter that much where you go, obviously some places are better than others but you can still manage.   I don't want to discourage you from your dreams or anything. In your position, all I could see was that so many people kept pursuing what they wanted and eventually got it. But no-one told me that even if you choose another way, you can still do well and learn to like it. Either way, I hope you make it out of that dark place.
It sounds like you are putting a ton of pressure on yourself
Please remember you're more important than work, and school and life. You need to put yourself forward every once in a while to make sure you're in a good place before you worry about everything else. There will be times you need to go when you're at 0%, there will be times you can sit back and relax when you're at 100%, they are very few and far between, but it's worth it. Hang in there, and take care of yourself. Even the smallest smiles can be the grandest gestures.
Please get help for you and your mom. It does get better.
Same. I've gone from 100% wanting to kill myself to maaaybe wanting to get some real help, as in telling my therapist I need more than just him.
Maybe we don't have to pretend. I feel like im acting out a scene 24/7, which is really bad for me because depersonalization always follows my worse episode. Honesty is hard, but I feel like its an act of self love. I just know I need to be more honest with myself before trying to do so with other people. Which is hard🙃
Yep, I just straight up lie to people when they ask how I am because I don't want to be a burden/negative with them. Sorry you're in this boat too. And happy cake day.
i feel the exact same way
Ugh, I'm so sorry. Hugs from a distance, I guess. Definitely share your feeling about going to the doctor.
You are not alone🥱😓
Well put... "withering away." those first few months of hermitting were kinda nice for me too, but now...
I’ve felt like this for the longest. Honestly what has helped me feel like I matter is really just interacting with ppl online. I know they may not ever see me so it gives me a little more confidence especially as an INFP-T I always wish to be validated and loved even if I feel as if I dont deserve it. But talking to ppl online like especially Twitter (tho twitter can be toxic but if u find the right ppl then it’s great) abt similar interests or just life or having a thread abt how you’re feeling and just life has really helped because ppl will respond now or later and honestly it’s just nice to talk to someone abt it even if u don’t see em. You said you daydream abt it which I actually still do but writing down my feelings on Twitter and my journal for more personal things has helped. Just know that I don’t think you’re pathetic and I really don’t even know you but honestly I really do relate and it’s weird how similar it is but yea I just want you to know that I think you really do matter even if that sounds kinda cliché and we’re both depressed but I always wanna say things will get better. They do I used to suffer from severe depression now it’s moderate so that gives me the want to get better.
I don't know you but I'm willing to bet you're not pathetic. I hope you keep on keeping on and if you can't, I understand that too
I'm sorry to hear that he said that, many of my friends are drifting away, or at least, don't really give a shit about me anymore. While I do have a few that I'm still able to confide in, this sort of majority almost seem like they decided to shut me out one day, not for any particular reason. Now I can barely hold a real conversation with them, since I barely know even what simple interests they have anymore, and I'm worried I'll do or say something wrong. I sincerely hope you find some sort of reconnection with some of them, or make new friends with whom you'll never disconnect. I painfully relate to what you finished with in this post. For a very, very long time I had thought I was a wimp for not harming myself, and I would year apart every piece of my interests, personality, and feelings instead. There was certainly a time where I didn't loathe myself, and there were way more that I did. I hope you find a support system with people who truly care, and invest the time into your friendship that you deserve. Obviously I don't know you at all. But I know that no one deserves to be alone. I'm not sure how this comment can help at all, but if this makes you feel even slightly better about anything, I'd say it was worth it to type all that. Everyone goes through their own shit, everyone thinks differently, and I'm not gonna pretend I know how to really help at all, but I know I would've wanted someone to show me some sort of support like this, so I figured maybe I should say something.
I hope she knows how lucky she is to have you.
Maybe she’s worried that she will lose you? I’ve had people who think that having suicidal thoughts means that you’re gonna take your own life. There are many of us with suicidal ideation but never go through with the final act. Some people can be too worried and anxious so they keep checking up on you.
Could she see you as a make-work project to fix? I've had so many people come and go in my life like that, they're basically all armchair therapists. It makes me feel worse, yet also feel used and worth so much less.
This is me right now. It’s nice knowing that I’m not alone.
I fucking hate myself for it
same v. same
Stop playing the victim card
(Hug)
I quit my job and worst decision of my life easy. Find something better while still working or dont quit!
Hey man don’t stress it . I know you got this
I know how you feel believe me i do.
[deleted]
There is no point. This can be liberating or very depressing. Try to make it liberating. Be the best person you can be and f##$ everything else.
Hey, i know this is gonna sound SO literally SO freakin stupid, but literally it's the solution (and yes that sucks i know it), but eh; try to find something to look forward to, something that makes you happy. And now u may think; could u pls shut up, i have tried this already, or; i dont want to, its so tiring. But really, i get it cuz im dealing with this shit too. The only thing we need to do is to; ... DO. Yep. Sounds so easy, but it isn't. Right now i am trying to find some new hobbies, or just do a few exercises a day, maybe u are creative, you can listen to some music, or make music, paint something, or maybe there is a series or movie that just makes you feel great, there must be something. Even if it is just lookin at the sun every day and feeling a sense of happiness and acconplishment. Try to find happiness in every small little thing there is. I hope this helps, and i hope u understand that i am trying to help u and wish u the best, cause i really do! Much love 💓
What do you do when everything in your life is going wrong. I’m fucking miserable and hate work, my personal life is complete shit, empty?
[deleted]
Hey, I feel you on feeling unheard. Is there anyone you can talk to in your personal life?  Just a heads up, though, *please* don’t cut  I’m not trying to make you feel guilty for feeling this way, but I’m saying from self harming in the past (not cutting, though.)  I never cut, but I would scratch myself up and down for momentary relief. It gave me that momentary release, but 0.5 seconds later I was overwhelmed with guilt and shame. Getting into the shower was rough.  But yeah, I totally understand you  Wish you the best <3
I'm the same way. I would love someone who I can just come to and just hug. Depression makes it seem like I can never have that. I want to end this loneliness, but feel incapable of getting rid of it. Your not alone
You got this.
Always nice to get a proper diagnosis. Opens up treatment options.
Sorry that happened to you, linnerz. One of the worst feelings.
I feel you. It has happened with me too. To me they are my friends but to them I'm just a  random person. I think they talk to me because they like me but well they just talk when they are bored or when their true friends are not around. I'm just not anyone's first priority.
same, its hard to not think about the past
You've probably already heard this (sorry if so) but writing out a mini-journal entry helps with me. Not really anything structured, I just rant into a notepad file for a few minutes and I'll often break down by the end.
Do you have a specific movie or similar that always makes you cry? It helps me a lot some times to start crying about something else but then I can usually let it all out once I've started crying.
Ah that sucks! Did someone insult you on here? If so I'm sorry that happened. I find that people can be mean on any subreddit. I was cyberbullied recently on a sub for people with autism because even though I have a diagnosis from my teen years it wasn't enough apparently and some people on there told me I wasn't autistic and to shut up basically. It can happen anywhere. But just know there are good people on reddit as well and not everyone will be like that. I've gotten some support on here. I've had to resort to visiting some other mental health subs for support during mental breakdowns and in the past, I have also been bullied on the suicide watch subreddit of all places. Some guy kept asking me to send him my pictures so he could determine whether I was pretty. Horrible stuff, on a support sub of all places. But that was a freak incident. If you're not comfortable staying on a sub that is completely understandable. But don't be discouraged.
Christ do I relate to that
Reading this actually brought tears to my eyes. Thank you for sharing. I'm dealing with a breakup, amongst other stuff, and you gave me a glimmer of hope.
Have you asked him what he needs? What you can do to help him?  I can't speak for him, but most people just want to feel supported. I wouldn't want someone to try and fix me, and I wouldn't want to be bombarded with potential solutions (if he asks that's fine, but in general unsolicited suggestions are a bad idea imo).   Not saying you're doing this, but don't push meds on him, respect his decision.
Exactly what it's happening to me. My online friends are finding new hobbies, new people and I was simply dumped by anything that became better than me. My offline friends became online friends in this pandemic. They left. Hobbies? I don't have mental strength for them. I tried to game today and I bursted out crying. I try to listen to songs. I sob like a baby. I go for a walk in circles in the land I live in and the sudden pain of loneliness eats me from inside. I'm suffocated, I'm tired, without perspective. Everybody leaves in the end.
Same. like I’m not suicidal I’d never actually kill myself because I’d never do that to my family but it would just be so much easier. I have nothing to look forward to in life.
I feel for you, I am in the same boat. I wish I could give you more comfort, but I just want you to know I feel what you feel.
Hi this is me and I’m 31. Does it get better??????
That must suck. Fuck those peopls
Yep sounds about right. Plus the crying. And the loss of appetite.
I wish there were something available medication wise for when we start going into a hole like that. People with anxiety can take instant-help medication for panic attacks, why isn't there something fast acting like this for depressive episodes?
Then go out and about with a forced smile on your face.
I kinda wish I never existed.
That's true what's the point of accomplishing goals when no one's there to watch you
Amazing, really. Keep it up.
Good job! Do you have. To figure out the purpose of your life? Maybe just getting by without alcohol ia enough for now?
I feel this so much
Feel the same. Also feel like I don’t deserve to throw away what I’ve been given. Immense guilt for staying alive and immense guilt for wanting to die
One thing that helped me get over my depression (at one point in my life) is learning to stop throwing self pity parties constantly, and set goals in life, and go through with those goals no matter the effort required. Depression won’t go away until you push it away. I hope this helps
> This is horrible.  Yes, and it's my constant state of being. Sorry you don't have school and stuff anymore. I always wanted to go to school but my life is all messed up...  Wish I had classes to go to though or work. I feel so worthless every day
From my experience my first therapy was very overwhelming and I blurted my heart out and felt pretty dumb honestly. BUT I gave it another chance with a new therapist and the first times I felt scared but I realized that I could talk really well with them! They asked the right questions, we concentrate on few things so I don't get overwhelmed and I don't feel judged when I talk to them. It has been a really positive experience! So for your first time just talk about things that are bothering you right now and only if you feel comfortable talking about it. Your therapist will help you to open up more session by session. You can also look at the sub r/talktherapy.   That sounds interesting! What genre is it? I started to read again a while back. I'm ready the count of Monte Cristo.
Happy birthday(: you are not alone❤️
sexual harassment is never the victims fault. i’m sorry that you’re going through this. i agree with a lot of the points you made, however.
im here for you,
same. its so unfair
Feel you
Sending hugs to you, i can relate so stay strong
I feel you, I get irritable as hell and then I just feel bad afterward that I lost my patience with people but I really can't help it in the moment as a side effect of one of my meds is irritability it's very hard to control and I used to be a very patient person...or at least I could act patiently.
I hear you. I’ve had problems w inertia setting in the past few days. I have to do major cleaning of my house but feel paralyzed. Hopefully we can push through. ❤️
Me too
I feel you. It just seems like endless waiting for things to get better. Only they never do. So you just keep waiting, watching your life tick by, and slowly losing hope that there will ever be a time when you don’t feel like this.
Today is also my first day posting, and my first day on this subreddit. It’s true that most people in the world won’t know you, or care about you. Isn’t that kind of freeing to think about though? That if no one is judging you or thinking about you the way you think they are, then you could conceivably do anything you really wanted to without worrying what people would think.   As for your partner, it’s hard to disconnect when the alternative is being alone. I struggled with that for a long time until I realized that I didn’t even really know who I was without someone else in my life. It wasn’t until I took some time to look inwards and be without someone that I realized more about what I wanted and needed both in life and in my relationships. My life is still hard, my brain likes telling me how much I suck, but at least the people I have around me now are there for support instead of tearing me down or making me feel worse.
I'm 19, turning 20 upcoming wednesday. I've been dealing with this shit since i was 15. I've had therapy for 3 years in the past and will start again soon. Because of this isolating quarantine and ontop of that got scammed big time and the police pretty much blaming me for the whole thing i keep getting the idea that i won't make it far. The urge and thoughts of killing myself get so tempting. And at this point living seems pointless since i'm spending the majority of my time trying to get out of this depressive state and preventing myself from ending my own life
Same. I'm 21 too.When I was around 15 i started to realize something is wrong with me but always thought its nothing or I would get better when I will get older but nothing changed i just  kept getting worse.
Hey, maybe try and take a nap then revisit the game. What game was it? I would really highly recommend celeste for a multitude of reasons. I used to love gaming and seldom play anything anymore, but celeste holds such a special place in my heart. It was very comforting in dark times, and helped me get through some stuff. Hang in there, sorry it's a rough go.
Nothing to add but I notice your pain. Can you talk to anyone to let them know that it’s worse then they think?
I'm not religious either, but I've felt this way since I was a teenager and bad things started an endless snowball in my life. I used to think to myself that I was "God's experiment", that someone out there was seeing how far a human could be punched down before breaking.
I hope they get back to you soon! A couple days could just mean a bit of administrative overload.
What do you think is causing this relapse?
Same
one small step after the other. Well done!
i feel the same way. im in the process of trying to make new friends because all my roommates are in school, and i did make one. but now i feel like im reaching out to him too much and that ill scare him away. all im holding onto right now is that therapy is tomorrow so ill finally be able to talk to someone
I’m with you.
I came into this group feeling depress but reading some of you makes me want to push you a little into holding on! I keep telling this to myself, someday things will be better... I wish you a nice day!
It probably hurts a lot right now, but you’ll be okay with time. Also may be a good thing in retrospect
Ironically, sometimes the things we most need our therapists (or other key people in our lives) are the hardest things to say.
Hi Max. I sincerely feel you. Please take some deep breaths and put on something on your laptop phone or tv to be mindless too and get cozy in a blanket, maybe make some soup or tea. You can get through tonight. I know you can.
Their problems aren't worse than yours, they're just their issues and not the ones you're facing. I've struggled with that for years when talking to friends, usually I hide my own troubles because I feel they mean less, or if the friend is lousy he/she had told me they were minor compared to theirs.  I've been avoiding all my friends for weeks now because my problems have grown so much lately I don't have the ability to empathize with them anymore. Or perhaps that little voice is right and I don't care to anymore, I'm not sure which honestly. I have flaky friends thanks to always picking real winners, so my concern for some of them comes and goes.  I'm glad both of us found this sub, it's about the only safe place lots of us have to vent.
Fun fact: it was.
i would
I wonder too if I dont need inpatient help at the moment. I'm not doing well at all. I dont know where to turn or how to cope. I have two cats but otherwise have no one.
I wish I knew the perfect words to say to you :'( I'm just thinking of you and hoping this burden you're carrying around eases and you find some peace.
Because it is
But it's illogical. I've been through this. It's just a bunch of fucked up neural pathways, right? And brains are very trainable, so I ought to be able to nip these spirals in the bud, think my way out of hell.  Be nice if that's the last time I ride this sketchy roller coaster
I’m in the same boat and actually is why I’m here. I’ve applied to no fewer than 100 jobs over the last year and can’t even get an interview. Friday, I found out the place I really want to work has a part time opening, but then today I found out they’re hiring through a career center who is only looking at at risk hires...like veterans, people with disabilities, people over 50, you get the point. So I think this one may go down the drain, too. I’m incredibly depressed and feeling like there’s nothing out there for me.
your artwork is dope as hell dude, you can definitely turn that into a living. signed, someone else also lost on the path of life
Yeah...  edit: are you interested in working?
Just remember that it always turns around eventually, and you should probably get some sunlight and fresh air. Do you have someone you can reach out to, or a physician/therapist you should alert that you're doing downhill?
Well the paragraph above is a start right? I understand what you mean from what you wrote. Maybe putting it into words will help you be able to communicate it to your therapist?
I always imagine my "describe how I'm feeling and why" as if I am going to say that to a therapist, and usually that helps me call out my own bullshit. Like, what would someone else say if I offered this up as the explanation?   For the record, I've only had 2 experiences with therapist through my decade or so of chronic depression, and I felt the same way you're describing for both sessions.   I definitely don't want to discourage you from going to see someone, just sympathizing with the idea of wanting to be able to describe things first.. the other thing to remember is that talking to someone (anyone) can be a huge help fleshing out ideas/thoughts that you can't fully wrap your head around by yourself. Even if you're just rambling.
I feel for you. I feel the same.... thank gd for Reddit.
Same
❤️
Bro forreal this job market is hot booboo garbage. Every application feels like a desperate hail Mary. Our culture is dummy sexually tense and puts enormous pressure if you haven't been laid in a while, I cant even imagine how you feel but is there really anything inherently wrong with being alone? Idk that's just how I see it. Most Uni girls wanna do dumb cliche garbage anyway, like "drink tequlia" or "go on adventures" the fuck does that even mean?  I swear life is a long-winded joke
that's great!Shows signs that you are improving! I'm also trying to improve my situation little by little, even if it seems like it doesn't matter.
Stay strong :( I'm another job seeker who understands the pain. You're worth more than your employment status so treat yourself better than those people did.
Interviews for sure are the worst thing on the world. Try to think 'fuck this guy' that helps me to forget bad interviews. Also searching for a job and it sucks really uwu
I'm glad you realize you're struggling and getting help. Maybe you can get the meds delivered by the pharmacy or by someone else? Or pick them up? Going cold turkey when u just started and sounded like u need them isn't the best idea. Grad school probably has a counseling center or something you can reach out to, also ask professors for extensions or what to do. You can make a routine/schedule when you're feeling better, it's easy to get caught up in negative cyclical thinking, especially in this subreddit. ChAoS happens, and life doesn't tend to end up how we want, we can only learn from such mistakes. And sometimes mistakes are happy little accidents-bob ross. A lot of people have high expectations try can't reach, you're not alone. Having some sort of panic attack or whatever that death thing was sounds pretty serious. Good luck! Keep tight t hope and take care of yourself.
Pour water on his head and send him away 🙂
It makes you stronger than them. Keep fighting!
You deserve to exist and things will get better. Right now is only temporary.
Even though I dont know you, I'm so proud of you! Steps  like these are everything <3
This comment spoke to me on another level. I'm proud of you!
And anger too. Let's not forget that.
You're in your 20s... It will pass. Can't say it will get better but you'll recognize your father is a human, not a hero. Your advisor, you'll still hate him, but you'll realize he's just a coward and a sociopath. Can't fix him but still hate him.
Hugs from fellow recovering slowly from depression.
Hi friend! Well, we are strangers, but I live in West Virginia too, so we’re Appalachian friends! I’ve lived here my entire life. I have identified as gay and cis in the past, and they still stand, but I have questioned some labels. I also deal with chronic depression that is untreated. I empathize with a lot of your pain and have been in periods where I thought in similar ways. I still have doubt and fear and anxiety over every aspect of my social relations, and it leads me to question everything. It’s so hard. Something I’ve tried is being really honest with my peers when my depression symptoms are particularly bad, and with those I feel are able to discuss, I bring up specific thoughts or worries or feelings my brain has when presented with different scenarios. I always make a point that they situations, or “dots” are real, but the connections are my own, and the other person likely has made connections as well. I own the connections I’ve made and hope to discuss why they were made.   From a fellow West Virginian, your life is important. These times are hard, and the circumstances that brought your here are likely taxing to consider, but you’re here. You are at this point despite all the baggage that’s been added to your back. That shows resiliency, strength, and courage, even if it’s hard for you to see it. It was hard for me to see it to. :)
Don’t give up. Keep trying. Do something for yourself when you’re feeling down
I'm in third year uni and I have found myself in your position time and time again. I start the semester off strong, then get lazy/depressed/apathetic on the first round of evaluations and bomb everything. Then somehow I manage to pull myself for the second half to pass my finals. I don't really know how I do it, but so far I've only ever failed 1 course. Once that fire is lit under your butt and the pressure is on, you just end up pushing yourself to succeed no matter what.
Best of luck to you man, I'm in a similar situation. Right around this time i also fuck up. didnt complete my 3rd semester around this time a year ago, so i went on leave and now im trying 3rd semester again, just now starting to fall behind again. might just end up leaving altogether, but im only really studying so my family wont think im a failure.
Yeah I'm 23 and have to deal with the fact that my mental scars probably will never go away
I hope you feel better with your leg, that really stinks. I know how it feels to not wanting to take care of yourself,  I have to force myself to even bathe each day. Big hugs
No wonder you lashed out like that. Talk to a pro instead of burdening me
I feel you and wish you luck
I feel the same. We will get there though. It'll be tough but we will end up stronger. I believe in you!
I’m sorry, but I completely understand your feelings, if we were friends irl I’d love to celebrate your birthday with you.
Hey birthday pal. I’m turning 40 Tuesday. No plans.
Happy birthday! I'm turning 30 on the 15th and I feel like I don't have anyone special to celebrate with. I actually don't even have the energy or the joy to want to celebrate.  No party mode just in depressed zone.
I'm so sorry about your cat :(
My deepest condolences.
Sorry to hear/read it. Obviously there is nothing I can say that will remove your pain...there is one tiny glimmer here: Your cat is not suffering at all.
You may need to talk to HR. They aren’t necessarily on your side but get it recorded that you have told them about it.
I get this. Obviously I live a different life than you and feel different things than you, but I still get this. Not too long ago my therapist did an EDMR session with me and one of the realizations I came to was that I just need to share more with the people around me. I keep it all to myself usually, and it all builds up and gets distorted and dark and lonely. But I started talking about some of my depression and anxiety with other people, and not only did they not hate me for mentioning my problems and issues, but they also gave their perspective and sometimes their personally gained advice. And if they couldn't do that, and if they didn't understand what I was going through at all, they still listened. It helped. It felt good. I started to feel less isolated. I started to realize that it's ok to share with people. People around you care about you, and it's not wrong to share with them. It is NOT WRONG to share with the people around you. Even when they don't understand what you are going through at all, it doesn't change how much they care about you. People deserve to be heard. What people have to say, what they are feeling, is worth something. It's important. And it is not wrong to share.   That's just something I've learned after many years of suffering
I actually have interest in data science and I want a data science job but there are no vacancy in data science field for fresh graduate in my country. If there's job opening in data science field, it always requires minimum 2 years of experience. am I wasting my time learning data science? Because I get literally nothing from here. Nothing.
One thing I know is you’re not a loser. I promise.
I don't think that's selfish. You have every right to want to live for yourself and not for everyone else. It's your life, you should get to live it however you want. But I know it's easy to say...  I keep trying to escape reality too, I wish I'd never have to leave my fictional worlds. I only ever feel like myself when I'm pretending to be someone else.
You could vent to me.  I spend tons of time playing videogames and I don't even like them anymore, but they're less effort than working out or drawing or something, and when I'm focusing on getting more XP or beating a boss or winning a match or progressing to the next area then I'm not thinking about how much my body and mind hurt. I used to read for the same reason, but my attention span is too far gone for that anymore.  I work a manual job so I can keep busy and not think about life then I go home and play video games and sleep so I can avoid thinking about life.
Ah the "sweet spot" of depression. I'm getting back there myself. It's nice to be productive in one thing at least.
I was starving myself for like a full year because I love how it made me feel, I think maybe I was running on adrenaline or something, but I felt hyped as fuck, really energetic, and sharp sort of often (never happened before I started or after I quit). Sort of felt like I was running on rage.  Be careful about a year after I completely lost all sex drive or sexual attraction I ran out of weight to lose and I started losing time and getting shakes and feeling super weird. It's dangerous B, stay safe out there.
same. are the cheekbones worth it? we’ll see
There is a therapy trick called de-fusion, have you heard of it before?  Here’s a quick link, hope it helps.  I’m sorry you are suffering.  https://highfocuscenters.pyramidhealthcarepa.com/what-is-cognitive-defusion/
I am in the same boat re: job. I’m paralyzed and not applying to anything bc scared my past will repeat itself, I’ll panic and drop the ball.
I hear you - I am an artist too but everything I make has been awful lately. I just can't focus for very long. Have to turn a piece in for a show in 2 weeks and I don't want it to suck! A little bit e ery day even if only 30 minutes or so - we get closer and closer.
Im the same way. I dont talk to people. I sit in my room all day and sleep. And when I forced to socialize( through school, work, etc) I come home and am EXHAUSTED from the day. I find myself asking God to just take me during the night because I dont see what my purpose is. I do understand what you mean though. I have RSD( Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria)  mainly because of my adhd. Nights like tonight are my worst. It happens to all of us that we at some point and time cause happiness in some people. Whether they laugh, smile, or just show that you brighten their day is the reason I keep going. It helps me to know that sometimes I can help/make a difference in people. Although its not the healthiest way, I see peoples happiness more valuable than mine. I also want to disappear at times. Or fall asleep and never wake up. But seeing smiles on other peoples faces is always worthit in the end for me. Ya just need to find the 1 or few things that you want to stay and work for. For me its people in general. I have no friends. I moved out of my parents a few years ago. And I work as a cook at a restaurant. I love hearing how people said how good their food was and they occasionally leave me tips. Makes me feel good I can make others feel good. Too much about me though. Just keep swimming as dory once said. You'll see things that you will want to stay for. ❤
Yeah. Normally Saturday is my day but I work Saturdays. And college is tough. No free time. Sucks. I hate early adulthood.
me neither dude. it’s fucking exhausting. i don’t hate my job but at the same time i really fucking hate it. if you can afford it, maybe take a week off to do the things you want to do.
Man this is sad and difficult, feel better
and that fact that there are so many people that have NEVER felt this feeling is fucking insane. THE AUDACITY
Second para describes me well. And im sure if I saw u irl id be like “omg she has a job and has her life together here’s me with nothing being a waste of space.” Cause thats how i am. But we gotta stop thinking about ourselves this way. Its straight up bullying. Its not good to be self critical especially during a pandemic. You have a job. You are making bank. Ur alive and breathing. U just being here and sharing this post helped someone because its so relieving to see that everyone feels this way. So thank you for sharing. And I hope tomorrow is a slightly better day for you 🖤
I read this and I care. But I probably can't help because I'm just another random depressed person on the internet. But I hear you.
My ex literally made me want to be alive. Like I am alive but dead inside. And u need to not depend on him for ur happiness. Try to focus on u. Try to do u (literally).
Sounds like our moms are similar. It's not fair to force something on your child to the point of emotional breakdown. I cannot wait for you to make your own choices when you get out.
I relate to this. They're not respecting boundaries. You feel the need to control your space because, well--it's your one space.   I don't know how long it will be until you move out but the one thing I regret not doing to calmly and clearly expressing how violated I felt by my family. My family is too emotionally immature to respond positively to any form of honest communication, but not all families are. It's worth a shot and even if you don't think it worked it might open their minds to your feelings later.
What was it and why did you have to give it up? I’m sorry that you lost one of the things that brings you true happiness.
I've been there, it is soul destroying. What was your hobby and why are you having to give it up? I'm so sorry.
I won't be that person and say you should absolutely continue living because I don't know you or your problem personally. But please, before you go, consider doing this 1 thing: listing the things that make you unhappy right now, list them all out. Then go over each of the things, and think hard about what YOU can do, in your control and power, to rectify those things and work toward that. At least try this. This is what got me out of it.
I feel the same way.  Being a human just isn’t for me.
Memory loss can be connected to depression and especially lack of sleep. It may be helpful to talk to a therapist or doctor about it.
I feel like I'm going insane. My symptoms are getting scary. My mind is racing constantly and I've been talking to myself. I've been getting deja vu. Forgetting things after they've just happened.
Omg, yes. This so much. I used to think I have memory problem and even consider going to the doctor. But as others have mentioned, memory getting worse is a common symptom of depression.  Don't be scared, you're normal (but going to the doctor to make sure is encouraged and helpful)  The first step is to conquer or learn to cope with your depression. Once you've done that, I think your memory should improve along with your emotional well-being.
It's a symptom, yes  I have it and it's so hard remembering things, absolutely annoying and horrible
I don't mean any offence, but how long have you been suffering from depression/struggling with these issues? For most of us it's a long-term thing. It's unusual to see such a quick turn-around.
hey man.  I feel the same exact way.  Especially about the family and room mate stuff.  It feels like no one gives a shit and it sucks when you've been trained to be so caught up in others relation to you.  Especially recently, things are so abnormal.   people have been telling me to get a hobby and stop caring what people thing, but my anxiety is so limiting.  Everything feels 10x harder than it should be.  its hard to enjoy the day to day recently.  let me know if you need someone to talk to!
You are not alone my friend stick in there ☺️
I'm kinda used to do much disappointment I'm number to all of that
i hope youll b ok ily
i wish you luck. i love you
please take care of youself. you matter
It's hard to say, people go about it in different ways. Some take DMT or some other kind of psychedelic drug, others read and meditate, then there is us who just go about their day wondering what the point of it all is. Just know that there is ALWAYS a chance for it to get better.
&#x200B;  >They said depression is about loneliness but mine isn’t.   >   >Mine  is like a big gaping wound in my chest. A void that doesn’t fill. It  doesn’t get better when I’m socialising, being around friends and  family. If my depression isn’t about loneliness then what’s the cause of  it?  Well, I'd like to say a couple of things. So socializing doesn't mean you don't feel lonely. I read somewhere that there are people who are alone, maybe reading by themselves, etc., who don't feel lonely...and there are people in giant gatherings, even with people they know and they feel lonely. Loneliness in *internal* not external. It's like you can be lonely in literally any situation. You can be isolated regardless of who is around you. It may be because your experience is different, or you can't connect with them somehow, or there is something missing. But loneliness can be anywhere and depression and loneliness are friends.  Second, I totally get the void thing. You can absolutely have depression for reasons beyond loneliness. It can be chemical, it can triggered by a social situation, it can be discouragement? (if that's a word), it could be just triggered by let downs, break-ups whatever. It can be triggered by things you may not even notice, or just a build-up, but it could be just as much loneliness that you can't explain either. Seems to me like literally *anything* can cause depression, but I think that's the problem.
> Trying so hard to take the advice of the doctor but he says stuff like  “you don’t have to fix everything. Maybe just worry about this one  thing.” I can’t stop worrying about “everything” and have absolutely no  motivation to fix this “one thing.”   God I get that. It's not like you can just flip a switch and stop, right? When I'm still able to keep from tumbling into the abyss, I try to "bucket" things into like "critical" and "less critical" to worry about, if that makes sense?  > I know I should be happy for all the things I have but that’s what makes  it worse. I just feel guilty. I’m lonely but don’t want ppl to feel  sorry for me. Just useless to everyone.   This reminds me of the 1st world problems vs 3rd world problems guilt. The way society treats it is BS, because just because you *could* have it even worse, doesn't mean your situation doesn't suck. It's like saying someone is "only" a paralyzed from the waist down, could be worse and they could be completely paralyzed....But like, a struggle is a damn struggle. You deserve the right to feel the way you do, and your pain is valid.
take comfort in the smallest things. and when that doesn't work... remember it gets better. this is shit, but u just gotta survive the next little bit, and then it will get better. i know it sounds hard to believe... but it's kinda a blind-faith sorta thing. it will get better. it will.
Awesome! Enjoy it!
Hey anything you wanna talk about? I won't say I'm good at advice but I can listen.
Giving feels so good to me too, especially as someone who also feels guilty. It makes me feel like a better person. I'm glad that you're doing better this Christmas, and hope you have a lot of fun.
Bro that sounds wild, was he hydroplaning on the ice or did he just lose control?
I wish I had the courage to do this
Maybe it’s not about sticking around for others. Maybe it’s about sticking around for you and the things you like to do. People are shitty, fuck em.   But if you’re gone you’ll never get to finish that video game, or see the leaves grow on the trees after winter, or have ice cream.
Perfect
I didnt think seeing someone would help, but im 4 sessions in and its incredible the ways it has helped me already! Give it a try, Ive pushed everyone away as well, but in the end the real ones will still be there
Pssst ssk there is no shame in taking a break. Burnout is super real and this year has been exhausting in a lot of ways. Emotionally, mentally, and physically, stress affects the whole lifestyle and mood. It's okay to "do nothing" for a few hours, or days, even weeks if that's what you really need. When it's raining, there's no point in starting a fire outside, it's just going to fizzle out, ya know? I'm sure you'll find a wellspring of better days later on in the year. Best wishes. It's a new day!
One tomorrow it will be better it may be this tomorrow or another down the line. Time.
you've put into words what I haven't been able to the past week. right there with you.
I would like to hear your thoughts man share it
I feel you although I don't have a PhD (I think you're awesome for getting your PhD). Sadly, I feel that no matter how much effort I put in, they don't translate into actual success. I wasted a lot of money on a fancy Bachelor's degree only to find myself underemployed. I'm a bit hesitant to go back to get my Master's now. This is such a messed up world
I really felt this. I’ve been there; but it’s about living for yourself, not for the person everyone else wants you to be. What do you want to do with your life? What makes YOU happy and fulfilled? In the end, people are always going to have expectations of you, but nothing will fill that void unless you make decisions for yourself; not them. I know the feeling of constantly working to satisfy others, and feeling lost when you constantly feel like you’re falling short of that bar. You’re doing your best; but you can’t live for other people. I know it’s easier said than done, but you don’t have to act like you’re okay. Crying isn’t anything to be ashamed of. It’s okay to have emotions, and to be sad, even if you don’t want to be sad. You’re not letting anyone down by being sad; you’re letting yourself down by not allowing yourself to be. You’re not alone.
Same. Hope you're doing alright
Scotland? As a highlander I get that druggys at 3 am climbing a mcdonalds
feeling this right now. much love, hang in there <3
there are online services like talk space that will get back to you much quicker if you want to try
WAIT SHIT DONT HANG IN THERE
please dont. do you wanna talk??? I'm depressed too and goddamn my best friend died a while ago and please hang in there.
It feels good after shower!!!!!!
Don't know about here but toastme is good for support and compliments on anything, even if it is small. not specifically depression related or anything, just kinda the opposite and nice version of roastme
Being kind, considerate and patient are definitely not the bare minimum of nice! You are being too hard on yourself. I'm not surprised though given that your girlfriend seems to be dismissive and noncommittal. I take her point about loving yourself; I suppose you can't look to others for validation but, if somebody loves you, they don't usually show it by forgetting about you, pretending you don't exist and telling you you'll always be less of a priority than somebody else. You deserve somebody who thinks you're wonderful even when you can't see it yourself. We all do.
I am asian and my bf is Mexican and his family is definitely more open and accepting than mine. My dad never accepted anyone I dated and it led me to sneak around behind his back. It destroyed my HS relationship bc he felt really insecure about not being able to meet my family and me having to hide our relationship. So I can see where she's coming from. Its really hard to be with someone when your family is so judgemental and unaccepting. My current bf understands that I can't control my family's behaviors but it still affects him that he's not welcomed by my dad, so I also understand how you feel. His mom was really offended too because she feels like she accepted me with arms wide open yet my family can't accept her son the same way. But its important to understand that your girlfriend has no control over how her family behaves and what her family thinks of her and of you. There is a lot of pressure in asian households to put the family's reputation over your own happiness. Its not right, but its the way it is unfortunately and its really hard to break away from it. I finally decided my well being needs to be my priority, and I got cut off. It may seem like a good thing, but when I was exiled from my family it felt like I lost my entire identity. And it still feels like I have a massive hole in me that only my family can fill and no amount of love from my bf or his family can fill it. I wouldn't pressure her to tell her family. Only she knows how her family is, how they will react, and when the right time is. If she rushes it, she may be severed from her family and there will be an emptiness that no amount of love from you will be able to fill.
I relate to this so much. I love that empty-headed feeling I get when I’m really high, like I can’t do anything but relax and laugh and enjoy the things around me. And then with sobering up comes all the thoughts and negativity. Lord knows how much money I’ve spent on weed during this pandemic to dull everything down so I can exist.  I don’t know what the right answer is to help with this; I’m still trying to figure it out myself so I can learn to enjoy life while sober again. (And you didn’t ask for an answer or solution anyway!) But I just wanted you to know that you aren’t alone in your feelings and experiences.
Its great that you were honest, i feel like we’re entitled to it honestly. Im sorry you dont feel welcome, home is so tricky :/
Hold on! It’ll go back up again at some point, inevitably, just as it goes down :)
I've experienced that at times.  For me, it seems like it happens when we're so wounded that any touch is painful.  I.e. it's the psychological equivalent of a physical wound where the touch of the doctor treating it makes it hurt more in the moment.  Doesn't mean that kindness isn't doing you any good imo.  ::hugs::
Yikes.  I'm so sorry.  Being undermined that way by your partner has to hurt.
If only it could be convinced away. I’m sorry you had to hear that.
Maybe this is not great advice but I’ve learned when I’ve been in positions like you are now that you need to be selfish. In the sense of yes you are having panic attacks, and there is nothing wrong with wanting to choose your health over continuing what you’re doing(aka work/video meeting etc) I’d suggest maybe emailing your boss asking for a day or two off because of mental health? There’s no guarantee you’d get it but it’s worth a try. Don’t even think about things like people having “real problems” it’s something that sets us back, our mental illnesses are real problems and they don’t need to be visible to be serious or need to be fixed. In truth my words won’t really help, a doctor or reaching out to a loved one will do much better. What helped me when I was like this was trying a different goal a day, could have to do with doing anything. Felt like I accomplished something and everything wasn’t spinning out of control when Ive done that. I deal with this shit everyday as well, it’s a constant adventure, I’ve always found advice from someone as easier said than done but those are just some ideas.
hey, your not alone, and I know how that feels :((  I hope you know your really important. I often think about how easy it is for us to downward spiral in these thoughts and I often find myself thinking what would happen if they were the opposite.  You can be whatever you create for yourself , and fu** anyone else's standards. Live by your own rules and beliefs . I know every day feels unbearable and the same, but who knows maybe last week you felt better than you do now , and I know it takes time but imagine getting to that spot and being strong enough to look back because I know YOU can do it !!  You are enough!! (I'm sorry I dont make sense I'm not good at making ppl feel better but I'm rlly trying ;-; )
>Everyone here has actual problems. I’m privileged but lazy and unmotivated.   Fuck, I feel that. I guess the technical answer is that even though it just feels like we're lazy and unmotivated, it doesn't mean there's no an actual real problem we have too... but it's really hard to make myself believe that. Best of luck.
Everyone has problems on their own level. Sure, others may have it worse than you, but your problems ARE problems to you, so don't feel like they're not valid.
I feel you. I’m in a good place despite the pandemic. In fact it was a blessing in disguise if I’m being totally honest. It has helped steer me to a path I am content with.  But still, I’m suffering. There are days when I feel like running away or hiding from everything. I cry a lot for someone with no real problems, and I’m so so frustrated.
Omg yes. When you say "programming" wdym? For me it's the need to interact with other people and experience love etc because all it's doing is hurting me and without it I could actually function in society happily.
Same. Only thing i like about the corona thing is that its accepted to wear a mask to hide my face
I know how that feels. You’re doing amazing! You deserve a break.
Youre not wasting their time man. Congratz on the paper sounds amazing to do. Take a break you certainly deserved it.
you're feelings are so valid. i've had the same thing told to me all throughout my life, and i always believed I was just dramatic and took things too far in my head. but ive accepted recently that anything that's happened to me in my life, no matter how big or small, are problems if they make ME feel sad or less worthy. they don't understand what WE feel. don't let stupid selfish people tell you what you can't feel. other people do not get to define what can hurt you. i love you and if CBT isn't working  that's okay, it's not for everyone. but there are plenty of other ways to combat depression and please never give up. there is always light at the end of the tunnel
I know what you mean. The pit is always deeper and colder than you remember.
I dont see it as petty. I see it as being tired. I have been there multiple times even within the last 2 years. It is okay to be upset by it and be tired by it all.   I know it sounds silly, but you should still celebrate. It is a special day. You should make it a special day. Whether it is with friends going for a walk or sitting somewhere beautiful with them you should do it. If it is just you going somewhere that means something to you, you should go.  &#x200B;  Whatever you do... Happy Birthday
I’m so sorry you feel this way. Is it possible you can start looking for new job options at some point? Life is too short to being feeling so awful at a place we have to spend so much of our time. I know it feels like we are trapped into jobs sometimes but there is always a way out.
That's how I feel. I have nothing to be sad about at all but I'm sad and down. I know just how you feel. It sucks..
I feel the same.
Plus I have a cat who's older and has kidney disease and it's only a matter of time even while she receives treatment. I try not to think about it but it hurts when I see her and know that we have to let her go sooner or later. She's my last pet I've had since childhood.  Received a call not long ago for the prescriptions and wondering if it's worth it if she would only to continue for \*however knows how long and in pain.
There are vids on YouTube about autism and how people cope with it. Even if you aren't diagnosed you may benefit (or simply be entertained and distracted) from watching some of those channels. There are a few autistic youtubers out there that do just this, and if you think you share similarities, they might be able to share suggestions.   *Also, your autistic vs. "healthy" is a pretty mean outlook, even if you don't mean it as an insult.
It's strange but yeah my depression is at its lowest at night even though I'm not doing anything too different
Now my eyes fucking hurt from crying.  I want out of this job honestly but it's not like I can just abandon all responsibilities and leave all my fuck ups.
I’m with you. I hurt someone I cared about as well. It’s times like these I really wish I can have a time machine. Words said out of anger are words that can never be forgotten nor undone. A moment of weakness always play a bigger role in our future then moments of strength. I hope the person you hurt can look pass the pain and learn to forgive you. Blessings.
Taking one day at a time helps sometimes. I hope you have a better day when u wake. Blessings.
Before I say anything else: YOU did not ruin your life, that man did. You may have made some bade decisions afterward, but that is a fucked up place to be in, especially if you never talked to anyone seriously about it after. All you can do is focus on moving forward.  Sometimes when we're at a low point we just have to focus on staying alive and making sure we (and the kids)  eat, sleep, and shower. So don't feel too bad about losing interest in video games or other hobbies for a little while. Do what you can to stay afloat, and consider seeing a therapist for ptsd or childhood trauma or something. Not every therapist is the same so you might have to try a few, but it's worth it.   Once you feel up to getting some sunlight and taking a walk, do that. And if that's all you can manage, just keep doing that. Or if you're up for something more in a month or so maybe figure out a club to join or some kind of arts/crafts/gardening/language class you can take.  Things can get better, and there are good people out there to make friends with. Just use some judgement and make sure the people you bring into your life are going to be positive influences. You can do this.
I feel for you man...and No you did not let it happen to yourself...to be in such a situation and coming out of it is brave enough ...take care of your son and mom..if shes gone shes gone ....cant do anything about that ..but you have been strong before her ...and i think you can be better again without her...just take 1 day at a time ..you will get through this
This vulnerable pain you are feeling is exactly what I am feeling. You just conveyed my feelings onto paper. You seem like a beautiful soul. Your post broke my heart and made me cry. Im not sure what I can say to make you feel better as I'm sure that nothing I can say can. But I know exactly how you feel. You are not alone you beautiful angel. I too have loved with all my heart and I feel like it is bleeding. All I wanted was to love him and for him to love me back.
Happy birthday - your not a failure. You have value
Every day when you wake up, you get a choice, an opportunity, and a battle. You either choose to have a great day or lose one, you get the opportunity to start over or keep following the same patterns. You get a battle of; am i gonna keep laying in bed, or am i gonna get up and have an amazing day and try my best? Tell yourself your day will be great, and everytime u are battling between yes or no, just do it. Try to do lots of things that take little energy and or time but give u some sense of accomplishment. They will get you through the days. Example; read 3 pages daily, (its just 3 but still you did it which makes u feel great) do 10 squats (done in seconds if u do it quickly, and u still get that sense of accomplishment), just eat some good food, and try to see happiness in the smallest things like; the food ur eating, the sun that's shining, the clothing u have. It may sound stupid but actually, it does help, for me at least. So try it out if u want. Maybe u already tried so and u think; nope. But really, keep trying. I wish u the best. 🙏
Y
It's all about finding the balance of WHEN you can be needy with a person. Obviously if you start out that way in a very new relationship, that's going to turn most people off. But if you focus on just being present and being your own person for at least a while, you may well find that you end up with someone who also craves companionship and validation. Just take it slow and be honest
Hey i understand u, and i am sorry that u are feeling this way, but remember that every day is a new opportunity. Every day that you wake up and get out of bed is an accomplishment already. These times will be over, but you gotta win that battle within yourself every time, and that is extremely tough. But i believe in you! Sometimes you dont need motivation, you just need to ask yourself; why am i not doing this? Can't i just do it? It isn't so hard actually right? And then u do it and u will feel a great sense of acconplishment which motivates you to do even more. I hope this helps u. 🙏
Dont show emotions ..take your tears back ..keep those feelings inside and grow up a maniac - my life
I was once in a phase where I would constantly 24*7 think about killing my self...then i really tried every day to distract my self and i dont know what worked but im out of it now ....i hope it gets better for you too.
Ikr thank god I don't need to pay for my meds, otherwise I would have totally not gotten help at all...   The meds worked well for me but I'm worried that once I'm off them, I will be worse off (my original state).
My mother told me I was a mistake that she decided to keep. That made me feel wonderful. Not.
Hey, I can totally relate to that. A phone call, even a text makes me anxious af lol. And my mom told me that "If you have anxiety, just don't be anxious." LOL  I hope you feel better soon
I have this too, I can’t get myself to focus on the present. I’m too focused on the future which makes me procrastinate on the ‘now’.
Man up? Wow, tell em to fuck off. That's just our culture's hypermasculinity  talking. Cant show emotion, need to be muscular, blah blah blah. Sure, plenty of people got it worse than you, but it doesnt invalidate the shittiness of your problems. Dont even worry about putting a label on how you feel because you're not a doctor. If your "friends" tell you that hogwash when you genuinely try to reach out for help they can all suck an egg and you can take solace in your loneliness knowing the shittier alternative.
You're gonna need to see a doctor to get a script. If you can hold out until you get that insurance, go for that.  You may be able to get the script from a telemedicine visit, since depressive and anxiety disorders are diagnosed through conversation.  Hope it goes well for you.
Don't be embarrassed! Any help you receive will support you as you find the next job. I think the job centre people won't even remember you. They're probably dealing with the same thing day in day out.
can you elaborate on religion?
Ha, tell your friend to piss off. I used to hard core people please and would do some many things I knew I didnt want to do and didnt enjoy doing whilst doing them. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with NOT doing things you dont want to do. Then they'll try to peer pressure you into doing shit by calling you a flake and what not, it's insane. You dont have to unfriend them, but you did a good job standing your ground and telling them you just arent interested. I'd rather be called boring and flaky than spend another moment putting on my mask to please other people at my expense.
Hi there! I hope you’re okay. I read your post and feel like I’m in the same boat. Job hunting is already stressful but it seems worse during these difficult times. I wish you nothing but the best and hope you start to feel better soon 🖤
I think that sometimes going to the doctor and trying to get a diagnosis can genuinely be easier than reaching out to people around you. I found it really difficult to articulate myself to people or get help from family and friends until I had a diagnosis. Of course it all depends on how the person your talking to digests the information you're giving, but to say to your family 'I've spoken to a medical professional and they've said this' can hold up more than just suggesting the effects of depression as many naturally discredit mental health.   Talking to like minded people will help generally also, to understand and come to terms with how your feeling and find advice on dealing with it. (Asking here is probably a good start so, positivity for opening up and asking, it's not easy)
You are not dealing with narcs. You are dealing with emotional inmature parents. And they are not lying when they say "we're all traumatized". They are just projecting their brokeness into the world without even realizing it. It's their coping mechanism to avoid seeing themselves reflected back in their consciousness.  See them like children. Don't fly away from your depression. Go through it. Be careful, my advice is just a projection of the advice I need for myself.
yes and yes and yes. hugs = important. hope you find some hugs soon. meanwhile, youtube babies laughing with dads. best wishes
It sounds like what I have, manic depression (bipolar). The ups and downs are terrible and downright debilitating at times.  It’s hard, the best I’ve found is to distract myself, find something to occupy my mind so I don’t think too hard about myself.
Hi. I'm sorry about that, man. Wanna talk about it, though? Why you feel useless or whatever else you feel like sharing?
ya somedays are harder than others and it's hard to hear your real thoughts. im geniunely sorry that you r going thru this rn. I guess I just wanted to say you're awesome even though sometimes it's hard when your mind is racing like that
I understand your situation but you need to make an effort. Give and takes. Always remember that your best friend, partner or pet are not going to be around always. What would happen if they suddenly gone ( accident,  terminal ill or etc ) ? What would you do then ?   Try to keep a small circle of friend. And appreciate other effort in trying to connect with you.  Source :- I experienced this 3 years ago when my only friend left to different country and my boyfriend cheat and broke up with me at the same time. Shit happen. Be prepared before it happen.
I’m the same. But now that I’m single, I’m sad and lonely — but still aloof
What about online therapy? Are you paying for the therapy? If you have the ability, try to call them and say it's acute, maybe they'll act differently. Sorry to hear what you've been through anyway. Keep fighting. <3
I feel the same sometimes, I literally can't cry even tho I'm feeling so bad
Those are not real friends anyway. Stay at home and make some internet friends instead! I had a similar thing happen to me with a group I wanted to be a part of, but I feel better now that I realized they weren't ever good friends to me. You're not worthless!
I do this too, before every therapy appointment. My stomach goes into knots and I get very nervous. Therapy is helping a lot, but there's always a part of me that wants to avoid it. It's easier, sometimes, to dissociate away from my problems and stay in my own head. When I engage or try to talk to another person, it's just sets in how disordered or 'outside' of normal life/society/functioning I am.
How old are you? This detail will determine the level of probable success your departure will have.
Who is it? I could use happiness somehow
We want happiness not anything else, real happiness doesn't need conditions like money or anything else for that matters. If money can buy happiness rich people will be happiest of all,but that's not true. So please try to search for happiness within yourself please. Like exercise ,yoga or anything for that matter.  If I can love myself and stay happy, I don't really care what I do for living. All I want is to love my 'inner child' and do what I think is right. Other's validation doesn't matter anymore. Hope my experience is helpful for you. Please have a open mind about this too.
I’m currently in the same boat as you. My lecturer recommend me to take one semester off and focus on taking care on my mental health, all I need is one referrrsl letter from a clinic.  I’m on my first appointment with my psychologist earlier, but the doc somehow was not keen to put me on a break as she mentioned I should not waste my time away Like that and I shall continue pushing and graduate as fast as I could, so I could accomplish what I wanted in life.  But what she don’t understand is, I can’t focus on my studies, everything seems to float around. Going to sch make me feels nervous and anxious. I can’t promise my doc to have positive thoughts all the time, although the she kept on pushing me to promise her earlier  But I hope OP feels better soon. We are all in this together. Good luck.
Take a time out please, school can wait if you feel this is worsening. Resolve the issues or don't be embarrassed to get help. Please don't make my mistake, and suffer for years, which may be easily solved if right now.
hmm I am no expert, but maybe you could look into someone you feel more comfortable with? if that’s an option for you, ofc!
I'm praying for you. What helped me is journaling my blessings. So far it has kept me in peace for a whole five mins 🤣. A daughter is one of thee most beautiful gifts from God! I am neither a wife or a mom. You are not beyond help, or hope. My dad was extremely abusive and bipolar with Schizophrenia tendencies I would gladly trade him for a dad who merely has depression. A human who knows he or she has hit rock bottom truly knows there is only one way to go. Either stay at the bottom or, look up, whenever you have the energy of course. I know sometimes for me looking up takes every muscle in my body and my muscles start yelling at me they can't.
Is there any chance your therapist can do some kind of telehealth, be it with a video call or just over the phone?
Hey just skipped work because I couldn't get up from bed. I want to help you. You need to get up. Chose your favorite assignment, plan it. You can do it. And don't mind your mom. We need to start to care about ourselves more. You can do it.
I need a hug too. Have a virtual hug from me, and not a two second social affair, a *real* hug that lasts as long as you want with no judgment.
Have you tried medication and or therapy?  I’m glad you have a support system
This is exactly what I want to do right now. Hard reset
I totally get that. That is what I’m thinking. Can I move and start over?
I understand. Everything is so fucked up.
Update: I now have to work another immediate overnight shift, because _of course_ someone decides to call off on Halloween. And after that I only have 8 hours to go home, sleep for like, 6 or 5 hours, then get back up immediately to do _another_ nearly 8 hour shift, all for minimum wage, which is _much_ less than what the full time version of this position makes 🙃  Happy fucking Halloween, I loathe everyone and everything right now
i read your comment earlier in the day, but i cannot sleep now as it runs through my mind. i am that daughter, though my mom does not have official diagnoses. i know it is a daily battle for her each and every day. i have begun to see that her actions and processing are reflective of the hurt she experienced, not because of who i am as a person.  i also want to encourage you that your daughter is 6. it is not too late. there is time. i wish i would have been told "im proud of you" and "im thankful you're my daughter." as you pour truth into her, hopefully that will override some of these thoughts and they will not stay with her for longer. when you're feeling low or say/do something you wish you didn't, apologize. tell her that mom is feeling sad today. give yourself some credit for the small victories. you got this mama, i will be praying for you and your daughter.
haha, it can help sometimes. Hope it helped you :)
We all have moments of helplessness, of despair, of regret.  It's human.  Regarding your mistakes, were lessons learned?  There is more often than not a positive to the negative you are focusing on.  It may be hard to picture, to let your mind slip past any guilt, and shame, and regret, but you can do it.  If someone you cared for made similar mistakes, could you forgive them?  If you can, why can't you forgive yourself?  Self forgiveness and mindfulness therapies may help here tremendously.  As for everyone appearing to have it all together, I will use myself as a example here if I may.  To all outward appearances I have it together myself.  I am clean shaven, in good shape, decently dressed, drive a new truck, have a wife and kids who are happy, and readily help anyone who needs a hand.  The reality: I am currently dealing with near crippling PTSD brought on by recurrent vivid memories of a truck accident a year ago which me and my family were in.    They're all safe, my emotional and mental self are not.  I haven't been able to work since May, this has escalated now into a financial spiral that will very soon see my cell, internet, and even my truck gone.  I live very rural, I need a vehicle.  Around here, you really kinda need a truck.  I digress; my point being that despite others believing life is fine in my world by appearances, its a damn mess.  Nobody has a map of how to go through life, the dos and donts, the shortcuts and obstacles.  Life is an adventure, and a curiosity.  Humans are innately curious creatures.  If you can't find peace in your direction in life, know that you're not alone, and you never will be.  The vast majority of humankind is working on figuring life out, very few have found actual contentment with their lot in life.  It's cliche as all get out, but life is the journey.  Everyone tries to forecast a destination, but there's no knowing what that will be.  Its the journey that counts.  Its the actions of today.  Also know that regardless of anything you did or did not do in the past, you have no control of that.  You now have control of this moment.    What you do in this moment is what defines who you are, and who you want to become.  What you did in the past defined who you were in that moment.  I've kind of gone off on a tangent here.  Take care of yourself, and wherever you want to end up just take a first step toward it. Then another.  The path may diverge at times, yet with each little step you move toward your ever changing self.
I feel the same. My eyes are dark and sunken and I cannot remember the last time I had quality sleep.
Im gonna hope that changes man.
That's some great progress. Some phones come with "Do Not Disturb"modes and night-time screen modes. These might also help you fall asleep on nights when you need to look at your phone.
Omg. That is so awful, I feel so angry hearing that you're having to go through that.
I recently tried online dating and I think I’m not ready. Dread took over me when I get likes from women that I don’t think are attractive, and anxiety that the ones I do like do not reply. I need to be a good headspace to date and I’m just not.
Wild, first time on this sub because I was feeling the same way everyone in my apartment building is an alcoholic and I decided to try not to drink for like 2 days and I’m already at a loss as to what to do with myself besides work and exercise.
Agreed, for every one reasonable person there's a dozen jerks just waiting to make your day worse than it already was.
That makes 2 of us. Mine is tomorrow and I’d rather be anywhere else and anyone but me. At least we are together in this I guess.
Yes, I have experienced these desires and acted on them with cutting my arms. I did feel better for only moments following the slices.  It felt like the only way to get all the overwhelming emotions out of my body and feel anything else.    This was in my adolescence, I am 35 now.  However, earlier this year I felt this urge again rather strongly.    It surprised me and it felt so much like it did in my adolescence; i had so much emotion (usually anger is the default) and I felt trapped in my body without any outlets to remedy it.  I thought back to what I did after the cutting habit, how did I get the emotions out?  I recall it was usually angry outbursts because I still wasn't dealing with the underlying causes.  I remembered listening to Eminem loudly and wrote in my journal (felt trapped within my family growing up).  I tried this again earlier this year.  It allowed me to cry and feel my feelings so I could move through the emotion. It. was. hard and it HURT so much. But it was nicer to ME.  Because I want to be more kind to me.    I have help too, a therapist I see regularly and I take daily medications.  It is still tough to manage during troubling times as we are currently in.  I have to ask for help because I can't do it myself or I would resort to cutting again.
I hear you.  There are not enough words to describe the difficulty of the times we are living in.  You are not alone.  These crappy feelings are overwhelming and exhausting.  I'm sorry this all sucks so much.  Sounds like you are saying you're under a tremendous amount of pressure with low motivation, little to no desire to seek out the pleasures you typically do, and self isolating.  Am I hearing this fully?
Am I too late?
Honestly, I harmed myself too, and i hate myself more because of it. i feel the pain everytime i think about it
[deleted]
I get feeling behind everyone. All my peers are done university and getting married and I'm sitting here hating my job, in terrible physical health, and single. To be honest I don't have any good advice but if you need to talk to someone or vent to them I'm here.
best of luck in your pursuit! performing arts is a fascinating subject to focus on
It may seem that way, but you never know anyone’s true life. I would like to think most people wouldn’t recognize how depressed I feel due to being mostly high functioning. Just some perspective that helps sometimes. It’s nice to know we’re all at least a little sad.
Get a new therapist. For real - the good ones will listen.
Noone is ugly. And everyone has worth, value and reason. Think about little things. What have you done so far this week? Maybe you got up for work or school? Thats good. Maybe you helped someone at work or school or anywhere. In some way. Maybe you saved 15% or more with geico. Lol. Sorry. I like to put humor in with stuff. It helps more than you think. You helped me actually. In the way of I dont like to see other people down and sad. Im always like that and can't help it. So I want to help people. The reason why im on this reddit alot. Don't want to die. Want to be the best you. I hope I can change your thought a bit. 🙂👍
fuck your therapist
I quit smoking just a year ago and I can totally relate to what you feel
I wish you all the best, dear 💕
Wow they suck
I’m with you my friend. I keep pulling the mental blanket over my head, hoping that I’ll wake up someday soon to a happier place. Just know your comment has helped me tremendously, because now I know at least I’m not alone. I’ve used journaling as a way to organize and process my thoughts and emotions. Big internet hugs to you pal.
Same here. I go without eating for days. I don't want to self harm but I do. I don't know what to do.
I feel this hard. I hate my birthday for as long as I can remember. I used to actively hide it from all my friends. I have no idea why we feel like this. Maybe its cuz we dont anyone to care about us, man thats definitetly not healthy
Hey man, I’ve definitely felt the same way before. In fact I just ended a 3 year relationship with someone I considered my soul mate because she just isn’t feeling it anymore. I tried tinder, that kinda just made me more depressed. The swiping aspect, the entirety of it, it was just too little. What I did do was try & meet women out at work, the mall, etc. I just put myself out there & I’ve met this amazing woman who really feels the same about the same things as me. Maybe try putting yourself out there? Who cares if it’s embarrassing. You’ll find someone who will like that. I hope that makes sense.. if not reply back & I’ll try & explain more l
I’m currently dealing with the same issue. I want to go to therapy so bad, but honestly the habit of numbing my feelings with a ridiculous amount of weed is cheaper than going to therapy once a month.  Fucking ridiculous. Qualified mental health help is for rich people.
i’m about to drop out next semester. i don’t know what i want to do with my life & im constantly too depressed to get shit done. hoping that this break will help me find myself
i think being lonely is one of the worst feelings in the world. i don’t know if this would work for you, but maybe try getting a pet. my friend got a hamster and it helped her depression a lot believe it or not.
I don't know if only telling those around you how hard things are for you if you intend on harming yourself is the best rule of thumb for sharing your thoughts and feelings. I understand and sympathize with the feeling of guilt and burdening people around you with your feelings, I think most people with depression do as well. It's, in my experience at least, one of the hardest most frustrating parts of being depressed.  I think there's probably a comfortable middle ground that could be reached though. You don't have to share EVERYTHING about how intense your internal pain is, to share just a bit. I don't know exactly what you're feeling or thinking, but I'm sure explaining it all in pain-staking detail would take a long time, and a lot of energy you don't have. That being said, telling someone around you things like "Man, things have been pretty overwhelming for me lately" and just saying there is so much going on and its been tough on you, without delving really deep into specifics is an option to consider. Of course you can add more or less detail if you wanted to, depending on how comfortable you are and whatnot.  There is almost always a spectrum with things, and typically the best options for us to take lie somewhere in-between the ends.
I was checked into a psych ward one time, but it was for psychosis brought on by intense stress and drug use.  It helped me, but I have never been hospitalized for solely depression.  I think it’s worth a shot, especially if you are experiencing a lot of suicidal thoughts, because they put me on anti-psychotics (which you may already know this but they are used for depression in tandem with ssris quite often) these are really good for slowing down unwanted racing thoughts which I think could definitely help.   Lastly, you’re surrounded by others who are in a similar or for lack of a better word “worse” condition, which I felt was comforting and gave me some perspective.  Hope you make the right decision for you tortillas
I was checked into one a few months ago, not voluntarily. I had told my therapist about my concrete plans for suicide (time, place, how I'd try to be found) that I had at the time, as well as the fact that I had almost finished writing my suicide notes. Its plural "noteS" because I had one for each specific person in my life that I felt guilty about hurting by being selfish and killing myself.  Anyway I was checked into the hospital later that day with the cops knocking on my door telling me I didn't really have a choice but to go with them. I was only checked in for about 2 days or so, so not very long compared to most.  The experience was bittersweet I guess you could say in terms of effectiveness. After just a few hours of being there I realized I NEEDED to get out. Prior to going in, I was like you considering going in voluntarily, until I got to a point so low I had given up on any treatments and decided not to. The fact that I was there involuntarily made it really unbearable for me. I realized I valued my freedom a lot more than I thought I did. I thought if I were trapped in a small blank room for the rest of my life I wouldn't care, since I wouldn't even care if I died, but I was wrong. And so the shock of realizing that I did value my freedom felt surreal to me since I had let go of everything else I had cared about for myself.   I ended up getting out that quickly after explaining my thought process I just described to the hospital's psychiatrist who decided to let me out early, as I was allowed to stay without consent from me for about a week iirc if the hospital thought it best for me.   After I got out, I was still extremely depressed, and still am. But since then I can definitely say that I've been on a net upward trend on my recovery from being so depressed. I think about suicide everyday still but have no urge to act on it or plan to execute it. The experience didn't cure me by any means, but it made me realize how incorrect I can be about my own thoughts when my head is so engrossed in my negative thoughts all the time. I felt so sure about how much I wanted to die and how much I didn't care about anything. I thought the stories of people who tried to kill themselves, failed, and said that the instant they kicked the chair or jumped or whatever they were trying to do to themselves, they regretted it was a bunch of bullshit. But now I'm in a place where I can at least say if I were to have tried to kill myself, I can basically guarantee I would have felt the fear and regret that those people cite they felt.
Relatable, just constant talking about COVID is throwing me overboard. Not to mention they say they wanna spend time with me but sit on their phones and don’t even appreciate me Bein there. 😂
Me too. I haven't in a year but suddenly it came back to me.
I keep asking myself the same thing.
pls don’t
I'm sorry you have unsupportive parents. I couldn't get any better until I moved away from then. Have you heard of r/cptsd?
That sounds like depression. It's okay, depression does not discriminate your background. You can have a perfect life but still be depressed.
If you can get diagnosed, and are able to get help, I’d do it.
It's important to have a therapist you can trust and you get along with. It sounds like this therapist isn't working for you.
CBT has helped me a lot with my depression. Sometimes I still regress, or don't want to get up and try the techniques, because depression lol, but for the most part, I've noticed a big change in my negative thought patterns.
How old is your son? Would you and your husband be able to do couples therapy together?
If it makes you feel any hope, I would love to have a penpal. I have nice stationary and pens that I have not ever gotten around to using.
Did anything specific happen? Or you just started feeling that way ?
Same. I was doing okay for the past couple weeks after not feeling okay before that. Today sucks.
I used to hate life and hate myself too.   Here's a word of advice from someone who used to hate life and hate himself: ask yourself why. Why do you hate life? Why do you hate yourself?  Write on a paper or something, jot it down. Then go over that list of the whys, and think hard about the things that are in your control, things that you can take action and rectify to make those whys disappear.  This is an honest advice from a fellow human being who used to struggle with depression/suicidal thoughts and who have used this technique to help get himself out of the rut.  P.S. Do take this with a grain of salt. I'm genuinely trying to offer genuine advice that worked for me but I can't guarantee it will help you. But at least there is no harm in trying this amirite?
that's great to hear! Your English is perfect :)
I don't know my friend I'm waiting too. When will I get to feel alive and wild again? I can't even remember how it feels anymore. I opted to not take the meds in my case. Something always didn't seem right taking pills for how I was feeling. I don't care for therapy either. When I was 13 my therapist told me to go ahead and kill myself. My mom took me out of school for the week and laid in bed with me. I never went back. I've been trying to manage since. But I have the same question...
Don't leave him... At least you got eachother. I have mine too I don't want to leave him either....that was the whole reason I got him...
There is more than one way out my friend, I hope you can stick with it and see the light at the end of the tunnel
I have been felt what you are feeling now. It’s a sense of hopelessness that fully consumes you, you hate yourself for feeling that way and not enjoying life like the people around you, you feel as if you aren’t worth saving. Someone begged me to stay and I did. I found the other way out and although I still have my bad days, I can genuinely say that I’m happy to be here. So this is me begging you. Please stay my friend.
Almost an hour and half gone. Still the same
Washed dishes.   Cleaned house.   Took a bath.   Filled up water.   Clothes yet to be washed.   Got groceries.   Didn't book though ordered from outside.       Gonna sleep now.   Get my life in order from tomorrow
Welcome from a fellow 40-something year old (46) male. I have the same diagnosis and I know how difficult it can be to talk about, especially being a man. Luckily, progress is being made on the stigma of speaking about mental disorders.   I know my Dad was depressed, but he wouldn’t really talk about it. A few years before his death, I found out that my Great-Grandfather (Dad’s Grandfather) committed suicide. Unfortunately, I don’t know much about his life. I don’t know if he was depressed or had some life-changing event that led to that. At first, I found learning that to be extremely depressing, but now it sort of brings me peace in a strange way. I know that it runs in my family. My Grandfather (Dad’s Dad) wasn’t necessarily an alcoholic, but he did like to drink. A lot. He was a successful father and husband, but I have a feeling he was also depressed. My Mother was also depressed. She was pretty functional as I am, but I know that she was diagnosed and on medication that helped her.   Now that I’ve typed all of this, I’m tempted to do what I do a lot on social media. Delete the post before I click “reply”.   I guess my point is, my friend, you’re not alone. I don’t know what else I can say that wouldn’t be a cliché, so I’ll just wish you good luck and peace. I know it’s a miserable small world that we live in, but at least more and more of us are talking about it.   I apologize if this comment made you feel worse. My self-doubt only took a couple incomplete, rambling paragraphs to kick in. Take care of yourself the best that you can.
im here if you need to talk to someone
im proud of you. your so worthy and i love you so very much
Maybe it’s the other way around. Try to be kind to yourself.
i love you and im proud of you
dont be. its ok
I am in this same boat. I had a relationship end months ago and I just cannot shake it, I wake up and think of her, I check my phone to see if she has texted me, every time the phone goes off my heart drops hoping it's her. I'm not sure the method to get over this but I surely hope I find it soon.
i hope youll b ok
Congratulations on breaking your mile time! Try again next week. The girls will come and go Stevie Nicks said it herself.
Jesus Christ you have everything I thought would cure my depression. Damn.
I’ve been there man. It’s a tough road, but you can get out of that rut. I’ve done it. We both have different shit, and I don’t claim to know what you’re going through. I stopped drinking liquor last Oct but had some bourbon over Thanksgiving. It just made me feel really crappy. You can get outside it.
Hey. I’m (F30) now myself, but have been dealing with this since I was a child (5 at the earliest I think). I think you are truly brave and really self-aware to post here now. For me, the most difficult years have been 12-20 years old.  I also totally relate to the struggle with the  support of others - everyone is dealing with their own stuff, and I’ve accepted that it’s too much for any one of my family members to help with this disease in a long term way. It’s possible that from their perspective that you’ve been doing better over the last few weeks; I am always surprised at how other people think I’m doing “better” at times when I’ve been struggling more. I guess it’s just I’ve been hiding it better, or they are dealing with more stress of their own and so have noticed less of mine.  Seeking help is the single hardest step of this process, but if you’re considering at all, please do. Through a therapist, online counselor like Better Help, your regular doctor, or even some Planned Parenthoods for guidance. I swear it’s worth it. If your parents are already in the loop, maybe try telling them clearly, “I am not better / I am feeling worse. I really need your help with this. Can you schedule a therapist appointment for me? I’m ready for this.”  I wish you the best of luck with all of this - if there’s one thing I could tell my 14-yr old self, it would be to tell someone else who I trusted that I needed help. <3
I’m a 14M. I find it really hard to open up to my family because I never showed any signs of depression to them. They’d think that I’m just being dramatic. Right now I constantly think that I feel like it’s a lot better to just be dead than keep living like this. I don’t see any hope, I don’t see my future getting better. I got some emotional support from a friend and talked to someone online but I feel like it’s just getting worse. I really don’t feel like going forward anymore. I always forced myself to think that it’s all gonna go well if I keep living life like I usually do but now I just don’t like the thought of doing that. I’m scared, I’m really scared of doing anything. I’m a mess. I don’t want to go back to that stressful and pressuring life. I don’t feel like living anymore. It’s too much
I suggest seeking out a therapist (if you've never been, try not to feel 'locked in' if you and your therapist don't mesh) and with the COVID stuff going on many governments adjusted restrictions on telehealth so seeing a therapist over the phone may also be an option. I've been seeing mine over the phone for months now and it's mostly similar to an in person visit and also importantly, depending on the doctor they can offer emergency visits via phone as well.
Virtual hug. 🤗
You got this bro.
Feelings mutual
I know it's such a common thing for people to experience, but I relate so hard. The miserable way my life is now is because of something horrible that happened two days before Christmas back when I was in college. I hate this time of year so much. It reminds me of everything I've lost.
Same
I care
Hey. I’m lying on my sofa crying by myself. I’ve had a great month. But because of my depression, my brain keeps painting a negative hue on everything that has happened. And it’s tiring having to fight those thoughts all the time and frustrating when the people you love don’t understand what you’re going through. I don’t know what I was looking for when I opened this sub. But I found your post and my heart tells me that you’re a great person going through a tough time. I don’t know if this will mean much, but I’m sending you all of the positive energy I have and I sincerely hope that you make it through tonight.
Hey, hope you’re still here with us.   I felt this way last Christmas. But I told myself I’d give myself one last year. One last year to really give it a go, and if nothing changed, it would be done. I spent the year really paying attention to things, putting effort towards myself, and working hard to “get better” (whatever that means).  A year later, I can honestly say I don’t want to kill myself. So I’m here to say you should give yourself another year. See what can happen in a year. It’ll be worth it.
I am sorry. I don't know what to say I don't know how to help but I hope that life gets better for you. I hope that you find find happiness again.
i'm proud of you :) good luck <3
good luck
Awwww yiss January bdays unite! When we're really stressed it's hard to focus and study under pressure for months. From my friends I hear grad school is another ballgame, so maybe it's a good thing you have a break? When you have a "good enough" set  at a later date, by the time you reach that later state, once again you move the bar higher and you're never satisfied. I almost didn't think I'd make it this far doing amazing things like getting through college, meeting cool people, so on and so forth. I think my child self would be really proud of where I am now, so why shouldn't current I also savor the moment and achievements? Some days it's an active awesome-feeling swim and other times we're doggy paddling or floating and trying to keep our head up in the turbulent waves. Congrats and good luck! In your whole life, 6 months or so delay for school isn't as long as it feels right now.
Emotions can certainly cloud our decisions. Journaling when I'm not with the person has always helped me. Seeing the words can clarify things, make it feel real and be a reminder to what you're trying to do or who the other person really is like. It sucks when someone close like a best friend or SO becomes distant. But sometimes people come and go. I don't feel ready to give up on my college best friend, yet. That decision to keep pursuing the relationship is up to you. It'll take a while to adjust, but humans are surprisingly resilient. It's a huge goal to become independent and rediscover yourself, by yourself. Good luck! Make 2021 your year!
That's me right now. I'm pretty much isolated from everything and I've accepted the fact that the isolation might just be permanent.  Just gonna keep living till I can't anymore.
Please keep fighting. There are people who care whether you realize it now or not. Someone's life would change for the worse without you in it.
Sometimes people like to group around mean people because it makes them feel superior to the ones they bully, but don't mistake, that is a shallow relationship and it won't matter when it really counts
I hate that feeling. The best thing I can suggest is to respond how she responds. Give flat answers, act like you don't care even if you do. You don't need to be rude but just treat her how she treats you- once you get into the habit, you'll feel much less emotionally drained!
We can talk
Hey how are you feeling now?
I would like to assure you that this is not so. College is all about second chances and figuring things out. I worked my ass off to get good grades in high school, and it literally had no effect on where I am now.
You don’t have to go to college. Just like highschool some people remember it fondly but for others its the source of their misery. Except now you’re paying for that privilege.
playing with makeup and now i look like a middle aged fag**t waiting to be smashed against the curb i dont want to be a man i dont want to be a woman i want to be nothing. any type of gender characteristics make me uncomfortable i dont even know what i want to be i just hate myself and my disgusting shit body and face and voice and everything so much. i dont even know what to do with my life. i fucking hate my job but im so empty and stupid that i cant figure out what id want to do for a living. im tossing hobbies left and right everything bores me out so quickly. mood goes nuts throughout the day. ill be okay and end up in hysteria at evening. one day ill sleep fine the other i cant because of depression. god and my eating disorder 😀😀😀😀😀 i dont know how to stop this binge (smtimes purging )/ starve cycle..  i want an answer and help to anything but im so unsociable i cant muster out the right words to people. the mood swings would fuck me up anyway since ill be hysteric the evening before the session and come to the therapist feeling okay and having nothing to talk about.  i really wanted to die before i turned 22 but unfortunately im 5 months in and still feeling like shit.
This is nearly the exact situation I’m in, also have had a really hard time sleeping these past few nights after school ended a week or so ago.
Lately I keep thinking about how hard is to meet new people... I think I have been going more into the direction of doing things alone... I like more and more stuff that I can do alone. Do you do some sport?
Try to focus on something else. Anything else at all. Just shift focus I mean I don’t know if it’s a good coping mechanism but that’s what I do. Get into something else completely, possibly something new so you’ll have to put even more effort and it helps to forget more stuff that’s constantly in your head
Na trust it does get better bro trust me
Rest but don’t give up on yourself
I feel you.  We stress in our community info that being supportive is like writing a good story; "show, don't tell".  Saying "I understand" demonstrates nothing.  You have to show the person that you get it by expressing what you're comprehending about what they're telling you.
I feel the same way.  It’s so lonely.  Covid definitely isn’t helping.  And I hate than people can’t see me smiling at them.  It always lifts my spirits to make others smile.  Keep looking for friends, OP.  I’m not saying you have to do it every day or week/month.  I feel like quitting sometimes too but it usually passes.
Hey man don’t give up. Things are hard right now but please don’t givd up on yourself . You’re strong and you deserve good things.
I hope I can help you at least a little, I was in a similar situation. If it causes you stress to go to this meeting with your old mates do not go. Just say no thanks or if it causes you anxiety to say no try to come up with an excuse (you are not a bad person if you lie about little things if it helps you to escape from a difficult situation, everyone does)  If you think going there will make you suffer and relive bad memories, avoid the situation right away, if you can I absolutely don't want to belittle your problem by saying this, your feelings are valid and I agree it could not be the easiest situation, also I'm sorry for anything caused your bad memories  If you want to go or can't say no try to relate only to your closest friends I hope I replied before your meeting and I wish you good luck! stay strong!
Money often makes you depressed, especially if you have little. It’s so wrong that you basically can’t live without it
Tomorrow i’ll go to the gym for the first time with the sole purpose of trying to convert my thoughts into some kind of fuel, cuz I just can’t put off w things bottled up inside my head anymore. Hope it’ll become my outlet for excessive thoughts.
My previous job left me an anxious and depressed wreck too. Not getting enough sleep is terrible. What do you hate about your job?
proud of you.
You have a job that thinks you're worth enough to send on work trips and a mom that you trust enough to call when you're struggling. Those are both good. Hang in there and kick ass.
If that's really true and you are acknowledging it, NOW is the time to snap yourself out of it and not let it get any further. If WILL become a real thing and will envelope you until there is nothing left but depression. Go now and learn a new skill, join a new club, take a class, meet some new people. You are the only one of you, you just haven't found what makes you special yet.   May the odds b ever in your favor.
Damn, good on you for knowing a bad situation before you even joined. Hopefully the next one will be better. Just keep your chin up and keep looking, not every company is shit.
I'm sorry you don't feel like you can trust anyone with your problems, insignificant or otherwise. It can be a huge weight off your shoulders knowing that someone else knows and can help or reassure you that they are really. I seriously doubt that someone is better off because you lied that you don't love them, though.. everyone needs more love in their life, not less.
Fuck, man. Does he know how bad it is? If this is someone you trust, consider opening up, and he may be able to help you even if it's just helping you remember what helped in the past.
i feel that. stay safe man
I cry alone, every day. some days I literally wake up crying.  and then I feel stupid because it's not even an emotional release, it's constant, it doesn't help or fix or change anything.
I do it all day every day... it’s OK. I helps release the pressure. Hugs to you.
I know that feel.
Yes. You keep living because you are your own whole person. You keep living because you matter. You can get through these dark times.
Oh my dude, I know how you feel, please don't do it, it will hurt terribly but nothing will change. Sending support to you 🤗
it's hard for random strangers on the internet to say, I think. it sounds like it could be anxiety or depression or both. What I can definitely say that this type of fear and confusion about what exactly I'm experiencing/what's wrong with me is exactly how I feel and it's hard to overcome, though I have occasionally (one time with the help of a therapist). hope you're able to find the clarity or help you need, friend.
watch videos of babies laughing at their dads. do it. :)
does your relationship promote healthy mental awareness? or does it throw everything under the carpet?
Hey, wanna talk about it?
Yeah, I can only think and plan in terms of days, not years. It's almost impossible to plan a path because so many factors would make the plan fail.
You and me both. Gimme a month where I am free of work and every other external obligation, just to see what happens.
I don't have any advice but I just wanted to say I feel like this too all the time, and it's weirdly comforting to know I'm not the only one. I feel like I can't complain much because I'm very fortunate to have a partner to spend time with, but it's really hard when I'm alone.
I see a lot of catastrophic thinking here, and I want to work with you on what you mentioned. Clearly you're doing manageable if you haven't been fired yet, and if you do, it may not be your fault, so no need to expect the worst. So while mental health can be a bit taboo and bosses aren't necessarily understanding, it is possible to say something to your boss. Request time off for personal health reasons, you can get a note from your regular primary care physician, mention the workload (they may or may not have noticed u need a break). Think about it, if they're overloaded, the boss will likely want to keep u rather than have to rehire and retrain. not everyone has the luxury of taking breaks from work, so you can also just try to put less effort while cruising to save energy. Don't think about what ifs they never end. You are where u are now at this job, what if u had left and weren't able to find another job til now cuz Covid? Would've been worse, right? You can use negatives to think of the positives. I would try not to hate yourself for relaxing. Realize u need rest, it's okay, and u can't change the past. So make plans for the future/present. If you're stressed to the point that you're actually thinking that last line, please seek professional help. even venting to someone irl helps and they can give better pointers.
Bought a sports car because of the same thought pattern. Didn’t want to die in an old rust bucket. “Go out with style! Maybe even add a police chase for the fun of it. One last ride” 2 years later and I barely finished paying for it.
Remember you always can push off the bottom.
TIL about EMDR on Reddit. Seems like the treatment combination is working. Hope that you'll have more good days in the future :)
i know it doesn't help, but i feel the same dude.
God will if you actually ask him and don’t try to prove him wrong. ‘Look how much I suffer’ becomes a subtle way to try manipulate god or reality.
In my mind this is because if someone asks *how you are* it's not socially acceptable to tell the truth if you aren't ok. People don't want to hear about it...

Not trying to scare, but a warning all the same.  I had a back tooth that I noticed at a really rough texture. Because of financial issues and covid I couldn't get in to get it checked for awhile. While I was waiting I developed debilitating headaches (could barely function, had tremors in my hands, could barely sleep) on that side, kinda thought it was related but not entirely. Dealt with a week-long headache before going to the ER, they didn't find anything but didn't another couple weeks on some heavy pain killers. When my appointment finally came around the tooth was pulled and everything stopped hurting.  So if you start getting major pain in the head/ face area, you might not be able to ignore it any more. But I can't really talk, I wait until I can't anymore for most pain related things.  Honestly, and I don't know your situation, but just talk with someone before setting any appointment up, they may be able to help with the financial aspect to some degree. I didn't have the money to get my expired nexaplanon removed and my ob/gyn ended up not charging me for it, it out was very very discounted, I don't remember as this was years ago
Hey japester, youre doing your best and im proud. You are not here on this earth to make anyone else happy but yourself so do not let your family make you feel that way. Have an award i hope it makes you feel better
Please seek help from psychiatrist 🙏,ask someone to come with you,if anyone is there.
But I want you to
Are you able to find the time and energy for trying to join some new activity, club, or so?
We want happiness not anything else, real happiness doesn't need conditions like money or anything else for that matters. If money can buy happiness rich people will be happiest of all,but that's not true. So please try to search for happiness within yourself please. Like exercise ,yoga or anything for that matter.  If I can love myself and stay happy, I don't really care what I do for living. All I want is to love my 'inner child' and do what I think is right. Other's validation doesn't matter anymore. Hope my experience is helpful for you.
Can only make others happy if you find it yourself, try talking to your inner child it helped me a little

As they say you're unique, people saying someone is better than others are just narrow minded
Ikr!! I feel your pain!

I too wanted a hug, but I didn't get any. As hugging may seem too intimate for some. And know one could sympathize with me during that time. As even I didn't know why I was feeling so sad always without any motivation,see my life history and see if you can relate to it. You've done your best,please go easy on yourself
i would give up literally everything to hear your little meow again , it was just you and me against the whole world and you are still everything to me, i wish i could die so i could be with you
Please read my above comment please,hope your pain lessens by time,as it mostly do
I thought so too, during my toughest time

What's up bro?

No dont do it. DO NOT EVER share your true depressive feelings to any close one EVER, your friends will distance themselves from you like mine did, I wish you the best :)
It aint better up here, try canada
I feel you.
I relate to this so hard. people telling me to "just be yourself" when in reality, being myself is what makes me so miserable. "be yourself" is possible the worst advice, ever
Fuck I feel this. It’s like I can’t get my mind to stfu about how awful everything is and I just dwell until I fall asleep again
I hear you. I love the Fall season so much but this year I just want it (and Winter) over with. I want to fast forward to Spring.
No, thats not fair.
I feel like a weirdo too. Tony Ferguson is weird, but that makes him cool.
Id sub homie, never give up
Me too. Let's just hang in there buddy. No need to sink or swim. Let's just float together.
Happy birthday in advance! Hope you'll feel better soon
Happy b day. ^^^
It's ok, everyone deserves some attention at some point. You can have those things, you may not get them. I hope you feel better arallute.
Great to hear that your career is going well selyssa, it seems like a great fit!
This describes being failed by the system perfectly
You aren't alone, I have this problem too.  I aim to be the most polite person yet I am such an outcast.  I wish I had advice to give, but I  don't.  I have a hard enough time dealing with my emotional pain and frustration from situations like these.  I sympathize with you.
I feel like nothing has meaning and nothing is worth my effort.
I’m sorry to hear that :/  I can assure you though that if you had the talent to get career opportunities in the first place, then you still can get them back. I’m not trying to oversimplify the situation and I know it’s not as simple as just walking right into a new opportunity, but I believe in you nevertheless
I'm disgusted with her for saying that to you. Fire her and find a new therapist, this isnt your fault.
oh gosh I have the opposite, I want to eat everything in sight and then some.
You still can go back, no?
I experience this too. I have everyone fooled into thinking I’m a social butterfly. It’s exhausting.   You aren’t crazy.
A job is just a job. Some jobs truly suck, some are wonderful, and some jobs put people in positions where they *can’t* win.   A job is not indicative of your value as a person. I hope you’ll reconsider.  Edit to add: If you’re not already doing talk therapy with someone, please reach out to a counselor for support. I’ve found that I perform better at work when I have help processing small successes and small failures, rather than snowballing every micro-failure and perceived fault into one massive wave of negativity crashing down on me and wind up sabotaging something without even realizing it.
I'm sorry you are feeling exhausted. I hope your day/night (whatever time zone you may be in) gets better! Also, how are you doing aside from the exhaustion?
Would it help if you wrote it down and put it on his desk as soon as you got in?  I have trouble voicing things but writing it helps a little more.
I'm sitting on the floor in my boyfriend's house wondering if he lied that he loved me. He talked to me in a way that hurt me badly tonight. Maybe I was used. I don't know. He hasn't come looking for me. He told me the way I was acting was "bullshit". Maybe I'M just bullshit. If I live another week, I'm not letting anyone else in. My family doesn't care about me. I've been too anxious to keep up with friends. No one to talk to. I've given up.
It sounds like you have very good and understanding parents. I think you should tell them about how you're feeling so that they can help you like they've been helping your brother. Will it suck for them knowing that both their kids are depressed? Absolutely. But it will be way worse for them if something bad happened to you because you couldn't take it anymore. Also, there's a chance you'll feel a bit better after getting stuff off your chest.
hey, i hope your support system sees your struggle. sorry to hear it’s been difficult lately. i don’t know your situation but its always possible for things to improve. i hope they do for you
I love how you write.
I relate so much to someone's negative energy making you more depressed.  My boyfriend does that to me and doesn't get it.  He doesn't believe in therapy and doesn't understand mental health but he hates people and constantly rants to me, to other people, to everyone and even sometimes to no one.  It is so exhausting listening to him.  UGH, I get it.
Completely relate.
I am having trouble keeping it together because I am on the egg fast diet day 2 and because I lost my friend circle at work. Only one person wants to talk to me out of that circle. My husband is nice enough to have done laundry but he hung my clothes up inside out and because I start at 5am every morning neither of us noticed that my shirt was on inside out. I only realized at 11:55am today. I am so tired of this. My poor husband is bad at socializing too so he has no friends either. Partially because we moved and partially because I for years nicely called out the main person from our last group on how they were mistreating my husband and when I decided to make screen shots as proof we lost the whole friend circle.
I am sorry to hear what you are going through. Being socially inept is so frustrating, especially when you notice how your presence alone can make feel people around you uncomfortable. I hope you and your husband have a nice Thanksgiving!
Completely relate to this.
Your living for what you choose. For the people that are around you. The things you contribute to. There are things that ALL people to that help someone in some ways. But what do you want to live for? You don't have to answer. But if you really ask yourself that with meaning. And don't overthink it. You'll find it.
Same...
You ok? What do you need?
Same
One internet friend to another, I’m honored to read your comment. It takes a lot of courage to talk about this, and I’m grateful for you sharing. Journaling has helped me. Just taking the time to manifest my thoughts physically on paper helped me process everything.
Hang in there
Geez it's 22:00.I,AM,GOING
ah, yes something similar happens to me. depression keeps me up, I get yelled at for staying up, then depression gets worse and I stay up even longer. depression fucking sucks
[deleted]
Hugs
Are you...me?
I care. I find for myself writing helps
Yeah, I know man. I feel the same way. I just try & feel a new reason to live every month. Right now it’s just making money so I can get a PS5. That’s my goal. Once I get to play some games on it I’ll set my next goal. I’ve got $100 saved up so far but with bills & everything else stacking into it, it gets hard. What do you want in life? Or even just this month? Or even just this week?
yes i know what u mean 100%. my brain is constantly consumed with suicide and death. i’m obsessed. but there’s still a really small part of me that wants to hang on. i hate that part of me because i just want to get this shit over with. i try to drown out the voices but sometimes i crave it so maybe it’ll convince me to actually follow through. i saw something today tho that said even people in their early/mid 20’s are still kids. you have time dude. don’t compare yourself to others. everyone excels at their own pace
Hey, just checking in with you right here. I‘m struggling with group projects the other way around rn. Believe me, it won‘t be a problem when the others see that you‘re really trying. They notice, even if you don‘t think they do. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses and people generally respect that! So really, try not to feel too bad about it. I‘m sure your teammates have found a way to deal with this rather quickly and are still very happy you‘re putting effort because that‘s so much better than no participation at all.
i know what you mean. i’m tired of making everyone’s life harder. it feels impossible to keep them happy when i’m running out of energy to be alive. the idea of being gone forever just sits and festers in my mind all the time. i’m obsessed with the idea of dying. but i know of people that have beat depression & now live a full and happy life. forget everyone else. do things that please you. it might be hard to find pleasure in life right now, but focus on you. let yourself live rent free in your head, not everybody else
[deleted]
Yes. I think for me when I started to feel a bit more safe in my environment I started to feel emotions, I think I also pushed myself out of numbness because it was not serving me at the moment I needed to find motivation to work. However now, I feel that my rollercoaster of emotions is draining the last few drops of energy left in my body
I did also feel this way a bit ago. Specifically with the feeling of not being stable and flipping through being "happy" and then in the next moment feeling like I'm going to break down crying. And I can especially understand the feeling of being irritable and even angry when I was never that kind of person normally had it not been for my depression. For me it felt like I was really losing it when I felt that way, bouncing around emotions, but atleast from how you phrased things it seems as if you prefer it. Personally, I was scared of the lack of consistency and predictability in my emotions as consistency made me feel somewhat secure.  I would say that I don't think that these are actually what "normal emotions" are like, and that these changes are probably a product of your depression or if you have anything else going on with you as some people do (I'm not a doctor and don't know you so its obviously difficult to say). Sorry if that thought of normalcy gave you some comfort. From my perspective people tend to have fairly consistent moods and emotions through a day unless there is actually a precipitating event that changes your mood (you get splashed by a passing car and now you're upset instead of happy for example). Kind of like a relatively flat line with a few bumps and dips but not normally anything to crazy day-to-day. From what you describe it sounds like rapid and intense changes in emotion and mood which doesn't sound like something a "normal" person would identify with feeling.  Hope that gives you some perspective
Same here. I'm a trans person tho.
😞
I feel this so deeply. Constant cycle
I can understand what you are feeling. I have a friend somewhat like that and my sympathy dried up after a bit. It's okay, we aren't bottomless wells of caring.
Hey I wanna reply to this because I can relate, but I just wanna say that therapy only works when you tell them everything. Unfortunately I had to stop seeing my therapist because she didn’t take my new insurance but I wanna start seeing another one again maybe after covid is over.
I don’t have any advice and I have not experienced all of the trauma that you have, although I have PTSD as well. I’m sorry for you. There is love in the world. If I could give you a hug, I would. The Guster song Hang On helped me a lot. It was comforting when I wasn’t sure that I could hang on. ❤️
Hang in there. It took me 5 years to graduate college. Your situation sounds very similar. I was in the same spot as you, now I am teaching kids and love it. You’re just being tested at the moment but I promise it won’t last forever. Take some time off from school if you need it, I did and it helped a lot. I took a year off when I was a sophomore in college and bartender at a bar. Made some cash and experienced the fun night life. Made new friends and wasn’t stressing about deadlines. I had fun for a year. Then came the realization that eventually, I would need to go back and finish school. Sometimes we need that time off to realize what we really need. Hang in there !
How can you focus and get work done when you're putting so much pressure on yourself? Take 5 deep breaths and hold them each in for 10 seconds. Breathe out slowly. Do it as many times as you need to.  When I have trouble with procrastination i find the pomodoro technique helps. Its just taking a break every 25 minutes or so. There are apps you can download to time you. I use Engross. That way you schedule time to chill. It's also supposed to make you more productive, because your brain processes stuff while you're relaxing.  Anyways, it sounds like you need to take a break from worry and just set take an hour to chill. Watch TV, listen to music, whatever. The presentation isn't that important. Your happiness is.  After you've chilled, tackle the project. Say you'll work on it for x hours, taking a 15 minute break every 25 minutes (I recommend an app). Don't hold yourself to impossible standards, just get it done. Good luck! Take care!
That's amazing. Feels so good to be productive.  I hope it lasts. But if it doesn't, no worries, I hope you bounce back soon.
That's absolutely awesome. One step at a time, no matter how small how insignificant it seems is a step forward.
That is the first great step. You should be proud of yourself for saying enough is enough and taking action to rectify your current state. Seeing a psychologist is a great first step. I hope it goes well for you.
I'm happy for you! When is it?
Whoaa this is exactly how I feel
Hi :) hang in there
I'm still doing better, than how I was doing a year ago though, so that is good.
I feel the same way.. I feel like I know what’s wrong but not how to fix it
I’m here for you
I'm here for you as well
im here 4 you
Shinedown-Atlas Falls.... literally just helped me get off the couch....
For me it feels suffocating. If that makes sense. I found this subreddit and I feel a little less alone, like there are other people in the world going through similar things. Please remember you are not alone. We all care about you :)
I feel you. I’ve been fighting depression for going on 20 years, it’s been varying levels of heavier for the last 3-4 years... even though I want to tell someone how I feel, I don’t bother anymore because they’ve heard it before, talking about it doesn’t fix it, it brings everyone else down, and I don’t want to push people away by just being a negative person all the time.
I’m so sorry.
<3
Been there. It sucks. I’m sorry.
It almost seems strange doesn't it? I remember when I first found this sub i was torn on how to feel about it. On one hand your happy that your not the only one, and on the other hand it's really awful that this many people are hurting so.
I feel this!! I blew off cleaning all weekend and now the guilt cycle is coming again. I have tomorrow off though, so there’s still a chance of I start doing things as soon as I get up. Hope you can feel lighter soon!
What's going on ? Wanna talk about it?
It will go back to normalish sooner than later. The vaccines are getting distributed and will help reduce the spread.
We’re the same. I always forced my mind to think that it’s gonna be okay but once I realized that it’s actually getting worse, I couldn’t bring myself to do anything anymore. I tried to get emotional support from a friend, talked to someone online about it, I actually felt a little bit better but it just made it worse the next day. I really don’t want to live like this anymore. I want that but I feel like I can’t do anything about it. I just feel hopeless and helpless
Same. This is how I have been feeling over the past few months. Even the most random things make me cry. I've also been feeling a lot of anger as well, and I rarely, if ever, get angry. But yeah, I've been feeling the same wave of misery you are, and I don't know how to get out of it.
No, your family doesn't always want the best for you, it's just what they *think* is the best for you. I've been in that situation too and I felt bad about myself. I realized later on that it's toxic of them to be doing that. And that's just one of the reasons why I have moved out. I hope you do get out soon. And I'm sorry you have a shitty family.
My parents constantly tell me they want the best for me but it's like it's never occurred to them to self reflect and think about if they could be wrong. I used to do it every time they went in on me, "Am I the problem, are they right, is everything I think about the world wrong?" I've finally accepted that I'm not crazy and they're wrong which was pretty difficult to accomplish and has taken a lot of stress of me but I still want them to like me and the choices I make and it still upsets me when they don't. Hoping that will bother me less as time goes on, or maybe they'll get better, but either way I'm trying to do what I can instead of hoping they change.  Those changes were really difficult but I hope you can edge closer to that so they don't have as much of an effect on your happiness, which is something you don't have to define on their terms. I'm sure you know that but it's so hard to put into practice. I hope you and your partner have a good holiday.
Wow you have really horrible family members. Wtf.
“I’m starting to feel the full weight of having wasted much of my life.”  This. This so perfectly articulates my experience with therapy so far (been having weekly sessions since September).
Same. I feel like I wasted the past ten years of my life, basically college onward. I missed out on a lot of experiences because of all of my stupid problems and fears. I hope I can get some therapy soon, because I'm losing it.
hey maybe no one called or texted you today but i’m just an average redditor telling you that i for sure don’t hate you.
Same. It’s been so hard.
nice job taking things one day at a time. when things get worse, narrowing focus to just what's going on right now helps. it takes effort but it helps!  keep in truckin and be safe 👍
I think it's a constant battle. Like an alcholic never defeats alcoholism in the sense that if they start drinking again it can be easy for them to fall back.    But there are occasionally people who get better and they make posts about it. Many probably get better and leave this sub looking at the age of posters.
I definitely did. In high school, I told myself that I would give it a semester in college to see if things changed for me mentally before ending it.   9 years later and I’m still here and thriving.
Realized that my mental health insurance/specialist coverage is not existence bc I learned that I have a coinsurance where it only covers after a 7K deductable. I guess I need to be on my job's plan, idk. I need mental health help badly. I see my prices for providers skyrocketing after this year and it sends a chill down my spine, I was finally turning my life around but NOPE.   I'm gonna go bankrupt trying to find mental health care to not kill myself. Amazing. yeah. My psychiatrist, is 300 dollars an office visit and I just started zoloft. On this insurance, I will get charged the full 300 dollars instead of a copay. I don't qualify for Meidcare.   I will just take my meds and shut up until I get on a better insurance, I want to get on aetna it is possible for me, even if its 300 a month, it is better than the alternative. The only thing my mom said to me today is asking if I can pay that bill, I hate her. I wish I never talked to either of my parents again. Every success I do is in SPITE of them.   Just folded some laundry and the only way I can do it is by imagining everything I do spits in my parents face. I hope and pray every day is a day I don't talk to them.
Have you heard of chakras?
Idk if you smoke weed but it can help
I hate to sound like an asshole.... but I suggest a joint and an omelette for breakfast... look up a short full body workout on youtube... after you should feel at least 0.01% than vodka
It’s hard when your only choice is to just keep going and live day by day just as you were. Makes me feel like I’m getting no where, fast. But you’re right about having real animals.. they keep us goin.
Yeah it's hard to fall asleep when there are so many temptations on the internet and it's very easy to get sucked in for hours. New habits take a while to solidify! Sometimes you'll have those bad cheat days where you lose control, the key is to make those less often as time goes on. By now you're probably super tired. Try just resting your body in bed for 15 minutes, even if you don't fall asleep, at least you'll be off the computer. I'm bad at consistently setting timers and limiting my phone time, but let's keep trying!
My dr just added Wellbutrin on top of my Prozac two weeks ago and I already can tell a big difference! I don’t want to actively die as much as before and I have enough energy to do basic tasks. I still have a long way to go but I finally feel like there’s hope. I hope it helps you too :)
I hope this is okay to comment here, but I just wanted to say congratulations on your cake day! Every day is a new day, even when it seems the same as the last one, today is a cake day, and I hope it inspires you to smile.   Also, jobs always ask for more than they really need. As someone who has edited a lot of resumes for a lot of jobs, I guarantee you that the perfect employee that these companies are looking for don’t exist. They are written for the wants of someone hiring, not just the needs, and often enthusiasm and a drive to learn and be flexible are valued more than the years of experience necessary for a job. So good luck, and good for you for cutting yourself some slack.
I know how you feel about being exhausted, lacking strength. Feels like college was a bad joke that someone will pop out and tell me “haha gotcha! Here’s your money back!” But of course that will never happen. But taking the time to tell myself, it’s okay to have a bad day. And not just saying it, but living it that day. Making the day about me and what I want and need, all the books I haven’t read and the blankets I want to curl up in with that warm mug of tea, or the walk I wanted to take but felt like I was wasting my time because I wasn’t working or being productive. Or that I had to be feeling better to do fun things. Just one day, all to myself, no one else, even on the phone. To know that I matter, if only to me, and that I deserve to have that one day before beyond and everything else comes clamoring back into my life again. At least I know that I’ll listen to myself.
The fact is that you are a beautiful soul and your individuality makes the world a bit brighter, even if you can't see it
Exactly my thoughts I'm in love with someone who she used to be even my common sense says to just fuck it block her and remove her she doesn't care anyways still I try to show care about her and do everything I can for her ,Ig my subconscious mind made her some god like figure I want to get out of this PLEASE SOMEONE HELP ME ITS JUST GETTING WORSE
Yeah I get the same feeling. Like I'm gonna mess up and get exposed if I go back or I'll feel embarrassed if people ask what have you been up to.
U wrote what I wanted to write I want her and everyone to get hurt how they hurted me , especially her fuck u katka u showed me love but but just for a millisec and snatched from me fuck u hope u suffer
Why did you get denied by the one
Same man wasted 2020 bc of sadness and crying over a girl and same shit I'm following in 2021 idk how to leave this shit nothing is working out
Ugh the "you're focusing on the negative" people are the worst. :(
My friends and myself included felt this way going into our first appointment. Most of our therapists set initial guidelines and helped us work out our thoughts. I don't know how long your appointment is but personally it took a couple sessions to build the whole narrative. If you've been considered high risk, I imagine they've assigned you someone who knows their shit.   Helping you express yourself properly will make it easier for both you and your therapist. I have an idea of how you're feeling, both with your trauma and starting out therapy, but it will eventually help you feel better. You got this! I wish you the best.
Man, caffeine has really hit different when I can’t actively use its effects daily. I feel this.
And that's okay! Don't push yourself too much, too quickly. I know I tend to do that because I get so excited by any amount of progress I always thought was possible. Take it slow, adjust accordingly and give yourself credit for being aware of it. It's difficult to work on, but that's amazing that you're able to notice it. Hang in there and don't forget to give yourself the credit you deserve.
Hey. Dont catastrophize right away, that has no benefits.
I would like to preface with I’m not a dr or a counselor. Just a recovering addict who’s struggling with his own problems. But from reading your post the first thing that comes to mind is something my mother told me when I was getting clean. And it was the phrase “fake it till you make it”.   While I know those may just be fleeting words on a screen it is something I regularly use in my own life and just wanted to share.
thats me rn but instead of vodka ive been smoking
hmm? ed sheehan!?? sheeran
You say you've been in a small town school, so you must have certainly made a big change recently. Congrats on being brave! True Friends are hard to make and long-sought after. Personally, I was able to find a nice community through discord, but building up that rapport and feeling/testing out if they can handle the dark shiz is important to establishing deeper relationships. People aren't trash cans, you can't dump a bunch of mental garbage at the beginning of a new relationship and expect them to take it. Some people are like vases and will reject anything remotely dusty. While internet friends are nice to find that niche community that also has the same interests as you, I think being real life friends with someone physically close by can be difficult, but richly rewarding. How do you think about others? As harshly as you judge yourself? Why should you expect others to love and accept you, when you can't embrace yourself fully? Our inter and intra relationships and thoughts reflect off each other, so those questions are something to consider. Have a good day!
You’re not a burden. Simple as that. I hope you communicate your feelings clearly because I can tell she means a lot to you. She’ll understand.
Sometimes opening up to loved ones can make a big difference. You can never be a burden to family and friends.
Hey buddy, I hope this reply finds you well. I wanna strongly encourage you to pursue your treadmill workouts. I know its hard to “feel like” you want to do it, but in my experience the longer you put it into your regular routine, the easier it gets. Even losing 10 pounds is a great start! Good luck, I’ll be rooting for you :)
I feel like I don’t even want to get better... I like cutting, I like being left alone.
>this   i know how you feel
Youre not alone
I know how you feel. I gained a lot of weight the last few months and heaviest I have ever been as well.  I feel really down about myself and it seems like such an uphill battle to get back to my pre-pandemic self.
That sounds absolutely infuriating.  It's funny how depression makes bumps in the road feel like mountains. Like a healthy brain would just be able to be like, "it's just a computer, I'll figure it out. It's gonna be fine" but someone who is already suffering can take it as just another obstacle in a series of seemingly endless struggle, and a reflection of our own failures. It's really really hard.
Yes.
Have you talked to the other members of this art community? Definitely do the mural project because that sounds awesome! But also, talk to the other community members and see if others feel the same way you do about this leader's new direction. It may very well be that it's a shared opinion, and you might just spark the start of a new group that branches off (whether that's something you want to personally lead, or not)
I have the similar issue. I go to work and get the bare minimum done (because I basically just have to) and then when I get home I just hit the couch and can't get myself to do anything.. then when it's time for bed I can't sleep because I know I just have to do the same thing again tomorrow.
You should talk to your teachers and see if there is a way they can still teach you the things the other kids can't handle. I took a French class in high school that was combined lvl 3, 4 and AP and the teacher was able to get each level of student working on things at their level all while in the same 1 hour class every day. Your teacher probably isn't equipped to do this super well, but they should be able to give you some more advanced reading and a couple harder projects, maybe even some one-on-one time (or time with you and others who are at your level)
You're so young and have so much life left to live. You hang in there so I can read your books one day, okay?
Did you want to talk first?
I do. I care. And that’s not just a cliche thing to throw around online to me, and I hope you believe that.   It sounds like you’re in a dark place right now. I know I don’t always hear these type of encouragement messages when I’m in a similar headspace, but I hope this reaches you enough to get through the day. We believe in you!
I feel you brother. I wish the best for you.
Oh man I can sympathize with that feeling. Even when I'm not feeling suicidal, I'm always wishing I could just disappear for a year or two.
Please do not kill yourself. Nothing in life gives you permission to do so. Even if you feel like it's too hard. From my experience when it gets really hard, something better is right around the corner. I was almost denied help with my depression and I almost gave up. The next week? I got an appointment and was prescribed medication. Who knows, everyone's story and life is different. But maybe, it'll work out the same for you. It's a hard road for sure, but keep your head up! Better days are ahead!
Please don’t
Don’t do it!!!  I’m here.  I don’t know you, but I know depression all to well.  Look we have something in common already!
Make a game out of taking smaller glances next time!
Your several edits worked and you put up a clear post that covered a lot of ground without using too many words.  Overwhelmed is a contributing factor of depression.  It sounds like your therapist is trying to help you to get stabilized so you can get healthy enough to get out of your rut.  I doubt what you listed is the cause of your depression.  I would like to give you advise but do not want to patronize you be saying a few things is the cure.  For me trauma connected to my core beliefs have been connected to my depression.  There are other people that help one to change their core belief but Joel Olsteen has been highly helpful for me to see hope instead of dispair .   EMDR has helped my brain to heal from trauma.
Having a goal is a trap,search it please. Live the moment and let life take its course. I have the same thought as you but they'll be happy only when you're happy. I don't know what I want in this world nor do I want to have a child here. So hoping to find an answer and long lost drive to move forward.
We want happiness not anything else, real happiness doesn't need conditions like money or anything else for that matters. If money can buy happiness rich people will be happiest of all,but that's not true. So please try to search for happiness within yourself please. Like exercise ,yoga or anything for that matter.  If I can love myself and stay happy, I don't really care what I do for living. All I want is to love my 'inner child' and do what I think is right. Other's validation doesn't matter anymore. Hope my experience is helpful for you.
Please don't compare, comparison kills as I teach nowadays to my students
Sorry to hear that but I can relate. Only suggestions are to try to keep your head in a positive place despite your surroundings. Philosophy is great for that, Stoicism is a great place to look to because it's about taking obstacles in your way and making them a motivator to become better and make the ppl around you better while creating a mindset of recognizing life is short and essentially without meaning but you can define your own life and what you want it to mean and everyday trying to do anything to make it better even in the slightest way and this will help build a sense of pride and a positive mind state even in negative situations. Best of luck to you and know most ppl feel how you do and you are in a much better place than a lot of others that feel the same, don't waste those opportunities you have earned.
You’ve lost me at “isn’t it one of the reason for violence against women.” Are you claiming “shaming” of men creates violence against women. There are arguments to be made that certain porn itself creates violence against women by perpetuating false and glamorized versions of sex without consent. Also, I’m not sure if what you’re feeling is depression.
Safely back from 7-11,Paid the water bill ! yay!
One day at a time...that phrase has always helped me
> All previous connections I once had were chance passive encounters that have now since lost meaning  I feel this in my soul. I always feel like I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time, always missing out on that someone or group of people who could just let me be me.
I find that I reach out to friends 90% more than they reach out to me and I’m not sure what to do. My therapist says it might just be personality differences.  But I don’t think so.  Just feel unlikablr
I might be lying to myself but I feel like if I didn't have so much work I'd actually be able to pause and do something to feel better tonight instead of just freezing up and wanting to die. Who knows.
>My life is spiralling so quickly. It's 3:00 AM and I'm nowhere near done half the work I have to do for tomorrow. I'm a senior in high school and I have no clear path and no ambitions. I just want to fizzle away? If that makes sense? I don't want to live knowing I'm such a failure to myself and my family.  I had a lot of work today but two things that always make me feel better are taking showers and journalling. I did some breathing exercises and made sure I did both. They weren't too effective and I think I'm severely sleep deprived. Things aren't really shaping up and my meds are pretty ineffective right now. I wish I could just be productive and make myself (and my family) proud but I'm just so overwhelmed. On top of a really bad episode, my anxiety isn't giving me a break and I just want to stay in bed for as long as possible. My room truly feels like my only safe place.  Hey, I'm in college and I was in your shoes just a few years ago, I know how stressful this time of year is with applications and on top of that quarantine. Hang in there, you're not alone in feeling like that. Try to take care of yourself and remember- **everything will be okay.** Seriously, everything will. Take it easy and good luck <3
that was a total dick move by the professor lol like hilariously evil and so inneffective. failing at school is really hard. i flunked out of school like i was that student and had my professor do something similar with me and say that they had students dealing with natural disasters so i had no excuse lmao. anyway all that to say that it took years and going to community college and going back to a four year and fucking up and doing well sometimes and getting lucky with some kind people and eventually i got my degree. but it would have never been possible at all unless i didnt get the years of therapy and other soul searching in between. like dont shy away from the shitty feelings, except it and be i=okay with fucking up at school and start talking to an advisor or school psychologist about support you can get or like alternative ways of getting credit or like a way to get a refund or some type of support you may be able to get. nothing in school is permanent. if all else doesnt work out  put yourself and emotions and your pleasure and your life first, fuck the grades and especially that professor lol.
>I see things I could do and I know they'd make things easier but its so hard to motivate myself to do anything. like the thought is just a thought and translating into action feels impossible. This just makes me feel worse about myself.   >   >level 3Cant\_getoutofmyhead1 point · 26 minutes agoThank you 💜ReplyGive AwardshareReportSave   >   >level 1Cant\_getoutofmyhead2 points · 5 hours agoDAE do something or notice something really simple, something that anyone would do or see immediately but you've just left it for months or an inordinate amount of time, and when you finally do it you immediately notice how it's so much better and wonder why it escaped your notice for so long?After three months of living here I just moved my lamp from across my room to next to my bed. I didn't even have to move the plug. It instantly made my room warmer, and I don't have to physically get up to turn on/off my light when I go to bed or get up in the middle of night.I also picked up some of the old recycling and trash in my room. I had about a month's worth of empty milk cartoons and food that my landlord gave me a month ago that had a dead fly in it. I feel so much better and more in control of my life. I realise that I kind of was vaguely ashamed when I left the door of my room open to go to the kit
remember every feeling you have is valid  They may be irrational or unhelpful, or unfounded, but theyre always valid.  stay strong
Are you my ex wife a year ago? We both have depression and anxiety and has been separated the last year. She took the time to process her feelings, worked out, and saw a counselor and friends. Now she’s dating again, and I’m still where I started of course, but now I have more anxiety about my future.
i got it and didn’t even get sick
I got it and I was hoping to die
Keep doing your work, theyre just jealous of your success
What is "pei"?
Make a small goal to get outside. Or if that is too hard, get a shower, clean clothes and then try to go outside. For me at least, being inside is not good for me.
On top of it, whenever I'm happy and share it with someone, something bad happens in their life, which makes me feel like I'm just a bad omen for others.      I so want everything to end. But I'm sure my comfortable days are over and I'll have to get used to uncertainties and hustling till I die.
Fucked up ur career how? It may seem that way now but things can be fixed, it just takes time sometimes so you got to be patient but everyone makes mistakes.
I'm with you. This is how I feel. I am sorry you are feeling this way too.
I get that totally. I feel so lost and on my own with the whole thing..
relatable
emotional dysregulation is a symptom of ADHD.      I used to think like this too, like if I could go back and do it over. then I realized it was unpleasant the first time, why would I do that to myself?
It IS exhausting. I’m in this boat, too. I’m starting a new medication this evening, it will be my 7th attempt at taking medication for depression. It is really really hard also to advocate for myself and go back to tell the dr when something isn’t working for me.   I did finally tell the psych, no more meds I have to wean on or off of. I have such a poor success rate it isn’t fair to me to keep trying things that take 3+ months to know if they are doing anything or fucking me up. I will try anything as long as the minute I decide it isn’t for sure helping, I can quit taking it.    Talk therapy has helped because my counselor walks me through the process of advocating for myself to the psych when the medication isn’t helping. She helps provide an objective perspective of how I’m doing compared to other medications or unmedicated because I sometimes can’t tell or don’t remember. And she pep talks me so I feel ok about it.   Also seeing a psychiatrist instead of a family dr or primary care dr for mental health treatment was a total game changer.  Hope this helps in some way.
You’re still running. Where you are now is my *goal.*
Please see someone for this. Those feelings are 100% the depression talking.
Hey, I don't know you, but I know, that absolutely no one is on this world without a reason and you seem to not have found yours yet. And this is okay. Feeling alone is okay. But there is another way to feel better, than killing yourself. Have you tried speaking to this 'friend' yet?  If you are Feeling lonely with him/her then let them out of your life. You don't neccesarilly need them, you can live without them. There are other people out there, that will connect with you and that are going to need you just as much as you need them. Just don't do it. You are worth the life waiting for you- it will be difficult at first, but with the right people, and if you want to, you can reach your dreamlife.   Don't give up. There's so much more waiting for you, no matter your age. I beg you not to do this. Please.  A stranger
i’m so sorry you’ve been facing this.  i’ve been there too with friends. it’s painful. but they aren’t the only friends you’ll ever have. you don’t have to deal with this alone and it’s never too late for things to improve. showing up is half the battle don’t know you but i’ll be thinking of you
Awesome! I hope things work out for ya. Good luck!
who knows maybe it will turn out okay or at least middling..
Go right ahead.
sounds like a something worth trying.
lol same, have not had any help for the past four years.
I feel like this a lot too. You've summed it up perfectly
Yes. 100%
I feel exactly the same. I have a 3 month break and I'm only a week in and I feel like I have no purpose anymore.
You're breathtaking
You'll get back to ok and then you'll feel good for longer and ethe periods of ok will blend together until u r ok
Slowly start setting goals. Baby steps. Try talking to few more people. Even if only at the store or saying hello to someone walking down the street.  Every baby step in right direction will help.  I don’t know anything about your situation but having no friends at all needs to change. Even if it’s a support group ‘grow’ or NA or AA if you have any problems relating to drugs an alcohol.  I’ve had times in life with no friends or family that I felt I could just fall for a chat. They were dark times but they did change.  Prey. It can’t hurt and it leads to hope instead of despair. I’ve done a lot of preying but I’m not religious by any means.   Hang in there. If you have any drug or alcohol problems let me know and I can put you onto online support groups, also face to face support groups. Look up grow on your area if your struggling with mental health.   Hang in there.
I had a post removed from Writing Prompts when I first joined Reddit. It was the first thing I’d ever posted and it completely ruined my mood for days. And I get what you’re saying — you feel like you can’t do anything right. It’s a small thing that happened but when you’re already in that headspace, small things become the tipping point. And then EVERYTHING starts to feel that way — that you are doing things wrong, or people don’t like or respect you, or they think you’re dumb. Sorry that happened to you :/
Don’t let them bully you
I also feel like I don’t have that “spark of life”.  It’s like everyone is in on something or knows a secret I don’t know.  I don’t get it.
no sir!!!! not the best for me.  If you can do it, so can I, and so can the next person.  hang in there, please <3
Hey man sometimes its just not ment to be thats the crazy part of life. Theres all these crazy turns and hell alot of them are terrifying and yea your gonna crash no ones perfect. But you pull out of it. You stop you look at the situation. You start to fix something that you think is the problem. Sometimes your dead on and you fix it right away. Sometimes your completely wrong and you make it worse and their isnt anything wrong with that, thats just how you learn. And other times you crash and theres nothing wrong. And you constantly tell yourself theres gotta be something wrong and you think your gonna break down. But as long as you keep positive and dont turn back to look at the situation youll be alright. Dont keep stopping to look at something that isnt broken.    And one more piece of advice king. A wise man once told me you cant make yourself smile. Go out into the world and make others smile. Their smile will make you smile. Everyday i try to make at least one person laugh or smile and you know what. It works. It might not at first but the more you do it the better it feels. And hey who knows you could be making your future wife laugh and not even know it. Be safe bud. Theres always positive vibes no matter how bad it gets.
I hope things start to look up for you soon. I can empathise with you along with most people in this sub. I know you didn’t ask for it, but If I could give some advice as someone formerly in your position, what first helped me was to do a bunch of small things to help your endocrine and psychological systems get levelled out: like going for a walk everyday, eating healthier, writing down how you feel every night (as cheesy as it is). Using any kind of counselling resource you will also help immensely should you find the right person to help.  If you feel like nobody cares, I care. And the possibility that things could somehow be better despite how unlikely is worth fighting for tooth and fucking nail.  Stay safe.
You should seriously try a psychedelic like dmt then
Teens and young adults can be the worst - drama etc. Take a deep breath and a step back. You’ve got this!
Can you check out a virtual therapy option? Like Better Health? I’ve not tried it myself. I also want to tell you that depression can just go away, based on various interventions. Now that I’m out, I end up freaking out on days where I feel down. I’m so afraid to go back to where I was. This is a struggle that maybe an objective person outside of your life might be able to contribute some insight.
I don't know what am I going to do about what is coming. I don't have the strenght to face it. I simply don't. I'm going to fail and fall even harder.
This is very wholesome. I’m dealing with the “men’s” version of this and it’s rough because after you have a deep, magical connection with someone other relationships just seem infinitely superficial in comparison. Like even if I found someone more attractive to replace them it wouldn’t replace the soul bond. Sounds cheesy but I think you might understand.
Video games are a great solace for me too, as are books. It's nice to forget reality for a while, so I really love the fantasy and scifi stuff a lot. It used to help so much, but now as soon as I'm offline, I'm flooded with the realizations of what my life is.  I even got a few games as Christmas gifts, but I have no desire to play for some reason. Even though they're kinda awesome.
also i got a gift in case there's a gift exchange my uni colleagues wanna invite me to but nope. nothing.
I felt this way last Christmas. I told myself that I’d give myself one more year. I spent this past year taking every opportunity, stopping to smell the roses and being with people I cared about, because I knew it was the last year in my life.   It’s been a year and I don’t want to Kill myself anymore. There’s still hard days, of course. But this year has taught me there’s so much I don’t want to miss out on, there’s actually so much to live for even if it’s just tiny little things, like seeing the flowers bloom in the spring.   ❤️  Edit: spelling
you’re going to be alone forever. you’ve pushed everyone away. nobody remembers you and nobody thinks about you. nobody wants you and nobody needs you. just have another panic attack and stop breathing you useless fuck. fuck this.
I feel this way.
Ooofff that’s tough. I had a similar situation where I had a friend break up with a friend who was kind of a psychic vampire and who didn’t respect my boundaries, and I finally broke it off because she said some really hurtful things to me (again) and I just really feel like a true friend wouldn’t treat me like that. I know she suffers from mental health problems too, and it’s partly why I’ve stayed close to her, I’m always aware that when she explodes at me it’s because she needs help and medication (like me), but she never appreciated it when I would try to talk to her about it, no matter how compassionately and non judgmentally I would try to bring it up. So finally I knew I needed to cut it off with her, for my own mental health, and because I couldn’t live like that anymore. It was like she was a possessive girlfriend of mine, but we weren’t even gay for each other, she was just so entitled to my time and resources. But after I cut things off, her life turned upside down in a bad way, and she only has her shitty boyfriend too (I was always trying to beg her to breakup with him because he makes her miserable, but she’s so afraid of being alone). I feel guilty for leaving her, but also I feel guilty that I overall feel much better without her dumping her issues on me everyday. I can finally focus on myself now. But, I’m not happy that she’s alone.
that's a good idea. it won't solve the problems but it's a step in the right direction to get some physical activity in. good luck, stay safe

Hey.  My story is a little similar, I was really involved but I began to question the ideology within these circles and started to feel like I didn't belong there. I was not really rejected, I just got out of it myself.  Did you get rejected because you disagreed with them? I feel like wanting to think by yourself and not being able to conform to a group often goes with feeling alone. Unfortunately groups seems to be working that way. And it takes courage to realize that and still defending your opinions. You are not a piece of shit, there is just something they can't get here.
Please call a crisis hotline. Please you are worth it❤️ if for no one else do it for some stranger on the internet
You are worth a lot to someone out there. Your parents, a friend, a significant other. You surely are going to make it out of your current feelings. So don't do anything to yourself. There is help out there, please contact your local social outreach programs. YOU ARE LOVED
that just sound like a normal person to me. not that it makes it ok, but most people are like that. people that actually care and can listen are the exception rather than the rule
Thank you! Still, it makes a difference to hear that from someone who can actually relate
It’s just that everyone’s suffering. There’s COVID, death of relatives, unemployment.   I’m just a piece of garbage - stewing over the same stuff for twenty years. I feel like I have adolescent problems into my thirties. Why would another adult with responsibilities even fucking care?
Trash pit buddies!
Yeah I feel that way a lot about some of the more depressing subs - it’s like someone saying they went through hard times because their girlfriend broke up with them and they’re stressed about school. I’m 31, single and female and never had a partner.
Still awake at 11:30 but your comment is very kind. It actually does help when someone is noticing you. Even though it’s a stranger on the internet.
Thank you ☺️
Idk, it’s just that the outside world seems to be reflecting the online world so much, that now entire friendships are built on commonalities in ideology. Problem is when my body seems to go against my own ideology, then it doesn’t work so well y’a know?   Or maybe I should stop falling in love with liberal womenZ
I'm trying to stay hopeful. I just wish I could stop wanting them.
Thanks! :)
I feel you. Last night I barely mustered the energy to reach down and plug in my phone 😔 one step at a time 💛
If you're anything like me, you will. It's funny - at first, it took three months to muster the strength to begin drawing. In the middle of it, you wonder how you're gonna finish it. And when you're done, it's always kind of sad to pack away the originals. That fear of the void always threatens to eclipse the sense of accomplishment.
Thank you 💗
I told my body that I don’t want to wake up today, I just wanted to pass away peacefully in my sleep. But it didnt happen...
Dude I can’t even sleep in a bed at night. I have a skin condition. Sleeping in a bed at night is a dream for me now
Yeah, it fucking sucks. And then people are surprised when someone commits suicide, like, 'we had no idea, why didn't they say something'. They probably did, but no one heard them.
Yep. The day started off good but just went downhill. I have too much going on, too many people pulling me different directions and just overall feeling that I’m disappointing others constantly.   I wish it was easy to travel. I need to go somewhere far away.. alone.
I want to believe that's true. it's just really disheartening when it seems like depression is only viewed through the lens of functionality. that's the only kind of depression anyone talks about - the kind where you can't get out of bed.  "high functioning depression" is a thing, but by definition, it's less severe than "regular" depression, and it's often framed as "feeling a little down" most of the time. which honestly doesn't describe me at all.  that's the rub, I guess. I maintain my hygiene, go to work and take care of my responsibilities (because I have no choice), so I can't have "regular" depression. but I can't have "less severe" persistent depressive disorder, either, because you have to experience symptoms for at least two years for it to count. and I don't think I'll make it that long.  I don't now. I'm probably not making sense. I guess it just feels unfair. my life has to completely fall apart before a medical professional will believe I'm deserving of help, but I'll be dead before I reach that point. I'm just stuck here until I go. I'm sorry. thank you for your time.
I went to a 1-yr trade school instead of college and it was one of the best decisions of my life.
Thank you :) It's been over four months now. I still get the urge to hit my head when I'm frustrated with myself, but have been able to withstand it. When I did it, I would get ashamed afterwards, and would have a headache, so it's really nice not having to worry about that, even though it's hard to stop an old habit like that.
My soul body and mind are tired
Thank you. You too.
I wish I could explain why we feel this way.  I’m tired of putting on a front.  I can’t tell anyone how I feel.  I’ve tried and they just shrug it off like it’s nothing.  Have I turned something off inside of me?  How do I turn it on?  Or do I even really want too...
I’m sorry to hear that.  This stuff sucks :/
I have PTSD...as well as depression. My whole life has been alone trapped in a room. I don't speak to people ever and don't know if I know how  I'm too ashamed to be out in the world and my symptoms make it difficult. It's hard to be around people, noises, lights...  I just feel sad that this is how it turned out considering I had a lot of hope once upon a time.
Thank you, hope you are doing well too
The only thing that gives me peace is knowing that a lot of us millennials are 'behind.' A wrecked economy and increasing political unrest can do that to a generation. I'm trying not to force the values of my parents onto my own life. It's okay to go at a slower pace, considering everything. I hope that you find peace, too.
I'm sorry that you're feeling the same way. It's a terrible thing to endure emotionally, especially given with the pandemic to help along with it.
1st year is also diff as fuck man. I had the same problem as you when i first started out and it took a lot of me to catch up. I hope you can also get back. Best to you man
Thank you ❤️
Yeah... and then when people try to say otherwise it just feels like they’re saying it out of pity or human decency makes them say it.
Thank you for acknowledging me, Internet stranger/friend.
Thank you for understanding. In my journal last night I wrote good, another day closer to my death. Some would ask but aren’t there things you want to accomplish? After I’m dead nothing will matter. It won’t matter if I finish my book. Everyone said get a dog. So a couple of weeks ago I got a little nine pound shit covered highly abused dog. I guess he is helping, the way he crawls up and nuzzles my neck. I do have a therapist once a week. Thank you again for listening.  Edit: ps I’m sorry you are/ have been dealing with SI. Why is the act of living so complicated sometimes? Be well.
do u have any tips on how to get there? i'm usually a confident person but my depression is giving me a loss of motivation and now i'm failing all of my classes.
First you need to undo decades of capitalist brainwashing. The underlying ideology of capitalism is that everyone needs to work in order to earn their living. This implies that human life is worthless and wage slavery is the only thing that gives life worth. This is why people measure their self worth based on employment or their salary or productivity.   In order to free yourself from this propaganda, look into some books written from the leftist perspective. Capitalist Realism by Mark Fisher and Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber are a good start. You can also check out r/antiwork.
I know.  Thank you.
The latest one, about two months in total, one month or so on the higher dose. At least it's not giving me any particular side effects.  I got something to help me sleep too at yesterday's appointment, and maybe if I get to sleep more the meds will help more too.
It would be easier if I didn't have to face for the entire next week if not longer.
I don’t know what I am anymore. It’s endless
I hope you're right
I’m so sorry you have to deal with it too :( but it’s good to know I’m not alone. I really hope we find something to make it all worth it
Thank you for replying. It means more than you know to hear about someone in a similar situation. I’m sorry to hear that you’re not getting the company and support you need, especially this time of year. I totally agree about all the damn holiday ads. The most realistic ad I’ve seen is of a bunch of people separately cooking these lavish dinners and happily talking to family over ZOOM. Otherwise, it’s the same Hallmark level cheesy Christmas ads and movies that make me feel bad for not enjoying the holidays this year. It’s just a sad sad time. Hopefully, 2021 is better. I hope you find at least one joy to get you through the holidays <3
Thank you.   It’s ok. I enjoyed it. On Boxing Day I came out of my depression so I didn’t mind if I had to spend my birthday alone, but I ended up getting a few visitors.
doubt I'll tell anyone else than the one person, but they should be reason enough for me to keep going for now.
Thanks, it makes me feel better that I'm not alone. I write sometimes but I end up just spiraling deeper and deeper into self hatred and going back and looking at my thoughts down on the page just reads like "I hate myself I'm so pathetic and useless and everyone hates me..." and on and on, and it kinda just makes me feel worse. I try to write about happy things instead though, even if they're just meaningless tiny things, and that makes me feel better. Hope we both make it out of this alive.  By Infp-t do you mean the personality type? That's the first result I got when I looked it up, I've never heard of it before.
I'm sorry for responding late, my job got in the way and all. But thank you so much, and I'm sorry your friends treated you like shit too. It's such a horrible feeling, why must it be a thing?  I might as well make new ones, since he was the last friend I've made in my own that stuck with me. It feels like I'm a bad judge of character, every friend I've ever made either drifted apart, or they turn out to be assholes that hurt me. At least I still have my sisters. And I hope you're not tearing yourself down mentally anymore, that's a special kind of hell tbh
she doesn’t really care, but that’s the brutal truth.   it just feels empty
Oh you might be right... Today she sent a good morning text with positive life quotes. I appreciate the sentiment but I really don't need it. It's also weird given how we were not that close before.
Aww, I'm sorry :<
I should have known better than to share. Thanks for reminding me.
thank you so much, i love ya for it
Thank you 🤗
I agree. Shit, I've fine tuned this as an automatic self defense mechanism, but I'm afraid it's very much a two way street
I mean, yeah, but there's a small logical catch there my brain really likes to get caught up on
Thank you for your kind words and advice. There was a time that I had hobbies and loved doing certain activities. But now I just work-out which I’m by no means passionate about and sit at home. I don’t really have many interests or things I love doing
I bought a Casio keyboard a few months ago - if you can afford it, I would definitely recommend!   And thank you so much for the kind words - I've had an awful weekend and reading this made me feel a bit better :)
Thanks for your message.since I wrote the previous message I took a shower even did a work meeting but then had another small argument with my husband. I felt small. I don't think I have the guts to cut. I think it is a good thing. But I snapped rubber bands. This is the third time ever. It really is helpful in distracting. I want to either talk or scream or snap. I can't talk or scream right now.    I feel pity for myself.   I appreciate what you are saying and I will keep re reading your message till I can absorb it.
Thank you
I'm not good with movies anymore. My attention span is shit and I get bored easily. I don't think I have something like that. But thank you for your reply. I hope you have a nice day.

I fantasize a lot about going on an epic fantasy quest so that a genie/divine entitiy will grant me a wish, only for the climactic end of the story to be I wish I never existed. Then, the whole timeline resets, and all the events of the story are replayed, except as if I never existed and were replaced by another person who might've been born instead of me.
Yeah. Sometimes, I feel comfortable celebrating my accomplishments (no matter how small or big they are), but I guess it's still different once you've felt how support from other people feels so much better.
Thank you I’ll check out that sub! And it’s a fantasy genre and I definitely recommend if you’re into that! It focuses a lot on characters personal growth and journey and the author has made an effort to reach out to people with mental illnesses to make any he describes as accurate as possible.
Thank you❤
I know, but in my case it was so easily avoidable. Can't help but blame myself, if I wasn't so nice and listened to my family, it wouldn't have happened. I do appreciate your concern though, thank you;;;
Thanks mate, you too
Yes just the same here. I don't want to be annoyed at anyone anymore.
Ooooooffffff saaaammmmeee  I’ve never been medicated and the doctor I just saw says let’s get on that, but I have to get a blood test and all that and I already feel myself losing my “good days” and I don’t know if I’m gonna get anything done for awhile.... but I’m hopeful if I can just get those meds maybe that perpetual waiting feeling will finally abide.... I wasted a decade in that waiting and waiting and all of a sudden it’s gone, and I don’t want to spend my 30s in the same haze. But I’m also not that hopeful really and I am sad already because I feel like a part of me knows that when I’m on my deathbed, I will just be looking back at a life of depression and still waiting for death like always...
That's tough, I remember when I was constantly under the same pressure and thoughts. You eventually get used to it, or rather I did. Sometimes I remember I'm not that old after all, and neither are you, so there's still time to get better and have a better life. Can't say I'm not extremely unhappy, but it's much harder to keep going on if you don't believe in some tiny smidgen of light at the end of the tunnel.
I'm going to try playing it later, I usually spend this time of the day playing pokemon or some other game on my switch, but I've just been crying instead lol  The game is graveyard keeper, I actually really enjoyed the game on pc, I even bought the DLCs last year during the summer steam sales I think, even though my laptop had already broken down at the time. Since I don't have a pc to play on anymore, I decided to buy it again on switch since it was on sale for $15 for the base game, plus 2 DLCs.   I actually have celeste, a friend gifted it to me, but platformers are not really games I play much. I have the worst coordination and I couldn't even get past the 2nd stage. It does look like a good game but I don't think I can play it. I'm glad it was a good memory for you and I'm sorry you don't play games much anymore :( The monster hunter demo just came out though, if that's your cup of tea, maybe try it out? I know my love for games rekindles from time to time when I try out something new.
Maybe. I know my therapist is terrible at keeping up with admin work but it was basically a smooth back and forth of emails until it just...stopped. :s
Also thanks for taking the time to ask me a question. I appreciate it.
Honestly so many things? I'm not quite sure. Social isolation is very hard on my mental health, so 2020 has been rough, but I managed until recently. The catalyst was when my 1.5 year old puppy  (ESA, I also have PTSD) herniated some disks in his spine on Christmas Eve and he is on crate rest for 6 weeks. We don't quite know how it happened, so I have immense guilt that I did something wrong somehow. For the past 2.5 weeks I'm just constantly worried about him. Is the shaking normal? Is if from meds? did he somehow get hurt more? Why is he crying? Is he bored? Does he have to go out again even though he was out an hour ago and we aren't suppose to be having him move a lot? is he somehow in pain even though he is on meds? I can't really leave his side because of his medication schedule, and I just feel stuck. Mentally, physically, emotionally. So I just feel empty. This week I've noticed some bad habits of other mental health struggles coming back too. But my husband and I are trying to adopt and if I have to see a therapist then our home study would get revoked until I get clearance from the therapist and that would be a whole other ordeal. We also had a failed adoption match this week, and 2 more friends announced they're pregnant.
Yeah. Thank you. Happy cake day.
I feel that. Anytime I try to talk to people I’m just left on read or they just give one word responses.  I’ve reached out to several people tonight and they’re all busy. So I guess it’s just me and my thoughts tonight.   We’ll get there one day.
Thanks, also wishing you a great day.
>I've been avoiding all my friends for weeks now because my problems have grown so much lately I don't have the ability to empathize with them anymore.  oh man, I relate to this. :(  my ability to offer emotional support (not to mention financial or material support, like helping someone pay a bill or running an errand for them, etc) has greatly diminished this year. I'm still trying, but it's so hard, and honestly part of me doesn't want to keep trying when I know I can't ever count on the same support in return... which feels incredibly selfish on my part.  I don't know. I always tried to be a good friend and I feel like depression has turned me into a shitty one. or maybe I was always shitty and selfish, I just had the inner reserves to pretend I wasn't.  in any case, I don't have anything to offer other people, so I feel like I should avoid them as much as possible.
Sorry man, I’ve been there. Happy birthday
Thank you for your kindness, stranger<3
I typed a long ass reply and just deleted it halfway. Probably not worth it to discuss this with you.
I’m trying to remember that things will get better. I don’t see a professional but I’ve thought about reaching out to my primary care doctor since she’s so nice and understanding. I just get nervous when I even think about bringing it up to anyone.
haha thanks for replying man. I feel a bit better. I'm mainly just a bit stressed about getting a job in my field now. covid sucks.
I'm not sure though. I have no idea how I'm supposed to work 8 hours a day. Still got all my problems I had at my last job which are still unsolved. I'm so addicted to selfdestruction and I have screaming anxiety about my former therapist, often she also made me worse. Already can't see anything remotely positive in this and feeling very awful.   Wish you good luck though.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
I wish I was in my twenties. I'm 40. And I got my PhD 14 years ago. I've come to realise that nobody is perfect, that most of my issues are caused by expecting perfection from others and myself. Yes, as you say, I've come to realise that people are only human. But when I get into foul moods, it is impossible to block out bad thoughts.
I'm 28 and I'm still deluding myself that I can possibly heal my fucked up head  Ha, what a joke
I needed the internet hug. Thank you.
thanks. i needed to hear that :)
Hey happy early birthday!
thank you. that's really kind of you to say.
thank you.
Thank you for the advice, I will also contact a social psychiatric center tomorrow and seek help, I am sure they can also help me to deal with any work related problems.
Yeah there's a sort of euphoria/high to fasting or restricting, can make it kind of addicting. I'm prone to low blood sugar and faintness so I've been eating a bit so I don't pass out or anything but mostly food doesn't seem worth the effort.   And that sounds terrible, I'm sorry you've been through this and wish you the best!
Depressed skinny legends rise
thank you for this
Hey I appreciate that, it's nice to hear from another artist. Yes, definitely a little is better than not at all. That's so awesome you're going to have your art at a show. It'll be good, anyone who's art has made it to a show is worth looking at. I guess we shouldn't be hard on ourselves, especially in this insane year.
Thanks for the reply! It’s always good to hear from someone with similar thoughts and feelings. My loneliness has recently been getting worse. I am graduating soon and just got an engineering job far away from my folks. It’s great since I’m putting my degree to use but...the impending loneliness is killing me inside. I’m diving into the deep end with new living space, new job, new everything, and I’m utterly terrified. A lot of my time right now, I spend distracting myself from my situation. I don’t feel ready, but I also know if I’ll probably never feel ready the way I want to be. If you don’t mind my asking, how do you deal with change in your life? Especially major changes like becoming independent?
And if you’ve never experienced depression or mental illness they will never understand. There was a reason that my house looked like the FBI tossed it for 8 years, and it wasn’t just me being lazy.
I could go to a GP...my therapist isn't working out atm. I'm just afraid that they'll find something really wrong and that I'll be hospitalised or something
I think there are people who fluctuate faster, if I understood my therapist correctly. I can't concentrate well so take that with a grain of salt! I remember the test I got to see if I was depressed asked about my feelings the last two weeks.
Yea so I have had slight depressive symptoms ever since I'm in middle school (7th grade). That was when I move to america from vietnam to study and i didnt have any friends for the longest time. I have always felt lonely, isolated and never really fitting in. Plus my natural tendency to self hate and social anxiety doesn't help either.  I started having suicidal thoughts when I was a junior in college.  I remember nights when I cry to myself alone in my dorm room questioning why I am where I am and contemplating how nice it would be if I can just cease to exist.  So yea it has been going on for a while to some degree. But the symptom really worse ever since covid kicked in and I'm more isolated at home. I become majorly depressed to the point of not wanting to get out of bed. I cry myself to sleep sometimes and the idea of ending my life becomes more prominent. But luckily in the last 2 months I managed to change all that and overcome my depression. Which is why I want to share my exp in the off chance that it be of some help for you guys. I know everyone's exp with depression is different but I just wanted to offer my exp.  And no offense taken. Please ask away if you're curius about anything  Edit: and yes i know it's weird that I turn around so quick. Honestly I'm even shocked myself and are my family. I was totally prepared for a life of depression, however long I decide to live further, but lo and behold, here I am positive and motivated to live and actually scared of dying haha. Which is all the more reason i feel compelled to share my experience and perspective to people here who are currently still struggling with depression. That change is possible, that there is a chance of recovery and I want to offer some general help/advice in the hope that it might help you guys
Thanks man 😌
Thank you! Your kind words mean more than you know <3
Thanks
Thank you for the validation. I really needed that today!
I like that - take comfort in the smallest things. ❤️
Thank you
I don't think anyone else thinks of last year and thinks, "wow her gifts were so meh, did she put any effort in at all," which is what I'm thinking in my head. I think they all really liked the gifts and it was so fun to give them out.  Thanks for your response, best wishes to you this Christmas as well :)
Think he just lost it, idk where he lives exactly but he always does 20 over posted coming home from work or wherever. Our road's sloped down to that intersection which levels out so he got nice and launched into the snowbank lol  He seemed to be fine but the decorations the homeowner had out are totally trashed by the look of it. Truck's still sitting there, nobody's willing to tow it until tomorrow according to the responding cop.
Nope, the good ol USA  H-How are they climbing a McDonald's tho  As in, they try to climb the building or like, in the drive thru window or something
Thank you, I'm trying but just sad :( You hang in there as well
>HANG IN THERE  Bruh
Just realized what you meant.  Lol. Kinda drunk again because I hate myself and drinking helps a lot.   Nah I didn't hang in there. Thank you for your concern. The suicidal thoughts come once a week or so and we will see how far I go next time. Love u bro.
I don't think she blames you for the current state of your relationship, whatever it is. But she probably feels helpless bc she can't do anything about her family, but she also doesn't want to leave her family. And she might feel like you don't understand what she's going through or how she feels, especially if you're persistent about wanting her family to know. The best thing to do may be to be patient and be grateful that you have each other. Coming out can't be rushed and it needs to be on her own time. Just support her until she's ready, even if it is only as a friend.
Thank you, you've made a lot of sense when nothing else has. I do need to seriously have a bunch of time off but I've basically been told that I can't until I'm done with the project I'm stuck on. You've given me a bunch to think about, I really appreciate it.
thank you that was beautiful. thank you so much
>Omg yes. When you say "programming" wdym?   Like automatically feeling the need to be helpful/servient to others even if you don't really want to. Or automatically feeling guilty if someone else might feel bad even though it isn't even your fault.   Or like people who feel forced to apologize all the time, even though they don't want to. Like that, kinda.
Its been a weird benefit. I hate people seeing my face. I'm hugely insecure. So having half my face covered all the time has been a bit of a relief.
that's really kind of you to say. thank you. it means a lot to hear someone else say that. I just wish there was some clear path toward getting better. thank you again.
it was really kind of you to say this. thank you. unfortunately it wasn't possible for me to really celebrate. but it doesn't matter. thank you again. it means a lot.
thank you for your kind words. unfortunately, and without rambling on too much... getting another job isn't going to work out for me, especially with the pandemic. I've been searching, but no luck. I have no degree and no real skills, plus I live in a rural area where there simply aren't other companies similar to mine. I lucked into this job about three years ago and it's the "best" job I can hope to get, given my lack of accomplishments and skills.  I'm sorry to be so negative. you seem very kind. it's just that sometimes, there really is no way out.
>*Also, your autistic vs. "healthy" is a pretty mean outlook, even if you don't mean it as an insult.  Yeah, might not the best phrasing. But I'm so done with other people telling me "you know, healthy people are having the same problems as you do, they aren't any different in this". And then being told by the same people "wtf do you mean, you aren't able to open a letter? Or open a door? Or answer a phone call?".  When you're already doubting everything and trying to make sense into this mess and you hear the first one and think "wait do they really? Do they also struggle so much with basic human functions? Cause that means that 1, they're so much better in this than you are cause they can do it _and_ have a functioning professional life and 2, there's just no help for you cause they just told you, everyone is dealing with this, you just have to deal with it on your own, get over".  Feels like gaslightning. At that point you're doubting all your problems and you're asking yourself if you're even allowed to ask for help.  The 'awareness' that one is having a problem that also actually deserves getting professional help is a very important one. And then other people trying to take it away from you again just fucking sucks.   If you don't like the word "healthy" in this context use "functioning" instead cause it fits way better and there are also well-functioning and a bit less functioning autistic people, same with people with or without mental health conditions.  E: and I don't want to "gatekeep". I don't want to "brag", I don't want to overly identify with illness. I just don't want other people to make me worse. Had a lot of trouble with "you got no right to be (physically) ill, you got no right to have problems" in my life so it's particularly bad when it's happening again.
Thanks for the support i truly appreciate it more than you know. I just feel lost lately and so sad and depressed constantly ive tried a few therapists and usually i just stop going because i never feel like im getting anything out of it at all but it could just be because i havnt had a good therapist yet i dont know everything has just been hell lately  and im just struggling. Ill do my best to try and keep moving forwards but it can be so hard when you cant even give youre self the drive to get off the couch/my bed.
Thank you for the kind words i appreciate it ive been trying to take it one day at a time the bestni can sometimes it just seems impossible but ill get through and its just terrible because i loved her with all my heart and soul and she just said im going to my dads for dinner and just never came back left all of her stuff here so now i sit in what was our apartment with her stuff all around me and it kills me ive asked her to come get it she wont i dont want to throw it away it has alot of her stuff from her childhood and i dknt want to be the person that throws away all her childhood belongings that would be a terrible thing to do and thats not me so idk what to do its just so unbelievably hard to be here without her looking at all her stuff the pictures of us all together as a family all over the place its just so sad it kills me its just unbelievably hard thats the best i can explain it but ill survive thank you for the support!
Yeah I feel broken, because I can’t find the balance. I’m either too distant or too needy.
I’m a terrible procrastinator, I think about the future but not when I screw my future self over! lol
hey, thanks. I did a little more research and found an online service that will connect you with a doc and evaluate whether medication is an option.  unfortunately, I did their online self-assessment and the result they gave me was that I am apparently literally "too depressed" for their service to "safely" provide me with treatment.  I put out a social media feeler and a close friend has offered to provide me with some short-term assistance; so I guess the next step, long-term, is to secure insurance and then figure out a way to be properly assessed and diagnosed. mental health services in my area are utter garbage (too few practicing therapists, insane waitlisting) but I am generally under the impression that I should be able to access some kind of telehealth services.  which would be preferable anyway since, ya know, we're living in plague times.
Talked to my former therapist about it. Which is a very conflicting thing by itself because she also often made me a lot worse, and she also really recommends me going to someone else. Unable to do it.  At least she understands why I have problems with the job center. I can't sign up there, I can't deal with any pressure, can't deal with them pushing me to sign up for jobs I'm absolutely not capable of. Just escalating.   Talking with their psychologists would be so superficial and fake, I literally can't be honest with people and had to lie on the spot.   Can barely talk to former therapist despite knowing her... And knowing that this is mostly inconsequential.   Still no idea how I'm supposed to work. I don't even know why, I'm literally too dysfunctionable to spend money. It's just paying bills and then breaking down at home again.
Finding God/similar. It can help in the short term and you might think that was what was missing in your life, But you still need to get to the root of your depression, otherwise religion can turn out to be another habit just used to hide your problems temporarily.  I don't mean to be disrespectful to the church, I'm not sure if I believe in God or not. This was what happened with me. I used religion just like alcohol and drugs, to temporarily fix my problems.
You’re right. If I have to put a mask on, they aren’t hanging with the real me anyway. My friends should respect my health and my choices.
Thank you!
Thank you this means a lot!
I am 25. I'm very embarrassed that I still live at home. Plus my credit is bad because I was hospitalized 3 times and went to two outpatient programs due to severe mental health issues.
It’s CaptainSparklez, he plays minecraft, among us and other stuff. I hope you find some happiness, if not in him then someone else
I dunno, I was planning on emailing her to ask but then I remembered that I only get a discount if I show up with cash (have no insurance; USA! Freedom to die in the street baby!), and that I hadn't payed for my appointment in advance so either way I'm kinda fucked.
Thank you so much :)
Yeah.. cant sleep more than 3 or 4 hours no matter what I do. If I try to sleep I wake up  because of anxiety or panic. I just cant sleep peacefully.
Thank you.
Thanks for the suggestion. Will check it out :)
Hey, sorry to hear that you're feeling the same. I finished my interview and it went okay ; everyone's pretty friendly although I have no idea if I could get the offer. You're right. We're in this together. I hope that you won't feel overly anxious and that your interview goes well. No matter what, you should treat yourself after the interview because you put in the effort.
I think you’re doing the right thing in offering support to others.
No no, they were right  I've recently realized that I'm a emotional vampire, so I'm trying really hard not to slip into those tendencies. They had every right to say it tbh
I can’t get a pet at the moment. But I genuinely appreciate the suggestion
Yeah. Been trying for a long time to do anything else, pick out a new therapist and do 'serious' therapy. Struggling to find some will to get better and to get over bad experiences in therapy in the past. I'm so disappointed and so low expectations. Also self-sabotaging and lots of anxiety. Finding it super difficult trusting anyone again.
My son is in his 20’s and no, my husband won’t do any therapy with me. He’s fine with the roommate situation. In fact, I’m in the guest room right now bc I now have insomnia, and when I do sleep, I have terrible nightmares. I’m a “bother” to pretty much everyone. For all practical purposes, I’m alone.
I would too, but I'm afraid of having the same drama I've had in the past. If I was normal and more sociable it wouldn't be a problem
Just started feeling that way... although I did get my period so I'm telling myself that's possibly why. It doesn't usually affect my mood like this though. I guess we'll see next week.
:( I'm sorry. It's the worst feeling. If it helps give you some hope moving forward... I had a very emotional but helpful therapy appointment yesterday where I cried almost the entire time about how bad I felt and how I must be relapsing and etc. etc.   My therapist is wonderful and she had me try to brainstorm even one thing I could do to just break my depression routine (which involves basically being glued to my couch and watching TV for hours every night while feeling miserable) - she pointed out that it can help perpetuate the depression and sometimes even just doing one small thing can help to get out of that (lighting a candle, sitting in a different part of my house and listening to music instead of watching TV, spending a few minutes sitting out on my porch in the cold, even just walking through my house... something fairly easy and manageable but outside of the norm).   We also talked about one of the daily goals I set up when I started therapy (keeping the sink clear of dishes... sounds silly but it has a big impact on my mood and tends to get out of control and overwhelm me) because I hadn't put any dishes away in days. She said sometimes therapy is helpful just to feel accountable, and asked if I felt like it would be possible and helpful to just unload the dishwasher as soon as I got off our call, just to get it done and have something to feel good about.  And we also talked about putting it in perspective. Even though I was feeling super shitty it's still better than I felt a few months ago. It's not my fault, it's just my brain chemistry. Everyone has bad days sometimes, and it doesn't mean it will last forever.  And seriously - I got off that call, went to go unload the dishwasher like we agreed, but also remembered to turn some music on... I felt good enough after doing that to take the trash out. And then I felt good enough to take a shower. I shit you not, it completely turned my mood around and I'm feeling pretty good today.  Anyways, that was really long and I know I'm just rambling about myself and it might be irrelevant - but one of the things I struggle with when I'm feeling depressed is feeling like I can't fix it and it'll last forever. So hopefully this gives you some ideas or at least hope that you might come out of this in a couple days. Good luck.

In this boat right now and in this boat at least once or twice a week, you’re not alone 👊🏽
I'm doing a bit better at the moment thankfully, but thank you, I really appreciate the offer.
Hey man sorry I haven't responded. This is an alt that I don't use often. Sorry if I burst your bubble a bit. I've battled this shit pretty much ever since I can remember. I wish I had some words of wisdom to help anyone else but I don't. My problems aren't due to my career or family or anything else. It's all because of what's in my head. If I could ever just overcome that I'd be good, but I don't know how.   Best of luck. If you ever figure anything out please let me know.
I love this. Seconded 🙂
Feels like involving my family with this is bad. They don’t want to be in this when they are having the best life. I’m even doubting myself about this depression. Why do I have days where I feel completely okay? Is it because I was able to distract myself or am I just faking it to make excuses.
I'm so sorry to hear that, man. But I do really feel you on this one. It reminds me of everything I wish to have and wish to be. I hope we survive the holidays without wanting to disappear. Good luck, my friend.
Hey, thanx man. I care about you too. I hope you had a great Christmas! Sending positive vibes!!
thanks. i feel a but better after a nap. messages like urs rly mean a lot regardless of advice/help. so thanks again. i appreciate it
Yes I can relate. Its wearying accepting you're alone, but well that's how it is. Still I hope we can still find something good somewhere
Im starting to not care about how it would impact others that’s the issue here :/
I'm here. Trying to lose myself in work. It's a little bit effective. Hoping to keep that going for the day.  I know typing that sentence took very little effort on your part, but it means a lot for someone to reach out with just a simple question like that. Thank you.
It just really sucks. I was looking forward to relaxing and not feeling any stress. But I don't know where this came from. I'm sorry you're also going through it too. I've been trying to distract myself, but it's been difficult.
Not in college, but I’m in a gaming club that can’t meet rn in this situation
what you're saying makes sense and I know it's good advice. distracting myself with different hobbies, activities, forms of entertainment, etc was my coping mechanism for a long time. this will sound stupid, but honestly, having things to enjoy or look forward to - even little things related to a dumb hobby - helped me so much and made life bearable.  unfortunately nothing really helps these days. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I struggle to focus and I'm not able to distract myself from my thoughts and feelings the way I could before. it's constant and has been for months.  I've tried everything I can think of - things I always enjoyed before, as well as new things. and not just hobbies/activities, but mindfulness exercises, CBT worksheets, etc. just anything I can think of. I don't know what to do anymore. it's pretty much hopeless. I wish it were different. I really did try.  anyway. I'm sorry to be such a downer. thank you for your time. it meant a lot.
Thanks bro I really appreciate it. I’m feeling a bit better today but it really helped to wake up to your message. I hope you have an awesome day.
Thank you!
Well I joined a club today. I don't think I'm going to enjoy it, but welp. It's something I guess. I'll work on my hobbies if I get time after homework too. I still just don't feel the point though. Nothing makes me happy right now.
I get you it's pretty much the same for me. Sometimes I feel like I'm always on the verge of breaking down..I have to try so hard not to cry but sometimes I want to cry but can't even shed a single tear.
Thanks. I just really regret a lot and I think I messed up my future.
Sorry, I don't know what is wrong with me.
Oh man. If I could drive that is very likely something I would have ended up doing too.
This is not an everyday emotion as there are time where I put my trust in him, but it seems to fail most times. I don’t think there will ever come a time where I will have complete faith as I easily reflect on the misfortunes of the world both past and present.
I could if there was anything I am interested in doing. I used to run long distances (half marathons and trail races) and that kept me busy. Not able to do that anymore due to back issues and nothing else interests me. I used to bowl but my wife is immune compromised so I have to limit what I can do so she doesn't get sick. reddit and tiktok and silly games on my phone is pretty much all I do anymore. I used to play this mafia game but my anger got me in trouble with that so can't play that anymore either.
Yeah, I am struggling to find something. I don't really love myself and it doesn't seem like anyone else does either. I have no hobbies. I did buy a bike that I want to ride but at the end of the work day, I then have to switch over to cooking and whatever else and once all that is done, I just can't get motivated to go ride. I know if I did I'd feel better but I am so emotionally and physically exhausted. I'm tired from sun up to sun down
My life history is a reply to another person. I got too carried away.
you’re always going to be alone so it’s about time to get used to  it like damn
how did you handle it?
Hey! This is great news! I struggle with negative automatic thoughts too, so when they are proven wrong I feel like a double win! Stay safe :)

Thanks. I'd feel way too uncomfortable getting donations. I have nothing to do all day and spend all my time online with no other source of income (from paid working) so an online job would be natural, but I'm depersonalised and feel so inferior to everyone.   I'd feel bad getting discounts in the shops just randomly because of my looks and felt bad when a guy bought me a drink when I knew he wasn't interested, so donations make me really uncomfortable...  Maybe it's something I have to get used to or maybe it's just my character, idk...
I’m barely hanging on day to day and wondering what’s the point. I’m going to have to fire my new therapist and seeing her was what was getting me going day to day   I’m getting older and rotting and telling myself to hang on but maybe it’s just denying reality
Thank you 💜
It's not what she literally said, just what I'm feeling. I feel like I lost any right to complain a long time ago, _she_ wanted me to move on and go to a mental hospital three years ago. That just didn't work. I'm super stuck and bothering her ~every six months because I'm not able to do more, and she's only talking to me as an offer and probably some small short-term fix. Or it being like a crisis hotline and being at least _one_ adress I can call.  None of that is healthy or leading anywhere. She has offered me a number of other things to do, wasn't able to do any of them. Just super, super stuck.
I was in a pretty dark place last night so I wasn’t thinking too well. My therapist no longer takes my insurance so I’m waiting for my new insurance to kick in and try and start again.
I haven't had therapy since I graduated college last summer but I'm going to be signing back up once my health insurance kicks in in January.  I'm just kind of stressing things way too much because this is my first job out of college and it's very different from anything I've ever done so I'm making a lot of mistakes right now. That combined with sleep deprivation and SAD has me a bit screwed up right now, not gonna lie.
That's a pretty good idea, but I think I'd be scared to take a note out of my pocket in the same way I'm scared to bring it up.
[deleted]
Thank you!!
That’s me with my boyfriend. I always feel like he’s ranting at me. I try to be positive but he just makes life feel so hopeless sometimes and that really messes with my mental health. I told him he needs to go talk to a therapist and not me because I can’t handle the negativity. It’s a struggle.
I appreciate that. Covid kinda turned my life goals on its head. Now I'm left at a crossroads. I haven't taken the time to reexamine what I want. I'm kinda just stagnant at a bullshit job trying to save up cash. Every day just it just gets harder and harder to exist. Its just really hard to keep moving when the past, present, and future all seem shitty.  I'll try to put some thought into it.
Just trying to be normal but my fucked up mind cant stay calm.  just cant do anything without beating up myself. .Im just tired of this shit. Im doing ok tho.  Really Thanks for asking. :)
Chore accomplished !👍  As this is Friday night,my neighbor restaurant's customers are annoying :/ I don't want to be quarantine police because nothing is enforced here,but I'm nervous after someone left gross thing under my apartment's postbox.I cannot trust fellow Japanese ,especially younger people anymore.Meh.sorry for vent!
Oh, for goodness's sake! Someone actually replied! <3  ---  > you know what's across the streets from the gates of meccah? a fucking KFC!!! bullshit..   What the fuck?! I've never been to Mecca or Arab for that matter, and I didn't expect a KFC to stand there. And those fanatics that surrounded my daily life often yell in a proudly manner that there won't even be any KFCs or western-related things in the Holy Land Arab. Fucking bullshits.  > the religion and stigma basically fucking my whole life up. never seeing eye to eye with those who gave birth to me because of this religion they were brainwashed into.  Finally someone gets it! Yes, yes! You're absolutely right. And your wording is so precise I can relate to you in many levels. I've been living with this family for as long as I can remember, but I feel more and more disconnected each day passes. They expect me to be religious, or else I'm no part of the family.  Someday, I'll show them the result of their game. I will definitely do. If they so don't want me to be around, so be it.  > I'm here to talk more if you want.  Thanks! Let this thread be our space to vent about this bullshit.
I wouldn't want that on you.
Thank you for the advice, and yeah I've always heard stories of people overcoming depression. It always sound so foriegn to me, that people can actually get out of this and live a content life, maybe its because the cloud is over my head and I just don't see it yet, idk I'm tired of overthinking for today haha. I appreciate you commenting, it made me a feel a bit better.
yeah i’m with you on the watching the same show. it’s too much work to find something new so i just watch the same shows i’ve been watching the last few years. but with time you will find meds that work. i found some once. it didn’t last very long bc i fucked it up but it works. also it’s hard with therapy & opening up to this total stranger that you know is only talking to you because they’re getting paid. it’s good u have motives to stay alive. i hope things start looking up for you, for real.
It probably isn't related, but it might have to do with the fact I quit working out. I also quit drinking, that might be a slight change.  I think I'm going to try and start meds because I'm just so exhausted. I don't think I can keep putting this much effort into hardly scraping by.
It really sucks
Thanks I hope you're doing good as well.
Thanks. Your encouragement really means a lot right now. Take care and stay safe too.
Thanks! It's in 2 weeks
Thank you
I was really hopeful when it seemed like getting help for mental health issues was becoming more normal, but it’s personally made me feel so much worse. I went to therapy this year and almost lost my job.
Thank you. I hope you have a good day.
Really does.
Yeah, I can't wait to move out because as soon as I defend myself I'd get kicked out.
idk what to do honestly lol
thank you. that made me feel a bit better
Thank you, you too. I was this close to giving up today but thank God I managed to pull through. Stay safe.
My mom gaslighted me again today. I'd do anything to not talk to her. I begged her to not talk to or try to call me this month since I am so stressed financially and otherwise. I bet she wont respect my simple wishes. When I said I was working on the bill, she was acting like I 'wanted to work on it'. And she was just calling to 'wish me a happy new year' BULLSHIT. If I go into bankrupcy I blame her entirely. I have to go work with people who don't respect me worth a damn. Just like my mom doesn't she takes for granted that I will be there answering her god damned calls. NOPE I am so fucking done. That money could have gone to food and medicine for me, but no. And god knows I need medicine dealing with her fucking abuse for 30 LONG years on end. I'm drinking wine right now. It's cheap, its good.  I resolved that every time they disrespect, or call me against my will, or erode my very being in some way, I will take a drink.   They forbid me from so many things, from making money, to having a bank account, now I am a paper hoarder thanks to them, papers all over my desk. I have such an unhealthy relationship with money and other people. All because my parents didnt love me a damn.  I have to remember I am strong in SPITE of them. I am a human and I deserve respect, and expect respect.
I was super into chakras and everything surrounding that a long time ago. I don't know why I moved on from all of that. Thanks for reminding me. I guess it's worth a shot to do again.

I’m so glad that worked for you! I struggled with shaking when I took it, but I noticed it did help mood for a while. I’m glad it’s helping, good luck!
Aw, how long has it been for you? Some days are really rough for me.  I feel like my mind is stuck on when the relationship ended even though it was last year. And my ex and I also haven’t been in contact which helps but I still think about him more often than I should.
Kinda denied, Company policy says I have to have a therapist at their facility, I already have a therapist so that's not really an option for me.
You were right
I am an addict as well.  This year will make it 10 years
Okay I've tried discord. Multiple times. It never works. It's just a chamber for people to shout into and only the ones who shout the most are the ones that are noticed and heard. No one can just... exist and be recognized as a part of the group unless you make a hell of an effort to make yourself heard as loud and obnoxious as you can. Because it's not like friends in real life. You can't just *exist* and be recognized as a part of the group there because people physically SEE you like in real life. In a discord of just 20 or so people who knows whose actually online and watching a conversation in the present without actively participating? There's nothing like that period.  So as a said before, it becomes a shouting contest of who can shout the most and garner the most amount of attention, just like the rest of the internet. And there's just so much shouting and so much going on that it's impossible to think of any thing besides how stressed and miserable and alienated you feel and how you WISH someone could just see how miserable and stressed you are. But like you said, people aren't trash cans so you leave the discord again because nobody can possibly understand you period. This is your life. You're me now and you wish you were dead.
So much of this yes.  My mind has it planned out what I'm supposed to be doing after work but nothing ever happens.
Thank you I will try so hard just for you
Yea. It would be nice to travel to an island far away from human civilization. Doc gave me more pills to make me feel even more dazed. I guess being dazed and drugged up is better than being suicidal.
it was really kind of you to say this. I mean it. I'm glad that things seem to be looking up for you. I hope that momentum continues. I just don't believe it could be the same for me anymore. I used to hope that it would, but not anymore. thank you again for being so nice.
Thank you. I don't think that this is the cause of my depression, rather it's been a running theme for the past five-six years, maybe something in the background and closely related to the trauma around "core beliefs" like you said, and this lack of validation (where I see people in popular culture or online getting the validation that I always lacked, but feel uncomfortable putting myself out there in a performative way to get this (maybe false?) validation, if that makes sense.   >It sounds like your therapist is trying to help you to get stabilized so you can get healthy enough to get out of your rut.  I think that this is accurate. It's just that I've been in a rut for so long that I'm filled up with shame. The times I thought were "too late" before were filled with opportunity that I've missed out on.   EMDR is not applicable in my case (I've tried it before and had too many bad experiences,) but thank you for the suggestion.
Mysogonistic views are one of the reasons for violence against women. I am recovering from depression and anxiety and I got so depressed thinking why some women think men as bad generally or they just generalize it without meaning to. I have huge respect for women but I too wanted to be respected without being judged as everyone watch porn nowadays. Ya maybe certain porn does lead to violence... or not. If you see sex ed in Netflix, you'd understand fetish won't affect real life action much. Maybe it may affect a harmonal teenager or  a deranged adult who can't see the difference between fantasy and reality. That's why many argue revenge porn maybe destructive to watch.
I am really sorry as it's very insensitive to talk, but I was feeling very depressed while talking because mainly some women said that they ignore or hate men in general. I understand that men at top of the ladder are not giving proper equal opportunity to women. But there are so many men at the bottom of the ladder too. Please see why women shouldn't blame men in Google,to understand a little about this. I am sorry again for saying such insensitive thing, because I know there are many women who are made to feel insecure because of this. I just hope we all empathize with each other as humans then having a dividing line between us. And please don't generalize men with those monsters who do that kind of violence against women. There are many loving fathers,husbands and respectable men who have no problem to sacrifice their life so their family could live happily. Those are men not these monsters who can't control their own actions and act with sick mentality.
I have visited 7-11 in Thailand and they are amazing. Love the prepackaged food. The Japan 7-11s look similar and would love to visit one.
Thank you. It helps me too and I still hold on to it
I don't think you are unlikeable. Maybe your friends are more self-absorbed. I think it's best we don't waste our energy on these friends. Not to say that we should cut them off, but we only give as much as we receive from them. This is what I have been trying to do lately
Thank you, i really appreciate that
Yeah I go outside for food often but not much else. Quarantine menas I can't stay outside in cafes. Thank you.
[deleted]
Thank you. I've already tried therapy, meds, the whole 9 so much with no success that I've sorta given up on it honestly
Nothing else has worked, if this doesn't I think I'm done
I don't have a drug/alcohol problem...I'm not really comfortable in those groups (in the one time I went to one when I was in a crisis house...)  I have a support group on discord and some old Facebook friends and have made a few potential friends in fandom  I just need to get up the courage to go on voice chat. I'm so ashamed of my life/myself that I've isolated myself from everyone. I know it's not the opportunities for friendship/connection it's me...  But I've let it go on for so long not sure how to stop it  Edit: Sry I forgot I typed that first part out already
what’s the point man, there’s no benefit to being the good guy, I always lose, might as well be bad n go out with a bang
Great advice, one small simple step at a time
i’m fucked i’m so fucked and i don’t want to be alone
That’s exactly how I feel. I feel bad for leaving her alone especially because it couldn’t have happened at a more worse time but also feel like it was an unavoidable thing. I texted her my condolences and my support for her but she did not respond and I don’t think I’m the person she wants to see right now but I know full well that she’s fully relying on her boyfriend so it makes things worse. She also used me like a therapist friend so I also felt an emotional toll like you did.

Woke up at 1 pm. Very out of it. Forgot wallet. Heading home to get it.
I wish you weren't so hard on yourself 😔 what makes you say that your problems are problems an adolescent should only have? If you don't mind me asking. And yeah, COVID is hell. Especially for people who are severely depressed too I feel like. It's got to be an awful feeling to be suffering but feeling like your pain isn't as valid as someone who lost their job or is battling sickness.
I'm in my 30's and I still have teenage-level angst.   One of the biggest things I learned this year, a huge personal revelation: I was taught growing up that I was not allowed to feel badly for myself because other people have it worse. Someone ALWAYS has it worse. What I did instead was fixate on those I thought had it worse than me and imagine how bad \*they\* must be feeling, and just be absolutely haunted by how bad it must be for other people.      the realization? I was projecting my feelings about myself and my life onto them. The sadness that I rightfully should be allowed to feel for myself, I was projecting onto those who in my mind "deserved" it. They were my feelings though. Of course I was absolutely haunted by how "they" must feel ... I had all these unprocessed emotions about shit that was horrible and inescapable that I endured as a child.      it's ok to feel sad for things you've experienced. It doesn't make you selfish.
I'm 35 and I've had plenty of partners...lack of romantic partners has never been an issue, at least for me.  Hope things get better for you.
Bro you say that, but rLGBTMuslims has 1.4k followers so theres plenty of others with common ideals to yours. (And that's everyone out of the closet)  Liberal women tend to be...well...liberal. so strict doctrines may not be so readily adopted but they for sure will be accepted. The LGBTQ+ community in general is super accepting I mean just look at that accepting ass title lmao. You can be loved and appreciated without a dedicated partner. Is there anyway to compromise with your ideology and your body?
What is it that you want?
where do you sleep?
I feel this. At one point I tried to talk to myself so I’d have at least one person on my side setting up someone stronger nicer and really thoughtful... but then I’d feel like I was slipping more into insanity.
I hear you.
No, you're definitely making sense. I've heard psychiatrists talk about this: the trap that people in their profession fall into where it almost becomes the case that "asking for help" is proof that you don't need help. Really unfortunate. I hope you're able to shop around or something and find someone who takes you seriously, the way you deserve.
IMO high-functioning doesn’t necessarily have to mean less severe. Maybe you are actually that depressed, but you are also exceptionally determined.   I fall into this category. If a medical professional won’t believe you, find another medical professional. It’s hard enough to get through the day every day and to drag yourself into an appointment without having to also convince some dumbass, skeptical dr that you’re not “being dramatic” or making things up.
Those questions at the end...those are the questions I ask myself, too, fellow human. Seriously, DO I want to turn it on? Or did I turn it off out of necessity? Can I selectively flip it on and back off based on my circumstances and the environment I'm in?
I resonate with the part about there once being hope.  I used to be outgoing, social, CONFIDENT, hopeful, and driven.  Now I am scared and still.   I want to be alone but am sad and lonely.  Feels so icky.
Hey. I'm so sorry to hear that. I can't imagine how difficult it is to have to deal with both depression and PTSD. It's especially difficult when you don't speak to people. However, this community is here with you so you should always feel free to share your experience or connect with others here. I think that's the magic and beauty of the internet.  With regards to having difficulty socializing and feeling ashamed of yourself, I wholeheartedly empathize you with because I have felt the exact same thing before.  What I can say is this: those two things can be fixed. Do not feel like you have to stay like this forever. Instead, believe that you have the power to change and reinvent yourself.
It sure is.
I understand the feeling. Since you’re depressed, you can’t imagine wanting to accomplish anything. It sucks.   I love that you’re taking care of a dog. Mine cheer me up often. :)
I wish I did. It happened naturally for me. For the first month of Covid lockdown I did nothing but read. It made me realise that I don't need much (money, career etc) to be happy. And that I didn't care if I was successful or not in the eyes of the world. I don't know if this state of mind is going to last, but I hope it does.
♥ ♥ ♥
I'm glad I was able to help, even if a bit \^\^ Yeah, I've got my lofi chill-beats music, books and maybe a fantasy video game I'll probably turn to because it's not gotten any better today. No more TV if it's going to have those ads lol--and yeah, I appreciate seeing those realistic ZOOM ads, it reminds me that we're all screwed, even if it's not because of personal problems but something that's out of all of our control.  Same to you, and I can't wait for 2021. I think it'll be better.
Yeah I’m talking about the Myers Briggs personality thing. It took test a few years ago and I took again recently and got that as my result both times. It really helped me find ppl who reminded me of me. I suggest maybe taking the test to see which one you are and that can be a small step into finding someone like you say least based on the ways you act. Writing about things that make you happy can also work I tried that too and it helps me to fall asleep without any stress. And yea I’m really hoping that we can both get over this mountain of depression together. It’s a slow journey but it will end with success I am sure of it. I also hope that you’ve had a lot of good moments this week that you can write about to feel better. It gets better even with small changes you can see yourself getting better and just being happier.
I really dislike people trying to give advice and shoving positivity in my face too.
Come back anytime for another one :) Unlimited supply :)
No problem 😊 maybe try doing those certain activities u used to love again? Right now everything seems stupid probably, but when u at least still get that small feeling of accomplishment with something it will still help, so working out is actually really good, and it will get ur mind a bit off of things and it is also good for your physical health ofcourse. Maybe you dont know what exactly to do, but try to do what is most hard right now; waking up, immediately getting out if bed, talking to new people and being like; hey you wanna go get lunch there with me? U can also get a notebook and write downin it everyday; at least 1 thing that you are happy with about that day, or grateful for, or that went well. It could be; the sun shining, having a good conversation, or just that random ass biscuit u had 🤷🏼‍♀️ it can be anything. Try to just start seeing a few more positives every day, and doing small easy things that will help acconplish something or make u happy. Every small little detail adds up to a greater purpose. I promise you, that things will at least get easier and clearer. Every step no matter how big or small is STILL a step. So take one, every day.
I get that. I'm often on my phone while watching movies for the same reason, so I just end up missing half the movie and having to rewind constantly. I hope you have a nice day too!
That has to be really hard. It's good of you to be willing to reach out online to talk to people in spite of everything. Yes, the deniers are way too far in number, it's f*cking horrific the amount of cruelty and selfish stupidity. It makes me so upset too. I don't know about you but I'm deeply upset by what's happening with America and their horrible garbage president. I live in Canada but it still upsets me because we're right next door. I follow a variety of random subreddits. I have found some for specific needs, the one raisedbynarcissists has been extremely helpful and positive for when I need to deal with pain from trauma or if someone was mean to me. They are willing to support anyone who's experienced any kind of abuse, whether it was bullying, parental abuse or abuse from a friend or partner, bad neighbours or in the workplace. I've also found the ADHDwomen sub helpful as I have struggles with that, and the emetophobia sub cause I have a fear of throwing up and frequent panic attacks. I don't find the self harm subreddit helpful as people are very caught up in their own problems and there isn't much support on there which is disappointing. So if I feel like I'm having urges to self harm I instead call crisis text line or email my therapist.  For more amusing relaxing purposes, I love going on the cottagecore and dark academia subreddits, the aww subreddit, natureislit, all those nice nature subreddits.
that would be nice, wouldn't it? I think of what it would be like to go back to when I was 6. not a care in the world, no idea what was going to happen in the future. just imagining it makes me want to cry. I miss being able to focus in class without depression running through my brain 24/7. it sucks, I just want a normal life again...
Sexual assault is always the perpetrator's fault, no matter the circumstances. I'm a survivor too so I understand how guilty and shameful it feels, but it's the abuser who deserves to feel all that blame. I hope you can find a way to heal - you deserve a full and happy life.
please don’t blame yourself :( i promise it was not your fault. you are amazing and strong, and i’m rooting for you that you can get through this even stronger. don’t ever be ashamed of yourself 💕💕
Sorry to hear about how you've spent your day, but luckily there's always tomorrow.  Graveyard keeper was the one that's similar to stardew valley right? I had stardew, and my brother got graveyard. I normally gravitated to stardew because I needed to light-heartedness. But I remember both being enjoyable.  Animal crossing I'm sure you know, is another great one. I just stopped playing because I got impatient waiting for fall, I haven't touched it since summer :/. But I enjoyed it, kept me busy, gave me tasks to make sure I did everyday. Gave me a sense of control over part of my daily routine.  I'll check it out but I'm not sure monster hunter would be my cup of tea. But tastes change, so it's worth a shot. If you want, try celeste with the built in assisted mode to make it easier. It's worth a play, even if you just use invincibility and roll through it, the story is worth it alone. :)
Im only 19 so i can't imagine the stress that the adoption process is putting on you. I know the system sucks ass doh but I wish you all the very best. Also I hope that the puppy is going to be all right, don't automatically put the blame on urself, that can cause no good.
Thanks.   I know its not much but you can be proud of yourself. I really hope it gets better for you.
What did you want to discuss? I agree with you, it’s really fucked up
I think that's normal to feel nervous about talking about it, it's an emotional touchy subject. But physical manifestations are definitely something you should being up with your primary. And I think you'll feel relieved to get it off your chest once you do.
Ah dont even worry about it man, you're still young enough to go an entire decade without getting in to your career of choice and still be able to retire at a smooth 60 years old.
We are walking the same path friend. I'm in my 40s, tried to get my phD in my 20s. I'm still angry at my pi, but not my dad. Those foul moods (I'm in one now) are pretty draining.
Sure, try to have a good night. People do care more than you know
:) I hope you have a great day!
Thank you kindly!
Good for you. Don’t do anything alone. I have a hard time asking for help. Especially when I really need it.
I'm a couple years removed from that now and back to a normal weight so I'm all good.  You just make sure you're being careful.
Well. I've been more antisocial than my usual just because I'm studying for college classes and I work 4 days a week with that so I dont get much me time. But I chose a few things that I really enjoy to do that I will do when I have time. For example I love outside. Juat being outside for me helps. The whole loneliness feeling is still there. But it is calmed. So I will go for a walk and listen to music which is another thing I enjoy. So when you start to really get that OVERWHELMED feeling if at all possible just step back and think about it. For me when I found out I had 3 tests in one day and I worked 5 days that week. I instantly just thought about the way I would do it. Yes, at first I had the " well I cant do that" thought. But I have learned to ignore those thoughts. As far as becoming independent goes. Find someone or few who know how to be independent. Good family member, good friend or any good role model for you. Someone you look up to. The major thing I HATE doing is asking for help. But believe me when it comes to this point in our lives we WILL NEEE HELP. my mom still helps me with paying taxes. Lol. So in all, If your getting overwhelmed or stressed, step back and do something that you knows calms you down and think about how your going to handle the situation. And with independence, do your best. And if you have questions or need help. Don't be afraid to ask others. Who have done it before. I hope this has helped or maybe motivated!
No, don't worry, it's most likely not that bad. Probably it's just a few things with your hormones that help you sleep which is connected to your ability to remember things. Or serotonin levels. This can be easily be fixed.
anytime. if u need to talk to someone talk to me
YW. I always heard someone try to use others' worse situations as a comparison, but when you try to compare yourself to others in terms of productivity or success, suddenly you "shouldn't do that". I refuse to accept that double-standard. Every single person's struggles and successes are their own and I feel comparing only in the negative is biased. I can get kind of salty about how others try to impart guilt, sorry, but I'm glad I could help your validation. :)
At least it seems everyone is okay
Can sympathize with the feeling that you absolutely need time off but can't actually make it happen. In the same shitty boat. Hope it somehow happens soon, for both of us.
Of course !! It makes me rlly happy I was able to hopefully make you feel a lil better :))
I am sorry you could not celebrate. I hope the day was at least a tiny bit quiet and a tiny bit peaceful, even for a few moments
I hear you. I’m not discrediting you or your experience- and I can relate, I’m so sorry. But I promise you, there are ways out. Apply vigorously to other things. Try to pick up remote work UpWork. Save save save until you can leave and look for something better. I was in a job similar to yours for awhile and it took a few years but I found something else and it was life changing. Where you are, it’s not going to be where you are forever.
Its great that you are trying to move on but you cannot do so if these pictures and her stuff is all in your face ...how can you forget when you are constantly reminded of her ...maybe take her stuff and hide it somewhere in a closet somewhere where you cant see it..this helped me when i was going through a rough breakup ...i deleted all texts all photos and excluded myself as much i could ...i watched a lot of comedy stuff to get constant sadness out of my mind...hope something works for you too
It's hard. It really is. Just try to be gradual with it. Open up little bits at a time and watch their reaction. Try to kind of match what level they are at I guess.   I was deathly afraid of being too needy with the person I'm with now because of how distant he was, but it turns out he was distant because he was hurt previously, and once he actually trusted that I was a generally good person we were both able to really open up and show affection/need.
"Too depressed?" Dang. Yeah, if you can get some help to get a move on before November, that would be great.  Hopefully, once you get insurance, they'll be able to help connect you to a decent therapist. I didn't know just how many therapists were in my neighborhood until I saw the in-network list for my insurer.  Good luck.
As for living at home at 25, that's pretty fucking common these days my friend. This was economy is designed so you fail at living on your own. We (the mentally ill) tell ourselves life should just roll out easily and make sense, after all everyone who's successful did what you're doing, right? Wrong! Most who make it, and make it easy are lucky. Our culture teaches us that if you work hard success will follow. Bullshit!   And as for bad credit, how bad is it because you'll most likely be renting a room and credit checks generally don't come with room rentals so it's not to significant.   But first things first! What can you afford, what do you have saved, and where you going? This will determine your rent.
I am sure my son watches him, he is always watching videos like that and he plays among us with his friends.  Thank you, I hope I do also.
I’m glad it went well at your interview. That’s wonderful. If you don’t get it though it is what it is and we can move on knowing we at least tried. Mine was a phone interview and they loved me which was nice and all but I could care less. I mean it’s nice someone notices you have something to offer a company but when deep down you feel so anxious and empty that the only thing you have to offer this world is working to pay my bills. If I make enough to do that. It really doesn’t change anything about the fact that I still feel there is something else to this world than work, anxiety, and depression. I’m sorry to be a downer but it’s been a rough week. I hope you get the job and like I said were in this together.
Don’t give up if you don’t get the job, ask for feedback and take lessons from what you did good, and what u did bad on the interview. 2 years ago I was unemployed going for interview after interview while battling depression. I got rejected so many times up to the point where I took some pills and drove my car, imagine that scene from wolf of Wall Street. That was my wake up call and after that I sat down with a coach and practiced interview techniques and I still got rejected a few times but I learned something from every interview and I finally landed a great job that I still have to this day. Going to interview is stressful and rejection hurts but you have to stay positive and learn from every experience, and build up confidence. Most importantly don’t make the same mistake as me and keep it all inside you, vent out to someone you feel comfortable with if you feel a lot of pressure building up. Also for the interview the best tips I have are; come prepared, research about the company and position, have questions ready to show interest, stay calm and speak in normal pace. Fast speaking and laughing are obvious signs of nervousness. Maybe stay away from caffeine as it causes anxiety and sweat. Sorry if I am all over the place, I needed to vent a little as well.  Wish you the best of luck on your job hunt!
That makes total sense, given your past experiences. I get the energy thing, it seems like it takes more energy to get myself ready to do something than it does to actually do it. I've been using some CBT techniques on my own, instead of going to a therapist, and it seems to be working okay. Maybe that could work for you, too.
That's rough, I am sorry that you're going through that. Is it possible to join an online or in person support group? I do ACA and find it really helpful to talk to and hear from people who get what I am going through. The meetings are free.
This is such a thoughtful and well-said response. I'm going on a run right now for this reason. My whole life I've forced myself to do things to keep my out of the worst pits of depression. I just feel like I'm running out of coping mechanisms, or little things to do.  But this confirmed my "Should I really force myself to go run right now?" thought. So I will. It might turn my day around. Thank you kindly. :)
Did you feel as each day passed the worst it got and the more you accepted the idea of leaving? That's happening to me...
if you ever need to talk. or vent or take your mind off smth talk to me
You’re feeling happy those days— you are feeling it. Doubt happens during depression but if you have a good day try to be ‘in the moment’ and *static* (or whatever you do in your head to push away other, less happy thoughts) and try to save it for your memories. It can help if you’re able to recall a calmer time.
You, too. I never needed to know what "the other side of the present time"/the end of this rainbow of hell is going to be like than now. Thanks, and take care, yourself.
You're welcome. Naps are great I should probably try to get some sleep myself. Of course I happy that I chose to say something. I really do hope that things get better for you.
I don’t know if this will help, but when I am in that place, instead of thinking about everyone else and all the people I care for and how they would hurt, I think about myself. It’s hard. But I try to remember the few times I felt a fleeting sense of happy, or what I always dreamed would come. If this is the life that I am given, would ending it all now benefit me? I’d miss out on so much - seeing my nephew grow, discovering a new delicious food, experiencing the warmth of the sun on my skin or the soft feel of moss. I’d give up on getting to finally see the stars away from the city, and I’d lose all the little stupid moments that my cats make. It’s okay to be selfish. To not be living your life for other people but for yourself and all the things you want, even if you try to tell yourself that you don’t deserve them or that it’s not worth it. I try to think  about how I might feel if I could feel or do those things I want. And that keeps me going for a little longer.
Oh cool! What do you play? What about online gaming? You didn’t get their usernames? I understand that covid is ruining many things, but maybe it will create also new oportunities!
Hey I know this is standard but maybe talk to someone aka a professional because anhedonia can really get to you or just check in with someone regularly.  It’s fine to be down. Everybody is at some point but staying there for too long really sucks. So while I may not be able to help you I truly wish you find yourself in a better state of mind soon! Take care :)
Who knows, you might make an unexpected friend of someone who also doesn't necessarily enjoy it, and you two can pick a different club or activity.   Hang in there. Everyone is feeling especially down and unmotivated right now. Things are uncertain and lonely and downright weird. It will get better.
The fact that you still have a future means you're doing just fine.
I'm sorry. How are you feeling now?
Do you like reading?
Yes I know,I also felt tired of life at one point. I just took a look rest to think about why. And time helped me a little. I too felt they only cared for me till I do what they want me to do. But even a kindness that is rarely shown , started to change that mind set ,I had for long. People have their own mindset to move forward, and many are especially fragile. Only a strong mind can help anyone else in tough situation. Others just leave us alone to find our own path. Most of the times the answer we find ourself will work wonders.   P.s. fatigue is usually a symptom, please do your best to find professional help ,as meds can help a little. Take your time bro , you did your best. Please be kind to yourself. Only when you're really happy, then you're surrounding get happy. You're a powerful source that can make anything happen as long as you truly think and believe it to happen.
Well, it was when I was being in college. After that they started to push me to join a job, particularly mom, as she was disappointed I couldn't complete my graduation. There were mean words spoken when she saw that I was unmotivated to do any work and always moody. So got over that attachment phase. Then I started to feel that I can't stop feeling hollow and very sad, can't think anything happy, bad things or even small things makes me cry. So then I started to see what went wrong why am I so down and the evidence pointed to   Child Abuse - timidity- bullied- made me sexually guilty - death of grandparents  So problem started with my mother,I hated my parents for that. For my father to not care emotionally about me. Even genes may have made me a negative thinker. Then I came to the conclusion even a perfectly raised child can have depression according to internet. So i became anti natalist.  So after 6 years (4years in college and 2 years as music teacher) time healed me a little I guess, and corona came. Tried to reduce my weight as I eat junk food when depressed,did little exercise and after that yoga,and I felt much alive after many years but only for short durations ,other time I'll just lie on my bed read some light novel's to distract myself from my thoughts and to keep my anxiety from acting up.  I tried a bad attempt of suicide in my college days,bad in the sense I can't think clearly how to do that, and also was afraid of pain. So after this many years I accepted that my survival instinct won't let me do it. So I have to atleast live happily and never have a child,so that he don't need to suffer. I had problem sleeping,the timing keep on changing so I felt tired all the time,and forgot my reality with a foggy mind. I ate only two times per day in the hope that it'll atleast make me come out of my 'laziness' as my parents and I thought that time. But my immunity got affected, I'll always have runny nose coz of that.  So back to after 6 years, the endorphines due to exercise and yoga gave me a small time to think. I tried to learn Japanese,but the anxiety didn't let me. So had my ups and downs. I tried to take care of my health as I thought my 'laziness' is bcoz of not doing any physical activity. I started to like doing exercise one day  and take  rest  the next day,and then again doing the exercise with one or two count extra, I liked the feeling of improving even in snail's pace. I started to look forward to exercise. I became a health nut. Changed my diet, as Indian diet is very unbalanced and unhealthy sometimes. The diet gave me atleast a little more improvement.    One day in internet saw about  talking with my inner child to resolve my anger ,and it worked most of the time. Went out and tried to have fun with family, despite having problems,I understood that I can be atleast feel remotely happy. Father had corona,became devasted luckily inner child method and 'House' series helped a little. Luckily he survived even though he had pneumonia and heart problems.  He came back a changed man, I started to see my father also cares in his own way. He asked whether I want to see a psychiatrist. I said let's have a try,if I don't like I won't go again I said myself. I have to do a lot of inner child method to convince myself to see a psychiatrist.  Went to a government hospital,with cheap fee . She somehow made me open up,I got emotional but I still shared how I felt for these many years.  And now only I hear for the first time, that I have anxiety and depression. I already know about depression ,as an actor died due to that in india.  But I didn't know I had anxiety ,so I was prescribed meds. First two weeks it made me sleepy,so the doctor changed to night dosage.  So I started to sleep at night due to the tablets side effect,I saw improvement with myself slowly. But had some episodes too,as not all my relatives know about my condition. So some well intentioned words can trigger me,it happened once and I didn't talk to that relative afterwards just like my mom. I didn't say my mom asked me to go out of house. It hurt me deeply.  Then I understood that it's not my fault to have anxiety in my college days nor could I have studied by pushing myself. Atleast its not my entire fault.  Finally the use of inner child method kept on decreasing to stabilize my mood. As the meds made me totally calm and didn't let me think about suicide even now. But it's also bcoz I see little hope for happiness after a long time.  Now doing exercise at morning daily, helping my father with work a little,as I understand I want money and I'll take it as motivation. So I can take care of my cousins in the future. As I love em all. My own sister had a baby recently and she also is an angel with her pure eyes and peaceful visage.  It's been six months since I started med,and I feel much better as time goes on. But I came to the 'reality', so I have to know what to study and to do with my life. My only motivation are my cousins,I just don't want them to suffer too much. I want to make money and buy them food to eat. And also have a Frank and helpful conversation about things,so they won't feel lonely or that they're alone.   P.S. I went to psychologist during my college days,but she just asked me to do what I like. But I had bad decision making skill that time.So I couldn't discontinue and got easily persuaded by those money hungry principal of  my college.  P.p.s. My worry is whether I can  study again ,as anxiety gave a huge trauma about it. But now I know I am not alone in it either. I'll try to support others in this community as normal people can't understand depression fully.
what else is new?

Sorry I deviated from the question. Its just known one replied anywhere or even show concern when I said I have depression. I know it's lame. But I just wanted to tell my story to somewhere it may be useful I guess.  So about mother, I loved my mother as she cared me from childhood even with her shortcomings, physical abuse was common india that time.  She showed real care when I went to college ,even when I said I can't study, I think she thought I'll do something else with my life.  But I didn't have any motivation for that. Then my parents starts to totally ignore me, or give disapproving looks. Made me hide in my room to not get stared down by them. But the silver lining wss that I found part time job only for two days in a week.  Still I started to question whether my parents love me only as long as I can study. Are they not showing me care just because I couldn't study and this thinking led me to become anti natalist. By this time I stopped seeing my mother as a reason for survival. As giving control of our happiness based on outer situation or another person will always end up biting in my back. That's when I started to search how to feel happy by myself.  So I ignored my mother who hurt me with words.  I did things that will make me happy. And this continues in the previous reply.

Damn, so we both want to go to canada
Still though, a different therapist may be the answer.   Did you consider going to a treatment facility? I wish I could.
Ahh i feel you on that. I have maxed my out coverage for 2020 and am waiting for January to go back to therapy. Hoping today was slightly better than yesterday  for you! :)
Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, makes a lot of mistakes in their first job. I know it feels horrible right now, but it really is going to be ok! I’m glad to read that you’re planning to get in somewhere for therapy sessions.   Here’s what I’m currently doing to survive this season, having SAD on top of everyday depression:  Baths— I find chillhop music to be extremely relaxing, combine that and taking a bath with some Epsom salts and I pass out hard and get some actual sleep. Epsom salts are Magnesium Sulfate— many people with a western type diet are magnesium deficient & it can be absorbed through skin so it is physically beneficial as well. Sometimes I take a 2 hour bath if I can’t bring myself to do anything else and I’m not sleepy, just let the cooled water out and run fresh hot water. Take a book with me so I’m not bored or ruminating.   AND... as much as I hate to have done this, I went and laid in a tanning bed for a quick 5 minutes twice this week. Not so great for my skin, but amazing for my immediate well-being.  Are there some small things you could do? Is there anything you really want to do that you’ve been denying yourself?
Also adding in— congratulations on finishing college and getting your first job!
I struggle to start talking, but once I start talking ( from a list held casually in my hand) it always got easier & they were always professional & helpful.  It helps me to think they are hearing about mental health issues all the time now, not like they would be shocked to hear you are struggling!  Maybe bring up how COVID has intensified some anxiety &/ or depression, to the point you believe you need help ( even if not covid caused, it will give you an easy opener) Also helps if I've researched the various meds (if I plan to try a med) so I'm ready discuss the ones they inevitably bring up, & know which ones I'd rather avoid ( due to side effects). Good luck
It helps me as its one movement. I can pretend it's a shopping list or a to do note.  Once it's done it's done as well. There's no stalling like when you're talking. You don't have to think about what words come next. It could just be as simple as 'I feel depressed.' 'I'm worried about my mental health.' not a long letter but something for them to begin the conversation.
of course, we can get through this. :) take care
My boyfriend "doesn't believe in therapists".  He understands why I do, but just doesn't get it and probably never will.  He is a lot older than me and is very set in his ways.  It is a hopeless battle when it comes to some things.
I got you. I know exactly what you mean. I dont have the best job and im in college. I live by myself in a shitty place. Im working, saving, and studying all day every day. I find it hard to just be here every day. But yeah. I hope you get past your stresses and find a way. Good luck!
I’m new to this, so just know I don’t always respond. Please feel free to chat anytime though.

i’m happy it made u feel better. overthinking is so exhausting but it almost becomes comforting & like a routine. at least in my opinion. just take it day by day
Almost lost your job because they found out you were in therapy or? That’s too bad, I’m sorry. Have you found the therapy to help at all?
Please do... “vishudda das” is a youtuber he’s really great
Look up vishudda das on youtube
Dude it's been a year ig since we broke up , but we keep talking on and off but yesterday I took a major step deleted her contact , bc not worth it bc she doesn't give a shit she only talks when she wants , like when I feel alone and want just someone to talk to she just ignores me wasted a whole year on this shit can't waste another , but yeah I think about her ig sometimes 24/7 and sometimes less but I also do it quite often ig it has just become a part of me and I accepted it , we both should leave the past ig and move ahead
Yeah if it's not working for you, it might be time to try something else. I'm sure there have certainly been times when I've felt lonely, and I'm not as connected as I want to be, but as you can see, I'm not you. Even being surrounded by people doesn't guarantee they'll see your pain and be actively trying to help you. If you feel the internet is annoying and not helpful, consider taking a few hours or days break, especially from certain apps. I like to listen to music and do something productive like clean or even just lie around, nap, or do something artsy. Please consider seeking professional help if you're having thoughts about death. A lot of people can relate to some of the thoughts running through your mind, you might think of asking mentors/adults in your life for their life stories. Ultimately, your life and its choices are up to you, and it's incredibly healthy to take time to rest and reflect and think of where you want to go. You don't have to have everything figured out or perfect. Just like there will be times of high spirits, conversely, there are the low valleys we have to make it through until we get out of the dark shadow of the mountain. Good luck with making friends, it's a pretty scary task as an adult, fearing rejection and taking lots of time and energy.
Of course. there's no way I could be unkind to you. To me, you deserve so much. There is so much ahead of you! You just need to get there! I don't care if your life seems like you aren't meant to live. You are! There is a one in 1 in 400 trillion chance that you exist! I mean seriously the odds are incredible. You are meant to exist. You are meant to be here. Please, even if you can't bring yourself to believe me, I hope that you at least get what I'm saying. You are an incredible gift to this world and this world just doesn't want to be as incredible back. I hope you can at least stay here till the end of the year and see if things look up. Give it a chance. You never know how much greater life can become within a few months.   One extra thing, usually every night I fall asleep pretty early. I couldn't for the life of me sleep tonight. I was just waiting for something to happen, as if there was a reason to be awake. Then I saw your reply. I can't know for sure, but if this message helps you, I believe one hundred percent that you are meant to be here and I'm meant to help you realize. Whether this message helps or anything I say in the future does, you are meant to be here.
Your welcome.   I also was trying to say core beliefs and trauma are two separate areas that are effecting you not that core beliefs are the trauma.  If EMDR did not work for you than that is an indication of complex trauma meaning you have had many cases of trauma leaving it to hard to pin point.  This of course is an educated guess from reading a post not a hard fact.  Whatever the case.   I wish you well.   I hope you find encouragement, start finding things that you can see as hopefull to build on and become stable enough to start removing guilt, shame and bad beliefs that are you keeping you captive in depression.   Faith addresses all these areas that is why I suggested Joel Olsteen.  He presents a faith of hope without the unhealthy condemnation that many add to faith.
I got some prepackaged rice ball today.People who travel Japan seems to have lots of fun in "Conbini".(How we call them)  They have nice Macadamia nut short bread too.Danish bread with anko is my favorite.I wish you visit here and have fun :)
Hi - I don't use reddit much - just figured out how to see if someone left a reply.  Sorry for the delay!  Thank you.   Yes, I know - and I do have a few dear friends where things are reciprocal - I think I want everyone to like me b/c I don't feel good about myself.  How are you?
There are options outside of typical antidepressants, I suppose that was my point. The medication I’m trying now is technically in the antipsychotic class, but it has been shown to help people with severe depression. There’s also non-pill treatments like EMDR and TMS. Hopefully your psych will talk to you about those.
You do have it in you, because you’ve made it this far already. Sometimes you have to pull strength from somewhere deep down in your exhausted, tired soul and keep fighting. I’m rooting for you.   P.S. for medication a psychiatrist is immensely more helpful than a family dr if you aren’t seeing one. Also after trying a handful of different medications in the “antidepressant” class with no benefit I believe it’s recognized as “treatment resistant depression”... there are other classes of medication that can be used as alternatives to treating depression that you could try, as well as non-pill treatments like EMDR and TMS appointments. I fall into this category and am currently trying a low dose atypical antipsychotic medication that sometimes works for depressed people. I’m also going to a tanning bed, because FUCK seasonal affective disorder.
It’s take me YEARS to get even closer to the right meds. Please keep trying.
Quick story. When i was 16 i thought i was in love. Never been happier i loved this woman with my whole heart. She was the first person to ever really care about me and it ment alot. She dumped me over text told me i wasnt what she wanted. I stayed single almost 3 years didnt even talk to another woman unless i had to. In that 3 years i started working more. I started working out. I lost 100 pounds. I got my license and started going on hikes and bikes rides. I showed her and myself that i didnt need her to be better. I really showed myself that all you need is to keep pushing through the thick of it no matter how dark it gets. And it paid off now im 21 with a really good job. A really good woman whos pregnant with my son and is going to give birth tonight or tomorrow morning. And every time i look at that bitch all i see is her struggling every day. I see her unhappy. And you know why? Because she was stupid enough to leave me and now she can watch my success from below me not with me.
What im trying to say is you dont need pussy you need to focus and improve. Show her that its her loss and your gain that you dont have to carry her to the top.
“Therapist friend”- yes, exactly that! So exhausting especially as someone who needs a therapist herself!

I mean that I don’t have older relatives to worry about or other relatives I guess. It would be stressful to be concerned about family members getting sick.   I’ve been pretty isolated and my mind has been going to old problems and insecurities that I thought I’d moved past or at least as an adult understood that they didn’t matter as much as I thought   Mostly around my appearance, but other stuff as well.   I feel like I was more emotionally mature and ‘adult’ at 26 than I do now
Yeah - I pretty much had the same experience growing up. I was told that I was “lucky” (I wasn’t), that other people had it worse, to ‘think about other people for once instead of myself’ (never mind that I constantly did that.)   Now I have so much trouble holding onto my own experience. If I’m not the most suffering person I have zero personal sympathy
Thanks.
For sure yeah. I don’t believe God will send anyone to hell for being gay. Nah.   It’s just with everything else. Sacred things tend to be mocked among those that live under the LGBTQ mold, probably cuz they have religious trauma from their childhoods. But yeah feels kinda like I don’t belong because of that obvious conflict between religion and LGBTQ.
Case of unrequited love right here... I want to get over it but I can't.
On my chair. It’s different material than the bed
I know what you mean. Still, you may have been onto something. At least, it can be a good thing to have your inner monologues speak with compassion. Like instead of thinking "I suck", go "I'm doing my best even though things are hard". I don't know, I think that's what they tried to teach me in therapy.
Also, it isn't easy maintaining this state of mind. LinkedIn and Facebook are always there to remind me that my peers are succeeding in their careers and personal lives.
where do you see the positivity in those sentences?
I think I might try the notebook I can’t promise it will be happy thoughts in it but maybe writing will help alleviate the pent-up thoughts constantly swirling in my head.

It... feels weird to call myself a survivor, ngl  Like others had it way worse, and what I experienced happened for like what, a minute, so does it really count? But in retrospect, being pressured/threatened into getting in a elevator at night just to get groped wouldn't be fun for anyone :/   I guess I don't know how to process this, like I'm subconsciously expecting a how-to manual on how to react after something like that. I'm just disappointed that I might develop another mental issue while I'm already struggling with depression and anxiety, you know?  I didn't mean to write a whole novel ugh, but thank you for the well wishes
Thank you so much  It's hard, but I'll be ok I think
Yes, that's what I've heard, but personally I've never played stardew valley haha Graveyard keeper is pretty nice actually, it's not really as dark as it seems, you just sell some human meat here and there and maybe make some burgers too. And in the end game, you can basically use all the corpses you get to make zombies to manage your crops and mining, it's great, I'd recommend this game to anyone to be honest.  Ah yes, animal crossing. I have 400 hours in that game, I spent so much time trading with people, it was honestly great. I can see how you stopped playing, it was the same for me and with new leaf as well. I stopped playing mainly because I just had no motivation to play it anymore, but there are quite a few updates you missed since you stopped playing, you could go back to experience them maybe? Toy day was interesting, but to be honest I couldn't get into it so I closed my game haha  I wasn't aware there was an easy mode on celeste, I'll have to look into that later on. I recently started playing hades and I was so thankful for the easy mode, or I wouldn't be able to enjoy the game or the story at all. Thanks for the heads up :) I haven't played monster hunter myself, but my boyfriend recommended it to me. You basically just slay monsters and you can team up with other people too. It reminds me of botw and lynels, but multiplayer haha It seems fun.
Thank you for your kindness! <3
Thank you. I hope the same for you too.
My mind jumped into think your "It is" is regarding the blame. Apologies.
Glad to know someone else has the same feelings. Hang in there brother.
Yes, it is easier for me now that I know when it is getting worse and I can act before it is too late.  When I got the depression for the first time, 6 years ago, the social anxiety got so bad that going to a therapist was the hardest thing and took all the courage I had left. But this first step is the most important.
Yeah I could use someone to talk to actually. But I don't wanna take up too much of your time or make it regular. Maybe if we had a scheduled time you're free so as not to go over? I'm free most of the time except tomorrow. Haven't talked to my therapist in forever.
yeah for sure... it's just so weird to me... I answered that I've been depressed for years, in the past two weeks I feel pretty awful every day, but I also (truthfully!) answered that I do not self-harm and I have never made a suicide attempt.  I'm just surprised that with those factors I was still deemed "too depressed" :( like I don't know what their metrics are but in my own lived opinion of my experience, it could be much worse ya know?  but it's ok. it's a process. I've just gotta work with/through it. it's going to take time; it is what it is.  thanks for your concern. even if you can't help it is always comfort that people care; strangers even. it is less lonely this way.
Dude, going on a run?!? That's amazing. I hope that helps, but if it doesn't I hope you don't give up. :)
[deleted]
Thats actually slightly helpful, thank you for the advice
I feel a little bit more energy now, thanks for asking. Are you doing ok yourself?
I’ve never had much luck reading cause my adhd but I did buy a book recently going to try again
why are you still trying lol
>Still though, a different therapist may be the answer.  >  Yeah.   I just spent years with "What are you supposed to do when therapy makes you worse?" "Well, you gotta do more therapy" "Well that makes sense, what else is one supposed to do" until I was so ansolutely exhausted I couldn't move one finger. I was at a different therapist and that one was even worse. Spoke to other professionals and didn't really change anything.   The whole time being split between selfhatred, fear of change, selfharm, suicidal thoughts and extreme fear of talking to people.  I talked to therapists for years and it has either been a chain of disappointments or setting expectations lower and lower where I thought why even bother because it was just like talking to a wall.   >Did you consider going to a treatment facility? I wish I could.  Yeah I thought a lot about it and gathered infos about it but so far still not able to drag myself to one. Fear of committment plays into that as well. All of that is super embarrassing, I even talked lots about all that and my problems doing more therapy to my therapist but she couldn't tell me anything.
Thank you!!! It's been a weird, tumultuous, and exciting time
That makes a lot of sense. Honestly Covid hasn't changed much for me and I wouldn't be going to the doctor if my physical health wasn't an issue, but I've been depressed for as long an I can remember and I think it's about time to try meds. I was actually thinking about how many people said Covid worstened their mental health and was worried doctors might take me less seriously because of that.  I feel like I'm on my last legs, but I think that's more because I decided at the start of this year that I was going to do everything I could to get better and I just couldn't do it.
That would make sense.  I had the conversation once after I was pressed to and I have never been stressed that much and I was physically unable to open up very much.
Wow I had this exact issue in my last relationship which was 8 years ago. My depression had no room for my boyfriend’s constant negativity. He would complain about literally everything and it brought me down to the point I felt like I needed to end things. He was extremely supportive of me, but was also depressed himself and the combination wasn’t healthy. It was like we bonded over misery.
> I'm crying man... yes.. YES..  We're so together in this!   > and of course I'd reply. I'm glad i did if it helps you. I've been there too man. just posting and screaming into this void of a subreddit with so many other people suffering.. it's both beautiful and terrible... but yeah...   One day, I truly hope that I can help fellow people here in this subreddit facing dark times. Words it might be, but I truly hope I can do something for them. Otherwise, I won't call myself a teacher.  > i feel your pain. it is so hard when the woman who gave birth to you can't even share with your deep personal feelings of depression and they just write it off as something to do with god.  YES! You're soooo right. Absolutely right. Sometimes I question myself like do I really belong here? Because my biological mother can't even feel what I feel, let alone showing support, sympathy, or even empathy. She just gave it up and hope religion would handle my issues and magically solve it. I can understand if she cannot help me, but at least I do hope she would show some support and be there when I need my own freaking mother. She is physically close, but I don't feel she's nearby. I feel more and more detached to my family on each passing day...  > I can't help but feel that it's because it's easier for them this way than to really face and deal with the emotional and very real and somewhat treatable mental health issues facing us.  Yes! I feel the same way too. They went the easy way and expect us to treat ourself for our own good, instead of actually join the struggle and triumph. Unrelated to religion, people always prefer the easy way to solve problems. Related to religion, this means 'handing over' that issue to God and pray he'd finish the said issue.  When the issue is actually solved, instead of acknowledging our struggle, they would just simply write it off as God's giving clear path and its grace so that the issue is solved. Thanking god is no problem, but not acknowledging someone's hardship through their life and simply writing it off as God's will is just plain bullshit.   > at the same time i can't blame them because psychology seems to be such a pseudoscience and the people at the clinics I've been to just assign us one medication after the other and ask us the same questions we can easily just lie to get what we want... it's not a perfect system... so idk... it's just being stuck between a religious rock and an incompetent health care system "hard place" lol  This imagery isn't so different than that of Indonesia. To make things worse, Indonesian mental healthcare system "is exclusive to Schizophrenia." You won't even get any help at all if you don't get schizophrenia. I had been admitted to the mental health hospital on April because I tried hanging myself. The medication they gave, the counseling sessions, are all geared toward solving schizo. They thought I was having delusions like how a schizo would. Even the healthcare system recommends me religion to solve my issues.   I envy you that you get medication one after another that would somehow help (if it indeed help). In my case, I was wrongly prescribed. The doctors prescribed schizo medications on me. It didn't even help me with my depression. It just makes things worse. The doctors don't even seem to care what prescription they're writing. They just shrug it off and take every patient as schizo. I regularly visited hospital from April until September, and on every visit, I met different doctors. None of them asked how I felt, let alone my depression recovery progress. They just had this small talk that was completely unrelated to my issue, prescribe bullshit, and had me left.  In the end, even the mental health hospital shrugs off my depression and hand it over to religion to solve it. Indonesia is a hopeless country.
Buddy I saw you replied from my mobile notifications but when I clicked your reply doesn't show up
I subscribed to them. I can tell it will be better for me than what I usually watch. I watch way too match about war and death. Thank you for the recommendation.
Thank you, but I'm not interested in any organised religion. All the best
Extremely difficult, I feel like I'd just be putting myself through hell and spending money again for no reason, but thank you. I know I should but I absolutely absolutely dread it. The side effects, the emotional labor of therapy, all the co-pays for appointments and meds both. It'd be one thing if it worked but it's infuriating when you do all that and it doesn't. And when that continues for ~6 years
[deleted]
It takes time to grow out of this mindset and habit. I'm certainly still working on it. Awareness is a big step. In the middle of talking to my therapist about how everyone else has it worse, she told me my childhood is one of the worst she's personally heard in her years of practicing.      I was blindsided by that. I had been conditioned my whole life to feel badly for other people and that nothing ever happened to me, but someone else's perspective was that I did have it bad or "worst".  It has been a slow process of accepting this, because to survive I basically forced myself into a rose-colored-glasses view of everything.      what if what you've experienced IS actually that bad?
Ah I see now, thanks for enduring my ignorance. It is quite a predicament and would be pretty difficult to overcome those inconsistencies pursing either demographic alone and maybe you shouldnt. At the end of the day your sexual orientation and religion are only two parts of what makes you you. I'm sure you have many more qualities, interests and gifts you could share with others that way you wont have to play pull and push with your body and ideals. I mean we're shooting the shit rn because we're connected through depression, to me it doesnt matter how you swing or what religion you practice because we both feel like hot garbo. How do you know your crush?
Only you can help yourself. You have to fight hard. It's easier said than done, I know. You will look back in a year's time and see things differently. I would bet money on it. Best of luck.
So you need chair-material sheets?  Also not my business, but what’s the skin condition?
She kept telling op to travel and meditate? People say that to force positivity in me. Try out new hobbies! Make new friends! Volunteer and give back to the community and whatnot.
Yes defenitely, writing down your feelings is a really great way to deal with them and heal from it. It's great for when ur feeling emotional in the moment or just when ur thinking about stuff and worrying. Im happy u found something 😊💃🏼
No problem! Stay strong! ❤️
Do you have access to therapy? Our situations are very very similar, and talking to a psychiatrist has helped me a lot. I get you on feeling weird calling yourself a survivor - I can type it no problem, but saying it aloud still makes me uncomfortable. But everyone who has been abused is a survivor; whether we feel others have had it worse or not. I read a quote once along the lines of "saying we can't feel pain because others had it worse is like saying we can't feel happiness because others have it better". When I feel guilty for feeling depressed or anxious, I try to keep that in mind.
sending love! <3
Well, either way, it seems like you've got a few good games to look forward to and hopefully some you can even play with your boyfriend!  I'll have to check out the other games you've mentioned. Here's to high hopes it works out and we can enjoy gaming again.
It’s alright, I figured there was a misunderstanding
I love being able to talk to my therapist on zoom now. So convenient
ofc!! just text me when you need me
Lately as each day passes I feel numb to my core. I'm in a state that I call a "howling loneliness" and nothing has an effect on me. At this point I might as well be gone... I can't even do simple task without fucking up because I'm just not "here" anymore.... Idk
Hey, that's nice to know. Yay for energy! For me, I've been feeling a bit better like a while ago but now it's shit again lol
actually so pathetic it hurts
I hope you find treatment that works for you.
[deleted]
I mean, I know it is on some level. I experienced complete emotional neglect along with abuses that are apparently the worst thing that can happen to a kid. I feel like I’ve never existed as a person and my life was stolen from me   My mind had to basically fracture to survive and I dissociate pretty much 24/7   The thing is I haven’t really been able to get proper therapy here and I feel like I fucked up my only chance to see someone who will validate all this and help me fix my broken brain   I don’t really have anyone to talk to and spiraled back into that emotional neglect/isolation part of my childhood....even as an ‘adult’   No idea how to catch up now as I feel like an adolescent compared to most adults
Fellow classmate.
thank you. I agree time helps.
No I just wipe it now and then since it’s those gaming chairs
do what YOU want to do. This is about you not her.
Today she sent me a message that says "don't fret over what you don't have, be grateful for what you have". Makes me feel like having depression means I'm not thankful enough of my life
I haven't booked a therapist appointment in months tbh, mostly because my job is running my life at this point. Been meaning to make a appointment on my off day, but by then I'm too burnt out to try and talk to people. I'll try later today after I rest from work, if I don't forget first.  Even typing that I'm a survivor feels weird. That's a good quote though, I'll keep that in mind
I could talk a bit today.
[deleted]

you’re going to be alone forever.
It still doesn't show up. Did it got stuck in the spam filter?
sounds like we're pretty similar, right down to the childhood neglect and dissociation.  weekly therapy has helped me immensely, I cannot recommend it highly enough.  So many therapists are doing virtual appointments now due to covid, maybe its possible to find a good one now? what happened with the fuck up?
I had a crush on my lab partner but she ended up getting married in the middle of the term it was hard to have to give up on my crush but honestly she ended up becoming the closest thing I had to a best friend. Try to get to know them homie, maybe you wont end up dating but instead become really good friends. Worst case you end up back here, but you woke up today without her directly in your life so you can do it again down the road.
Oh no I meant you need sheets for your bed made out of whatever the chair material is.   What’s the skin condition?
Ugh. Please cut her out of your life if you can. Depression comes with enough guilt. We don’t need people to make us feel worse.
Probably not the best but I'm not too far off heading deeper down this road..... Your just shedding some light on what may come next... Idk
I was researching... Ive done the hotline it's a band aid..... I'm new to Reddit as well but something told me to check up on discussions on depression. Seeing people write about the deepest corners makes me feel at least not so insane.... I like to read about this to gain perspective on what I should do... In my head I know what I should do... It's been telling me for years... So I wanted to see if I could relate to someone.
[deleted]
I can’t afford it. I know my life would have been improved/saved by therapy, but it’s impossible to get
Yeah I thought about that but the chair is leather and I don’t think there are leather sheets out there? Intense itching for some reason when I lie on the bed or wear clothes and sit down
[deleted]
Lol okay, it might have been stuck in the spam filter or something
I'm so sorry.
Honestly been already isolating, I stopped talking to a long term friend and deleted him from my life... Along with 3 others this year. Everyone wants me to go out and when I do it's just not a good time. I rather be alone in my bed.... This year made me hate and not trust people even more than I already have. People have let me down on being basic human beings that I'm already isolated.... I'll follow this thread in Reddit and see how that goes... But in real life I'm not talking to no one... It's a waste of time on their end and mine. I'm not mentally here when talked to so it seems like I don't care about them but truth be told I didn't even realize they said something till it was over...and if I talk I get no responses so isolating was the next understandable choice I thought I could make...
And to add on you being 100% honest about your world and what you are feeling is helping me. Just so you know....

Yeah, I pretty much don’t have any options other than suicide, no matter what anyone else says
[deleted]
Yes this one that I missed.  ---  >as a side note i really really love Indonesian food and I've taken friends in the past with me to eat at indonesian restaurants and literally cried at how good the food/flavors are lol.. it is somewhat close to pakistani food i guess  Wohoo if you love Indonesian foods I have a bucket of suggestions you'd love mmweeheheheehh  >wow ... yeah that seems much worse than the american system honestly. it sounds archaic and I'm so so sorry you've had to go through is  Thank you. I've heard stories about American healthcare system and while it's better than here, I can relate with what you've been through. But hey, on the bright side, it let us met and relate to each other. Not all is so bad.   ---  >teaching is such an honorable profession and i respect you so much and i hope you some day find yourself back in a position to do so do something that fulfills you and makes you happy  Thank you. I wish you also the best in everything you'll be going through.
You seem to be so kind, intelligent, and considerate/empathetic... all wonderful qualities seriously lacking in a large portion of humanity. You have value and worth and I can't imagine that suicide would be any sort of solution.  Maybe a crisis hotline? it's exactly what it's designed for, and I doubt theres a limit on how many days you can call. It looks like you're not in the US so I dont know whats available, but there should be some programs in place for those who cant afford treatment? Maybe a treatment facility for a while could even help-- a friend of mine (voluntarily) spent almost a year in a facility, and her improvements were so noticeable, she was just so much more confident and alive when she came back.  my sister spent some time in a free facility here in the US for a while, which she described as scary and full of homeless people. Overall she did get the treatment she needed and has now finished a medical degree and is working in a hospital helping people.  please dont give up <3 I dont want to come across as pushy, just really hate to know you're hurting so much.
I don't you're ranting one bit. Everything you say makes sense to me. I'm a hypocrite too and I call it the Alice syndrome, always can give it but can't follow it. I hate that about myself. My friend and I have never fought untill this point and it was a mess... And it shattered me hard. Whatever was whole was broken in me. However my friendship was toxic and he didn't understand why I feel the way I do. Which is why I don't think I'll talk to him again.   I understand what you are saying about isolation but I like I'm getting judged when I'm in this mental fucked state. Then I get embarrassed and run away. So idk... I didn't have many friends to start off with and I'm down to one kind of.    You sound very smart...and this talk is making feel a little relieved in a way though...
[deleted]
All of those things don’t matter...  In fact, they probably led me to be abused more.   I used to call the crisis hotline a lot, but then I got sent into despair afterwards because I was telling such personal secrets to strangers that I’d never see again.   It was always my dream to have real relationship or a real friend - someone I could really talk to but I don’t feel safe enough with anyone.   I’m terrified of hospitals and of being locked up. I was sent to a public ward after being suicidal last year and after that I felt completely broken.   I guess I’ve been numbing myself and avoiding things that I like because feeling anything is just too painful for me   Thank you though

>lol yess i can't remember exactly what i ate.. but redang *rendang? always good and i just generally love the spices .. there were some restaraunts in Philadelphia i really liked to go to when i could when quarantine wasn't a thing. the rice and everything in general is so good i would order anything. there was some sauce they semzjrved with the chicken satay and i put it on EVERYTHING and it honestly made me cry.. i really LOVE food lol.   It's rendang and sate Padang!! Mweheh there are just a myriad more of spicy foods from Indonesia, but Rendang and Sate Padang are among the most famous ones. It's not so hard to make one yourself too, especially Sate.  >and yes i wish the best for you as well. hoping anything gets better if even the smallest thing moves forward for you maybe it will be something to hang on to and make other things move forward if even slowly. hopefully in the end it gets better.  We both hope for the best of us. I'm so grateful of this conversation 💗
Hey are you still here

I got a dog last Sunday? Thinking things would change and I can keep my mind busy but now I have work and still feel empty. Anything and everything I thought might work really hasn’t...
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0g5z0/being_depressed_is_not_being_lazy/
I am fed up of people around me because they don't even accept that there is something like depression. Anxitey isn't an excuse. It's real. I am tired. I am tired of my life. I am tired of my anxiety. I am tired of living.  How should I open up about depression and anxiety?
someone you really trust like a good friend
You should try to express your feelings thoroughly in any way you can. Reddit can be a good place for this. You can talk to me if you want.
It's all about frames of reference. During my years of battling depression, I simply couldn't be around people that had no understanding of depression - and these people were usually those that have never experienced anything like it. To them, if you're sad, you just 'snap yourself out of it' - go for a run, have a beer with friends, cheer yourself up and problem solved... Those who have experienced real depression know that isn't remotely how it works. Furthermore, the fact you're telling me to 'snap out of it' is just a massive insult as it assumes I haven't already thought of and/or tried that.      Find people that get it. Find people that understand. As others have pointed out, you're only likely to find these people if you're willing to be open and share how you're feeling.     But I want to point out something I noticed in your post - you talk about depression like it's an absolute fact that you have it. Be careful with that. You're completely correct, depression is indeed a crippling and real problem that deserves sympathy, much like physical illness would get. However, be careful when thinking of it like something that is 'part of you' (and therefore people should accept it).    Depression is not part of you. It is a temporary state of mental and physiological illness. No matter how grim it seems, no matter how long you feel you've suffered it; you cannot be born with depression -it is a state; a consequence; a symptom. Do not ever think depression is a part of you, it is not. You should always see it as a problem to be solved. A thing you (and potentially a psychologist) need to figure out the solution to - but it is never permanent. You need sympathy for how you're feeling right now, I absolutely get that. But never lose sight of your battle against it. Best of luck to you!
The harsh truth I’ve found is that no one WANTS to hear about it. Even my mother who is a licensed counselor doesn’t like talking to me about my depression. It’s uncomfortable and generally people don’t like hearing about problems, especially ones they can’t fix. And to the ignorant, it can come off as whiny. It’s similar to an addict trying to explain their addiction to a non addict. “Just say no.” = “Just be happier.” Ignorance is the issue.  That being said, I would start by identifying what your looking for, what do you need? Do you need a shoulder to cry on and someone to just listen? Or do you need someone who can help advise you through this, in my experience they’re usually not the same person. Talking to others that struggle helps because it eliminates the ignorance issue, but you don’t always get the most edifying advice from other depressed folk. Therapy is a bit of a toss up, but it’s worth a shot. I would be down to chat, but I’ll be honest, I’m not a great shoulder to cry on. But I would be happy to try and help you through this.
It's sucks doesn't it
thank you for saying this. i've been thinking (a LOT) about it lately. they see me as a lazy and ungrateful person because i complain about work and life. i just want to rest in peace, i can't take this anymore
Lazy is just a pejorative and doesn't actually say anything useful   Its a way to disregard someone's problems with complete denial and a bit of gaslighting too.  I hate the word, being beaten over the head with the lazy label has caused me a lot of psychological pain over my lifetime and i might even say almost killed me.
I have given up at this point. Work is the only reason I get out of bed. I’m just waiting to finally get enough courage to end myself and not give a fuck about who it hurts because I’ll be dead why should I care?
That's kinda me... I don't know what am I supposed to do... That's something extraordinary I'm not able to do much...
Sometimes even they don't care
Yes, I am trying my best to open up. Sure, Thank you.
Exactly, I wasn't born with depression. It all started four years back.  Whenever I say something people around me are like you look absolutely fine. I cry at night. I get panic and anxiety attacks and unfortunately I learned to hide them so they just assume I am fine.  Around 18 months back I was diagnosed with severe anxiety. Because of anxiety I was getting frequent cheek bites and I used to have sharp pain in my chest. My face nerves used to get stiff during anxiety attack. I went to a general physician. I thought it's something physical but he told me what's the exact cause. I was on pills for around 4-5 months. Initially I never shared this with anyone. But later my sister found that I am on pills. And unfortunately I have to discontinue taking pills and I shifted to new city. To be honest I really don't want validation from everyone around me. I just want my family to understand because they are the only one who can take me to a psychiatrist now. I have tried a lot but it isn't getting better on my own. I have waited too long and now I feel I can't do it all alone.
It does definitely :/
Same here friend!
Yes, exactly this hurts a lot and it takes away all the confidence. I somehow gather strength for opening up and people around me end up by saying you are lazy or you just don't want to be happy. And honestly it breaks me into even more pieces.
dude im sure thats not true
And you need to find your unique unrealised potential. Everyone has creative and destructive energies in their unconscious - you need to find your positive feelings and thoughts and make something of them.
well .. I thought I might tell my friend about this ... She said something like "this is bad ..." and didn't take it seriously.
Yes, I have to find myself. I feel like I am lost in depression and anxiety and that really sucks. I want to find my life back. I want to live, I want to chase my dreams.
Exactly. People around us don't take mental illness seriously because they can't see it unlike any other physical illness. I wish there was some mechanism to measure mental illness so people will understand that it's not a joke.  Suffering is very personal but seeking professional help is really self love when no one around you understands your situation.
Don't be mad at her. She doesn't understand what you feel. Before I encountered depression, I had no idea it was like this. I wasn't around for my best friend when he needed me and I'm really sorry for it. I didn't know, but now I do. Now I'm the one that doesn't have anyone to express the pain that I feel. What a life.  Whoever survives through this... there are no words to describe what you are. Those that choose not to, I understand and I'm sorry! Maybe I'll be the one that doesn't too.
It's a complicated process. But you should get there if you embrace all your thoughts and feelings.
i agree can be hard which is why you need to tell your friends this is what im feeling ect
Yes, it's going to be a long journey of emotions and mental strength.
I hope you find whatever it is you're looking for.

I have no desire to get up earlier and do something with my day even though if I could force myself I’d probably feel better.   It starts to get dark within an hour of waking up usually and it’s so depressing but it keeps me isolated in my “comfort zone”   Being up in the middle of the night feels freeing for some reason, no one awake, no guilt for responsibilities, I can sleep away the day and not feel guilty about it.  But I’m wasting time and I want more than anything to feel okay again. I want to start to get my life back to something that I can derive some genuine enjoyment out of and move forward with productive things.   I became depressed again about 10 months ago since my mom passed and these past 10 months have gone by so fast, I’m almost 26 and I’m scared at how fast time is moving without any stability forming in my life.   TLDR: I’m 25 and I feel like I’m wasting time, which I am. But it’s so hard to even attempt to start getting my life in order.   It feels so far out of reach
I've been doing the same thing. Night feels so peaceful with no pressure, I don't want to sleep and then have to be awake during the day when people can see me.  I used to go for long walks everyday with some loud music I like and that would help a lot, but since pandemic hit I haven't been able to do that, and started going to bed later and later. Now I wait till after sun rise cuz it's when people start getting up.   My mind keeps reminding me "time to sleep!" but at the same time also giving excuses "Just this one more quest and I'll go"  Not a helpful answer since Im not sure what to do either but we know we're not alone at least :P
I fall into this cycle myself when my depression gets really bad. I’ve found the only option I have is to set an alarm, and immediately get out of bed when it goes off to brush my teeth and have a shower. If I don’t hesitate when the alarm goes off I don’t even realise exactly what I’m doing and can’t get into my own head about how I just want to stay in bed and be depressed. Doing a shower first means I put on “real” clothes, which stops me from going back to bed. I don’t know if this specific method would work for you or not, but it’s kind of the way I’ve been able to “hack” my depression.
I'm 22 and I also was playing video games up to 6 am everyday and waking up as late as you. December last year, I forced myself to stay awake all day up to like 6pm so I could sleep earlier and wake up earlier. It worked. I went to bed 6 or 7pm and woke up at 1am. This way, by 6pm I'd be tired again. It worked for like 3 weeks straight. Now, I'm kinda going back to waking up late, so I intend to stay awake all night again and do like I did before. Try to do like this. It may help you. Waking up early in the morning helped me feel less depressed (I don't exactly know why).
I understand how you feel completely, I really do. I go to sleep at maybe 4am? And wake up any time between 1 and 3pm and get only a couple hours of daylight before it gets dark again. Night time is comforting for me, because it's just a lot quieter. There aren't any people around, no responsibilities to take care of, no stress. Half of the time I'm either playing video games or laying in silence. Maybe play some music when the silence gets too loud, but I get it. It's my comfort zone.  I'm 23 and I'm just waiting to die at this point
First let me say, that I am deeply sorry to hear about the loss of your Mom. I lost my Mom too, and have been severely depressed (for the first time in my life), ever since.  What helps is to attend grief groups. They are done via zoom, and there is usually no charge.  If You do a search for Your area, I bet something will come up. Most Churches have groups too, and you don't have to belong to their particular faith, etc.  It's just a suggestion. because I'm right there with You.  Sometimes it seems like being alone in the darkness is where it feels the best.
Considering what you went through, I think how you feel is completely valid. You are super young and I can’t imagine losing my mom at your age, or at all to be honest. I think how you are responding to this situation is understandable. Grief is terrible. I’m not a therapist, so I feel like I won’t have the right advice for you. I just hope you realize that you are doing okay and just surviving is enough. Even without dealing with the trauma of losing a parent, I feel like the expectations for young people to achieve are way too high. It’s okay to take some time to process how you are feeling. It doesn’t make you weak. It makes you human.   I hope you can find a professional to talk through during this difficult time. I hope you can see that you are enough as you are.
I’ve been doing this too. Even worse. I’ll stay up until 9:30am. It’s getting really bad. You’re not alone.
one of the most relatable posts ive ever seen
Sounds like this is just a symptom of a bigger problem. Waking up earlier isn't going to help your grief or your depression, and I'm guessing you know that, instinctively, and that's why you aren't motivated to do it. Is there anything else you can try?
I'm not really sure if it might work but you should try to literally force yourself and go out for a walk. Try to find a place with the nature, spend some time, don't look at people just focus on the nature when it's still bright (at least it worked for me when) . Maybe try to wake up a little bit earlier so it'd still bright.   Ahhh if it's too much for you start with lookin through window, then leave your home for 5min very slowly get used to leaving your home.
I have exactly thoughts too, although I don't know how can I put them in words. Only except I wake up around 10-11 every morning, be on the phone for an hour or two, and then continue to sleep until 2-3pm. I still can't move on from past. My ex broke up with me, I lost all friends, I still can't get a job, and I don't have proper graduation despite graduated from college. And now I have to move back to my parents house and to attend some virtual classes for my graduate studies. I just like to distract myself so I don't need to indulge myself into guilt of not being able to achieve anything irl.
I've been doing the same. I enjoy the nighttime. I don't have to hide how I feel and I don't have to wear a fake smile and pretend i'm okay. I can feel how i feel. Everyones asleep. It's peaceful.   But i'm not living. Just surviving.
Holy shit I used to do this too, I thought I just like the night because no one was awake. It's nice to not have to deal with people and just be in your own world. It felt so peaceful. Even with my depression under control right now I still miss those days where it felt like nothing matters in the night world.
Dude same. I get out of bed at 5pm.
At least you are having fun with computer games, and we are in the middle of a pandemic, and you just lost your mom...give yourself a break.
I work a full time job from home, but ever since I was about 13/14 I've been stubbornly avoiding going to sleep at a sensible time for very similar reasons, only I have to wake up in the morning and as a consequence am exhausted every day...I feel the same sense of liberation in the small hours of the night of being able to do the things I want to do on my terms, and at my own pace. I was actually reading today about some who have diagnosed it as 'revenge sleep procrastination', you should have a read about it, it effects more people than you think.   Ultimately I know that if I don't keep to a healthy, normative sleep schedule then I will find it harder to keep in sync with normal day to day, 'productive society', but I think it can work for some people. Maybe try and use that time at night to do some other things besides video games? I know it's hard when you're depressed (been there a million times), but you might find it a little easier if you try and do one other thing during those nightime hours - maybe read, write, learn a new hobby or do a free online course? Maybe even buy a house plant or two and look after them, I know all those things can help me feel like I've spent some of those later hours doing something that will benefit me long term.  Getting to bed before midnight and having a few hours in the morning will probably make you feel better, quicker however. Set yourself a challenge, maybe keep a journal.  Not saying any of this is easy, by the way. I just can strongly relate to this issue, and I know how hard it can be to get out of this cycle, in the past when I've been unemployed it can get out of hand quickly
Hey OP, I just wanted to say I’m so sorry for what you’ve gone through in losing your mom. I can’t imagine how devastating that was for you and ripple effect on your life from her passing. You can’t put a timeline on grief. Thank you for sharing your story here with us. I don’t have a good solution for you as much as I wish I did. If you do have state insurance, it’s possible you can find some very affordable if not free counseling.   When I was at an all time low I actually called the suicide hotline (800-273-8255) who connected me to a low cost therapist who I continue to see a year later.  If nothing else, I hope you get some comfort in the strangers here who will rally around you and support you from a place of caring. Good luck to you.
I'm literally doing the exact same thing, played cyberpunk until 6am then went to sleep and woke up at 3pm today
Same over here, not planning on stopping anytime soon either, i play video games and stay awake until 7 or 8 then i go to sleep, miss online classes wake up at 3 pm rinse and repeat, my life's going downhill quickly but i don't find any motivation to be productive tbh
haha literally the same.  i've been doing this for over an year.  Now slowly i am getting sick of gaming and i am now ready again to change something again. Take the time you need. There is nothing wrong with IT.
I have been in this same rut for a long time.. the way i got out of it was to look at my life objectively. I could have easily have been born as an animal that had to watch its every move to either escape from being food or have a tough time hunting for food. I could also have been born in a part of the world where i would have to be on the run from a dictator or have to struggle just to go to school... You get the idea.. If you are grateful for the time you have on this earth, then you will start to think of how to use it to help other creatures less fortunate than you.. including your family and friends... and the best way to do that is take control of the time that you have to get the most of it.. Hope this helps. Best of Luck and be Grateful.
I do the same...
the same happens to me. Then I feel guilty for sleeping a lot and just playing, I end up feeling a great crap that does not contribute anything to the world and I feel even sadder.
If you enjoy what you're doing then it's not wasted time.  If you want to do stuff, well..you are already playing hames and there sometimes loading times ore you have to wait in a lobby till the round starts, in that time you could try to do stuff.  When you play on pc then it's a bit easier to do something, you could try to make some YouTube video's, get startet with Unity ore check out Blender ore Photogrammetry. Your first result's wont be that good, but at least you're doing stuff. Also, second monitor, even if its a cheap one, is big improvement for productivity
Im so sorry for your loss man.  I have had this exact schedule you are having.  Idk if it could help but if you want to reorganize your sleeping schedule, this worked for me, maybe it will work for you.  One of these days, whenever you think is more convenient (idk what responsabilities you have) just literally stay awake until the next day and sleep at around 8 pm.  So if you wake up at 3 one day stay up until 8 pm of the next day, do anything to stay awake I would strongly suggest not doing anything that requieres you to be on bed or even sitting down after the 24 hr mark.   Those last hours, do exercise, prepare future meals, clean around your room, whatever it takes that isnt a sedentary activity (watching movies/shows).   Some videogames keep me awake but I wouldnt recommend them for the very last hours.   You will sleep from 8pm to possibly 5 or 6 am of the next day, feeling fresh and with sunlight.   Genuinely hope you get better bro, i honestly wouldnt know how I would react if my mom passed, so I genuinely think you are so strong for keep going.  You can do it man. I dont even know you personally but I trust you can do it.
For me its the same Dude/Girl, I myself have the tendency to stay up until very late and wake up very late. The thing for me is, im not sure why I do it like that. In my case it may very well be because my parents are awake at normal daytime. So my own rhythm changed over time so I have lots of hours completely to myself, without the chance of disturbance. However it may be,  I wish you the best !
Hey man, I got laid off in the summer and I did the same thing. I'd stay up until 7am playing games and watching TV, then I would sleep until 5pm. All the while my gf would go to work. It really strained the relationship. Same feeling though, at night I didn't have to worry about everything and it was so calm. During the day though I felt horrible so I slept through it as much as I could. I'm also 25 years old and it was really rough. Just keep pushing through, you can do this and you're not alone
Ask yourself: what time do you actually want to get up? Not some absurd time; an actual time you would be happy with. For me, it is 1030 AM. Most people would say that is absurd, but I used to be just like you, and so setting a reasonable goal is key.   Say you start with 11 am. Just get up at 11 am every day. I know that sounds silly, but instead of setting a bed time, set a wake time. Even if you go to bed at 7 am, the next day you will be so tired that you will probably go to bed at around 2 am. Boom, 9 hours sleep. This process repeats itself a few times until your body adjusts to this new cycle.   Hard mode: all of these things keep you up longer and are most likely the reason you are staying up so late - video games, food, sugar, porn, drugs. If you cut most of these out by 2 hours before going to sleep, you will be ready to sleep much sooner. Non stimulation = sleep time. I have ADHD so it could be different. I have also found stretching when I get in bed and meditating for 1 min make me sleep immediately. Also rain noises are a huge help, or even just listening to the radio quietly as you go to sleep. And obviously, exercise during the day will make you more tired at night. Exercise could be walking to the shops or 5 push ups every long loading screen/death in a game.   All of this is much easier said than done, and if you can implement one small thing that will consistently help, it is much much more valuable than trying 5 things for 2 days then giving up. Start really small, and stick with it. Force yourself to turn off games and read 5 mins before bed. We must accept pain into our lives if we are to grow, and we can be accountable for our own behaviour, even if it feels like most of the time we aren’t in control. Control of one part of your life is so much better than giving up everything completely.  Good luck my friend, I wish you the best.
How you do survive without working on that schedule?
Same same as far as depression and sleeping. I’m so sorry to hear about your Mom. Grief is a bizarre thing and such a unique journey. I’ve also been going through it for different reasons than you...as a stand-alone it’s difficult in normal times, now compounded with the absurdity of this last year, and everything is hyper overwhelming. It’s awesome you’ve posted here.... if nothing else you’re not alone. So what if you sleep all day.... I did Saturday. I like you find comfort in the dark... don’t over analyze it and be kind to yourself. Self care is challenging for me, but I’m pretty good at telling others to take time for it. :-) ha. I’m 50. 25 is a pretty pivotal time... and you have an extra trauma to process. Be patient with yourself. If you’ve had this vision of all the accomplishments someone your age “should” have accomplished by now, 100% let that shit go. Married picket fence 2.5 kids? You have pleaaannnty of time if that’s what you want.   Depression sucks. I still have days I barely get out of bed. I’ve had days (during the lockdown in March/April) I would get out of bed, feed my bunnies, stare blankly at the living room for 5 minutes, say fuck it and go right back to bed thinking “what’s the point”. It’s ok to have those days. Set small goals, trick yourself into doing things... and when you accomplish the goal reward yourself... even if the reward is crawling back into bed. Lots of good suggestions here. Figuring out your “life” isn’t something you have to right this minute. Jot down ideas. Journal. If you game, live stream? Maybe build an audience?   There are lots of free classes etc being offered... if you’ve ever wanted to learn something new..... start a small side business... this is the time because you have TIME. Adulting/ the 40hr grind... sucks up that luxury.   I’ve been blathering so long I’ve forgotten all the different points you touched on. Reach out to groups for grief, depression and anything else you’re feeling. You are loved and you’re not alone. Hang in, and keep us updated. Laura
Me too. I’m pretty much nocturnal at this point. I have been watching shows until around 8 am then sleeping I until around 5/6 pm. I want to get my life back on track and start doing workouts but I feel zero motivation. I’m really sorry that your mom passed, I hope you’re doing at least a  bit better now.
Since I was fired from the job i had, i started to live like this, i usually had to wake up 4-5am to get work and slept at 9pm but since i was fired on Dec 24th i was so depressed i just said fck everything, and keep awake until 5-6am  and sleep till almost 1pm, without taking care of my health, i dont care if i eat healthy or even to eat, and started consuming caffeine in more amounts than b4.
Same here. I’m supposed to be in online classes but instead I sleep the day away and play video games during the night. I’m no longer ashamed about it, it’s not like my parents care enough to know I lie to them when I tell them that I’m ok. Better to just cling on to the stuff that makes me feel well for awhile.
I don't know if you're the sort to comfort eat in your depression, but when I manage to wake up in the mornings, it's because I've saved a special food for the morning. Something that is one of my favorites, even if it's not a breakfast food. I'll have the best food I have as the first meal of the day, premade/prepped, so I have something to get out of bed for that I don't need to think about.   That said, I'm generally in the same place as you. I haven't lost my mother, but in the past 4 years I've mourned the loss of a bf, an aunt, my grandma, and most recently my dog. It's certainly been rough, and I've been doing the same thing as you- staying up until the morning, sleeping until the afternoon, and then just fiddling on my phone in bed trying to not think about doing anything.   I've also started doing some of my 'work' (art studies) at night, when I'm feeling less stressed. I've noticed in general I feel more capable of doing anything at night, I guess just because it's not expected of me in that time to it takes the pressure off. Maybe you could get some of your quieter chores done at night? I've taken showers at 3 AM because that's just what felt easiest for me. I don't feel ready to do anything at all in the morning, but at night it's not so hard.   I just turned 26 last month, too, so we're around the same age!
lol same. I stay up til 6 or 7 and sleep til 2 or 3. I tried to be a morning person for 30 years and it wasn't happening, so I just stopped fighting it. Sorry about your mum, I hope things get better for you.
I'm just going with it dear. it's better than being super stressed when I was trying to force myself to do what I believed I "should" be doing.  Now I'm just going with the flow and accepting that I'm doing this because something about it supports me, given the resources I currently have access to. I can intentionally allow myself to explore online at night when I feel safe and comfortable, and use this time to look into things I''m really curious about, write about my plans and concerns, write to fellow people about stuff I actually care about, write things that hopefully help other people. And then I have faith something will come of it that ends up bring the string that I follow through the dark tunnel and slowly leads me back out into the light of day.   Just saying that things lead to another, if we allow it to and don't feel unnecessary guilt, and just embrace whatever it is that we are receiving value from,   because no matter what we think logically we "should" be doing or who we "should" be, there's only so much we can ask of ourselves, like asking a plant to grow in winter, the conditions just aren't appropriate to support certain types of growth. Maybe we can hibernate, chill out, let our roots grow strong safe under all the snow, then in spring when environmental conditions are different, we can start popping out new growth with all the energy our roots stored up :)
Take it easy on yourself we're in a pandemic where many people are dying everyday. Its okay to just survive and exist right now
I know how you feel. Every time I feel myself slipping into a depressive episode again I just sleep all day and then the few hours when I’m awake and not working I just stare at my phone mindlessly. Then it just makes me more depressed feeling like I’m wasting my life away.   But my only advice, which I’m sure you already know, is to just force yourself to do anything else. I know it’s hard and it feels bad at first, but anything is something to help push yourself out of loop. Clean your bathroom or take a shower, make an elaborate meal or just go walk around a store. just pick something and do it, don’t give yourself time to think about it. It always makes me feel better for a little while anyways.  I hope you can find something that helps you soon.
Do what I do sometimes. Get up, get dressed, go downstairs...and sleep on the couch.
:( fuck all this time I thought I was the only one that did this. I went through a very traumatic breakup when my ex financee left me at the end of 2019. Since then ive drowned in my depression with a very unhealthy daily schedule of staring at the walls, the occasional streaming of tv shows/movies/music, and talking to my therapist through telehealth once a week.   I've been able to live this way because I live with my dad and I get ssi and social security benefits.   I know I can't leave this way forever. I'm so afraid of being homeless. But my depression causes me to have no motivation.   I'm working on getting a case worker to help me find a apt for my income.   I dont see my life ever being more than sleepiness nights with the haunting memories of my mistakes and all I've lost playing over and over in my head :(.
Do you work or have any hobbies aside from gaming?  Depression has an exhausting cycle. One day you’re good. The next day you aren’t. Another day you say you’re gonna go to bed early.. but postpone that for like a week... decide you need to make a change.. try.. fail... rinse and repeat. Oh and don’t forget those random days where you feel like you can do anything you out your mind to, just to get robbed of that motivation when a trigger happens.
Being awake during is so peaceful. I can literally just be staring at the wall at 4am without any consequences. There is no responsibilities. Nothing to worry about. Just you and your thoughts.
I do the same but I have a 9-5 and honestly I'm not sure how I've not dropped dead only sleeping 3 hours at most and part of me kind of wants to
I’m 23, going through college and I’ve been doing the same thing since the outbreak of COVID. I will say, I’m happy that I started sleeping earlier (3:30ish), but it’s still admittedly bad.
Check out DSPD r/DSPD
Same position here. Hope not many people understand the pure depression of waking up and the sun already setting.
I was doing the same thing up until yesterday. Smoking a ton of weed, eating one meal a day and just so much sleep. Yesterday, i took my sleeping meds (seroquel is my savior as a person with bpd and insomnia) earlier than ever, forced my ass to bed and woke up at 8am. Had nothing to do, but walked around my town a bit... did some much needed housework, and still smoked a bunch of weed lol. It feels good getting up snd "doing something" however besides applting for work dunno what to fill my day with tomorrow..  Best of luck my friend. Exercise is key. I hate it too, lol.
thanks for sharing. it's so challenging getting out of that downward spiral but you can do it. you're not the only one feeling that way, you ain't alone!  one small step at a time. I'm rooting for ya.
Yeah I mean it's more enjoyable staying up late than going to bed and dealing with responsibilities the next day.
Man I'm 24 years old and since I've quit my last job (long story short I was tired of being treated like trash) I've lacked motivation to do much else. Night is peaceful, and I am less likely to be interrupted. I know I need to get my shit together but, I just don't see the point or have the motivation anymore.
Sorry for your loss. I’m in the same boat. I’m 21 though. But ye I’m getting sick of it
Not depressed whatsoever but i can feel you on wasting my youth. I have job, not really well paid, but enough to live on my own, have gf as well  But everyday I think i should be doing something more. look at the other guy, they sleep half my sleeping hour, have a well paid job, informed in many aspects of life, knowhow to run business, have hobby that could pay, know stock trading and start making more money. Etc. I feel so left behind  Sorry if im not supposed to think like that, there are also many people who live more miserable than me
the first thing i did to end my depression is to sleep earlier , i couldn't so i brought sleep aids from amazon to regulate my sleep , u should try it .
I go to bed around 11 pm but don't fall asleep until around 3 or 4 or sometimes later and I wake up between 8 am and 6 pm
It’s normal to fall into depression after you lose a loved one. When I lost my mom at 21 I couldn’t do anything.  I am sorry for your loss, btw.   It won’t last forever.  Slowly try to do little things here and there that are “normal”. Even something small like brushing your teeth every day.  No rush.  Again, sorry for your loss. I know how impossibly hard it is. 13 years later and I still miss my mom and cry.
Been there done that. The only thing that really stopped me was getting jobs that required me to have a more reasonable schedule. Turns out my fear of being scolded for being late outweighs my desire to be a night owl. Or rather, having to consistently get up earlier for moola helps me reset my internal clock.
If if helps I found being a night owl it’s really easy to work an overnight job.  This can help with depression since you will feel productive and overnight jobs tend not to pay too bad since most don’t want to work those hours.    Food for thought!
I'm 25 as well & I feel the same, I've been depressed for 10yrs, idk i go through spells. I sleep at 5am in the morning, I have no desire. I feel no motivation. I'm wasting time, i think about it everyday, i feel like shit each and every second. I feel like depression sucked the joy out of my life to such a point that i don't remember ever being genuinely happy. I've lost a lot of ppl bc Its made me less optimistic.  But I'm working on it. In that way i feel proud of myself, that I'm hanging on, Will get better, will work so that whoever i meet in the future, i don't burden them with my crap.  Let's like work together on this. Ik it's hard, I've relapsed a lot, but it's for the long term good i guess. Gotta do it man.     What keeps me going is, i wanna travel this world, i wanna do that before i hard myself. So much for dreams.
Same problem here. It’s something I really struggle with. Here’s something worth trying - let yourself game, but only in the morning. So how about not letting yourself game at night and telling yourself you can start gaming first thing in the morning? It will give you something to look forward to when you wake up. If you wake up and start to feel depressed, jump into your game. But only allow yourself to in the morning. That way you’re improving one aspect of your life while not actually sacrificing anything. You’re just moving your schedule
Aren't we all !
I used to have a two day cycle of playing video games all night and then in the next day sleeping 16h in one go.
Same, but it’s not comfortable. I sleep in the same room as my mom so all I can do is scroll Reddit until 4 am under my covers then either get up at 8:30 in the morning because I have school or sleep until 2. I wish I could play video games
This is definitely relatable. Just know that it’s ok. U don’t need to feel productive. Sometimes it’s ok to be lazy or sleep late. Don’t beat urself up over it! And u can definitely change ur habits if u try. I believe in u!!!
I am the same story. 25 and I stay up extremely late playing video games, watching anything I can on Netflix. I have to use melatonin if I ever hope to sleep. Waking up I sit in bed for about 2 hours and try to remind myself what I want to do every day because I usually have so much on my mind I don’t remember. Lost my father in 2019 unexpectedly he was very healthy when he passed it made no sense. I’m still trying to get past it.
If you want you could add me on discord. Feeling the same and could use someone to keep me accountable.
Deriving genuine enjoyment out of life? That's something I can't relate to. The closest thing there is for me are videogames which are pretty much to pass the time
You got time brother. Don't think it's too late.   I'm 24 and I'm restarting life. We're only a year apart.
I too stay up whole night just to play 'City skylines' on pc. I don't know why but I really feel better at night when there is no one bothering me. The world feels better. Apart from it even the game soothes me as I think atleast I can make my city (in the game)a happy place, where everything is under my control.
Me too
Omg this is literally me right now. I realize that I tend to go through small periods of time where I do this.  I eventually come out of it. But I can understand how it’s so addicting.  It’s quiet. The world is asleep and you can just exist without any societal pressures. It’s peacefulz
Damn dude, this is exactly me rn. I'm lazy, unmotivated, I just play Videos games all night and sleep all day while working with my GFs famil via transporting vehicles. I even live with the rent free and I feel guilty and shitty because I suck at everything and I don't know what to do in life. I had a couple of jobs in fast food and as a buzzer but my back would constantly hurt (probably because of somewhat curved spine) and I've been doing college but because of my ADHD, I can't focus and I have zero motivation to do anything. I'm literally a failure tbh. While others are struggling to live paycheck to paycheck, I'm here being a slug/leech. I'm scared of everything (like the dark, needles, heights, death, bugs, etc) and so I would never kill myself but regardless, I feel miserable. Not because of my lifestyle but moreso trying to live up to everyone's expectations of me. The only other things I'm decent at are things that would probably get me nowhere. I like performing music but making money off of it is slim (I have tried making beats but I can't even focus on that). I have interest in acting/voice acting but as an Asian, parts are rare.  Because of my ADHD, I can't even sit still, talk on the phone while sitting, or read a damn long paragraph without skimming through it and forgetting everything I just read. This also includes trying to listen to professors as I try and listen but I literally forget and if I don't do that, I don't pay attention. The only way I get by through tests is to use muscle memory and just bury the same concepts in my head but I end up forgetting it after a week or so anyways. Atm I'm 25 y.o. And I relate to your post hard. Sorry I don't have any advice but I'm hoping that we can all make it out of our depressing slums.
Sounds like me for the past 5 years or longer. I became a lot more productive in the past year. I got a job delivering pizza, now I have 2 food delivery jobs but I usually wake up at 4 on days I work. Work til 10, then go home to watch tv and play video games. I got a switch past year after working a few months. It’s was my first time playing video games regularly in 15 years. I got Skyrim for Black Friday and have been playing it nonstop since. Lately I’ve been staying up til 10am or later and sleeping til 8pm. It’s getting a little out of control but it’s ok I guess.  What have you been playing?
Bro i am there for you love you bro🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏻‍♂️
Sometimes when I am awake I stare as a sink of dishes and even that feels crushing.  I hate myself for crying over a pile of dishes or laundry, but I do.
Night time is honestly the best. During the summer I would sleep at like 6am. At night everyone else in my family is asleep. I can go to the living room and watch Netflix alone, eat some good food. I’d go on walks, which no one would be on the streets. It’s so peaceful and calming.
I remember that time in my life...  And I regret it. I wished I had concentrated on slowly but surely moving my life to more senseful things. And complete some things.  But you are in the right age to catch yourself, since many do get of track right at that age.  And don't panic and don't make rush decisions, just put you focus on something that is worth to put the focus on and don't throw it away.  Wish you luck.
26M and having the the same thoughts
I'm doing the exact same thing rn, I feel like this is a sign. Its 6:16am where I am rn. I usually sleep before 5 but today was special. I have very little money and I just stayed up all night trying to find a way to move out. I'm 21 btw.
Idk but try finding a part time job....just something to keep you going and focused.  I know it hard bruv.   I was furlough for  4 months  and started to fall into a rut ..  I'm  now  back in work and its given me more structure and routine to my days.
I've been doing this for years.
Pretty similar and 25 here too. I'm usually tired for games though, so I just end up browsing the internet aimlessly or watching shows or anime.
Same here I don't fall asleep till 4-5am then I wake up at like 11am-noon.  I'm more of a night owl and I just hate sleeping as it feels like wasted time. That and it means another of my days gone. Then it is also I get constant lege pain due to an injury as a child.
I am the opposite on my days off. I wake up around 5am and play while no one else is on, and then go to bed early.
Sleep is really important and it’s one of the first things you should try to fix when your depressed because it will give you more energy to do things, one thing you Can try is each night, get off of your game 30 minutes or even 20 minutes earlier each night until your going to be at a decent time like maybe 12:00. For me there’s always a point in the night where my eyes get really tired at around 12 and I used to just push trough it and 20 minutes later I would be wide awake again so I would play until like 4 in the morning. I’m not sure if you get this while your playing but if you do then as soon as it comes just get off no matter how into the game you are and go to sleep without using your phone or tv because screens will wake your eyes back up. It gets me to sleep within 20 minutes every time so if your playing and get this then just try it once and if you do fall asleep earlier just see how nice it is to wake up with more energy and it might motivate you to do it more. Waking up early with a lot of energy is honestly the best feeling and you need to just experience it once to realize how productive your days can be. You might need to get to sleep early like 2 or 3 days in a row to really see an affect on your energy throughout the day but I promise you it’s worth it. I’m not saying that it will cure depression but it is a good first step and will make the rest of the process so much easier.   Also I just read the end of your post, my mom passed away when I was 7 from lung cancer (not a smoker) and I’m not 16, I have no clue what it’s like to have a mom and I think that that was the main cause of my 4 year depression, little things like doing something that your parents used to love to do will help a lot (at least for me it did), it will make you sad at first but it will also make the healing process easier because you will feel like your almost doing it with them. I hope you get better! Stay strong
I used to prefer night time and do exactly the same as you back then, and I couldn't get myself to "fix" my life and rearrange my sleeping schedule, until one day responsibilities forced me out of it, I had to get a job. I left the habit for good, and never fell back into it again since almost 7 years ago. Now I've built up confidence, made a lot of friends, started many new hobbies, and I really like the daylight with various activities, and chill night time with a couple of friends and some alcohol.  Don't give up hope, try to get help from the outside that can force you out of it, talk with people more, arrange different activities, sometimes the hole is too deep to be able to climb out from alone, you need a hand. Good luck my friend.
Video games stopped working for me. I sit and stare trying to decide what to do with myself. Every choice I make in that context is met with near painful butterflies in my stomach when I imagine what I might be about to do. So, I sit there thinking in circles until I get tired and fall asleep. I can't get in to anything and it sucks.
I woke up 11am today. It's hard. I don't have an episode of my anxiety/depression in weeks... I'm starting to worry how bad it will be when it comes.
> I want to start to get my life back to something that I can derive some genuine enjoyment out of and move forward with productive things  Baby steps - my dad died a few months back and everything got put on hold. I found doing more and more little things got me going again. As I did more, I slowly could see normal life coming back.  I started with cleaning, organizing, etc. I put down the video games and just tried to work and keep my mind occupied. It helped a lot - give it a try.
I’ve been in that cycle before, it helps to have something you need to wake up for, like a project. Indulge your curiosities and start learning and doing, I’m wishing you luck
I'm with you bro. I'm 24 and I haven't made any progress in the last few years. I'm really sorry about your loss.
I'm sorry for your loss
Same. Anime/games/reading/writing  until 4 AM.   I love it but it certainly fucks with your mental state.   Nights are such a blessing
im not depressed but id be lying if i didn't say that i play rust to 4am
You should join the military dawg
5 a.m.? Rookie;).
How tf do people sleep for so long. Im jealous. I stay up till 5 and wake up at 6.30 after. (Am not pm) And then ill feel dead af but somehow stay up to 5 again
You sound like the perfect candidate for: **night shift**
[deleted]
Sounds like we’re on the same page
Same here. But after 800+ hours in my favorite videogame I got bored and now I just don't know what to do, I don't want to play anything else but I also don't want to see that game anymore, so... I'm just wasting my time on reddit.
Night feels like day and day feels like night I wake up when the sun is down and it sucks but it’s like I can’t control it
I got bored of every game even ones I got for Christmas I just don’t feel motivation anymore for anything anyone else’s feel like that?
That’s the only way to do it, and it works. But sometimes easier said than done
I get used to the alarm noise and then the time I spend in bed hitting 'snooze' gets longer and longer, so I have to change the sounds for my alarm from time to time if I want that to kiiinda work. New sounds seem to have a better effect on pushing me out of bed.
That worked on me for some time as well but I got back to playing video games late with no enjoyment what so ever it feels so bad.
I feel you. Don’t give up hope yet, you never know what will happen
Thank you ♥️
actually reading this at 9:32am 😐
I’m so glad this showed up today.
Good idea, thank you
This had sort of helped me. I found that forcing myself to go on some nature walks in county and state parks has helped.
So relatable
Relatable to a tee
Thank you
Rinse and repeat
Thank you ♥️
Really well put. Thanks for the advice
I’ve got quite a bit of money in savings currently. and I do Instacart deliveries on and off.   This excessive staying up late and sleeping all day has only been going on for about a month now but it’s a vicious cycle
Really nice post. Thanks for the advice and comfort
I’ve been smoking some weed again lately, goes well with gaming but makes me more aware of how depressed I am
It’s rough sometimes man. I wish you all the best
Nice, sounds like some progress. I’ve been playing COD Modern Warfare mostly lately
Lmao what
There are different types of videogames.
Treat yourself to a good morning. To be honest, it does feel tempting to stay up, but if you're like me, the night is when you feel most emotional and the darkest thoughts and the morning is when you feel most likely to be interested in things. So waking up at 7 is awesome! You get a whole little period of time to just enjoy it being day, the news (or maybe not the news?), breakfast, etc. Just try it one day!   In practical terms the only way to fix a messed up sleep schedule is just to wake up early. You will realistically never fall asleep early one day -- not unless you're tired from waking up early. So wake up early! For real one day. Just keep trying if it doesn't happen right away. And then, the second morning after that is probably going to be better in all realism. But the first day might be good too!
We are all on the same page. I feel like I have no purpose. Just waiting for what tomorrow brings.   I've finished games in days where normally if I had a regular work schedule would take months to finish.   I've watched countless TV shows and I officially run out of shows to watch.   I'm bored out of my mind n because of covid there is no place to go even if I did feel like venturing out into the wild.
Which game?
There are countless good games out there. No need to play the same one forever
You poor thing :( I hope you feel better soon. You deserve to at least find joy in the new games you got. All the best
Definitely easier said than done. The only way I can really manage it sometimes is by tricking myself with the alarm
Can you set a song as your alarm? Cause choosing a really annoying song that you hate might help
I at least get some enjoyment out of gaming, but then it feels like I’m wasting away my life the more hours I put into it.  Thanks OP I think I’ll have to try that
You don't give up hope either. We can get through this 💕
Been doing the same and now having to get up for work and I feel absolutely destroyed. Can't function well at work, problems are mounting. Feel like I'll crash and burn.
You're most welcome.
Check out griefshare or similar programs
♥️
You might be able to break out of it not by trying to wake up earlier but by not going to sleep. If you’re up until 5am, just be like “well I’m up, time to start my day”. And then go for a walk outside or something and make a healthy breakfast. You might feel a bit deranged all day from lack of sleep, but by nighttime you should be able to fall asleep a lot earlier because you’ll desperately need to.     Obviously there are other issues to deal with and I can totally relate to feeling more comfortable in that dark quiet nighttime, but this might at least help one piece of it.
Man. Good for you. My advice? Try to work at least enough to cover your monthly living expenses. And keep as much in savings as possible. Especially in the given climate. This is you time. Grieve... stay up late, but set goals for instacart. Maybe invest a bit (stocks crypto.. I educated myself a bit on both and I was clueless at first). This could possibly be the only time in your life where you have this kind of a break and don’t need to stress about money. In that respect...you’ve got some breathing room... many of us don’t. maybe volunteer? Consider donating to a cause, family, individual depending on your situation. Right now $10 or $20 would be a huge deal to so many people. And it might make you feel a little warm and fuzzy inside. If you’re instacarting... get your customers order, checkout, if you see an opportunity, pay for the persons groceries next in line as a surprise (or $20 towards their total or whatever). Buy a gift card while checking out and gift it to someone walking in. Random acts of kindness.  Again... small goals, trick yourself if you have to. Force yourself and then be kind to yourself. Just Some thoughts. 👍🏻 Laura
Anytime. As a followup... you say you feel like you’re wasting your time... have you always felt that way? Was there a time when you didn’t feel that way? If so what was different... and were you happy?   What makes you happy? Or has made you happy in the past?
For me it masks it. I get stoned and dont mind wasting 6.hours playing a video game. Im actually coming up to my first break from thc in about 6 years. Smoking the last of the good stuff i have and taking an undetermined length of time totally sober. Im scared shitless for it and also super excited for it. I am an poly substance addict, by the way.. lol.
What happened?
BABY SHARK  (I'd hate it, but it'd wake me up)
Im not sure if I can, will look into it. But would definitely be worth trying, even if I wake up hating the world :P
The feeling of wasting time took away all the enjoyment I had in video games, and some times things in video games would hit the soft spot and I would start crying in front of my computer.
League of legends is my drug... I've been pretty ill for the last few weeks and have been falling behind in my school work, I've been overwhelmed with anxiety and fear, but today I've been trying to look into the void and slowly deal with my emotions rather than going into autopilot and my body going into 'flight' mode and turning to League to escape from reality.
Good luck! It could allow you to make some good progress with your life   I was an alcoholic for like 3-4 years, drinking every night and it did a great job at masking, but I realized it wasn’t sustainable so I had to stop  But then I got really depressed without a coping mechanism
hah I'll leave this idea as a last resource, if everything else fails
Oh my god that’s a level!!
That sleepy scramble to turn off the annoying hateful sound will definitely get you out of bed lol
depression sadly does remove our enjoyment for things we used to love. Whenever I go on my xbox now I'm like: 'Why am I actually on the xbox? It's not even fun.'
Yeah that has to be done at some point. Facing the shit head on, but it’s much easier than it sounds
Play seraphine
videogames are an escape from reality for me. now I don't see any point in them. I have 13 games installed on my pc and none of them amuse me.

She tried to kill herself on christmas day but she ended up in a coma and died about a week ago. I only found out because someone i know asked me why i wasnt at her service. Cant say im suprised though. Her parents always hated me. She was cremated so i cant even go visit her grave. I just feel so empty or maybe angry, i cant even tell at this point. I dont know what im going to do, she was really the last good thing in my life
I am so sorry
Fuck these parents! How can people be such motherfuckers?
I'm sorry to hear that. Just try to improve your life from hear on out dog. Pick one day a year to devote to mourning, be it a the day she passed or her birthday or a day that was significant to both of you for some reason. Light a candle or go somewhere that was special to her or just be sad on that specific day every year. Sorta like the opposite of a holiday. Maybe get involved in suicide and/or youth counseling, since it seems you may have some incite into what goes wrong and how it can be prevented.
Wow this is so horrible to hear. I hope her kind soul rests in peace away from this shitty world. As for you... I hope you don't put the blame on yourself. This isn't your fault. Please remember that. I'm here if you need someone to talk to :(
I’m jealous of your friend. I’m sorry u lost your friend though.
Im actually already involved in a suicide prevention program. I got into it because of her, this was her 3rd attempt. I met her in the hospital after her 1st and we became friends. I found her after her 2nd and saved her life
As unpleasant as this is, it gives you valuable experience. Young people sometime lose sight of the fact that things can get better, and the people they leave behind when they do something drastic like this. Trying to look at it in a somewhat positive way, you have leverage now with folks who might pull the " you don't understand" card. You can give an example of how you feel having not even been contacted before she did what she did. My dad had a missed call from his brother the night before he killed himself, and he always felt guilty about that. It's important for people to understand that while others may be busy with their own lives, they really do care and want to help. Hopefully you can make a difference with at least one person, empathy is a powerful thing. Good luck and sorry for your loss. At least she has someone to remember her.  I apologize if that was a bit of a ramble.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0c7rs/im_suicidal_but_i_want_to_keep_living/
As someone who is suicidal, I honestly don't want to die. I want to recover and continue living. It's just that me recovering isn't feasible, considering that the solutions to my problems are very demanding, and will probably never be solved unless something very extraordinary happens. I'm honestly very heartbroken that I'll probably never get to experience the things in life that most people do, but me recovering isn't gonna happen, and I'd rather be dead than never recover.
I came in here expecting to find somebody I can relate to. You remind me a lot about myself. It’s like you’re writing something in which I would’ve written yesterday. Somethings never end. Hate never ends nor suffering. There will always be darkness. But what makes people happy is the light that shines through it. A lot of the bad things you’ll never get rid of. But I realized in order to feel something you gotta outnumber the pain with happiness. Sometimes it’s hard to find happiness and what makes you happy. But I guarantee you, if you find some light, even the slightest bit of happiness, you will feel something. You will find reason to live. Sometimes dying sounds like a good option but it’s the little bit of happiness that’s holding you back from doing anything crazy. Keep believing and keep finding what’ll make you happy. That will make you feel something.
As someone who has felt the same way, I thought it would never get better. And yes, something extraordinary had to happen for it to change. 15 long years of pain and sadness. If I hadn't spent the holidays last year with my aunt, I would be dead right now - well... probably not because I am terrible at that, too. Then it happened. I got a call that my ex-husband was dead. I know it sounds awful, but if you knew my story, you'd be happy for me. Ever since his death, life has gotten a little more tolerable. I've been losing weight. Been kicking ass at work. I might even try the dating scene again. But, I'm with you. I'd rather be dead than be alone for the rest of my life. Now I have hope that I will find someone. Life is not perfect right now. I still fall into a deep dark hole here and there and cry until I have a headache. But it is better than before.   I'm not saying everyone gets what they want in life. I think I won the lottery in this case. But your personal extraordinary event may happen. Wait a little longer if you can.
I feel the same way. It's like you want to just pass on but you want to just live on to have a glamour of hope that some great will come along. I hate it when life is trapping us for no reason and everybody else is living to their according. I'm here for you.
Then you're not suicidal, you're emotionally void.  Once people realize the Universe is indifferent and life has no meaning, it becomes much easier (sometimes) to just live for the sake of living.  There is no purpose, no why, no end goal.  Given that, live as you want because you aren't gonna live forever.
I don't mind working in a covid area.
I relate to this more than I thought I would.    I accept dying, but there is still that small bit of hope that somehow I will find a way to be able to live a sustainable life, but it seems that nothing short of a miracle will do.    Currently traveling between cities, mental health in shambles, having a hard time finding a job and fighting to avoid becoming homeless again, everyday being tempted by suicide to just throw it all away and try to find rest from this existence... But still, there is still here this hope that if by some miracle I could find a way to fix the basic things around me that I could just live instead of die.    Anyway, hopefully things somehow turn for better for you and that your miracle may come and this post becomes just a fading memory of darker days.
Depression still hits me don’t get me wrong. But as my life has gone on it’s gotten better. I can say that first hand, keep fighting. Peace and Solidarity
beautifully said that meant a lot to me
I feel super similarly to both of you, when it gets really dark I try tell myself to carry on for the people around me and that helps a lot. Hope your feeling better at time of reading
I have people who are my last reasons for living. They carry me in living if that makes sense. They bring that light that I cant see when I go through very tough times. I hope they eventually realize they are very special and important to me. :)

because other people will just hate and leave you. what's the point of everyone being different, if no one accepts who you are? i have no friends, and i've been trying to make some friends for years. due to that i've had many experiences with trying to make friends with people. i tried just being natural, covering some things up, or just being completely different. i'm someone who has always been lonely, i never have any friends, and so i'm always sad and crying. if i tell that to people, there are two types of responses. either they just don't care much, or they say it's ok and they will be here for me. however, i find that they will always eventually leave. so i tried being completely different and just acting like nothing is wrong and i'm happy. and i found that it works much better trying to find friends. i mean, that makes sense, because who would like to have a friend who's just depressed and crying and complaining everyday. however, doing that i got tired of it real quick because, really, it is very hard to hold everything to yourself and act like you're happy when you're just crying, dying with loneliness and pain inside. but seriously, no one wants to stay with me and look out for me? i'm having to lie and cover my true self up, so that people actually stay and talk to me. i guess that's just how it is now. i guess from now on, i'll keep everything to myself, i won't tell anyone anything. no one cares about my feelings. no one cares about who i am
I care who you are, and we all look out for you.
I care it's just hard for me right now
What sometimes people forget in their desires for connections is that friendship (or any sort of social relationship really) is a "social contract". You are expected to certain behaviors and if these are not maintained you eventually end without any social relationships.    You may find people with whom you may build a social contract that allow you to be yourself most of the time, but is unrealistic to believe that all relationships should be like that. The most lonely of us still has some small criteria on what they can put up to enjoy or tolerate someone else company, why others wouldn't offer us the same?    So, answering the opening question: most of the time you can't be yourself. You can be in specific situations, with specific people if you are lucky. Living in a society is performative experience, it is all an act, some people are just more conscious than others and that makes it hard to throw yourself into a role you are expected to fill in. You can either accept and try to learn how to be a better actor and take enjoyment while doing it or you can refuse, but even in the refusal there is no need to be bitter and sad or angry, there is peace in accepting that you need very little from others to be able to be content and happy with your life.
Everyone has unique unrealised creative and destructive energies. You need to find your positive traits and leave destructive energies behind. You will have many thoughts and feelings - some beautiful, some ugly; but they all have beauty. Try connecting with people over unique positive aspects of your psyche.

I just wanted to quickly  say thank u to  everyone on this subreddit. Im just glad that we're able to have such a great vibe here tbh reddit is the only form of social media where i feel safe and comfortable and it's all thanks to you so. I hope that we'll keep on helping each other. To whoever is Reading this stay strong Queen/king
i has to delete twitter and Facebook because of how negative everything on it is. it’s just people arguing. the only safe social media is Reddit and Snapchat (and that’s only because it’s close friends rather than public posts). social media can really affect those with mental illness and “trigger” negative thoughts. im glad you found a safe space on this platform :)

&#x200B;  When every day is a struggle  It's a wonder how I even muster up the  Non-existent energy that no longer radiates from my mind  The energy that fueled my happiness   That fueled a life I thought was worth living  People say "youre amazing"!  Am I?  When all I want…  All I want…  To do is disappear?  To not wake up?  To wake up and not be corrupt  Corrupt in the emotions of my mind  I tend to lie.  "I'm ok"  But really am I?  I struggle with courage  The courage to move on  Damn courage!  I had courage before!  It was taken and ripped from me  From the year of bullies  The years of emotional torture…  That never…  Seemed…  To end….
You are amazing, this poem is proof.. Wish I could write like that
I love the lines   “To disappear   To not wake up  To wake up and not be corrupt”
This is so great. I love it
I can relate a lot to the doubts you've captured so well in your poem. I feel less alone in this struggle. I feel understood, and this brightened my mood a bit. The ability to make someone's day better with your words is remarkable. I hope this poem will allow others to feel (even a bit) better, too! Thank you for sharing.
I bet you could! It takes practice :)
Thank you <3

Falling apart but careless  Try to depart awareness  Identity is bareness  Who and what and when and how  For if I try the swelling vow  My mirror meets me with a scowl   And now among the endless sea  Seeing blue eternally   The muster of effort for death or for help  Never myself for another I yelp   I got myself here I should get myself out  But I struggle seeing the point  For if I try I disappoint
Actually super cool imo
I liked that.  If you write some more shit please post it!
Beautiful poem. A great way to relay how you are feeling
Good poem man. I hope its gets for you from here.
Great expression...speak your truth, we like to read it homie
Great, it's good to explain your feelings in whatever way.
This is an incredible . Keep it up mate . I would love to hear more .
Thanks you're really beautiful
Oh, thank you!  I like the way you’ve written this, I’m a big fan of ‘generic’ rhyming poems, it has some flow!

Ever since middle school, I've gotten these intense spikes of depression that kill my energy and drive to do anything but eat and sleep. I can have everything planned out for school or work and it all goes out the window once I get depressed. I can get all straight A's in school and then the next semester get all F's because all my hope gets lost. I can do really well at work and get everything done one week, then the next week actively try to get fired. It's exhausting.
That is exactly how it felt for me ever since middle school. You are not alone. It is very exhausting. I just keep riding the sine wave. It comforts me to know, that there are others experiencing life in the same way.
Basically when it started for me as well, you’re going to have to find those things that distract and uplift you. For me it’s always been art, music, friends. There’s more I can’t think of them right now. Just do your best to cling on to the things that bring you happiness during the low times.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0ls3d/how_to_explain_to_my_therapist_that_im_really/
I’m in therapy with a psychologist and we talk a lot about my anxiety and why I have it but we never really talked about my suicide thoughts or even when I’m really depressed and what I think in those times. What I wanted to do really quickly is informing her that I’m currently really struggling and I’m not well. I have suicide thoughts almost everyday and depressed thoughts 24/24. I don’t know how to really bring that up in my next session with her and I’m kinda scared that she will judge me or something bad could happen (like being yelled at or she asks that I go into a hospital which I don’t want). We never really spoken about that because I’m to shy to open up about those things.  One time we talked about my suicidal thoughts but I never had the courage in the next sessions to tell her that now it’s unbearable for me.  So how should I introduce her that I’m depressed, have severe anxiety and suicidal thoughts in my next session ? And what will probably happen after that ?
[removed]
I have some experience with this. The first time I brought up suicidal thoughts to my therapist he stopped me and explained his legal obligations to me. If he thought I was an immediate danger to myself or others he had to report it. An immediate danger involves having the means, a plan, and a time frame. I just had passive suicidal ideation, never active. That is, I would think about suicide all the time. "I should just buy a gun and shoot myself. That would make the pain stop." That's very passive. No set time. I don't own a gun so there's no means. If I told my therapist, "I'm going to buy a gun tomorrow and then shoot myself in my backyard," Then that's active suicide ideation and now he has to determine how serious he thinks I am.   Talk to your therapist. Tell them you feel depressed 24/7. Tell them that you think about suicide. She may ask you straight out if you are a danger to yourself. Just say no and that you want to work to stop having those negative thoughts.   >I’m kinda scared that she will judge me    Tell her this. Tell her that you are hesitant to speak up because you have a fear of her judgment. This is something she is trained to deal with and can help you work through. Therapy cannot work without you being completely honest and open with your therapist. If there's a personality conflict causing you to feel judged then you may need to find a new therapist. There's nothing wrong with firing a therapist.   I hope things improve for you.
Its her job to understand your condition from the symptoms you describe, so start by telling how you've been feeling and how hard and unbearable it is for you these days. I remember I once told my therapist (I go to bc of social and generalized anxiety) that I feel that nothing matters anymore and I dont see a point in living or trying to improve my life and she immediately understood that I was depressed. What will happen after that? Therapists have different methods dealing with their patients, she might alter her therpay sessions to focus on your depression or prescribe antidepressants like mine did
oh my god, how is therapy supposed to work if you can't talk about stuff like that?  isn't she asking you questions about how you feel lately? Or isn't she asking the questions if thoughts like those come up?  If she's not constantly double checking that an episode might had started between the sessions then she's obviously no good.  I understand you shiness in that regard, because the undepressed career psychologists would like to tick his patient of as "healed" and likes to go to the next and if it doesn't work he tries to blame the patient for being uncooperative.  But maybe start to hint at her "things aren't as good at the moment". She'll probably pick it up and tries to go into that. You don't have to justify "why" logically things are not quite working for you. That's not how depression works. If she doesn't get it: next!
Thank you for your advice, I think it’s yes, the best thing to do if I’m not comfortable saying straight up to her “I want to kill myself”, I might try to maybe say I’m very sad these times but I’m afraid she will not considerate this as “please I really need help rn” and continue our session with another topic not related
Thank your for your response, now it's more clear in my head of what she can do or not, I do not plan to kill myself like tomorrow or with something (as u said you need for example a date or having plannified something). And I think as you said I should talk about the fact I'm scared she will judge me. Sometimes I'm scared for nothing and more particularly about the judgement of others but yuuup, sh'es trained to deal with that you are totally right so I think I should start my session with her with that and then explain my depressive state ? Yep I think it's the best to begin like that, thank you

I always doubt myself. Is it me? Am I the asshole? Is my memory right? I don’t know what I want or like or dislike anymore. What am I? I feel detached from reality. Long time since I felt present. I don’t know who I am anymore.
Thanks for posting this. I thought I was the only one descending into madness.
i feel the same
Ever done any dissassociatives?
I remember feeling like this. You're suppressing your feelings. Be open and honest with your deepest, darkest feelings. Look for your unique traits and stuff in your unconscious. Everyone is full of potential.
What did you to help yourself on this?

Hey, I don't know why I'm writing this, because it still feels surreal. I have hope for the first time in years. I smile, I laugh with my heart, dare I say I'm even happy sometimes? I spent so much time drowning in stress and an seemingly never ending void of nothingness that I'm not sure what to make of this. Part of me is terrified it won't last long and already worries how hard I will fall again. But there's also a small part in me just telling me to enjoy this fleeting moment while it lasts. It feels like I don't have to carry all my stuff alone anymore, you know? I'm used to living in my black and white world and now I can see these greyish nuances as well and it makes me anxious and hopefull at the same time that I will be ok some day. I picked up reading for enjoyment after a long time, I allow myself to live in the moment. I will never be able to forget my past and somehow I wouldn't want it any other way, it's a part of me for better and worse. But why should I worry so much about the future? Isn't it enough to worry about things when they actually happen? I wonder if I'm completely insane now, but I don't want to loose this feeling. Does it really get better? For the first time I believe it just might. Crazy shit, huh.  English is not my first language, I apologize for mistakes I made.  Have a nice day, I guess.
[removed]
Its understanding that you are afraid of it going away after I suppose being in a depressive state. Was there anything that happened or some things/activities you did that lead to this current state? I would suggest writing those down and perhaps finding that pattern that works for you and you can fall back to later. Its a journey for sure and it will take time. Whatever happens, you feel good now and that's a positive memory that will be left in your brain. Whenever you feel down again, you can always refer back to this moment. I hope that helps a bit. Sending virtual hugs!
Thank you :)

My whole life I've always done everything I can to be the best person for the people around me, constantly changing and adapting to suit the people I care for. I've gone to such great lengths to help people out and to do what i can to improve their lives in any way. Never have I been the type to just be petty or a dick to someone, never do I insult people or instigate fights or even participate in them. But time and time again, I've been shown that despite all this, I simply will not get the love from those around me I so desperately crave. A few months ago, I attempted suicide. Before the event, my friends knew I was depressed and they tried to help me feel better, and I felt loved. After I made my attempt and later recovered, these same friends don't talk to me as much anymore or care to ask how I'm doing or any of it. That makes it feel so much like they were only there in the first place as a sort of human moral obligation; i.e. no one wants to be the asshole that didn't care about the suicidal guy. I feel constantly like they no longer care because they no longer have to, because now I'm not in eminent danger of dying at my own hand.   This is a minor detail to add, but recently my friend group and I went to a chain restaurant and got a booth, I was the last to the table and they shifted about quite a bit, along with some minor tussle-talk. It was clear no one wanted to sit by me so I ended up pulling a chair to the side of the table so no one would need to worry about sitting directly next to me.   Even in my last serious relationship I experienced this. My feelings were never considered in the decisions that she made, and she even did things to spite me at times. Throughout our whole 2-year long relationship, I put as much time and effort into us as I possibly could, because I cared about us and our future, about her and her well-being. Despite all this, she lied about various things, broke promises with no regret, and even cheated on me, hid it from me, lied about it when confronted, and then blamed me for it in the end. Sometimes I feel like one of the primary reasons my relationship failed was because I'm simply not attractive enough. It's brought my self esteem and self worth to its lowest point.  Everything people say to me or do to me seems to either be out of obligation or pity. I just don't feel like people care about me the way I care about them.  TL;DR; I do everything I can for the people I love but I feel like I don't receive any of that love in return from anyone. Why?
I feel like people can sense this like they know they can get over on you and you allow it. I would leave these people alone cultivate yourself and your confidence and set boundaries straight up. You have infinite value but you can’t wait for someone to notice that or to tell you that it’s truly within where the process starts, I hope this helps...
You’re looking for love in the wrong places. God loves you unconditionally
Do not make this about religion, please
Well I was just trying to help. I don’t feel worthy of anyone’s love either but I have to accept that there are people that love me unconditionally
I understand, but I personally am not someone who is religious or believes in deities such as gods. Thanks anyway :)

Memory loss has become so prevalent because of my depression that I can't seem to remember anything. I study all day every day just to remember exactly nothing when I start my exam. I used to be the kind of student to just look at a summary of the course once and to remember everything on it and to ace the exam. Now I can't remember anything even if I write down everything from my syllabus. This is embarrassing and my parents are starting to ask questions.
Write down main points of a topic in a card after you study the topic . In this way , if you look at it again after sometime it will be easier to remember . Also cards are very short , so you don't need much time .   Let me know if you need any help .
I may not be the op, but I'm struggling with some issues here and there as well. I'm finding it hard and difficult to focus, making me useless both in group studies and in class. Memory is also a part of the problem but i think it can be solved by fixing the short attention span thing. I can also add more details if you want, I understand this vague will almost certainly give you nothing but same case applies even now. Any help will be accepted. Thanks for the memorization tips as well.   Note: English is not my first language. Sorry for wrong grammar and spelling

therapy makes me anxious asf but not gonna lie, i miss it. just having someone to talk to and not feel like im being a burden to them because i know that im literally paying them with money just to listen to me talk. because that's how lonely and pathetic i am. i could literally just call up a friend and talk to them but i've pushed them all away and they're now all mad at me so im left with no one to talk to but some random stranger who listens to people's problems for a living.  but then my mom made me stop going to therapy, as it costs us too much, which was understandable, and yes we can afford it but i don't want to have any more debt to my parents, if im being honest. but then she went ahead to say that it was all *fake* and i don't really need to go to therapy because there's nothing wrong with me in the first place. she claims that i was just too much of a pessimist and that it's all in my way of thinking, and she's not wasting any more of her money for something so stupid. depression is apparently dumb, and anxiety is just an excuse to be lazy.   maybe she's right, but i still miss it though.
You can tell me about your feelings.

I can't stop thinking commiting suicide, killing myself feels like a release to my hellish life. I can barely be motivated to do anything. From every possible viewpoint I can find, I'm worthless. I don't matter from anyone's standpoint. If you think I haven't told anyone, that isn't true. I told my mom, who told my school. Probably worst year ever. All that happened, I shit you not, was me being yelled at more, forced to reveal everything, and a "therapist" who told the suicidal 7th grader that happiness was a choice. Now, I can barely find the motivation to not play video games during class and cheat on schoolwork. I fantasize the day I die currently. My mom is clueless and thought the therapist fixed everything, so thankfully, nobody in my life knows about what I'm going through as they just make it worse. I can't currently kill myself as I have no access to weapons or a car, I've tried dehydration and that failed three days in, starvation obviously wouldn't work, so I'm currently trying to plan my suicide without getting caught and debating when to write my suicide note. I feel like I deserve this and that I did this, this is my fault, and that I should just run away right now and starve to death. I hate everything and nobody brings any positivity into my life and I have nothing worthwhile to live for. I have two friends which I'll lose after highschool, so I'll have nobody except for my shitty family. Even writing this post is making me self conscious about being an attention seeker, and that it's all in my head, and that I'm just not trying enough. On the other end, I feel like I've fought like hell and there's no way out. Why should I even live anymore?
There was a point last year where I felt the exact same. I didn’t want to get out of bed, I couldn’t find the motivation to do absolutely anything.   Killing yourself is a permanent solution to a short term problem. And you aren’t being an attention seeker, you always have an outlet here online. There will be people who can respond and give you some advice or just let you vent.   I suggest doing something every day. Or at least try to.  It can be something as simple as making your bed everyday, but even that can improve your mental health by at least a tiny bit.   If you live in the US, there are plenty of resources that can help you out. Unfortunately I can’t name any of them besides the one I have in my phone.   You can text the number 741741 and send them the message “Home” and it’ll connect you with someone who can help you within 10 minutes or so. It’s not a direct solution but it can help you in that moment.   Try to hang on, you can get through it. It won’t be like this forever. If you ever need someone to talk with, I’m here.
You're got hope. That's why you wake up.
I am no expert, but, unless you exhausted absolutely all opportunities at getting help, you shouldn't make such decisions. It might not seem like a bright future awaits, but sometimes you have to act out the thing before you can believe it. Do anything in your ability to restore stability to your life, whether it is making your bed, having a shower, waking up at the same time, going outside, etc. Be honest with your parents, as it seems like they are concerned about you, and your therapist, make sure that you do not hide the way you feel from them, otherwise they're not even going to be able to give you help. Search for different therapists, it can take many attempts to find one who will help you.  Suicide is a devastating experience for everyone around you, I've seen it happen when I volunteered in EMS. Even if you think you want them to suffer, think very carefully about that again.  Take it all one day at a time. If you can't take it a day at a time, take it an hour at a time. Or a minute. You don't have to plan what you will do tomorrow if what's happening right now is overwhelming. Narrow your time frame.   Keep moving forward. One foot in front of the other. And if you have planned your suicide out already and are determined to carry it out, please call 911. Please. Don't think much and just call them and tell them.
Not trying to downplay your advice or anything but I have to ask how is it a permanent solution to a short term problem. Like what makes it short term? How long can it be considered short?  Sigh.
Killing yourself would be considered a permanent solution. The issues that OP is experiencing is considered short term (to me) because it won’t last forever even though now it feels like it will.   I can’t explain it very well right now, but you can look [here](https://lifemovescounseling.com/suicide-a-long-term-solution-to-a-short-term-problem/) if you want a more detailed explanation.

the only thing I look forward to is sleeping, I feel like when I'm in bed all my responsibilities go away and I feel somewhat safe. when I'm not in bed I just feel so tired, I don't have the energy to do anything, but I have to, I have to put up the image that everything is okay, because its easier to suffer alone than be a burden on everyone.
Feel asleep all day yet I have a completely shitty sleep.
Yup. I rarely leave my bed these days
Ya my room is a mega safe space for me.
Felt this.  Unfortunately I suffer from insomnia and barely sleep through the night.  I also am incredibly anxious 90% of the time and it makes it hard to sleep. I've been trying to sleep for 2.5 hours now.
I get this. I’d love to sleep all day if I could. Yet I get to enjoy waking up to crippling anxiety so I don’t get worn out until about lunch time. Then it all starts again.
yeah i understand, i feel so tired all the time but i have to go to work which makes me even more exhausted and then i sleep, wake up just as tired as before, and repeat the cycle. i feel like i’ll never have energy.
I feel the exact same way. I am unmotivated to live
I think many of us can relate but sadly we still haven't found a solution yet.
Very relatable.
I feel the same but at the same time i tend to avoid sleeping so i dont have to deal with shit the next day
yeah my parents get so annoyed and tell me i dont need 15 hours of sleep but i really just want to sleep all the time

I'm a college student. About 2 years ago, I fell into the pit that is depression. About 4 months ago, it got bad enough to where I tried to commit suicide.   I went to a mental hospital and got treatment. I found the right medication and dropped my class load. When I dropped my classes, I became a part time student. I knew the risks of breaking the terms of my scholarships, but I knew a situation of this kind would work well for an appeal. I got one of them back, but I got denied for the other. They said "you didn't need to drop those classes, right? You could have dealt with it on your own."  Guess I'm back to having student loans.

You need to find your inner beauty and reach out to people. Everyone has unique creative and destructive energies. Focus on the positive traits and trying to turn destructive impulses into something beautiful. I wish more people read new posts to see things like this.

My anxiety ate me alive this morning I felt awful and fought with my parents about it. They told me to kill myself so after panicking I took my jacket and left my home. I went to the nearest bridge and sat there with my legs out of the bridge, over the water. For the first time I was completely calm. Every other time I attempted I was as scared as hell and that was the reason I couldn’t go trough with it. Probably I would have done it this time. Instead a woman grabbed me from behind and took me back to the bridge. She even took me home scared that I would try again. I don’t even know how I should feel. I don’t know anything anymore  Edit: I wrote this post in the heat of the moment but I just wanted to tell you that my parents really love me, it was just a difficult situation I didn’t know how to calm myself and they didn’t know either. It just degenerated but I know they did not mean it, not even a word. When I came back they were terrified that I could have really killed myself, they were really happy to have me back with them.
Is it just me who see's something so beautiful in the thought that some random woman pulled you away from that place? She could've turned around, walked on by and ignored you, passed it off as just a place you like to relax and turn a blind eye..  But wow.. I don't know what I'd do if someone were to show that level of kindness to me.. I hope that you can find it in yourself to maybe thank her or see if you can't get in touch, maybe she'd be willing to listen when your parents don't have the capacity to do so? I dunno, maybe that'd be weird or something. Seems like a powerful gesture though, takes a kind heart imo.  At least take solace in that... That one random human saw you and decided you were worth going out of their way for... I think I'd break down embarrassingly as a 25/M if I had that happen lol.  Thanks for not taking the leap, thanks for still existing, and thanks for sharing this with us/me. This makes me feel a little better about the world... Ever so slightly, however temporary... But I hope the memory stays with you.
I can’t imagine ever telling anyone that I love or care about to kill themselves, no matter how frustrated or overwhelmed I am by the situation...
How about may be not talk to your parents when you are anxious. My parents suck in this department too. May be if you get anxiety like this again you share it here and discuss with us instead of talking to them? It seems like they are dealing with some problems of their own and that might have caused them to make this particularly harsh statement. It looks like you have been given another chance at life. Just know that you are not alone and whatever you are going through is going to change and you will emerge victorious!
Fuck your parents this is their fault. Get away as soon as possible and never look back.   Look at the love you're getting from strangers. We are out here. One day you'll find us and be where you belong. And you'll look back at this moment and say, fuck you mom and dad, I won.
If you under 18 you could call the youth welfare office and let them get you out there, refering to that they told you to kill yourself im considering that it's not the best household to life in
Inexcusable and heart breaking. I am sorry...
Please give the book "Anxious People" by Fredrick Backman, a read. Your brief post reminded me so much of it. It is an unbelievably poignant work of fiction. I am sure your heart would be much warmer after reading that :)
Your so-called parents suck. You were calm in the forte bc you know your destination. Knowing where we should go is important to peace of mind. Idk but can you rent a home? If you are under the age try calling police.   Don't waste the one extra live which that stranger woman gave you. It is hers now. Pay your debt and don't be selfish by escaping.
How old are you ? if underage I would report ur parents. I'm sorry you have to go through this. My mom said the same thing when iw as 16. I almost did it.. thankfully I didn't. After I left home I went no contact with her and it was the best decision I ever made.
For your anxiety, you need something to make you feel a sense of control in your life.   If possible, let that sense of control not come from the thought of ending your life but from something that gives you a sense of achievement.  I'm glad you are not dead, it was no coincidence you were pulled away.   They as parents shouldn't have said that to you.   Do the opposite of what they want you to do.   Stay alive and spite them.
Hey, there are so many young people in your situation . Honestly  some have it so much worse . but that's not healthy for you or anyone. when we are struggling being yelled at or berated does so much damage . we forget to build each other up =( I hope you never go back to that bridge but if only to pull another life from leaping of that bridge <3 stay strong
I grew up severely depressed from age 9 (as far as I remember) with stereotypical Asian parents who were very rough on me and never showed any affection. I had never once heard my parents tell me they loved me, gave me a hug or anything of the sort. One time I lost it when I was 15/16 and screamed at my mother saying I was going to kill myself. She told me to go ahead and do it as she’d have one less worry in her life. At the time, I was resentful and genuinely hated my parents to my core. I moved out right after I turned 17. After a while, I realized and learned to appreciate all my parents had done for me and how much they actually loved me. My relationship is much better with them now than when I lived at home. I think my mother didn’t know how to react that day, so she blurted out a thoughtless response, but I now know 100% that she didn’t mean it. That’s my story at least. It’s hard to really make comments without knowing all the context and background of your life.  I suggest you move out of home. If your situation was anything like mine, maybe it will turn out the same. If not, you still should leave. No one should have to live in such a toxic environment. It will only increase its permanent negative impact on you. As much as I love my parents now, I’m still suffering with depression from their unintentional abuse during my childhood.
I had a similar experience in the past, as far as my father, in an especially heated moment, telling me to go ahead and kill myself — he doesn't care, and in fact it would be at least a financial burden off his shoulders. In my father's case, he did not need a fight to say similarly nasty things — though for others, if you otherwise mostly get along with them, people will say pretty horrible stuff that they don't truly mean, supposedly.   If you think it might help, you might want to mention to your parents that you did this, or at least entrust it to a friend/confidante if you have someone who you can rely on for emotional support. It might make your parents think twice about how they will handle such a situation next time, while a sympathetic friend can at least ease the pain, knowing you are not alone.
When I was told the same thing by my parents counterintuitively it helped me to get my shit together
I’m just going to throw this out there for you.... I wanted to kill myself. But really I was just dying to live. I wanted a different life so bad but I never really even knew it until I moved back to my home state, broke off a 7 year relationship, started dating one of my best friends weeks after said break up..... just now got a new job. This has all happened in 6 months and I’ve been so happy, even with my shitty job up until now. I had to get that new life partner because the one I was with wasn’t my match.... I had to move home so I could be with him... I’m just showing you my situation and leaving out so many things obviously but I’m trying to say, do what makes you or WILL make you happy. And I’m honestly so sorry that you have to deal with your parents telling you that, and I really hope you can make the moves you need to make to feel comfortable but that sounds like one of your first predicaments. I’m really hoping the best for you and that woman that saved you is telling you that you’re not finished here, you have much more to experience on this earth so make those life moves when you want to/can and really bring out that positive mindset of “I can do this”
Shit, this is so messed up dude.  I just hope you get over this somehow.
r/raisedbynarcissists stat...they can help.  Your parents sound like children. What they said to you as parents is unforgivable.   Hang on and get ready to escape them when you can. Life after abuse is so much better, like a whole other world. You need to get away from them before deciding to do anything to yourself. The source of the depression is probably not inside of you, but how they have treated you.  I think r/cptsd can help you too. Short for complex post traumatic stress disorder, this is kind of the default disorder that results from growing up with abusive parents. It can cause depression, anxiety and all sorts of issues related to those things. Even physical health issues like extreme fatigue, insomnia, poor appetite.   For me it turned out to be the root cause of all of my issues and those subs helped me figure it out. I hope they can help you too.  And if it hasn't been said yet, do therapy if at all possible. See if it is available through school, or any local mental health providers that do charity care or have a price scale based on what you can pay.  Having parents like this is just not fair, and just having someone to talk to that you can trust can make a big difference.
I always tell myself that I would never give up no matter how disastrous the outcome of my decisions or situation become.     Life in itself is meaningless, but it has been given and death awaits you so don't rush it. It's okay to think about it but never forget that it will happen so might as well move forward because I'll guarantee you that you'll never know what's coming.  If it's still bad okay? But the important question is, what if it isn't?  Just always remember to move forward.  I always tell myself "I will open every door in my life for as long as I can no matter how much the situation goes down."
Your parents opinion of you are irrelevant. 99% of the time people are just taking out their fears and insecurities. Please don't hurt yourself. That woman being on the bridge with you was a sign, because most people wouldn't have intervened. I know the words of others can be very damaging, especially when you're in an already fragile mindset. Keep strong, you're still here now, keep doing that. I don't know how old you are but you'll get out of your parents house one day. Much love
Id like to first know more about your relationship with your parents.  It sounds as your parents need help and maybe you can help them as we can help you and then all of you can be happy together but its hard to understand without knowing more about how your life and relationship is with them.
My depressed friend whose always been my inspiration, told me he OD'd on pills once after his mother told him the same. My mother also tried to OD on my dads medication when we were really young. I'm doing ok, so no woe is me but it hits different when someone you love deeply, says they don't care. It isn't how they really feel, but some words are difficult to take back.   Theres a short story on anger/resentment, where a son in anger puts nails in his dads fence, after conquering his anger he pull each nail out, but the fence is never the same. A verbal wound is as bad as a physical one. So be careful with your speech!
even in a tough moment, it's never ok for your parents, or anyone, to tell you you should kill yourself. I'm glad you're here.
That’s terrible! I’m happy that that woman did something. Absolutely horrific that your parents would say something like that to you, no matter what they say now or have said in the past. I wish you the best of luck and I really hope that you can overcome this!! Really, I’m happy. :)
All that's important is that you were saved and that you're safe. I'm glad you thought it over afterwards because a lot of us have those moments and only seek to wash it away like it's nothing
oh no so sorry ur parents told u that bub :(( my father told me the same thing too when I was 12 cuz he said he was ashamed to have me as his kid. Please please please don't attempt I beg of you 🥺🥺 I think u feel numb rn but please I see so much potential in u don't let it go to wasteee. In the end I decided to stay alive for my mom, and now my father completely denies that he ever said that and says he's proud of me lol (all cuz I got into this course with super low acceptance rate 🙄🙄) basically life turns around bub and im always here if u wanna talk about it !!
it's something i think (ok maybe day dream) about, if someone finally told me that i should genuinely kill myself, maybe it'll be the final push
[removed]
Wowwwww your parents are terrible people, you deserve better!  There is a whole world outside of your parents and since we didn't pick our folks they do NOT define us.  There are people and groups you can be friends with and reach out to that will support you better, nobody WANTS to be suicidal ffs, glad you came here to vent because you ARE cared for ❤
wow i can relate my mama tried for years to get me dead she put knives near my heart and a pistol by my head and she shoved pills down my throat triying to get me to pass out at night
You should leave your parents and shun them forever, I definitely would. I can't imagine the evil one must have to encourage their own child to commit suicide. You don't deserve to live in that environment; to call it unhealthy is an extreme understatement
You poor baby! I’m so glad that woman had the decency to help you at your worst moment. Your parents should rethink how they treat you, honestly. How are you feeling? I’m sending you all my love ❤️
Sweetheart you need to leave your environment. You can contact protective services or even go to a youth shelter but your feelings are only going to get worse if you stay with people who do not care about you.
Advice your parents can go fuck themselves and you need to figure out who this woman is and she if she can’t help you
No loving parent would say that to their child.   How old are you?
You need to read adult children of emotionally immature parents. You can get a free PDF. Read it. It won't fix your parents but it might prevent you from turning into them.
I kinda have the same story. But this time its my sibling who keeps saying I should kill myself or says that I should take my suicidal thoughts to the next level(even said that I don't have a reason to live when she/he clearly does)I was always told by she/he that im worthless,ugly, fat,stupid countless times to point its become a word trigger for me. Its come to the point where in public she/he sneered with a smile and said that I was ugly and ended up having a fucking panic attack right infront of my family and all the way through the ride home. I just hope that no one has a sibling like I do coz its fucking hurts.
No parent who truly loves their child would ever say something like that.
My mom tells me to kill myself quite often. I tried once. I was tired of hearing it.
For the first time recently, suicide just made logical sense to me. It wasn’t an emotional reaction but one I felt I came to reasonably
Not much to add after that edit but that woman is amazing. Did you get her contact or anything?
You sound like a woman in a abusive relationship.
My father told me to kill myself. However, he has no remorse for having said it. I don’t ever believe it’s ever right to say that to your own child. Whether or not you believe it may happen or not. Words have consequences. It’s good (I guess) that they apologized. Sure, we make mistakes. But if they ever say that again in the heat of rage, then they’re not truly sorry.
I will do it
I hope you get better  Today on class i was given a question and i couldn't understand. My heart stared beating faster and i couldn't breath like air was getting sucked out of my body slowly but sure i dont know is it anxiety attacks?
I wonder if they truly meant it.  I fought with mine a lot and told them I hate them, but that was just because I was emotional and couldn't think rationally.  I never hated them and wish I could apologize for it.  I hope you find the strength to make it through.  This is just a side thought, but if you're going to do anything in life, it should be because you made the decision yourself, not because somebody told you to
No parent should ever tell their child to go ahead and kill themself.  I'm so sorry they told you that :(  Any child, teenager, or adult who experiences this should see it as negligence and a threat.  Leave immediately and stay with someone else if possible.  Your parents are not healthy for your mental state and you deserve better than them.
All of this is really sad to read. I wouldn't wish suicidal feelings on anyone, especially as a parent to my own child. But I have to say the saddest part in all of it is seeing how readily and repeatedly the parent's behavior is excused by OP in the comments. I say this from a position of experience, as someone who is still reconciling the two truths of that my parents did/do genuinely love me AND are terrible, toxic, and abusive. I hope OP can come to validate their life, feelings, and experiences above the need to uphold the clearly unhealthy relationship w their parents.
this happened to me too. it's the worst thing that can happen to a person who is in desperate need for any kind of hope. I'm so sorry. they probably have their own issues and they don't know how to deal with a depressed person and sometimes it can be exhausting for the family, too. they say things that they don't actually mean.
That’s so sad and feel so sorry for you. Parents can really suck sometimes! My mom was about to kick me out Bc I didn’t want to go to college yet
You should thank that lady. She saved your life
Trash parenting
Just gotta say I was relieved to read that edit there.  That must have been horrible but I'm glad     you're still here.
Look, by the sounds of it this was an actual suicide attempt. If I'm not mistaking 40% or so of people that attempt suicide once will do it successfully soon after. You are at major risk now. Say what you want about your parents, staying there is not safe.
This is why parents should learn to control themselves not even parents everybody should get a work on self control cause it can cause in so much fatalities . As for you dont ever try suicide you worth and you are much more important for people around you maybe they didnt show you maybe they dont know how ,believe me you are loved ,its never worth taking your life
In the moment we can say a lot of things we don't mean. I'm happy it worked out for you.
I was in a very similar situation a few years ago, it took my alot to forgive them and they still to this day have never apologized. I told them that an apology is all I want to close the emotional trauma from that day and until then I won't forget it.
I would die of embarrassment or cringe if someone ever found out  One of my friends from elementary school found out because I was “acting strange” and I completely cut them off because I couldn’t show my face  I just didn’t reply anymore and I don’t know what happened to them.
Hey since you got a diagnosis even by a GP you can very easily fill out disability papers for ur college for accommodations so you like have longer time on tests which helps with anxiety you have opportunities to make up missed work if you had something depression or anxiety related happen etc. It is really important because depression and anxiety are disabling when it comes to school work. You could probably find ur college Disability services on your college webpage and email them for the papers. Please consider doing because it sounds like you’d totally benefit from it. You don’t need to suffer more than you already do use the resources. I didn’t realize how much I needed those accommodations till after I had them. Let me know if you need help with figuring it out.
Hey, as someone who has atempted suicide i can tell you that it is not worth it. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety and recently started taking pills for it.   As i was trying to kill myself, i realized that i didnt want to die and that i just wanted to not exist. They are two very different things, i was scared when i was doing it and im so happy that i didnt die. Life is one of the best things ever, and now that i know what the feeling of almost dying is, i know thats not what i want. What i wanted was to not exist but still be me, its a bit complicated but its true.  Remember, no matter how shitty life may be at the moment, it gets better, trust me.
Man FUCK your parents. They don't matter to you anymore, they told you to kill yourself. I'd advise getting out and just running away even if you have to live in the woods or some shit.
I don't know what to say.
Yes thinking about it now that I’m calm that woman really did something precious, not everyone would do it. I still feel like life isn’t something worth fighting, but at least I have some more time to get better and hopefully change my mind
Just reading this thread has me fucking breaking down. I certainly do have parents who love me so much to the point that I really think I’m lucky getting them in this lottery of life. It just breaks my heart that I might be so much more but in reality I amount to so little.
Now that I’m more calm I understand that they didn’t really meant what they said. They were just unable to cope with my rage. I don’t completely justify their phrase because it’s still the most horrible thing a parent could say, and it really hurt me deeply, but can now understand where that’s was coming from.
My mum has told me multiple times that she should've aborted me uwu
That’s what I usually do, I do it so much that when I was diagnosed severe depression they thought it was just bullshit. But today I had an exam and I really needed their help but they forgot, which made my anxiety even worse and suddenly I exploded, I’ haven’t been this angry for a while and I couldn’t control myself. They probably were not able to cope with my fury and just responded in a bad way, but not being lucid enough it hurt me deeply
Ikr lol. I DIDNT ASK TO BE BORN MUM.
In the heat of the moment I did not put that in the post, but now that I’m calm i can say that they are loving parents and they care deeply about me it was just something my father said without really thinking
I’m 20, anyway they are loving parents it was just a really difficult moment and they weren’t thinking what they were saying. It doesn’t hurt anymore they did not mean it, at all.
I’m going to get it as soon as I can, thanks for the recommendation
Truthfully my parents aren’t that bad, it was just me feeling really awful and terrified for an exam and their response made me even more angry. They are completely unable to cope with this situation and I’m to be blamed as much as them, but the things they say in these moments really are the worst stuff that could come out of their mouth. Also in such moments I’m as fragile as I can be so those words hit me deeply. I know they love me and are just trying to help but hell if it hurts
I’m sorry you had to go trough this kind of stuff, I think my situation isn’t that bad, I know they care about me they really do love me, they just made a mistake
I still need to find a way to cope with my anxiety, I just started going to therapy in order to achieve that, I hope it’ll get better in the future.
Thanks a lot, my situation really is not as bad as a lot of other people, and I can’t even imagine the strength they need to pull it trough.  I’ll just try day by day hoping sooner or later it will get better
Yes now that I’m calm I completely understand that they didn’t really mean it, it was just the heat of the moment, I know they love me, I’m sure about it, it’s just that they don’t know how to cope with my depression and anxiety.  But as soon as I can I’ll be back to my college city so I’ll be able to stay far from them at least a bit
I know my parents didn’t really mean it, and now that I’m calm I can understand that it was just the heat of the moment.  I’m sorry you had to go trough that kind of stuff, you really must be strong to be able to go trough all of that.  Thanks for your advice I don’t know if I will tell anyone about this, I don’t want other to worry about me but I get your point, so I’ll think about it
Thanks for sharing your story, right now I’m studying hard to reach my dream, which will, hopefully, make me happy, but I still have a long way and part of me thinks I will never be able to get there, so part of my struggle and even the fight I had this morning with my parents come from my insecurities. But I need to try harder and maybe just maybe someday I’ll really be happy. I’m really thankful for your comment, wish you the best
I wouldn’t really define my parents as abusive, but I get your point and i will surely give a look at the Reddit that you linked.  I’ve just started therapy, I’m still at the beginning but I hope it will help me get better. Thanks a lot for your advice
Thanks a lot for your advice I’ll definitely trying to pull it trough, I’m not sure if I’ll be able to but I’ll try harder to live as long as I can
Thanks for your advice, I’ll try harder to stay alive, I still don’t know if i really should, but for now I’ll keep on trying
They are really loving parents, they just don’t know how to cope with my anxiety or even worst with my depression. Except for that they are the best parents I could have wished for. They surely have their own flaws but everyone does. My father especially, during arguments doesn’t really thinks what he is saying and I should know by now, but sometimes when I’m feeling really down I just forget and let him hurt me, without it even be his own intention. I really think it was just the heat of the moment and he really felt guilty when he realized it.
Thanks a lot for sharing your experience. Hearing something like that as young as 12 years old must have been a nightmare, you really are incredible for pulling trough, really you must be an incredible person
I’m not in the position to say anything to anyone right now, but think deeply about it. I’m sorry, I don’t know the pain and difficulties that you are going through, the only advice I can give you is to search for help, talk to a therapist and maybe he will help you see your struggles from a different perspective.
Thanks a lot, luckily I have some really caring friends that help me whenever I ask them to, it’s just that I don’t want to be a burden for them. But thank again for your comment
I can’t even imagine something like that, I’m really sorry that you had to grow up in such an environment. I hope you will be able to leave soon and live a better life, you must be very strong. Wish you good luck and hope you will be able to be happy in spite of your mother
It was just the heat of the moment, normally they really are good parents
Honestly right now I don’t know how I feel, I’m not sad or angry, not even happy, but still a the end it all turn out for the best so someway I’ll get happy. Thanks a lot for your support
Luckily I’ll soon be able to go back to the city where I’m studying. I love my parents and they love me back but some time apart will surely benefit all of us
I think she probably has her own problem and stuff, but I’ll surely try to reach out to thank her
I’m 20, but I’m sure they didn’t really meant it
I will, thank you for your recommendation
That must be awful I can’t even imagine, I myself don’t have a good relationship with my brother but none of us would even think instigate each other to kill himself. I’m really sorry wish the best and hope you will be able to distance from your brother as soon as you can
I’m really sorry to hear that, hope you will get better, wish you all my best
I know the place she works at, so I’ll definitely go back and thank her for her help
They did not apologize, they never do, but when I came back I could clearly read in their face that they were scared as hell, my father was even getting dressed to come and search for me, so I’m pretty sure they didn’t mean it. Anyway I’m really sorry for your situation, wish you luck and hope it will get better for you
They definitely didn’t mean it, I’m sure from the look on their faces when I got back home,  it’s just that they are too proud to apologize, but it doesn’t really matter.  In the last months I’ve often been thinking about killing my self for a lot of other reasons. Once I got really close to it but then I couldn’t because I was too scared. Their words were just what pushed me forward to try again, this time being really serious about it
also gaslighting is a thing. Just because they're sorry now doesn't mean they won't do it again.
I think it was a straight sign not to do it, as she pulled you down. Life has its surprises on offer still. Don't lose hope for change.
Hey, I want you to know that it's okay if you're not changing the world, it's okay if you're not running a successful business, it's okay if you're not where you want to be at the moment. It's completely valid to want to have ambitions and to have goals and it's completely valid to be disheartened if you don't feel like you're achieving your full potential. It's completely valid.  It's okay to struggle, truly. Making it through the next day can be the hardest step, the biggest mountain, the largest ocean. It can take all your willpower to get up in the morning. It can take all your energy to get through another second. I want you to know that getting through the day means you are so incredibly strong. You are a fucking conquerer!!!!! I am proud of you for getting through each day, I am proud of you for every step you take. No matter how big or small that step is, it is a step nontheless. And each step means you are strong.   In my eyes, you amount to a hell of a lot, and that is down to you choosing to be strong each day, even if means crawling those long drown out seconds. You are strong. Thank you for being you, because your strength is inspirational.
You seem to be blaming yourself now to some degree to excuse what they said - don't fall into that trap.  They are not a victim.  If 'kill yourself' is even in their list of phrases they consider appropriate to their children even in a heated argument - I don't have words to describe them.  My parents were beyond effed up and never said that to me though I heard more than a few "I wish I never had you's" from Mom over the years - I wish she never did either so we were on the same page there and I never forgave her for saying it.  You have three choices - give as good as you're getting - keep arguing with them which will lead down a dark road and maybe back to the bridge which is a dead end.  - be prepared to have a calm conversation with them and ask them to sit down with you together so they can better understand what is happening with you. Beyond what they said they certainly do not appreciate where you are right now.  - get out of there - me personally if I was you and had the resources to leave this would be my choice or I would focus on being able to do so.  Independence is a wonderful anti depressant.  Its much easier to have friends, make friends and be with friends away from your parents.    You may be too young for this though in which case have that conversation and just keep communication open till things get better.  That woman who took you off the bridge had a purpose in life that day - to save you - so if for no other reason stick around for her.
fuck em    you don't need their acceptance, you just need their money and shelter, these kinda parents are evil, get a job and leave their home ASAP,  you are their child and they MUST NEVER TELL YOU  TO KYS, no matter what ! I repeat , no matter what !
I don’t know that it really matters a whole lot if they meant it. There’s really no way to know what they did or didn’t intend. The only thing you can really look at is their actions, and their actions implied that they didn’t care if they said something hurtful. It’s not on you to justify their poor actions. Your parents don’t sound like very nice people, and I think you deserve to be treated well. It’s no wonder you feel so bad all the time if this is how you are treated regularly. The two things are very much related.
6 years ago my father told me he wouldn't care if I hung myself (amongst other things, but that one hurt the most). It took me a long time to be able to forgive him, and I will probably never forget it, but I can confidently say that he didn't mean it. It doesn't excuse what he said and I will never completely justify it, but for me it was possible to move on from it despite that.  I don't know your parents and I can't say why they would tell you such a thing, but in my case I know my father was already deeply stressed and something I did in that moment made the pot boil over. He truly is a wonderful father, sometimes good and caring people do really hurtful shit. Just my two cents.
That’s not okay. You try to make yourself guilty when obviously any normal fucking human being won’t say such a horrible and disgusting thing to their own child. You have a very good hurt, man, and a very toxic parents. You shouldn’t try to blame yourself, whatever you did they didn’t have a right to say that
If that is truly the case, then I understand. If he apologizes or has apologized then I’m glad you’re able to work this out with them. That being said, I don’t know how old you are (this situation is very rough regardless), but without letting it be an unnecessary problem, it might be best to calmly contemplate finding a backup source of support in the event that they ever say anything so careless again.   I’m so very glad you held strong through that dark moment, and that random lady is glad too. I’m with you in this fight and can’t say I’ve made it to any light at the end of the tunnel, but I know it’s there and I see it from time to time, and you and me both gotta just do our best to be strong and find it in whatever ways that we can. Please reach out to me or anyone here if you want to talk.

Telling your kid to kill themselves is very high up on the 'im a bad parent' signs list.   They chose to have children. They chose to make a human being that comes with all sorts of emotions and personalities. They chose to take the role of a parent. In that moment you described they lost control of the situation and sunk the lowest they could. Instead of meeting you with calmness and patience to help you work through your emotions they chose to verbally and mentally abuse you.   You are not to blame. You needed their help. They forgot. You have mental illnesses that they should be aware of. They are your parents. Everything they say or do should be in a form of healthy communication or support. Losing your shit happens, but they have the ability to choose how to respond to that.   I'm so sorry for you.
No. Telling someone to kill themselves is completely fucked. Doesn’t matter what you did
Look it sometimes feel good and normal with those ppl, I know it literally. But dont let it fool you man, as much as you stay in denial the more fragile and emotional you become and all of sudden you will lose it. Maybe insanity. Time cannot heal you when you are in fire.
'Truthfully my parents aren't that bad' is what I told myself as a teen, not able to run anywhere and having to deal with some really bad stuff. Your brain is trying to adapt to situation in order to survive.  When I mentioned some of bad family events years later, people around were shocked. It was the time when I realized that it really was bad. Other people made me realize it.   Please please try to get a separate space, even if that is just a tiny room in dorms, and as the time passes by, you will start being better.
Can t imagine my mom telling me to kill myself and we barely talk. Each with thwir own but i don t think that s normal
Anxiety is truly a crippling disease, its worse that the people who are supposed to care let you down. On saying that, I'm not sure which part of the world you are from, the older people are uneducated and mental health is not a concept they grew up with. If you come from those parts, you don't expect emotional support from your parents (just use their money to pay for therapist/ medication would be as far as you can go). You'll set yourself up for disappointment.   Therapy would be were you'd expect the emotional support to come from, but don't despair you feel it doesn't help as many people had to change therapists to find one that helps them move forward. Have realistic expectations to how much you can accomplish with anxiety in the background. You may never get rid of it, but you can master it to an extent that you'll be able to enjoy life again.    I wish you nothing but the best OP.  Remember you deserve BETTER than what your parents said to you. You deserve BETTER than living a life in anxiety. You deserve ice cream and puppies and kittens.
You definitely really really should.
thank you
Shit my bad, still what they said was super uncool
Honey. If they told you to kill yourself that is not love. That is abuse and damaging. Im worried about you. I hope you are in a safe place.
Regardless.  That’s not something you say.  I would recommend forming a plan to move out if possible.
Heyy thx for your support! Well atleast there are people like you who don't fail to make my day better:)) have a good one too.
Since what we go through is similar,  we can talk about it if u like
Neat dude!
Thank you for writing this. This brought me so much comfort. You, are amazing.
Thanks for this. I didn't really think a random comment from a random person over the internet would give me the gooey  feels, but thank you.
Thanks for your advice, I still can’t blame them, I know they didn’t mean it. Anyway in 1 or 2 weeks I’ll leave home to go back to college so I just need to wait some more
This morning situation really fits in what you described, I just need more time to get over it, but knowing that they didn’t mean it will surely help me. I’m sorry that you had to go trough this kind of stuff but thanks for sharing you experience
Thanks, I’ll give it a go this evening
I steel don’t see my parents as the only on to blame but yes a place for myself far from my family sometimes really is helpful. Thankfully I’m a college student so when covid will be over I will go back to my university
I really think I’m in a safe place, it really was just a mistake, they didn’t mean it. They just couldn’t cope with my anxiety, and I can assure you that this morning I was completely unable to control myself, so they just responded instinctively
You are amazing.  You're a champion, you're still fighting. Your spirit is god damn unbreakable because having to deal with depression every day is having to push a stone up a smooth hill. I'm proud of you!!! I will always be proud of you <3
There is no need to thank me, all you need to do is thank yourself for getting this far. It's hard, it's so hard, and you're still here fighting in spite of that. I am very god damn proud of you!!!  Much love to you my friend ❤️
They may not have meant it in hindsight, but the fact they said it shows a lot about how they see you. Your preternatural calm at the edge also says a lot about your current state of living. I idolize dying, a state of non-being, but I never get very far because I think of the pain before the end, or my cat who would die of depression in my absence. Whether you would have actually jumped or not is irrelevant, the fact you *got that far* is enough of a statement of your current position.

All I seem to be able to feel is this overbearing sense of doom and then indifference.   I’m so tired.

I've tried, for the past 10 years I've heard people tell me things get better, but they don't.  I've been going to therapy for the past 3 years, and I still can't move forward. I have skills in web development, but nodody gives me a chance, and there's a 15 years blank in my resume so they're not even trying.  And for relationship, I've concluded that I'm a despicable ugly anomaly that's not worth it.  Today I've considered killing myself, but I'd fail that too, I went outside and screamed, and went back home to bed, where I've been for the past week...  Edit : I’ve called the 911 equivalent in my country because I was afraid of myself and now I’m in the hospital and a psychiatrist will see me in a couple hours.
i’m 40. i write music. it doesn’t make me any money. i haven’t had a job in nearly 2 years, due to a magical combination of BPD, autism and chronic fatigue syndrome. all jobs i have had were garbage jobs like barista, janitorial, or valet. i had a marriage for 9 years. it died. and i’m not going to kill myself, so you’re not allowed to either. work out how to make your day pass as pleasantly as you possibly can, and fuck other people’s standards. i cannot stress this strongly enough: FUCK EVERYONE ELSE’S STANDARDS. they mean absolutely nothing to you.
Hey you are not alone. I'm 25 I never had job too all I can say is don't suicide its not answer. We'll go through this together!!
I'm 30 and I haven't worked since I was 16. You're not alone.
There’s is no actual meaning for age except the meaning you give it and the meaning society gives it. Don’t ever let the thoughts of others consume and dictate how you live your life, care what others think and you’ll forever be their prisoner. You know web development, that’s an awesome and very respectful skill, you can be a freelancer on platforms like Fiverr, you’ll earn more and the best part is that you decide when you work and from ever you want that have internet access.  Love is something mutual, you can’t control all of it but put yourself out there so you could have the opportunity to get to know someone.
I always recommend recreational drugs.
Have you ever changed therapists? It could make a real difference to find somebody that you connect better with. I'm sorry that you are going through such a tough time. Just know that at least one internet stranger doesn't judge you.
If you have skills in web development, you're still relatively lucky. For one, you can fairly easily demonstrate your skills (and desire for the field) by making something yourself. Two, a lot of those skills is changing every few years, so there's not a insurmountable wall of experience to compete with. Three, there's still not enough people to do it, so the bar is not that high. and four, even a relatively poor position within the field is not that poor a position, generally speaking.
I'm not sure how much I can help with the emotional stuff - working on myself as it is.    I work in IT though. What web development skills do you have? The good thing about the tech industry is that a good amount of weight is placed on certs and practical skills.  You can get those online at your own pace, and they let employers know exactly what you're capable of.  The important thing is to have the skills validated, so the certs really are key to make you stand out.  Even if there's a gap in work experience, it shouldn't outweigh *updated* certifications too much.  In any case, I wish you much love and fulfillment in the future.
Aside from love, I'm 19 soon and I got my first job ever last week. It kind of just happend. I applied for a beginner position and was trained up like i was in school. I now do things independently like second nature. Try it.
True standard's of society try to paint like everything's perfect that were suppose to be model's with jet planes and mansion's . Reality money isn't going to always fix how people feel .It's nice to find another person who love's writing music
How the fuck do you pay for stuff
I have a good connection with my therapist and she’s helped me a lot for things, and I was okay last time I saw her.  Thank you for your moral support :)
I’ve learned React last year, and I have my portfolio online made with it. I’m scared of applying and being accepted and messing it up with my mental health issues and losing the job :/
being creative every day keeps me alive. i’m certain it does many other, as well.
I've been on disability since 2012. It's not a better or easier alternative to working that's for sure but my mental health is unpredictable so working isn't possible.
Losing a job is not really worse than not having it in the first place. Just take it as a bonus while you have it. Don't try to oversell yourself, and in time you'll find a place that's okay with you learning and won't kick you out if you don't deliver in the first month.   If they kick you out after half a year, you've already learned something and have some job experience. If they kick you out after two years, you should be knowledgeable enough to work part-time and/or random jobs, whatever suits your time and needs. (Sadly it's probably not a viable option as a junior.)

every day feels like another level of hell. I know I'm pessimistic but anyone in my situation would be unless they're some kind of superhero.  I just wish that I could know what it's like to be loved or even just liked by someone, anyone, even if it was just for a moment. I wish that I was charming and confident enough to strike up a convesation with  someone without feeling like every single word I say is wrong, laying in my bed at night analyzing every single facial expression people have made to me. was that smirk malicious? did they look bored? Of course they did, who wouldn't be bored listening to me? I have no idea how to stop despising myself, nitpicking every single word I utter and isolating myself in fear of being a burden. I can't bring myself to go to school anymore, I dropped out for three years and now that I'm finally back it feels as if everything is going in thee wrong direction. Why am I not getting better? I'm supposed to be getting better...People tell me I have my whole life infront of me and they mean it in a postive manner but it makes me panic, If I could choose I would be gone long ago. And I mean, I can choose. I can choose to leave this world and never come back, I want to so badly but I don't know if I dare to even though I am aware no one would miss me and that I could finall get some peace of mind. I don't know what is stopping me. Sorry, just needed to write this down somewhere  (edit, spelling)
Please don't kill yourself. Even if your life is bad, there is always something to live for. You can try therapy and even though it won't make your life perfect, I guarantee that it will help you
did you drop out of high school?

- You stop listening to music  - You’re about to text a friend but you wonder if it’s      even worth it anymore   - You don’t get hungry   - You become passively suicidal to the point where you exercise compulsively and ruin your body   - There’s a ringing in your ear like static  - Your grades drop  - You drive too fast  - You stop saying what you’re thinking   - You question the merits of therapy   - You get put on a higher dosage of medication and all it does is make you tired  - You can’t sleep without drinking to take the edge off
How are you doing? I can relate very much so, but let me ask if you experience memory loss aswell from depression.   Been depressed maybe 6 years and it's all been a blur lol. I can't seem to remember a damn thing, even a month ago. Guess we just block out or repress memories cause they're all shit to us.
jesus christ, you sound like me some months ago, sometimes i even wondered and dreamed about dying, having a heart attack, dying peacefully, about my funeral while i was resting in peace...but i specially feel the 2nd, the 8th and 9th one. stopped taking meds because they made me feel numb/apathetic and tired asf. and stopped texting/keeping up with friends because they just made me feel so ignored and lonely at times,stopped telling everyone what i thought because i thought it was absolutelly pointless and made no difference.
Ya I’m very avoidant now. I lock myself in my room
All too real right now for me as well.  You feel every muscle in your body but numb yo every thing else. Can't sleep but always tired. Want to drink but no energy. Zero focus
Is it weird that I relate to a bunch of these
I have trouble remembering small things and where I put them, I’ll lose my keys for no reason or my wallet will just vanish.   I don’t have a lot of childhood memories because of the meds I was on.
Same I just curl into a ball on my bed and listen to Keaton Henson
Ditto almond, I locked my keys in my car 4 times in one month. $150 each time to call a locksmith. I couldn't go to work today, went to the hospital instead. Explaining your story over and over gets so tiring. I just need to get on with it and stop guessing myself.
I love Keaton Henson. ❤️  But I only listen to him when I'm very sad. I know it isn't going to magically change everything, but maybe change the soundtrack and it can help change the movie? Ya know? 🙂
I’ve been watching this YouTube channel called criminal psychology - pretty interesting
I’ve told my story so many times it doesn’t even feel like mine anymore
Jim Can’t Swim - Criminal Psychology (AKA JCS - CP) is the full name of the channel
This is a profound statement.

Everytime im thinking about not killing myself at all, but in my funeral, I just imagine myself already dead. I imagine my friends, my family, close people, not so close people and thinking about how I could have died. I imagine myself hanging from a bridge or dramaric things like that. I dont focus on me dead, I focus on their reaction of me being dead and just by thinking that I know that I can’t die, that I have to keep posture and trying my best always. I have never wanted to kill myself but I have thoughts about me already being dead, it’s hard to explain. I just imagine a movie about my life and the end of the movie is about my funeral or stuff like that. (Sorry for my bad English)
I would keep my mind busy to keep off these thoughts if i were you. I hope it gets better for you.

Like maybe I'm just an animated body pretending. I feel like everyone around me has some intangible essence of being that makes them real, and I'm just hollow. A part of me knows that seems too crazy to be true but more and more I'm starting to genuinely believe it and it's scary. Has anyone had similar thoughts?
Do you have an unfortunate habit of reacting to pain, difficulty or dark thoughts by shutting down all emotions? This was the root to my "puppet" feelings during suicidal depression.

I'm 22. I feel like I'm failing in life. I see al my friends succeeding in their lifes while I'm stuck in the same place, that gives me a lot of anxiety. My best friendl from high school has not even graduated from software engineering and he already got a job at an IT company and he'smoving with his girlfriend. While I graduated one year ago as a commercial pilot and the only job I managed to get was a call center where I'm constantly being yelled at. It is so frustrating I feel like I failed my parents who spent thousands of dollara in my career. I feel worthless and with no hope. Everytime I see one of my friends being successful It gives me a lot of anxiety and fear. And everyday I feel like I am losing my life.  Help
Don't compare they might be going through some shit they ain't gon tell you like bullying at work. Your parents will always be proud they know how much you try.
Life is not a race to the finish line. Plenty of student loans don't end up being used just ask millennials. You will be okay, just focus on you and what makes you happy, not what friends select to show you on social media. Have fun you have your youth and an education. Try to stay positive. I hope your night gets better

My older brothers fiancé who hates me decided to plan their engagement party last minute on the same day as mine which I sent invites out for weeks ago.  I got told today by my dad that he and none of my family will be coming to my engagement party because of how rude I am booking it for the same day - when I planned mine first - and that he will not be involved in my wedding at all. Will not walk me down the aisle. And that none of my other family members will attend.  I can’t stop crying. I just want to end it all right now.
Screw him and THEM for blindly following his word. He's intentionally acting oblivious so he can gaslight you. That's not fair and you deserve a more positive and stable support system. Wishing you much love
Exactly my thoughts for the OP. Don't give a fuck to those who do this to you. You are better off without toxic people even if they are your parents.  Best wishes to the OP for your engagement.
Funny its usually the family members that cause such mental damage. Fuck. This world is tricky

The planet is dying, the rich get richer, micro plastics are in everything, can’t go out. Life is ass and I’ve been told my 20s would be great but it’s stolen from mr now, along with everyone else. The system we live in is terrible an ensures no one from this generation will ever own a portion of this nations wealth. Everything is terrible and there is no reason to continue on. What’s the point of living here if it’s just a constant feed of bullshit.
Would your ideal world involve anything specific to change this? Nationalist resurgence, wealth redistribution, anything that you think would work against this?  And if this world came about, would you feel instantly better about yourself, your life, and your place in the world?  Not being judgemental or trying to attack in any way, just seeing if your views on the world are a symptom, or a root cause, to the pain you're feeling right now, bud.
it really feels like we as a race messed up this playthrough of life... so to speak
Capitalism has gotten out of control to the point where coups are being staged for resources. I wouldn’t feel instantly enter but knowing the world and those who currently suffer would be better would be comforting
I ask because I've spoken to hundreds of people on this board who mention plastic in the ocean, fascism, communism, hating their gender, genital size, height, race, etc... in their posts, and the vast majority of them are displacing something like self-hatred or past trauma onto external factors.  Again no attempt at railing or ragging on you, especially considering I was wishing for nuclear war during my suicidal days, and also getting into extremist politics (just me, not you).  If you think the state of the world is at the heart of your depression/anxiety, would you be up to doing what you can locally to help cause a sea change worldwide?  But if it's incidental, have you had luck finding the origin point to the depression/anxiety in brain chemistry, identity issues, parental divorce, anemia, suppressed shame or another root like that?

So I just finished school and did great academically (like top 50 student in my state). I know this just sounds like im flexing, especially on a sub like this, but no one in my life recognises just how fucking hard and impressive it was to do that well while being depressed. Homework, studying, getting out of bed, daily things that most student do by default, were extremely difficult and depressing for me, and I just want the effort to be recognised :)

Thats awesome, congratulations, I know just beginning somethings can be a feat of it's own, but managing to see it through and succeed is amazing. You deserve every bit of praise you get.
congrats! that's actually really amazing to hear. you deserved it for working so hard.
Being top 50 in the state is amazing if you aren't depressed. Being able to do it while depressed is, well, I just don't have words for how awesome that is. I am so proud of you!
That's amazing! Congratulations, I know how hard it can be to get out of bed sometimes, and I'm really proud of you. :) This definitely deserves a reward of something, maybe a break or going to your favorite place to eat or something. Have a good morning or afternoon or evening or night, too!
Hehe, im taking the whole year off as a reward ; )

23 year old living with ulcerative colitis - which has exasperated my depression to a point of suicidal thinking. I’ve withdrawn from friends , work , everything. I feel completely lost . Looking to hear reassuring advice that it’s always possible to start over .   Let’s just say that at the moment I’m a blank slate - I have no hobbies / interests and no proper career path yet . I’m at my rock bottom , lucky enough I haven’t had an easy means to commit something as drastic as suicide which has given me time to reflect and think about giving life another go before doing anything permanent.  Thanks for listening
I hear of people turning their lives around in their 60s so you probably still have time.
I'm listening sorry to hear. I'm 24 still haven't started yet. Keep hope please.
It takes a lot of will power and time for one to turn their life around, but it is possible even into ones late 70's or 80's. Commitment is the foundation to every success story.
Relevant [pic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItIsntTooLate/comments/kxzqn9/a_scale_of_perception_vs_reality_of_whether_its/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)  Thinking rationally (turning off my depressed brain for a sec) I think it's possible to turn your life around at any age. That being said I feel like it gets more difficult the older you get though not impossible. Imo at your age you still have plenty of time to accomplish things. For me personally, the closer you get to 30 is when it all starts going to shit, not because it necessarily makes things super hard or anything but... In my case I kinda feel like I have this imaginary deadline looming over me... If that makes sense? Like I can feel the clock is ticking away and it just makes things feel a bit more hopeless, and stressful imo.
I'm so sotry to hear you feel like this. But it is never ever too late to turn your life around if you are willing too. But even more especially at 23...you are still very very young and have tons of time. People of any age at all can turn their life around, so you can definitely do it too :)
I say yes.  For about the last year and a half I've been working on seriously giving my life to Christ and also looking at career options.  Neither are a flip the switch and it's fixed type of deal, but with them you can see some improvement in life even if not immediate
What keeps you going if you don’t mind me asking ? For me a big part of the reason I struggle is focusing on limitations / things I can’t do due to physical health . It’s strange , part of me would love to have another shot at life in another body if that makes sense. But at the same time the fact that I feel that makes feel a bit of hope that I can find reasons to want to live
I just hope one day I can start life. If only there was a way not to feel that to push through that for you.

I’m fucking miserable all of the time. I’m simply playing different parts that other people want me to play. Loving daughter, funny friend, good student. I don’t care about any of it.   I feel like a robot or an alien or something. It’s like I have some vague idea of what a human in supposed to do and behave like, but I feel empty inside.   I’m not interested in new hobbies or changing degrees or doing something valuable with my life. I’m basically just existing. Nothing I’ve done has worked to help me recover from my mental illness, and I’ve begun to accept the reality that I’ll live this way forever.   I’m tired of living my life for other people. I wish they’d all just leave me alone and let me wither away in peace.
Are you just venting or do you wish things could be different?  If the latter, i have a couple of suggestions that you may not have tried.  One is international, and the other is US only.
I feel you. It's like you're dispassionately moving forward along the rails someone else has set for you. Like you have no personality or character beyond what you've robbed from those around you and begun to imitate. The energy required to broaden your horizons and find something to be motivated towards just isn't there. It is an endless, apathetic slog towards the grave, a lifetime of never truly connecting. All there is to do is wish desperately for a spark of passion and to seize upon it in the hopes that something will change. It is exhausting. Maybe there is something of worth to be found in the march, but it is hard.
If you're fed up about playing a part, consider telling people around you that it feels like a part for you. Sometimes people care but just don't realise. Don't go down in silence is what I'm saying. Liberating yourself from these roles could be a step to something better, or at least more bearable, with a little more *meaning*.
[removed]
Whats the US only 1
I wish things could be different but I don’t know how to do it. I’ve tried everything I can. I’m not US.
I appreciate your honesty. I think we understand eachother. Sucks there’s no hope though
I don’t even know what that would look like or how to do that.   Giving up on these roles would mean sleeping 20 hours a day in my room. Unless it’s to keep other people happy, I have no reason to do even the smallest of activities
Nami.org.  they have support groups and informational meetings on how to navigate the system to get the best care, and family support groups also to help your family learn how to support your treatment  better.  The other one is clubhouse international.  They have day programs to socialize with people and learn employable skills.  Clubhouse-intl.org
See if you can find a Clubhouse near you.  clubhouse-intl.org  They have programs to give you social contacts and employable skills, and it's like a family-away-from-family.
Don't think about it and take small steps. Things will change even if you don't know how to do it, you just need to take small decisions to get the ball rolling. It doesn't matter if you don't know where it goes, as long as it changes *something*. Even starting to sleep 20 hours is already something, because after that you won't go exactly to the same "everyday" as before. Don't think about the after, it will come even if you don't know how. But you need to *show* there is something wrong if you want to progress. Break a vase, shout on someone, be honest, stop being nice, if you don't see any meaning in these social interactions, just abandon them, noone is forcing you to do this. You are currently staying in them because it's your comfort zone and you're just afraid of the unknown. But it's only after you break the monotony that you can expect something *real* to happen. Come on, I know you can do it.

I understand how you feel. It sucks feeling this way. If you are kind to others then you're worth something. You're precious. What would you say to someone who said what u just said? Be kind to yourself.. you are home to a life. It will be okay.. "you are what you love not who loves you" (some good lyrics from Fall Out Boy)
if no one cares about you  just remember that you care about yourself  and remember   my life my rules   and just do whatever you like like singing ,dancing /studying memes etc or create youtube videos

I’ve had a pretty traumatic two years, and am currently in a stage of life where I’m focusing 100% on being healthy again (I’ve experienced worse depression and anxiety now than ever). I’m not working nor going to school—literally just focusing on resting and healing.  Problem is that I am terribly impatient with myself, and constantly telling myself that I just need to “get over it,” that I should be healed already, that I’m lazy because I’m not working, that I need to just eat and hydrate and I’ll feel better (by this I mean I barley have an appetite and truly struggle with preparing and eating meals), that I’m the worst because I’m not doing anything that I deem “productive,” that I’m wasting my time because I literally stopped my entire life so I can heal, etc.  Does anyone have advice on how to treat myself well emotionally during this time? I’d be in total mama-bear mode if I were helping someone else in my situation, but because it’s me, I feel like I’m throwing all of my patience and gentleness out the window.
I don't have a total answer, but I usually don't listen to the words that come to mind first. I write those off because they're usually the negative thoughts. I make a conscious effort to talk myself into more understanding and loving thoughts.  Move yourself towards those loving thoughts and then take the first step towards something positive. One purposeful step at a time until you can look back on your day and be happy with what you've accomplished. This works for me and I don't know your personal situation, but gosh darnit you deserve to be genuinely happy. I hope this day goes well for you and creates a habit of happiness for you.

I didn't even say goodbye to my friends. Just paid off the last lone and looked at all that I'd built and DELETED IT.  The thing is, I do it in real life too.  The moment I have any success or if things are going well, I destroy it.  I push people away as hard as I can, because I want to see if they really care.  And if they leave it just varifies my own self hatred. But I did it. I would never want a friend as mean and negative as I am.  But things getting better feels terrifying.  I have no basis for comparison.  So I sabotage to get back to what feels comfortable. I just want it to stop.

Being this dead inside makes me not care how I treat people.
I feel you, I ended up going the opposite and faking my moods in order to try being help and joy to family and friends only to make matters worse, have you told your family the reason why???
I am the same
For real.  I never saw myself as disrespectful to my parents, but I'm realizing that I am.  I'm so fucking lazy that I forget or don't contribute to chores, I just stay in my room all the time.  My rent payment has always been spotty but now it's non-existent, and I feel like a squatter.   When my Dad gets home from work and sees me making food, I'm sure he just wants to talk to his son and we can share our days, or have a laugh.  But I can't even look him in the eye most of the time.  I'm too tired to talk about my day, or to ask about his.  In the moment, I truly don't care.  He must be so disappointed.
same bro. i hate talking to my family about mental health because they never take me seriously.
I haven't told my family sadly. I'm way too scared that I will get treated differently. The idea of telling them just won't ever happen. The loneliness is so real. I sit in my bed doing classes all day and then play videogames and whenever my family talks to me I get weird and try to avoid talking to them as much as possible. I feel like I've dug myself into such a deep hole with my personality that I can't really be jolly and fun around them or it will be too much of a change. Lol sorry for writing this much. Honestly out of all the kids my parents had to get it HAD to be me. Why couldn't someone kinder and smarter have been their child instead of me who is wasting it. Thanks for replying tho.
You don’t need to thank me :D listen, I have been exactly where you are now, and I still sometimes have my moments.. it’s breaking that cycle you are correct, everyone does it in there own way. I find my way was to throw myself into my job and create a routine that I stick too perfectly. See that may not work for you but I had to go through so many different ideas, plans and options to find the right ways of ‘breaking that spell’ good luck and I am always here to chat if need be, just bare with me if I take a little longer to reply sometimes.
I'll try being more organised and see if that helps me. I appreciate your feedback :)

Lately I’ve been on Facebook looking at the people I graduated with. And they seem to have their whole life together. They’re all married, have kids, and a nice paying job. As somebody who works in retail, it can be pretty tough sometimes. How do you guys cope with the comparison game? Would love to learn how to get through this hurdle.
Everything on social media is curated to portray the absolute best and hide the worst. It's the equivalent of wearing long sleeves to hide scars. Just because you don't see the dirt of life underneath doesn't mean it's not there.   Keep in mind we always have a complete understanding of our own lives, and we tend to amplify bad experiences and hard moments, so when you look back you see only the bad and very little of the good moments. What happens on social media is that people photograph those good moments, put them online and artificially edit out all the other stuff.   You don't see the arguments, the sleepless hours, the constant shit covered diaper changes. Just the happy baby, the one who spent the previous 5 hours screaming it's Lungs out.   Stop looking at social media, it's a lie.   And life isn't a competition there's no winning in life, there's just being and living.
I understand the feeling, everyone else has goals and accomplishments, they have friends and careers.  I'm just some minimum wage waste of life, nobody knows or cares about me.
My ex peers from college are workin in high tech industry or in government jobs. I am unemployed, it sucks.  Regards to what you see on social media, let me tell you that at least 5 couples from my college that got married in the past 4 years got divorced. I remember one couple in particular who used to travel at least 3 times a year and post everything they would do and eat together. After 2 years of marriage,they divorced. They looked like the "perfect couple" on fb and I was really jealous of them but in the end they divorced. So not everything you see on social media will remain the same in the future

I don't know how to describe what I'm feeling. When I want to let it out it's like it stops at my throat but won't go any further. I'm so exhausted, confused, lost, nostalgic, extremely EXTREMELY nostalgic, empty and lonely. And it all amounts to a pain I feel in my throat, numbness in my body, pressure behind my eyes.   I wish there wasn't a lockdown and I didn't cut all my 'friends' off. I wish I kept them around just for the sake of never being alone, like I always pushed myself to do. I really want a hug, I want to be around them. I need a hug.
Sending the biggest hug ever
I’m sorry you feel this way. Sending you a big HUG! 😊
thank you so much, I appreciate it ❤️
really appreciate you ❤️
Much love my friend. 🤗💚

It won't matter what you do, everyone will feel guilty, and everyone will feel pain. Giving up isn't a cure, it's a pain multiplier that will echo through countless social chains. There's no pretty way out sadly.   There's always a way forward, and everyone can find their path.

My girlfriend broke up with me 2 years ago.  She's been over me for a long time already. Moved to another city and found a new boyfriend plus lots of friends after only a few weeks. I feel so worthless, I've been trying to have a social life for years and even after fucking me up completely, she deserves it all while I don't. Obviously.  I remember her telling me I should be happy she was together with me because no other female would want to be with me. After 2 years now, it feels like she's been telling me the truth lol.  I just hate how unfair this shitty world is. You could focus all your efforts on certain things and yet everyone does it better than you without giving a shit. I wish I could finally escape this hell.  Cya.
In a pretty similar boat. He got everything he wanted, to be happy with someone else, and I’m laying here like trash. I don’t even get out of bed.
It's the worst feeling. Additionally, she cheated the last 4 months of our relationship and STILL is the one happy with another guy. This kind of shit sometimes makes you question why even have morals anymore.
Exactly. I put in 110% effort, he screwed me over multiple times. And still he’s the one that gets to go and be happy and throw me out like nothing. Why even bother. Like I said, I don’t even get out of bed anymore. Idk wtf I would be getting up for

I'm exhausted. I feel defeated. I am depressed. I am without purpose. I am lonely without a friend. I am almost dead inside.   Where is that fire I once had? That ambition to soar above the clouds and the drive to keep going? I'm so very lost.   I'm too tired to do much or to push myself. My medicine, I fear, is making me feel worse. I'm trying to get through each day with 5000 lbs on my back. I crave a connection. I crave a friend. I crave someone who sees me for me and wants to help and doesn't punish me by starving me of affection and love. I crave someone that won't burn me with the past and verbally create more wounds.  My life is slowly dissolving into nothing. How do I stop this? How do I care again? How do I strike a match and feel the flame again?   Hopeless
You need to find the beauty within yourself. Everyone has unique unrealised potential waiting to be found - all your feelings and thoughts have beauty. Try to express yourself the best you can.

I am too depressed to deep dive about why this is so awful since there is alot of reasons.. But yeah, I hate talking to people. I want to avoid people as much as I can, I don't exactly hate people, I just don't enjoy conversation. The worst part is, talking to people is the only thing I am good at.   Why is my brain like this? Just to haunt me among all my other issues?  My brain is so fucked

I am 21, I live at home w my parents. I have no job, I am not in school, I have few friends and even fewer hobbies I enjoy. I do not hate my life, I hate myself. If I weren't a coward, I would not be anything anymore. I have been struggling for years, perhaps even 10 years at this point. All the therapists and counselor's I've met with over the years have told me I may be "too self aware for my own good." I've taken this to mean that, because I'm so aware of the destructive and incomprehensible things that I do so often, and yet I am also aware of how, stupidly, I often repeat these same patterns, it has a very large negative impact on my self confidence. Over time, I've grown to truly believe in the fact that things will never change for me; I will never change. Recently, I'm being told more and more to "stop feeling sorry for myself" and "stop wallowing in my own self pity." And they are right, I do it all the time because it is easy and change is hard, and I am a coward. Hell, I'm literally doing it right now by writing this post. I get very scarce bursts of motivation, wanting suddenly to make changes and turn things around. They feel real in the moment, but I convince myself that these things won't happen, as I have tried for years and failed for years.  TL;DR: I am basically living destructive cycle of laziness, self-awareness, insecurity, and self-pity.
Hey. I’ve been there and lived this life. Waking up and being like today is the day I’ll change for the better. I’ll get a few tasks done but then by the afternoon I’m burnt out and say tomorrow...tomorrow is when I’ll change. Day after day I’ll say tomorrow will be the day. But yet I’m still lazy, slowly gaining weight and losing all the motivation I have. I have no friends either. Don’t really know how to make them. But hey I got my dog lol I still fall into this cycle. But usually an able to pull myself up after a week or so for a month or two before I fall back. It’s a constant struggle. Change is hard and you need a strong motivfactor to change. But it is possible. I personally want my own place away from my family so I could truly be alone without people bugging me. So that’s what gets me through work and the day. Knowing that I’m working towards a goal I truly want.

For the past couple weeks, I've been having trouble sleeping. Because every night it's another fucking nightmare of my suicide in beautiful scenery. Jumping off the golden gate Bridge while watching the sunrise. Hanging myself in a room with a view of the ocean. Slitting my jugular or femoral artery as I lay in my own blood watching a beautiful sunset unfold. Always the same concept, I prepare myself for suicide and do it while watching a beautiful scene. I feel at peace as I slowly die... then I fucking wake up to my shitty reality. Even sleep isn't safe from the cancer that is depression. How are you able to sleep? Nothing seems to be working, and I miss being able to sleep by myself. It's embarrassing, but I've been asking my partner to sleep over because I feel too scared to be by myself.
After I stopped Paxil, il be honest the dreams were torture.... multiple all fucked up ones 8-10 times a night all mostly Lucid, the really bad ones consist of me becoming somewhat aware and screaming to wake up... from the torture, this usually happens a few times until I fully wake up... so yeah trust me I get fucked dreams.... but none of mine involve suicide its mostly like a psychological thriller lol
I'm on paroxetine! And my nightmares feel crazy real. The pain, sensation, the sounds, and my eyes all register it as real. It's freaky waking up in my own bed sometimes.
Haha yep and if you stop them it becomes worse!

I was trying to study and I got stuck on ONE problem, and I snapped. She just wanted to show me her sweater and I told her to fuck off.  I don’t see my dad for 90% of the day, and when I do it’s just an always nod or fake smile. I sit in my room, worrying about the future, studying with no results, jacking off and eating.  Where did I go wrong? Like I actually don’t know what is the cause? It’s not quarantine. quarantine only mad wit more evident and made me pay attention to it more.  Where is the sweet loving son who helped everybody? He stopped helping people because he either made it worse or got nothing in return ever.  My throat hurts writing this. I get pissed off at the slightest things, even my parents talking too loud makes me burn with rage.
Yea just classic depression right there. When I'm really low ill be kinda the same way. But my mom is crazy and if I said something like that to her she would punch me in the face multiple times and scream at me to leave her house. So I always just bite my lip. But yea man I know the feeling. This disease fucking sucks.

I made the therapy appointment I had been putting off today. I know I neeed to go but I also know it’s going to be very uncomfortable.
Yes Itll be awkward and uncomfortable, but once it is over you will feel a little sigh of relief. It is one hour, and they will mainly be trying to get to know you and your situation right now. Take some deep breaths and try to be as honest as you can. They need to understand you to help, and it’s ok if you dont have all the words to describe how you feel. Good luck :)
It will go well for you!
Thank you. I’m having a very productive spell, so if I can get this appointment over and attended it’ll be a big step in the right direction.

Or rather, I want someone to love me. Is it selfish to ask for that? I just feel so alone, year after year I get more lonely. It's what fuels my depression I think, at least to some extent. I keep having dreams that hurt me but feel so great when I have them - having someone who loves me, hugs me, makes me feel loved. It's actually quite sad because I used to live for my dreams and I think I'm starting to do it again. Everything else sucks, so I flee into my dreams.   I don't know what I'm trying to say, just venting I guess. I'm probably what you might call "touch starved". I just crave contact but not from anyone, that just feels wrong. Maybe I'm just weird. Or maybe just really lonely. I'm trying to convince myself year after year that I'm okay with beeing alone forever even if deep down I know I'm not. I'm not attractive, I'm not a very nice person and I don't have any achievements on my hand - that's probably why I'm alone. I just wish it was different but I also don't want to burden anyone with my health and mental problems.  Yeah that's it. Life sucks.
Being alone with your depressed mind is the worst. It makes me spiral even worse. I’m sorry you are dealing with that. I can’t give you an actual hug but I can virtually.   You don’t have to be a certain way to deserve love. We all deserve it.
I totally get you on this one, throughout this virus/pandemic/plague bullshit I haven’t had many hugs, closest thing I got was the Snoo hugs in the chats but then again I don’t get much of them anymore, so lately I’ve been craving a hug from SOMEONE who cares.
Thank you :) I know I probably shouldn't think that way but It's just what I see. Everyone around me who has a relationship is either successful at what they do or really attractive/beautiful. I'm happy for them but it sucks having nobody that close to me. I don't even know what it feels like to be loved and I'm in my mid-twentys...
Totally feel you with that. Haven't had many hugs  anyway so I might as well hug everyone I can, when I can again
It’s easy to compare and bias yourself. Instead Focus your energy on yourself. I think there was some post about how if youre not handsome be tidy. So do that or it sounds appealing
Yeah I'm gonna try that I guess. Thanks for giving advice tho :)

Have any of you had a moment where you suddenly just fully understand that no matter what you do you will eventually die and not exist anymore. Like i woke up in the middle of the night about a year ago and it just hit me that everyone i know and love is going to die and everything will come to an end. all the memories i’ve made everything will just be gone when the lights go out. every since i fully realized this i’m so hyper-aware of the situation i’m in and constantly thinking in my head. i feel like i’m living from like a 3rd person point of view now. anyone else ?   I reposted this from really late last night so maybe more people know what i’m talking about
The realization hits me every now and then, I try to push it aside so I dont dwell on it.
thanks for the comment, for me it sits in the back of my mind and whenever i’m at a point where i have nothing to worry about i just sit and think wow i’m going to die one day and just be in eternal darkness forever. I really hope there’s something on the other side
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0m6x9/this_might_be_a_weird_question_but_what_are_the/
people who are taking medication and treatment for the depression, like when did you realize you should see the doctor now? I know suicidal thoughts could be the one but what are other signs
Well, for me it was when I realized I was completely mentally numb. I drove myself to the hospital. Surprisingly, not when the suicidal thoughts came.
I don't know what the hell I'm going through but I fight with my dad every day, I get angry, sad over small things, I don't go outside, I hate people, I hate myself I think I become another person. Every day I don't feel like doing anything, I can't even sleep, it affected my health. I feel like I have no ambition left to survive anymore.
These are the clinical signs/symptoms of depression:  "The DSM-5 outlines the following criterion to make a diagnosis of depression. The individual must be experiencing five or more symptoms during the same 2-week period and at least one of the symptoms should be either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.  1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day. 2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day. 3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. 4. A slowing down of thought and a reduction of physical movement (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down). 5. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. 6. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day. 7. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day. 8. Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.  To receive a diagnosis of depression, these symptoms must cause the individual clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The symptoms must also not be a result of substance abuse or another medical condition."  [This](https://www.mdcalc.com/phq-9-patient-health-questionnaire-9) is a PHQ-9 survey, used for gauging severity of depressive symptoms. 5+ might warrant a visit to a provider, 10+ I'd definitely consider it.

I'm a quitter. Always have been.  I've tried tons of hobbies in my life, from playing the piano, guitar, ukulele, harmonica to learning how to crochet, how to paint, scrapbook, draw, play chess, make clothes, sing, play tennis, do various martial arts, debate, make various crafts, do calligraphy, cook, bake, journal, write poetry, the list goes on. And I'm finally accepting that have never been good at anything.  Everything I've done has been a waste of time, because I could never stick with anything for longer than a year, maybe two at most. The only proper hobby I still have is playing the guitar, and I'm starting to give up on that as well. The spark is gone, if it ever was there at all.   I hate this life.
I don't think it's that you've never been good at anything, it's just the dropoff that happens to quick. Do you have any good leads on why it's hard to stick to things long enough to get good at them, bud?
Hey Mate  I think I can relate a bit. I think it is especially critical in our Social Media driven times, where you always get that picture of a world where only super dedicated people live that already mastered multiple things by the Age of 20.   Where you see bullshit "motivational Quotes" that make you feel even worse on top of it.   What most people miss, is the fact, that "Motivating Yourself" is only partly in your own control. Your "Brain Juice" has to do the work, and if somethings fucked of, there is no fuel, and without fuel, the engine doesn't work. You can press the paddle as long as you want.  It's the same thing as telling a depressed person to "be happy".   So, don't go hard on yourself by telling yourself that you haven't achieved anything that super hard sweating Achievers see as "a worthy achievement".   You already accumulated vast knowledge about a lot of things by being "a jack of all trades", which in itself is allready a big achievment.
Lack of motivation, drive, passion. Its not that I don't want to stick to things, I just lack the will power to do it because everything feels pointless and boring as shit.
I see, it sounds like the symptom of something deeper like chronic apathy, hatred of self, something like that. Truly hope you can find where this is sourced and coming from so you can target it directly and best, bud.

I'm 16 years old, i've been suicidal since i was 12 years old. depression has been hitting the hardest it ever has since august of 2020. i feel like a failure, im about to drop out of highschool. mostly because i just don't have a reason to believe i have a chance at a nice future anyway. i have really bad impulse control and i'm losing all of my 5 friends very rapidly, because im too much to handle. i got upset because they all hung out without me and i know it wasn't on purpose but it felt like it was. first world problems i guess. i really just want to die, i put a belt up in my closet last night but decided to just leave it there for now. i just wish people didn't hate me so much, and that they could understand how horribly im hurting for some background about me: my name is bradyn, im 16, a junior in highschool but was held back so i repeated freshman year im a musician, ive been playing guitar for 2+ years and drums for 7+, im also apparently a great singer according to a lot of people but i dont see it i've always wanted to tour the world in a band just putting my soul into the music, both my dad and aunt were musicians so i was kind of born into it. only thing that sucks is im the only new generation in the family that is passionate about it. im also kind of a video game geek, i think it's kinda cool that i have an original sonic 2 sega genesis cartridge even though i think they're common i don't know why im doing this.
also i like cars a lot and always have, i wish i could race them but i cant
Please don’t drop out of high school. I was close to dropping out and that diploma will help you, even when you don’t see the point. I think it’s cool that you’re a musician. That seems original to me. Have you tried getting help? Like even talking to your dad about what’s going on in your head? It may feel pointless but therapy and talking about what’s going on helps you dilute and solve the problem. I’ve been in really hard therapy for 2 years and it’s helped me a lot.
You need to find your unique creative energies and turn your destructive energies into something beautiful. You're only young, you still have lots of time to find your potential.
I have a therapist but she doesn't really help, just listens. i find it really hard to talk to my dad about what's going on in my head, he understands it even less than i do. he just doesn't get it, like at all. he doesn't understand why im the way i am
well i like writing songs but they're mostly just depressing because that's just how i really feel, i wish i had more variety in what i wrote but i can't fake happiness or anything of the sort
Maybe you could see if you could get a new therapist? And maybe even talk to your doctor? I got diagnosed with depression at 12 and my parents refused treatment or medication. When I was a teen, I just told them I needed to have a physical and then brought it up to my doctor. Maybe even ask your school counselor if they have any resources. The school counselors are able to help with that stuff too
Explore your feelings. You might find some new inspiration.
I told my dad i wanted a new therapist and new meds a few days ago, i was on prozac before and it wasn't really helping
How’s your relationship with your mom? Would she be able to help?
she was abusive when i was little, i finally made the decision to stop living with her in october 2019 because at the time my nana (her mom/my grandma) was living with us and my mom kicked her out of our house in the middle of the night. watching my nana walking down the cold sidewalk made me lose my shit and i yelled at my mom and called my dad so that he could pick me up.
in other words, no she wouldn't
I’m sorry to hear that. I had to live with my dad in high school too. My mom’s boyfriend at the time was hitting us among other things. I would talk to your dad again. Kinda push the urgency of the situation. Like this isn’t working for me, it gets worse and worse every day, I really need help or I’m not going to make it
I would but his response is to immediately put me in the hospital which is definitely not what i want
I know the hospital seems scary. But, it honestly may be the best for you. I mean you’d get a new therapist and a psychiatrist and new meds. You wouldn’t be there forever and you’d learn some coping skills and stuff in the group therapy they provide while in treatment
i'm much more comfortable figuring things out from home though, plus hospitals are always cold lol

I've been suffering from depression, anxiety and borderline disorder for years, I've always wanted to be an artist, but never thought my work was good enough, never been happy with it, I think I stopped drawing for like 5 years because of it, plus all the shit I've been through, stalked, treatened, I never really been in a good place. Always thought that the only things that made me happy, watching a cartoon and thinking about a moment for weeks or playing a game and being proud of defeating a difficult boss, were stupid and meant nothing.  Back in 2019 I had a job at a gaming bar as a cook, I do love to cook, but the job was exhausting and was stressing me out really bad (and honestly, even today I think I wasn't good at the job, not in the quality of my food, but as a professional), and it was being really hard on me, plus all the trauma and problems I've had for years, but I didn't want to say anything because my mom was really proud of me for finally landing a job.  Unfortunately, it took the best of me and I tried to kill myself. I lost he job because of it and tried again a few months later.  I ended up drowing in debts, I always used video games as an escape and always had a compulsion when it came to buy them, so I sucked my cards dry to buy stuff, as the year ended, I had no job and 3k in debts (roughly 1.5k American Dolars, I belive, wich may not seem much, but for someone who had no job and was still living under my mom's wings was devastating).  I was feeling really bad, but decided to ignore it, we had a family trip to Japan early 2020 (a bit before the quarentine hit) so I decided to not worry about it and just enjoy the trip.  It was well, but I couldn't stop thinking about my financial problems, how I shouldn't be there (my mom paid for the entire trip) and my mom eventually found out, I hid my financial problems from her for months, so I was really stressed out.  But the trip was actually an amazing thing for me.  It was something that I've always wanted to do, since the first time I watched Spirited Away as a kid, that movie was the beginning of my love for japanese culture and the reason I wanted to become an artist, and I never thought I'd actually be there.  The first feel days were ok, it was really nice, but my mind was still on my problems.  On like the 4th day we went to a Seven Eleven to buy some food and the cashier saw us speaking portuguese (we're brazilian) and asked us in portuguese if we were also brazilian and we said yes and started talking.  She said she had been living in Japan for 15 years and it had been years that she hadn't seen her family or even spoke portuguese with anyone, she was literally shaking that some random brazilian showed up at the store and was neraly crying because she loved hearing her native language again and be reminded of her family.  That was the first sweet thing that happened there.  We visited a lot of places, it was everything incredibly beatiful, everyone was super gentle and really nice to us.   On our last week on the country we spent in Tokyo.  The first night we were there we got a recommendation from our Hostel to try a sushi restaurante near it. The restaurant was owned by the sweetest elderly couple, he the sushiman and his wife helped him. They had this wall with poster signed by people from several coutries who visited, so the wife asked us to sign and my brother (who knows a little japanese from his classes) told her that we were a family, a mother, an older sister and a younger brother. We spent the whole night talking to them, the man knew a little english, it was a bit broken but we could understand him, but his wife knew little to none english. Everytime he asked us something and we couldn't properly understand his wife would grab something to show us what he meant, like when he asked where we were from but we didn't understand and she grabbed a globe to show us. We started talking how me and my brother are a fan of japanese animation and his wife quickly went inside and brought us a Hello Kitty plushie, I thought that she was just showing us but she handed the doll to me and said "present" (in that broken english that we often see in anime), I couldn't believe it, that woman, who never met me, we didn't even speak the same language, gave me a plushie because I said I loved japanese animation (I'm not even a Hello Kitty fan, but you can bet I accepted it). That plushie is one of my prized posessions today.  Fast foward a few days, we were in Tokyo so I asked if we could go to the Pokémon Center. I've been a HUGE Pokémon fan my entire life, seriously, my love for Pokémon is immense, so I couldn't pass the oportunity to visit the Pokémon Center while I was in Japan. I was hoppinh with excitement as we made our way and once we got there... I saw those walls painted with Pokémons, a giant Snorlax Clock  in the center, a wall with Pokémon game timeline, I was literally crying with hapiness, I've never been that happy my entire life, I was like that Blastoise kid from that meme. As we were cashing out our itens my mom looked at me, saw how fraking happy I was (note that my mom, even thought I love her very much and she loves me very much, always critized me for being an adult who loves Pokémon and said I should grow up, and I've told her countless times that cartoons and video games were the only thing that made me happy were stupid) and said "See? I don't get it why this makes you so happy, but if does it's not stupid. Life is mostly made of small things that makes us happy, so don't you think it's worth living to see those little things?". That day something started to click on me.  We went to visit Mount Fuji, wich is one of the most beautiful sights I've ever witnessed, seriously it doesn't even look real, it looks like the sky is a giant windows screen saver (matrix confirmed?) and went biking, we nearly got lost but and elderly woman, who didn't speak english, showed us the way (who said that we need to know someone's language to communicate?).  Once the trip ended, I was thinking about what my mom had said to me. We made a woman day just by speaking portuguese with her for a few minutes, they were very gentle with us and they even gave us some presents while we were there and I never been happier, it was a dream come true, so I came back home with a mindset "I'm gonna try again".  I sit back home and started to draw and I didn't need hours of thinking (rather, oberthinking) to draw something I just did it and I liked it, I actually enjoyed the process and I enjoyed what I made... it was the first time in years.  But I still had my debts to deal with. Altought the pandemic was, and still is, a very bad event that we are going through (and should not be taking lightly, and for all of you who are suffering direct or indirect consequences from it, I wish you all the luck, it's okay to not be okay during this times, we're here for each other) everything closed up, including schools. One of my mom's cousins wanted to find an art class for her son, but everything was closed, so her aunt suggested that I'd give him some lessons. I was really nervous, I never been a teacher before, and even though I was happy with my art it was still not the point I wanted to achieve, but I gave it a try.  I ended up loving teaching, my students are very happy and evolving so fast and the big irony is I realized I knew a lot, I mean A LOT of stuff about art, I just didn't used because I was so afraid of failing.  Some of my students, who don't even take classes anymore, because of schedules, even recommended me to others, without me asking, because they loved my classes so much.  Today I have 5 students, give classes 5 days a week, paid my debts and in 3 weeks from today I'll be moving out of my mother's house (I'm 26, turning 27 in June) back to my home town, where my family and friends are, paying my own rent, caring for myself while doing what I love doing. I'm also saving to buy a new badass PC to work better with my students and play better games with my friends (I only own a laptop right now, it's good but it's not perfect for my job). I sold a lot of things that I was hoarding and I'm ready to enter a new chapter in my life.  That trip to Japan changed something in me.  I don't think I beat depression and watnots, but I'm most certanly learning how to live with it. I still have really bad days and fear that I might have a breakdown someday, but I'm trying my best everyday, I'm seeing things differently. I'll always carry my scars but I'm proud to say that I had a pretty bad day last year and instead of harming myself, like I've done before, I sat on my chair and drew a nice illustration that I really enjoyed.  Thank you so much for everyone that read this all the way through. I know that things aren't easy, and you don't have to feel bad for not being able to handle it, but if you can find something that makes you happy, even if small, it gets easier.  I hope you all have a wonderful day and if you don't, I hope that you are able to get through it.  And don't feel bad if you can't handle things right now, it's alright, tou have the right to do nothing when things aren't ok.
Maybe something like that is what I need to get out of this cycle of negative thoughts. Maybe not necessarily travel, but just something new and exciting. I think i kinda forgot how to have fun since the pandemic has started...  Thank you for sharing your story. I wish you luck in whatever you decide to do in the future.
What happened to you is very good.
Thank you so much for this post.
I’m happy for you! I’ve been feeling depressed and your story made me feel some relief. Thank you for sharing.  Do you share your artwork online anywhere? I’d like to see it if so.   I use to enjoy making art, but always struggled finding inspiration and kind of stopped doing it after seeing how amazing so many artist are compared to what I could do. I ended up going to college and getting a degree in Art History instead of pursing an Art degree, because I didn’t think I was good enough. I convinced myself I could still be around art and had a better chance finding a career in a gallery or museum with the Art History degree. After college I got a job in a gallery and loved being around the art and artist, but the owner and sales aspect turned me off completely and made me not want to pursue another job related to my degree.  Glad you got back into art! Keep doing what you love!
Thank you.  I truly hope you find something that brings you joy :)
Thanks you, I'm really glad that my story helped you.  I share my work on my Instagram @_kyraxiii.  Hope you fins a job that you enjoy :)

No one understands why I am my harshest critic. It's because the second I start loving myself, ppl will remind me why I'm such a shit person. Having confidence in myself backfires every single time. I am a shitty, shitty friend and person altogether. And if I stop telling myself that, someone will be right behind me letting me know.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0je3b/should_i_just_quit_current_job_cant_handle_mental/
I've held more than 4 jobs in 2020. I got fired from 3, quit from 1. I just got fired and instantly accepted another job.  I've been bedridden depressed like I haven't been in months. I actually stopped abusing substances and I've just been forcing myself to sleep.  Today I feel a little bit better than yesterday. I feel like I should just stay jobless until I sort out my shit. I am only spreading my name in a very specific job industry, in a very small country. So everyone knows who I am and how I've fucked up.  What are your thoughts? I need help standing up and currently I can't do it by myself, and it's hard to admit that. I only eat because my anti-depressant causes hunger (Mirtazapine), otherwise food just make me sick. I feel like having no stressors would help me a lot. Otherwise I'm risking going back to a psychotic state. Either way, parents have noticed a steady decline in my health and they're concerned to the point of agression ("If you don't seek help we'll call the police again to kick you out and get yourself jailed on a lie, like last time").  Official diagnoses are major recurring depression and borderline personality disorder, and I got psychotic symptoms because of both.
Are you in the position to quit and still eat, have a home to live in, and have other necessities? If not, please keep it until you find another. Weigh your pros and cons dear. You can't sacrifice food.

I gotta say, I’m a handsome guy and I’ve never had sex, kissed a girl or dated. I feel like shit because of it, but no more. Don’t let it bring you down. Find your talent, focus on getting good, make something of it for yourself not the world and float in your individuality as if you are the last person on earth.
You are me, lol literally. I share the same insights for the OP.

I don’t even like video games or the internet all that much. However, for some reason I’m extremely drawn to them. It’s like I feel empty without them, but at the same time when I’m on the internet I don’t feel fulfilled. It’s been going like this for a couple of years. I’ve tried to live a more balanced lifestyle, but I’ve been unsuccessful.   I was diagnosed with depression and depersonalization and I’ve been in treatment for six months. My psychologist, therapist, and psychiatrist all think video games are a big problem, but it feels completely impossible to withdraw from them.   I feel guilty because I spend more time than my parents would like on the internet. They really want me to get better, but I can’t do it.   Does anyone else have this problem? What should I do?
Is there something you'd rather be doing, but the net is acting as a poor facsimile of that thing because the true desire is difficult to obtain?

I’m so depressed and I don’t know what to do. I wish I was good enough for my standards but I’m not and I never will be and I don’t want to settle for less. I’ll never be enough for anyone I like, even myself. I feel like suicide may be my only option.
Please don’t
Please don’t x2
Please reach out, I've been in your position and still feel that way, but there is a greater purpose and you are worthy of living life.
I completely understand how that can feel like the only option. I’ve been there myself and it’s something I still struggle with sometimes but please please believe me when I say that there are other options. I don’t know your specific situation but it can and will get better. I know that sounds cheesy and it’s easier to say than to believe. For now in this moment try to breathe and just focus on the now. Don’t think about the future or the past just focus on your breathing or distract yourself with something that makes you comfortable

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0l5x4/seasonal_depression_covid_friends/
I get really bad seasonal depression. I don’t do well in the cold and therefore I stay in doors much of the winter. But the cold makes me so depressed because I’m the type of person who *thrives* in warm and sunny climates. Now that there is COVID, I’ve been staying in doors even more. Which makes sense, but to be honest the mixture of COVID and seasonal depression has made me not want to socialize. I’ve gone days if not weeks without seeing my friends. The thing is I am so far into isolation that I don’t even want to see people because I enjoy time alone and feel like my depression will just bring down the people around me. Slot of my friends don’t understand why I’m like this and I don’t have the energy to explain because tbh idk either. It’s hard seeing friends being all normal and social during this time because I literally can’t relate and can barely leave my house to get a coffee. Yeah.
That is how depression works. If your friends can't understand, then they are going to either have to learn more or you are going to have to find others who can relate.  It isn't up to you to change your entire life to act normal for others who barely notice. It is up to you to be true to yourself and be your own caregiver.  This feels like it is going to last forever, but that is in the now. We don't know what the future will hold for us so we doubt what can happen. Just keep yourself safe and healthy. You can make it out of this winter into a better spring.
Needed this. Thank you:)

I don't think I can pretend to be okay and strong in front of my family any longer. I am tired of trying. I can't even sleep at night because my mind is too busy. I have no energy to do daily tasks but I have to act like I am okay.   I have been jobless since November so I am currently  job hunting. But I am also so freaking tired of the process. I finally got a job offer but it didn't fell through due to some circumstances. The fact that my country is still under lockdown isn't helping too.   I feel like why do I even bother trying. Inside of me I feel like I have already given up but I cant because of my family. Today I feel like I have reached my breaking point. I don't know how to face tomorrow..and the upcoming days.  I know it's not good to seek validation but please today I just need someone to say it will be okay.
It will be okay. You are not alone. Love to you today
I feel you man. I am sending internet hugs. I hope it gets better for you.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0iq0f/what_counts_as_a_mood_swing/
I've been thinking about mood swings recently and realised I've never realised understood what the term means. General definitions say a 'rapid shift in mood' or something similar, but there's never any context to understand what 'rapid' means.  I always thought of mood swings as being unpredictable one second to the next, of cycling through moods several times in the space of a few hours, so said I didn't have mood swings. However I read something, somewhere recently which gave me cause to think the timescale was more day-to-day, than minute-to-minute.  My moods range quite wildly on a day-to-day basis, dark and gloomy and apathetic one day, perky, sociable and productive the next. Whenever I have a very good day, it's immediately followed by a very bad day. Or days that start happy and energetic can switch to miserable over the course of an hour or so, then stay sad for the rest of the day. Are these mood swings, or is that just a normal fluctuation in mood?  Have I misunderstood what mood swings are and been incorrectly answering diagnostic questions for over a decade? Or does a "rapid change in mood" mean a more sudden, rapid cycling within a period of a few hours?  TL;DR: What timeframe do we have to look at when considering whether we have mood swings?

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0dqqz/the_call_of_the_void_means_more_than_jumping_at/
It's a [phrase](https://www.healthline.com/health/call-of-the-void) that resonates with me quite well, not from an edgelord perspective but from my 'previous' depression. 3 years back, all I wanted to do was sleep during my times off from work. I worked at night which meant most of my days were spent sleeping or attempting to sleep before going back the next night. But restlessness wasn't the main reason why.  It was because sleep felt like an escape from the chore of life. The waking world was overwhelming and stressful in most areas, even with the most simple or mundane of tasks. My home life at the time didn't make things any better, constantly having to put up with an abusively berating family that just didn't get it and didn't care to get it. I didn't have any productive hobbies to look forward to and my issues went so much deeper than this. So the only thing that I looked forward to or cared about at the time was sleeping. It was so warm and inviting. I didn't have to fear it. I didnt have to think. I didnt have to do anything. I just closed my eyes and then there was nothingness. Which I felt was my natural state of being at the time. With no hobbies, people, or paths of life to look forward to, this was the one thing at the time that I really felt comfortable with. Yes, I eventually went to therapy for this and just talking to someone who actually listened and gave advice was satisfying. Even if it was their job to do so. But all these years later, I feel the same urge to sleep in the back of my mind. Just knocking and waiting.  Has anyone else experienced this? What have you or would you do to permanently get around this?

I’m done with everything right now. I feel so very exhausted and hate everything about myself. I don’t want to be myself and wish I was someone else. I have no friends, I feel empty and tired all the time. I have no reason to live and feel lonely everyday.
Similar feelings here :/ Are you working or still in school ? Like what me helps is to do things i like and that’s Gaming but it’s complicated because not working and sitting home playing games is in society just not welcome  But do you have any Hobbys ?
I have a job and go to school. All the things I used to find fun are no longer fun and I force myself to play them ig for nostalgia. I’m never motivated to get up for work or go to class (I’m full online).
I feel actually the same :/  Im also in struggle to find something that helps me going through this phase but I can’t help myself   The only thing that distracts me from all the shit are video games  But when you say the things you once liked aren’t fun anymore it’s pretty hard I know
Been trying to get into new things like playing the guitar but end up giving up a lot. I can’t think positively anymore

A need to be someone for everyone else is tiring and soul destroying. You will have many feelings - beautiful and ugly; but there's beauty in all of them. Everyone has unique unrealised traits and things in their unconscious waiting to be found. Look for them.

Well first you need to find a spot where it can support your weight, then you need to choose the time. You need 30 mins (uninterrupted) at least because if you don't do it for that long you'll probably be saved and it will be classed as attempted suicide. Plus there's a high chance it will put you in a worse state (like it could paralyze you from the neck down) and I dont think you want that do you. I've done my research and you haven't so don't go around spouting shit like that.
I'm really fucking close though.
I doubt that. Thanks for the kind words though.
Not for long i hope.
I'll probably have to look for a stronge rope. So in a way im not going to use this exact one that i have now lol
Lol, don't worry I have done research as well don't worry. I have a plan obviously...

Do you have any family?
I'll rephrase - Please don't kill yourself at all :(((
You really are stupid you can't even come close to my knowledge. You can't even comprehend the knowledge that is in my grasp so shut your mouth
And your life isn't as bad as you think it is
i don't really have friends and i don't care about my family that much and im not in a relationship
On theory yes, but it doesnt feel like real parents. They're delusional and stupid. I can't really blame them though.
I don't need to...
wtf? this person is in pain n ur comparing intelligence?
Trust me, it is.
what about pets? and even if you don't have many friends they still care about you. id walk through fire to save one of my friends im sure yours would too
Why do you think they are like that? What do they do that makes you think like this?
Go on I'm listening, let's compare and don't lie
I dont have any pets either. I cant take care of myself let alone a pet.
We dont need to compare lol. Everyone sees stuff different and has different motives. It's really  unnecessary :/  #
ok but im sure your friends still love you

Does anyone know why I feel like everyone is judging me ,weather it be in my appearance or the clothes I wear , whenever I feel like this i go  light headed and start to loose my breath
I was in a position like this a few years ago. Anxiety so bad I couldn't even talk to my professor about homework without choking up. Over time I realized I needed to stop going with what I interpret peoples reactions to be and just go with what they say. It leaves a lot less room for intrusive thoughts to morph your view.   Also I think, at least in my case, could be partly your own conscience leading those judgement. Whenever it gets bad try to focus on one (big or small) thing about you you're confident in. Could be some ability, some style choice, or or even something as trivial as your taste in music. This will distract you from the noise your head seems to create.  Remember, no one is as good at being you than you are. =)
Your thought strikes me deeply as i hv myself been there. I realised you just can't escape judgements at any point of life so better make those irrelevant.  Care for people who cares for you, rest don't give a fuck.

Last night I had a really weird feeling come over that kind of reminded of childhood, ever since I’ve been really depressed so tonight I decided to get drunk alone. I’m currently drinking as I write this and I kinda feel better. But I’m thinking really deep into this feeling. Do you guys ever get like a weird feeling that brings back memories
Yes. I’m constantly affected by my memories and negatively nostalgic sensations. The only thing that seems to get me through the day is my passion and talents, and my will to become the wiser version of myself. And also, psychedelic drugs holds me up. I used to be afraid of altered states, but after a mind changing mushrooms and lsd experience, I can say for sure that my life goal is to explore altered states of consciousness and inevitably experience all that can be experienced through being a psychonaut. Researching about psychedelics and lucid dream, etc vanquishes my problems. It’s utter happiness for the time being, but my depression seems to always peek through the curtains of my prevailing of happiness and meaning
Yup all the time. I get flashes of trauma that I can't escape so i am learning to live with it.  Its okay to be alone sometimes but don't be lonely.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0f1dm/lamictal_for_depression/
Has anyone else taken Lamictal? If so, how did it go? I think it’s working for me, but I’ve read that it’s mostly for bipolar people. Just curious really.
worked for me when nothing else did. i’ve been taking it for over two years now. it’s also been one of the only medications that barely caused any side effects. it doesn’t really make me feel great, we’re still adding and changing other medications to find the right combination to truly help me get better but it definitely helped pull me out of the deep depression i was in. i don’t have bipolar and it helped regardless and i would definitely recommend it.
Yes its working great for me off label  (no one has said that I am bipolar) in conjunction with Emsam. The first time I took i felt a sense of well being that I have not felt for years. That faded but  when I take 100mg at night I don't wake up with as much fog.  When we increased the dosage I felt that I was experiencing confusion but in retrospect it could have been poor sleep.  My diagnosis is atypical depression and i have been in treatment for 24 years. My dosage is 200mg.   Report any rash immediately. Alot of providers wont even consider it because  the condition associated with the rash is dangerous but rare.  And of course you may have a completely different experience.
also, if it’s working for you, that’s great!! it might be mainly for bipolar but that doesn’t mean it’s only for that. it’s often used for depression even though that’s not what it’s “meant for”. i’m glad you think it might be helping :)
May i ask your dosage?
of course! i have a high tolerance for medication (just so you know). i started at 100mg, went up to 200, was on 300 for probably the past year or so and lately have been doing worse so now i take 200mg twice a day to make a total of 400mg a day. no noticeable side effects at all. overall it has been a good medicine and has helped me feel more balanced and i feel like it has also helped lessen mood swings such as anger or irritation and also outbursts caused by being overwhelmed by depressive thoughts.

I don’t think I can handle this I just have to many things , to many things on my mind  That I am tryna deal with , but I just can’t , I’m tryna be happy  And school at the same time , I’m tryna give myself time  And just tryna think in positive , but school is just tearing me down  I just don’t think that I can handle all this load , I know other people can  But I am just not that strong , I’m tryna tell myself  That there is a point for all this , that someday I will get something I deserve But if this is what I deserve being hell bound and never reaching a better place , I wish I was somebody else , because I see everyone with their friends , and there , I feel so fake , like come and watch this weird kid With zero mental health , and see if he can lead us to a treasure  that he can’t posses . I can’t I’m sorry , I need to crash , I need a vacation  But not from school , from my brain , I need a break from me  I need to stop pushing my problems away and start facing them  But every time I do l I just drown . I can’t handle it  And I can’t handle knowing that sooner or later I  will have to ready or not  And I can’t handle knowing that everything is pointless  I can’t handle knowing that I cursed myself to this  I like blaming the old me , but I know future me also curses me Blaming me for not getting out of here ,  But I don’t even know if there even is a road I don’t even know if there is a reason to keep forward  I can’t handle all those doubts , all those questions , all those regrets , all this anger I hate toward myself ,  All those things that i wanna say but can’t because no one listens  I feel like I’m on a prison ,  Who am I kidding I know how to get out  Just walk out the door , there are two outcomes  It works or you get shot 20 times and get out here again , And just looking at the data ..... And Im being pressured everyday to do it  But I can’t because I know that I end up losing  So do I just wait till the time has end  Until someone pulls me out the this place  Do I even have someone I could call a friend Do I really have to do it all it by myself  Because if so then all that comes to mind and killing myself  I know my problems are probably not as high stakes as most of you  And I know y’all probably screaming at how lucky I am and how easy I’ve got it , but I feel bad they are really just shredding me ,  Sorry for making you go thru this rant
Problems are never a joke.
Other people have gone thru much harder stuff than I  My problems against theirs is like people starving against a guy not being able to order food online
If you're depressed, you should be helped. That's what matters, is that you get helped out
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0jujf/a_bad_person_in_a_bad_world/
My whole life I have known that I'm a bad person.   Afterall, my mother told me so on many occasions.   My wife normally sees the bad in me and walks around on eggshells all the time.   I hate that I make her feel that way.   But growing up and in my early days of working, at least the world around me made sense.   Work, parenting, decent government, etc.   Now in my 50s, the world seems to have just gone to shit -- covid, trump, radicals destroying the capital, guns everywhere, school shootings, propaganda on every television channel.  The question is why would a bad person like me in a bad world want to go on?
Bad in what way if I may ask?
Wouldn't a solely bad person feel pretty well in a fucked up world?   That fact that you struggle with those "bad" things, means there is something opposing inside of you.   Do you get what I mean? :)
meaning, me being a bad person or the world being bad.
I do and it's a fair point.  An argument that my therapist tried to make (back when I had one).   If I were single and younger, I probably would feel the way you describe.   I have responsibilities that pull me back over and hold me together.  I couldn't live up to my responsibilities if I acted the way I want to act.   This is part of what I meant when I said that the world around me held me up.
I just didn’t get why you think you are a bad person. I think everyone has some good traits. Some ppl can’t see the good.
I don't see why you can't try and be better.
Yes, but then again, wouldn't a really self-centered person not just get rid of those responsibilities and live according to his true nature?   I think he probably wouldn't care for the aftermath and just do that.   Although I can completely relate to the feeling of having something inside of you which can't come out because you caged it there. Those things tend to pressure up until it's really nasty.  Usually, there is a valve for such feelings, but it is hard to find one that goes hand in hand with the rest of your life.
Mainly because of what goes on in my head and in my core. DM me and I'll explain.
Genetics mostly.  a house with a bad foundation can't really be fixed.
You can destroy the foundations and build new ones. It's a difficult process but hardly impossible. You could start a conversation with your partner, I'm sure they would encourage any self improvement.
I've been trying for a long long time.
Yeah, it's not easy at all, but you can do it.
Nah -- best I can do is put a veil over it so I don't piss off everyone I speak to.   As the world get's worse, it's harder and harder to do
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0ju8y/i_really_really_like_drawing_but_now_i_seem_to_be/
Hello everyone, I'm just want to write what's in my head right now. Sorry if my english is bad. I used to really like to draw for ages specially on fantasy things.   Until some incident happens (I say it here) and I feel lost my ability to draw and often I feel exhausted when i trying to draw something. Meanwhile on the other side people just look at me and say "get a real job" or mock me because I do drawing as job which is not considered as a job (I tried to find them)  I love my job as pet artist and fantasy artist as hobby. I can pay and help my parents with the bills. I don't know if my parents are proud of me or not. And now this pandemic happens and all collapse, we need to sell everthing we have. I usually can only sleep when the morning comes and often got nightmares between my sleeps.   Sometimes, sleep is more exhausting than stay awake. But I can just give up because my family needs me. sorry again if my english is bad, I don't have any friends to share what I feel. So, I think it's okay if I share them here because no one I know will read them
For dream analysis I can recommend reading Carl Jung's Man and His Symbols. Everyone has unique unrealised creative and destructive energies. You need to find your positive thoughts and feelings and leave destructive energies behind.
I would love to be able to draw something imagined. To think of being able to completely dive into a fantasy Place and bring that to paper amazes me. But whenever I try, I find myself completely lost between what I intended and something a 3-Year old would draw :D
Thank you so much for the tips

Hey guys. I'm 26 yo and for the past few years I've been dealing with depression, last month I decided to change my lifestyle,  eating healthy, workout, meditate and more. I did it for 20 days I felt sort of happy but just ONE little stupid thing was enough for me to go back. I feel worthless, I hate myself, the only thing that makes me not wanna do it is my mom and my sister ... I feel everything I do is for other people... I don't want anything for myself ... I donno it's 4 in a morning and I am crying to Toy story 1 soundtrack , I think back then I was happy ... will I ever feel normal again? I am tired of sleeping and doing nothing for all day ...
I'm sorry this is happening . i understand the lack of motivation as it seems there is nothing compelling you to even get out of bed . But my advice would be , remember how you felt those 20 days . You were exercising,  meditating , eating healthy, and more . You can get that back . if there is anything we can do to make that happen , let us know . we are here for you always .
Thanks for reading, I am scared of doing things that I wanted to do and feel the same. I'll try my best to be better.
No worries . I know how that feels . If you really want it , the best advice I could give you would be to do it . I know your scared of doing it and of not feeling anything but if you truly believe you possess the ability to feel joy again , you should try . Keep your head up mate .

It’s with you when the phone rings and you’re too frightened to answer it.  It’s with you when you look into the eyes of those you love, and your eyes prick with tears as you try, and fail, to remember how to love them.   It’s with you as you search within for those now eroded things that once made you who you were: your interests, your creativity, your inquisitiveness, your humor, your warmth.  And it’s with you as you wake terrified from each nightmare and pace the house, thinking frantically of how you can escape your poisoned life.  \-Ben Locker  One of the most relatable descriptions of depression I have ever read.
Thats a beautiful piece of writing .

Oh my gosh my friend, here in Canada I don't have to pay anything for them - they are completely covered!

Every day seems like it's basically the same. My daily routine is pretty much wake up, drink coffee, smoke some weed, watch some tv, go to school (or online classes for now), do my work, browse reddit, play videogames, watch more tv, and then finally try to force myself to go to sleep since I also have sorta bad sleeping problems, and repeat. I also want to start to focus on getting a part-time job, because I feel like it will help me get out of the house and do more things, as well as I really, really, really want to start making some money. But I feel like I'll go to sleep, wake up, and just be... Extremely unmotivated to do it or anything again and my "mental fog" will start kicking in again, it always happens and I absolutely loathe it and myself for it. I really do want to do this and make a change to my life, I've been planning on doing it for a while but Covid kinda fucked that up. I guess I just want to hear someone assure me that I can do this, and maybe give some advice on how to actually stick to doing this
You're not going to be stuck in the same rut forever. As you get older, form more connections, and venture into different areas, this will open doorways into different activities and circumstances. A major part of getting out of a rut is seeking different things to do to break up the boredom. Maybe try fishing, different music, exercise, fight training, instruments, getting a car if you don't already have one and taking a drive to a different area. Just don't stop and don't give up.
Lmfao its the same for me except for that smoke the weed part
God I wish I could do most of that stuff but I'm kinda poor so anything that involves me buying something is out of the picture lol, I could try the different music and exercise, I haven't worked out as much as I'd like to ever since quarantine started. I have also been trying to get someone to go driving with me 'cause I just got my G1 in December so I need somebody with 4 years driving experience with me, and I only know a couple of people who do and Covid makes it harder to get someone to go with me so I'm just kinda waiting for it to slow down a little. I won't give up thank you man, your comment makes me want to try more
No problem bro. Stay safe.

Its horrible, I hate it, but I know it. I know it so well bc it’s so predictable- the same type of tired feeling like it’s too much effort to even breathe- and bc it’s always been such a dominant part of my life. And it’s been getting better, I’m happy and the bad days are sparse, but it feels weird and I look back at when my depression was at its worse with a weird sort of nostalgia. It’s like: when your at your peak you’re awaiting a great fall, but when you’re in a valley there is no where else to go.   I feel like I’m anticipating a great fall. I’m happy but it’s so unfamiliar in comparison to the tired sadness I feel so often. I feel guilty for worrying when I’m happy but it just feels like I’m running on borrowed time.

i feel tired all day long, dragging my feet and struggling to keep up, and then when the night rolls around i want to do anything but sleep.  but at night, i’m really alone and it’s just me and my thoughts and i just feel worse and worse and it’s expedited by the fact that i’m alone. i usually just end up crying alone until i get tired enough, but half of the time when i shut my eyes the tears just start again and i have to sit up. i don’t even know why i’m crying i don’t think there is anything wrong. on paper my life is great, i’m in a happy relationship, i’ve been getting continuous 4.0 semesters in school, my family loves me, i live with friends, i exercise frequently, and so on. maybe that’s why i feel so sad, that even with all of this good stuff it’s still not enough to make me feel happy. at this point i don’t really know what will. i feel so apathetic about my future - i truly can’t imagine it at all and i don’t care to. i have no great aspirations or goals or dreams to keep me motivated. it feels fucking pathetic to push through every day, trying to motivate myself to with little, inconsequential rewards like a good dinner or to watch tv. im in therapy but i don’t know if it’s even helping or working because well here i am. i don’t know how to talk to people in my life about these feelings. there is nothing tangible i can tell people like, “i failed a class” or “my mom is angry at me” because nothing bad even happened. i just feel this way and i don’t know why or what i did to deserve it. how do i explain that to people? the constant exhaustion and apathy which i try to mask everyday is exhausting. nothing really feels good anymore and i don’t know what to make of that. rationally i know it gets better probably, but i don’t care enough to see it through. even if i told my friends i don’t know what i’d be asking of them. i don’t know how to feel better and what they could give me or do for me that would help. there is nothing in my life that i feel is lacking, i’m lucky with friends, family, academics, relationship, but i still feel so empty. there is nothing tangible i am seeking or a clean cut solution, so i just stay quiet. i don’t want to make other people feel sad or bad for me. logically i have to go on and keep trying but i just don’t really want to anymore. i’m so tired, i’m tired every day no matter how much i sleep. laughing feels heavy and forced half of the time. i want to feel enjoyment and pleasure again in hobbies and hang outs and the little things in life. eating sometimes makes me feel good but then i just remember my ex who encouraged me into an eating disorder and told me i’d look better if i restricted more. even though i haven’t seen or spoken to him since early 2019 i am still a prisoner of those words and the lifestyle he forced upon me where i wasn’t eating for days in a row. i still struggle with eating and calorie guilt and body checking every day and i no longer find much pleasure or joy in something simple like eating. i don’t know what it’s gonna take for me to feel good again but i hope it’s soon because i am so so tired. ok thanks for reading bye
Sleepless nights are so difficult, make it hard to function the next day without tons of coffee. Hope your night gets better

My heart feels heavy. I thought I already left the weight a few years ago, but it's back again, even heavier now. I don't know what to do. I've been unproductive af lately. The stuff I used to enjoy, I can't even do anymore. My poetry, I can't even write anymore because I feel so empty. My schoolworks, piled up and another set of tasks came in for this week. I don't know what to do. I just wanna rest for life.

broke up with my fiance, its been 9 months. i have a job, got my own house, wishing i was dead. have her messenger, discord, battle net open, just watching her come online. we never meant to break up, she struggled with happiness. she is my happiness.   she still cares for me a lot, just cant do anything because she moved on with someone new, i could get a therapist. Dont want to, if she ever needed cash, i gave it to her, shed never accept extra, but i shoved it down her throat pretty much cuz i knew she cudnt get a job, struggles with studying, a task that takes a regular person 10-20 mins, takes her 2 hours.   she never ever asks for money unless its specifically to pay a bill and she never lets me send it to her bank account, only to pay the bill directly with company, i buy her cigarettes because its one of the few things i know that calms her and keeps her leveled. she never ever asks.  i have everything but the one thing, she has half a thing and nothing else. if i waste away, that's fine by me, to me, i know that this is all i want out of my life, dream about becoming so depressed that my heart gives out and i can die from a heart attack or something, i wanna die from somekind of a natural cause because I'm too pussy to suicide.
If she's with someone else, it's probably best to try and reframe your thoughts of her from sadness and regret to nostalgia and appreciation so you can get back to your life, bud. It takes weeks to months to accomplish this, so I understand the difficulty at first.  If coming back together is impossible, I can't be the only one who wants you on a new and brighter path.

Im a very social person, and definitely i love to talk. But recently ive been struggling to do that. I  felt like suddenly ive become an introvert. Which i know is actually somehow a good thing for me since sometimes i could really talk alot and become very insensitive.   A lil background about me would be i am a sanguine and i love love love to communicate. I love conversations alot! To a stranger to infact anyone! But because of depression and anxiety and me having to always stop myself from cryinf cause ive been so busy in my jobs. ive been struggling to speak up which is very unlike me. I dont like being alone but because of work and my bestfriends having their own bestfriend, it made me stop talking to them mostly and even to anyone. Maybe im jelous that they found someone but mostly i think its because ive been feeling so alone lately. Last Saturday my bestfriend told me she will be joining a group with her new friends and she was sharing how she was excited and i dont want to be a bummer so i said that its good to see her happy and everything but unfortunately i dont know why my stomach was really aching. I was sad after she told me she will be spending most of her free time with them. It almost made me cry after that. I dont know maybe I should start reaching out to a therapist but unfortunately there are non in my province. And i definitely cant travel as well. So im struggling this alone, umm wish me luck. Thanks
Huge luck to you!  I had huge social anxiety in college for years myself. Have you been able to locate the origin point to your depression and anxiety (physical or mental based) to better target the root? That was essential to me slowly turning my crippling social anxiety around. Hard to fight the unknown enemy until it's exposed, you know?

When I think of foods that are nutritiously sound, ugh it just sounds awful. Having to go out. Go to the store. Make food. But then again... I know my weakness is junk food. I lost all this weight, and I won’t let depression convince me to gain it back! But fuck... it’s hard.   Anyone else relate to this?
I completely get you, i wish eating wasn’t so necessary to survive. Somedays I just can’t be arsed
The annoying thing is that sometimes I’m in the mood to eat something like a salad but I just can’t motivate myself to actually make one so I end up just having oven chips again :/ I gained a lot of weight when I started slipping into this depression, partially for this reason and partially because I’m an emotional eater
Sameeeee! All my relatives say that food is all you need if you want to torture me!
I have no idea if this would help or not, but have you looked into nutritional meal replacement shakes, like Huel? Might be good for when the work of preparing food is too much.
I feel this. I've been living off of cereal, frozen meals, meal replacement shakes and protein bars. I just don't care. I wish humans didn't need to eat. It's just another chore.
Yeah. Just talked with my mom. We decided we’re finally going to start meal prepping. I think it’d help me a lot because a big part of it is just the process of deciding what I want. I try and eat healthy but fuckkkk it’s so much easier to eat unhealthy. Hah why can’t there be a restaurant with McDonald’s speed and efficiency that serves actual healthy food! Lol if only.
Yeah deciding is the bit I can’t do and since I do my own shopping I always just end up eating the same couple (not perfectly healthy) meals I cook myself. Awesome tho dude having a good meal plan will take away so much stress plus you’ll also feels good from healthy eating

It's an ongoing thing. I don't know how long it'll last. The thoughts just surge upon me during said hour. More so, suicidal thoughts are ever present. They're more persistent these days despite being with people. Anyone knows how to get these thoughts out of my head?  Medicines make me regret everything since they cause me to sleep too much and when I sleep too much, my parents get angry. (Which is why due to this happening again earlier today because I tried to drink medicines again since I can't anymore, I was just riddled with more guilt.)  So yeah, if you have any suggestions on how to get "inspired" pro-actively, or on how I can get rid of negative emotions, that'd be nice. Thank you! :)

So i have struggled with depression for over ten year and these last few weeks I have just been nothing but tired. I get a good amount of sleep at night but can barely get up in the morning and I will fall asleep periodically throughout the day. Does anyone have any tips because I have been sleeping through classes and my grades are suffering immensely because I do not have the energy or capacity to complete my school work.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0n3n9/insight_two_extremes/
Life has two extremes, happiness or depression. Without one, the other cannot exist as they cause each other to occur.  So does wanting happiness cause depression? Does avoiding depression cause happiness? Wanting and avoiding is the reason we suffer, the reason why we are in so much pain.  The reason why we may feel depressed is because we don't understand the reality of the world. It is all impermanent, we are born and then we die. When we crave or cling to anything of this world, like happiness, we suffer.  So the question here is, is your depression really yours or is it part of the world? The mind is a powerful thing, don't let it get swayed by delusion.

Been feeling low lately, I seem to fck things up everywhere I do without even trying. I’m tired, I’m confused, I’m obviously not made to live long. I just wish things were better yknow, I wish people were nice to each other, I wish I was normal, I wish I would have lived the life I wanted. I wish a lot of things but I know it’ll never happen. I’m too useless and there’s legit no use for me anymore I’m just a stain on this world. Idk if I’ll make it to my 23rd birthday which is this Friday. Idk but idc either way.
No honestly it doesn’t. But if you are lucky, you are able to become numb to it. And accept the lifetime sadness. It kind of helps
Numbness is a defence mechanism that leaves you feeling empty. You don't just loose the sadness you loose any chance of positivity. You need to encourage and express your deepest emotions but it's difficult when most of your feelings become unconscious.
Yeah I agree to an extent. However, I’ve never been able to properly express my deepest emotions. Could be from chronic depression. So I guess I took a different route
Many people with depression struggle with their deep feelings because they feel they need to suppress everything. I felt numb and empty for a long time. Everyone has unique unrealised traits and feelings in their unconscious. What is your experience of depression like?
Mostly having no emotional feelings or at least able to show them. I haven’t been able to cry in over a decade. It’s been very difficult because I can’t find enjoyment in many things. Never really  genuinely happy or have much hope in anything. I started smoking weed and using other forms of THC which have helped a lot. But I hate having to get high to feel better. Been looking for natural ways but just isn’t there
You're hiding from your uniqueness and that's something that is difficult to understand. You have thoughts and feelings that may be ugly or beautiful... but there's beauty in all of them. Finding people who have similar feelings to explore your feelings with be helpful.
I appreciate this!
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

I have been together with a woman (shes 28 I’m 26) for about 3 years. II’ll try to keep it short. We met at work while she was coming out of a toxic relationship and things blossomed at the very beginning. There was then baggage with death threats from her ex and I pulled back. Work found out about us and she was given the option to transfer, she ended up quitting and she found a job she enjoys more anyways. I started drinking with friends and using that as an escape not dealing with the issues. We still continued being together, going on vacations, spending nights with each-other and everything seemed fine. I then started to realize I wasn’t really present and as of November I started making big changes in my life and being more mindful. I saw all the hard times in her life and I really wasn’t there as I should have been. I recognized all my mistakes in the relationship and was grateful she stuck by my side for my short comings. After I stopped drinking and focusing on bettering myself, in December she was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis and started spiralling downhill. She has always dealt with depression (was on medication, not sure if she still is). I also never acknowledged or researched what depression actually was until recently. She was saying she needed space and that eventually turned into her breaking up with me. We went 8 days with no contact and she called me at 3 am after no contact and I called back when I woke-up and she was saying how she misses me, was crying and saying that I just have to be patient with her. We saw each-other a few times but it definitely wasn’t like how it was before. Conversations were very hard and it felt like anything I said would overwhelm her. Then 3 days ago she asked if we can talk and then broke up with me again. I asked if she was still in love with me and she said she loved me as a person but wasn’t in love with me. I accepted it and then the next morning she FaceTimed me saying that she’s sad and she called in sick to work. I told her that I’ll still be there for her and she wanted to be able to still hear about my milestones in life and every so often do check ins. We basically agreed to be friends I guess you can say. Then what really confuses me is that the next day after that she FaceTimes me like everything is fine to show me a car that she was borrowing from a family member (I’m really into cars). I really do love this woman and want to spend the rest of my life with her. I’m strong emotionally and can focus energy on other aspects of my life. What I am struggling with is do I tell her that we can’t talk anymore and let her deal with her issues and see if that helps her fall back in love with me? Or do I stay a supportive friend through out these times and still answer the phone anytime she calls?

Hi all!   When I am in a depressed spell, one of the things I struggle with is teeth-brushing. And flossing. And not eating sugar. Lol.   Unsurprisingly, my teeth have not reacted positively to this. :-P However - when I last went to the dentist (who luckily was understanding when I explained), she was able to use some kind of compound to fill in some of the gaps that appeared between my teeth, even spots that I thought were unsalvageable.  My teeth looked great again, so good that people actually gave me compliments on what nice teeth I had haha. And it was painless for me. And while insurance didn't cover it, luckily it was not nearly as expensive as I was expecting. It still wasn't cheap, but it wasn't catastrophic. I acknowledge that dental care is, sadly, a privilege not available to all (and of course some people have dentist anxiety - I'm lucky that I always had good dentists growing up who made going a positive experience and I have no bad memories therein), and that this procedure is by no means accessible to everyone, but I would say it's probably doable for the average person (I am on a very limited income and still managed it.)  FF a year and a half and I've done it to myself again (sigh), but I can get it done again, and at least I know now that not all the physical damage the Disease has wrought on me is irreparable. Hope this can be encouraging if anyone else is stuck in the sucky spiral of "I can't brush my teeth because I'm depressed - now my teeth look bad so I'm more depressed" - etc.  Good luck to everyone! Sending love! <3

I haven't been diagnosed with anything (mainly because I don't know how to be and my parents wouldn't really understand) but I was told to post here. i recently got into the university I wanted and today I got my restricted license, and while it felt good, it was just for a few hours. I'm back to feeling anxious about... I don't even know. the next thing that comes up? I'm never...happy, you know? content or anything. talking to my friends helps a lot but as soon as that comes to an end I'm back to just feeling nothing. i have no self esteem or confidence or anything, nothing im really good at or passionate about, and I'm just starting life. I don't want this to be what the rest of my existence is like. I'm always 'down'. I just want to be happy
You will find your happiness or acceptance or purpose. Congrats on the admittance that’s pretty cool. Make sure you focus on you and loving yourself the best you can. It’s not easy. Be kind to yourself

After a years long struggle to get on antidepressants and wait for them to balance out, I am finally starting to think that they are working and am starting to feel like myself again! While this is of course great, I still have a ways to go and something that I can't quite come to terms with how much I have to put into being happy. I'm just really bothered by how difficult it is to get/refill medication and deal with insurance companies, how costly it is to see a therapist AND a doctor to prescribe meds, and how much time all this shit takes! I know that it's important I keep up with this all and that in the long run these sacrifices are worth it but goddamn, is no one else irritated by this? I am literally pouring hundreds of dollars into achieving a baseline "happy" required to go about my daily life. Does anyone else think about this or is it just me, and how can I accept this unfairness and move on
It’s stupid, but that’s just life. We just gotta keep on pushing through
Yep. But the alternative is worse. So we have to deal with the cards we’ve been dealt. I could have had great holidays with the money I’ve spent on Psychiatrist appointments but I know if I didn’t see them, I’d have to deal with a regular GP who hasn’t got the time, knowledge or ability to prescribe the medication that I need.

I know that there are people doing worse than I am. I know that I have many things to be grateful. But I still feel so shitty most of the time. I feel embarrassed to even write this post because of the other posts I've read here. Some of them are just heart-breaking and they're hurting a lot more than I am, I think. It also makes me feel pathetic to be writing here because I should just do something about these problems and not whine. Gosh, I feel like such a weak person, really. I don't think I deserve the things I have. I have contributed nothing to this society, yet I have a fairly nice apartment, food, laptop, phone, soft bed, clear water, access to so many services and products online for free.  I am a uni student and I fucking hate uni. I love learning and reading about things, but uni is the most awful learning institution I've ever attended. I have multiple minors of which none really interests me. I despise my major, literature, it's so dry and the people are pretentious. I don't fucking care. I like reading but studying literature at uni is obnoxious. But this is my 4th year and I'm doing my master's degree so there's no reason to back down anymore. Despite everything, I get quite good grades but I remember nothing of what I've learned and I don't feel like I've accomplished anything. I don't feel I have any skills for anything.   People. Friends. Relationships. I am constantly recycling people. I talk to some for a while, then I become overwhelmed and ghost people. Then I start talking to new people until the cycle repeats itself. I am also in a relationship that is secure but I don't love the person. Yet I am too scared to leave.  Career. Honestly I have no idea. I'm 23 soon and my only work experience was a summer journalist four years ago. How pathetic is that? I sent applications during two summers but didn't get a summer job. Last year I was experiencing severe burnout. This year, I'm trying again. But a part of me doesn't even want to get a summer job because I have social anxiety, I'm really shy and I am not good at customer service, not to mention how easily I get stressed out in hectic situations. Yeah, it's really pathetic and I should just suck it up, which I'm trying. Today I had to record a video of myself for a job interview and although I did it, I already felt like my whole persona screamed at me how I'm definitely fit for the job.  Body. I'm not fat but I think I'm chubby. Oh god I hate my face and stomach so much. Yet I'm too lazy to exercise and I keep eating pasta day after a day. I have started to feel uglier again and I just want to hide myself from the world. On other days I feel I look better but it never lasts.  I really don't think there's no point in living although I'm not planning to kill myself. It's all just very meaningless and I don't feel I have anything to offer. Something I enjoy is drawing but I have no faith in myself. I've thought about streaming as well because while I'm shy, I enjoy talking. I'm just scared to be judged by other people. I'm so... I don't even know. I feel empty, yet I'm trying not to drown. Nowadays I procrastinate everything and I do my assignments at the last minute. I hate it. I hate myself and I think I'm a bad person.   I just don't want to be a pathetic loser but I sure as hell feel like one when I'm looking at how other people are getting jobs, having big dreams and getting further in life, while I'm just fighting against some shitty uni courses.   I don't know why I wrote down all this. My problems aren't unique. There're people doing worse than I am. I guess I just selfishly wanted to let these thoughts out. I'm always really trying to change things but I just end up in the same situation after a while. Damn. That's sad.   I really feel like a less worthy person compared to others.

I do not want to share my personal information but I have heard that on this site you can get rid of every thought that haunts you. I am a person who has been struggling with bad thoughts for a long time. Uh, hello.
Welcome! Yeah I've found that it's a lot better and more helpful community than most other social media platforms out there. You can share more information about your situation so people can help you more effectively, just don't give out the obvious things like your home address ya know.
Thank you, and yes if I think about talking about something like this on other social media, I feel like I'm going to be judged right away, eh, but with information I mean my age and gender.

I feel like my entire life the past couple months has been nonstop disappointing everyone around me. I drank way too much alcohol and they were concerned the first time but then I just kept doing it. I dont even enjoy alcohol and they're just getting progressively more and more mad at me. I bet they wish I could be different. I bet my parents fucking hate me because I cant just be a normal kid who does normal things goddamit.
Couple months is rookie numbers. If you get better and better soon you will be good to go and forgiven. Self destructive behavior the longer it is, the worse it is long term. Hope you figure it out homie, I am sure you are loved

I just want to die
What's up, bud? Did something happen, or was it more a slow slide to this position and feeling?
General feelings of failure built up over decades. I’m just a useless failure waste of space. I contribute almost nothing of real value to the world.   I owe theIRS a ton. I haven’t filed taxes in ages. I’m behind on so many tasks at work. My home is a disgusting pig sty. I’m fat and obese and like 60 lbs overweight.   I’m just an all around failure at life. I own nothing. I don’t have savings.   I’m just useless
Why do you feel like a failure? Is it because you specifically failed a lot, or more a general feeling? What was the longest time you worked at something before you felt like stopping? I gave up a lot of skills and hobbies during my suicidal depression years, and the disease was almost 100% to blame.  With the money, is bankruptcy an option? Or less extreme, installment plans to pay things off?
These are good questions.   I think in almost everything measurable in life I come up short. I fail at most things. Basic things.  Daily self care is a fail. Living like a civilized human being is a fail. Keeping up with my job is a fail. Taking care of my body and health and appearance is a fail. I’m a horrible father and pretty shitty son. I’m a mediocre employee. I’m just the worst
100% not being argumentative or saying anything about you personally, but with all those dark thoughts, I highly suspect it's something deep and embedded, and it's probably been there for a long time.  It took me years to realize the damage being raised by a Borderline, as well as being put through 4 parental divorces, did on my psyche. Not saying this is your case, just that these roots can be strongly hidden and striking from the shadows to twist your thinking hardcore, like it did for me for years.  If you can find and confront these roots yourself (I studied CBT and put myself through the therapy), or with pro help, I hope you can do it as soon as possible. Assuming I didn't get your case wrong, friend.
I have no trauma that I recall. Just a life time of failure to measure up.
Do you spend an unfortunate amount of time every day, hours a day, for years and years on end, entertaining and agreeing with thoughts of your own worthlessness or spitefulness, and/or fantasizing about death? Because that will do it, even without external or past trauma.  It's also perhaps related to the measure up part. If you compare yourself to the places others are, especially if it's an ever shifting pair of goalposts that changes day by day and comparison by comparison, you might be continuously unhappy with your position because you are defining yourself by what others do, especially if you switch from ideal other to ideal other.  How do you fare compared to yourself last year? Do you have a set of "victory conditions" that you can reach and feel like a success? Have you written these goals down and made plans to reach them?

My head is constantly filled will with upsetting or frustrating thoughts. I’m not allowed to have any moments by myself. Sadly I’m also very lonely and barley have any human interaction.  So to the internet I go. Where I see things that make me more upset and I get in pointless arguments about things that don’t matter.   But if I leave? The thoughts swell up against I’m feeling awful. I can’t be alone in my in head so I use the internet to fill the space, but then it fills it with such utter bullshit.   I try using other distractions. I take a walk with music, but then I get filled with upsetting thoughts and all I want to do is lay in bed and look at my phone. I come home feeling depressed. Video games+ music so far is the only thing that kind of works  Going to sleep is painful. The thoughts dont go away and if I don’t take medicine for it I’m fucked. I’ve gone several days without sleeping with turn me into a horrible person.  I’m not proud of myself. I’m a loner who spends all day on Reddit or playing video games. I’n real life I’m clingy and annoying. If this is going to be my life forever then....I can’t. I just can’t.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l00rwa/the_thought_of_my_mother_dying_is_eating_away_at/
I know death is inevitable. I know that the best thing I can do is to cherish the time I have with my mother. To make her feel loved and cared for. To listen to her stories. To hear about her day. To just be there for her. But everyday I cry myself to sleep thinking of her dying. It’s every single day. I cannot imagine my life without her. I cannot imagine her getting any older. I don’t know what to do about this sadness. I feel like these thoughts are impeding my functioning in an extremely unhealthy way. I will just be talking to my mom and she’ll see me start tearing up as she’s talking for almost no apparent reason. I’ll look at her cheeks, see the wrinkles forming, and the tears just well up. And I feel so bad just crying in front of her telling her I’m scared to lose her because I feel it only takes away from her happiness. I don’t know what to do but I’m really fighting over here. I just need some help, some perspective, anything to help me accept this morose reality.
Almost the same boat. I'm not as extreme with the emotions, but this thought lingers inside my mind at least once a day. Hugs.
I feel this exact way towards the thought of my mother dying. I wish I also had a way of coping with that.
I get this too. As morbid as this sounds, I plan what I’d say at her funeral, what songs I would play etc. And it’s just torture. I wish I could stop doing this to myself. It’s mostly about my mum but I also think about it for my dad, my grandparents, my boyfriend, my dog etc. You aren’t the only one don’t worry <3
Exactly same. I grew up only with my mom and have an extremely strong bond to her. Her dying and me being alone in existence would definitely knock me out mentally for a LONG time. I hate everything
The deepest virtual hug I can muster, I hope you find a way to cope..
I hope you find your way, I know it’s important we try.
Oh wow I’m so sorry to hear you’re experiencing this as well. I can’t let myself get to funeral planning because I just start having very dark thoughts, but I can’t definitely relate. What brings me some iota of comfort is the idea of seeing all the people she positively impacted, and that hopefully I will connect with these people in a way that will allow me to keep her alive through those new relationships.
:( I hope we come to find some level of peace on what is clearly a very difficult subject for us to handle. I just wrote in another reply that meeting those who she impacted will hopefully help me cope, at least I hope so.
That’s a comforting way of thinking of it :) I really hope you feel better about this sort of thing soon. I know I wasn’t much help in the advice department but I think it’s comforting to know we aren’t alone. Up until now I thought I was the only one who did this. Thank you for sharing :)
It’s the best I’ve got right now, but I agree, it’s nice to know other people are in the same boat. Thank you for understanding.

I‘ve been taking Vitamin D supplements for a couple of months now. When my mood improved, I never thought that it was because of these supplements — Until now, when I stopped taking them for like a week or so. I don‘t know if I have depression, I have never been diagnosed and never told anyone about it, but I‘ve been feeling really depressed for a year now. I remember being in a particulary bad place for 2 months or so, and then it got a little better. I don‘t remember if that happened when I started taking these supplements though. As already mentioned, I forgot to take them for a week. My mood incredibly worsened. I feel the way I felt back then in those two months. When I take these supplements, I still feel depressed, but I’m able to do things — schoolwork, cooking, etc. Right now I’m not able to do anything. Has anyone experienced this as well?

Months ago I decided to ctb through od but I was hospitalized and some of my friends who I consider close to me, know what happened. I was in a deep shitty hole before. Weeks after my discharge I am starting to do some things that can help me improve myself but then this month I noticed that it is getting bad, again. My eating habit is getting less healthier (I eat 1 meal or nothing a day), I get to sleep late at night and wake up early and sleep again or play some video games, isolating myself from people, just staying in bed all day, and just yknow some stuff that you'll def know right away that what's happening is not goo.The thing is, I am aware it is getting bad and I want to reach out to my friends but then I would think that "They might be busy doin something.", "I don't want to bother them.", "I'll just make them sad if I'll vent." I don't know anymore. I had breakdowns that they don't know because I can't ask for help from them and I don't know if I am just tired or is it kicking in again. I don't know. I feel numb and empty and the reason I had breakdowns because I wanted to feel something. I want to cry. I don't know.
>ctb through od  ?  Something about an overdose?
Are you getting out?   Are you getting sunshine *or* exercize?

When I was 15, everyone hated me. Literally everyone.   Kids at school were telling me to kill myself. That I was just a whore for getting with some guy. I couldn’t go a day without getting an unknown number telling me to just end my own life and that nobody likes me.  I had an ask fm and everyone told me to kill myself. That I was just a flat chested/flat assed bitch.  I was an anorexic twig.  Keep in mind, I’ve been a skinny girl my whole life with a super fast metabolism and this wasn’t close to being true. I ate a LOT!  I was cutting every. Single. Day. Many many times.  I started off doing it lightly.  My dad one day screamed at me “WHY DON’T YOU GO CUT YOUR LEG UP?” and then that’s when I progressed to getting really deep because I knew that even my own family didn’t care about me.    There was a time where I needed stitches and my mom sent me to this program I was going to anyway. I kept telling her I needed stitches.  The teacher at the program ended up seeing blood trickling down the outside of my leg and knew something wasn’t right. She was the one to send me to the ER. She forced my mom to come get me.    The cutting became a severe addiction. About a year after I had scarred very terribly, I got so scared that I stopped.  I hated the way my body looked. I couldn’t look down at it.  I seriously missed the old body I had when I was a child so flawless and beautiful.  I realized I was thin and perfect. Thats why everyone picked on me.  My parents told me getting plastic surgery, a scar revision was going to solve my problems.  The surgeon did a disastrous job.  He didn’t give me antibiotics and when they got severely infected, he PEELED OFF the scabs. He still didn’t give me antibiotics afterwards.     Fast forward to now, 7 years after the severe self harm, and terrible surgery I am very depressed.  I feel like I can’t live with myself seeing the hundreds of scars on my arms and thigh. I have two deep caved in holes where the surgeon let my leg get severely infected.  When I move my leg to the right, the bumpy scars turn into holes and it looks like the flesh is just gone.  I really need help. Or some type of remedy to remove the scars because seeing them every day makes me realize I’ll never forgive or love myself.  I can’t deal with the pain any longer. Please help.  I need kind words because I’m really giving up.
I used to cut myself up. I use my scars to remind myself of who I once was and how I’ve grown. You’re not the only one dealing with these kinds of problems. I’m glad you’re sharing your experience. I don’t know much about surgery or how many cuts you have on you, but I think you’re just fine. To have the courage to take all the hate you’ve received and have all the cuts you have now, I’m very proud of you. Not many people stay alive after cutting themselves. I can assure you that you will be fine. You reached out for help and that’s what matters. As corny as it sounds, it doesn’t matter how you look on the outside but who you are on the inside. I’m amazed by your courage and hope you get whatever help you’re searching for.
To be honest, that made me tear up. You’re so positive and very strong. It made me feel a lot better.  Thank u so much.

You can take a piece of shit and cover it in perfume. Make it smell better than a flower. But it's still a piece of shit. Sitting there might not stink the place up now. But perfume dosnt last forever. And I dont think the bottle has much left in it. Shit is there in the way waiting to be stepped on. Becoming a nuisance,   I have lived with this popping in and out of my head for years now. Along with other undesirable thoughts. I've been selfish enough to almost take my own life multiple times. I don't know any other way to see life. Circumstances. People. Existentialism. My future. My past. My now.  Please. Comment somthing. Anything.  Help.  Please.  I'm scared of what I might do.  And I have nobody I can ask  Thanks

It's currently 255 am, and I have to get up at 7 o'clock, and I can't get to sleep because I'm uncomfortable, and I want to be held.. Depression has been a number on me and the fact that I've been alone I am touch starved is killing me I just want somebody to wrap their arms around me and cuddle with me, I don't care if they leave once I'm asleep, I just want to be held man
I feel this a lot and ive found huging a big blanket or pillow helps me especialy if you can fall asleep during that. I think its worth a try and eventually you will find someone.
i know it sounds stupid but “hugging” yourself/wrapping your arms around your stomach can sometimes help with the touch starved feeling. i know it’s not the same but it really can help and i think it might be worth a shot. i’m sorry you’re feeling that way, i know how it feels.
It's not dumb at all!

I can only read so many stories of people just finally stepping out of their comfort zone and suddenly everything works out. I just don't click with anyone. Can't make fucking friends to save my life. I feel like a fucking loser. I can't even conceive in my head what it would even look like to make a friend anymore. I just don't have any confidence around people and I don't think I ever will. I'll never have a social circle and even though it sounds really petty and vein I'm probably also never going to get laid, or have a relationship for that matter. For the latter I just figured asking people out on dates was kind of how you get that going but apparently romance and sex are a much for vague social dance than I will ever be able to preform. And I can't get a date anyways so f*ck it. And besides that I'll never really have any friends because I'm not capable of really connecting with anyone.   I kind of thought the fact that I'm now eating on a strict budget and the painful delay of gratification that brings is depressing enough on a moment-to-moment basis,,  but my deep seated loneliness I will never be able to shake. I can only distract myself so long before I just throw in the damn towel with this fucking life. They say depression is a disease that kills people eventually. Well I can see my will to live slipping away im front of my own eyes.  Thanks for listening.

I've reached the point where I actually want to talk to people.  Something I never really considered before.  I don't know how and have tried in my own way, but...  I just don't know how to come out and be like "hey, I need someone to talk to about things", so I just message random casual friends just to have a conversation.  I feel like I'm bothering people.  I also don't want to tell people I need them.  I'm just feeling alone.  I have no more distractions left in my arsenal and I'm just sitting here thinking.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0f6ao/do_i_have_depression/
I wont take what reddit says for truth but it would be extreamly helpfull to get an outside veiw from a person. I know a doctor is the best option its just im younger and cant go on my own and dont want to bother/worry my parrents. Ive taken the self assesment on google and it says i have moderatly severe depression. The symptom i dont get is haveing problems staying focused. I feel like i maybe overeacting or i think i may have sorta a placebo effect. Anouther thing i dont know about is how long depressiong lasts for. For example i have the feelings of depression for only like an hour or so nearly everyday typicaly at night time. Here is an example of my hour of what maybe depression. Say im playing video games with my friends and i feel a transfer into this "depressive" state. I get of because i feel like im may cry or be unfun to play with or ruin their time. Then i may cry or be just sad or not doing things. It would be helpfull for me to hear someones point of veiw on this.
Yea I used to have those. Mine would happen like twice a week and could last as little as 1-3 hours. But as time goes on it gets worse. Just barely 2 years after realizing that I have depression now its just a constant feeling of hopelessness. It doesn't go away after a few hours anymore. My advice is to get help asap. Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you go to long without trying to get help you just might end up like me. Completely hopeless. Take advantage of the time you aren't feeling the depression. And just go to a doctor to seek help.
From what it sounds to me is that you are experiencing low self-esteem which causes a temporary depression. You need to act on this now if it’s the case. In my opinion, mindset it what inevitably changes the way you think you effect things. If you think, like you said, you will ruin their time then you have to reevaluate the situation. How are you going to ruin their time? Why is it important? Are they mentally unstable that ruining their time will have a negative effect on their health? And the most important question is ; how is this benefiting my own mental health? Asking yourself these questions will get you closer towards a sort of self-diagnosis...but never claim to have something you don’t know you have.   And to elaborate, depression is different for everyone. For me, it feels like no matter what I do, I feel that every single day is a part of an endless loop that swallows itself, as if I’m trapped in the never ending negative thoughts of my mind until the thought of ending my life brings utter serenity which is suddenly bulldozed by guilt, ruminations and a sense of never ending unbalance.
I’m no expert but it sounds to me like you might be. I may not have all the information but I’m sure in most cases your parents would definitely want you to go to them for help. I know when I have kids my main goal in life will be to do everything possible to keep them happy. You don’t have to feel bad for not wanting to carry the weight of depression all on your own, it is so much easier if you tell someone. And if it doesn’t end up being depression it will still be better to talk to someone about it because it will likely increase your bond with that person and make you feel better
Thank you for you expeirience. This helps a lot. Have you tried to go to the doctor because im not shure but i dont think it would be to late. Anyway thanks and i hope you get well too.
Ur definitely not too late. I've never tried going to a doctor and it just got worse over time. From what I understand just go to your normal doctor and tell them you think you may have depression and they will determine what to do from there. I'm not 100 percent how it goes because I've never attempted to get help. But I assume he will do a assessment to determine if you are depressed and then most likely refer you to someone who specializes in mental health

Today was the day I new was coming but didn't want to face it. I have been feeling so down and in the dumps lately. I have been finding no joy in anything, I have to be high all day to even get through the day, I called out of work for the second day in a row. I can't seem to get my brain out of this funk. I have dealt with my depression for 5 years now and I know how to still bring myself to do things I know I should do like shower, eat, clean, breath.   I live with my girlfriend and I told her I would take the Christmas tree down this weekend and I did that today. I made a really great and nutritious breakfast, wrote a few things, and even cleaned the kitchen. Im functioning but I'm not happy I feel like a robot. I can feel the constant lump of tears in my throat waiting and wanting to explode out of me. I can't seem to take my mind out of this empty state of sadness no matter what I try to do, I always zone out. I tried to watch some anime but I wasn't able to focus, tried to listen to some music still couldn't focus. I could only focus for so long on my writing until I got distracted.   I feel like I was so accomplished today, I scheduled everything out, and met all my goals for the day but still feel so incomplete. The way I am feeling right now is complete shit. I can feel the anger of why can't I just be happy festering inside my chest, I can feel the melancholic cloud over my head. I tried to take care of myself today, I took a shower, did a great face care routine, got into cozy clothes, made a great breakfast, smoked, but all I can focus on right now is when is it acceptable to start drinking or can I go to sleep right now and hope that my girlfriend doesn't bother me too much. I have done everything I know to do to help with my depression but none of it is working. Which I know, that's usually not how it goes. When I usually get into these funks I am usually able to pull myself out of it but this one seems to have me by my throat and isn't letting go.   I feel like the universe was trying to tell me this was coming in the following weeks to this weekend. I was so tired, no matter how much I slept I was always tired. I wasn't very hungry and my anxiety was so high. I got into arguments with my girlfriend over the smallest things. But I just kept going because what else am I to do.   I know that I will get through this but I just haven't felt this down in awhile and its starting to really consume everything I think, everything I do or don't do, and everything I decide to do. Its becoming debilitating and I am TIRED. I just want to sleep for 4 days. I feel like my head is stuck in this dark, stormy cloud and my ears are filled with static and my eyes are too heavy with exhaustion to keep them open. I can't think straight, like a constant tornado in my thoughts. Everything is so hard to accomplish right now.

Hi, this is my first post on reddit, I don't know if anyone will respond, but anyway, i ll tell you all my story, maybe it s gonna be an occasion for discussion. I was raised up in a middle class family, we didnt have any problems during my childhood, i already knew that there was something that wasn t going so well, but i wasn t completely conscious. I ve always had a shy charachter, closed and sensible, apparently aggressive, but i ve never had the courage for start a fight with anyone, except one time when i was 16. when I was a child i didn t have the same passions of people of my age, first, i didn t really like videogames, i played with them when i was i middle school, but i never fell in love with them, i wasn t intrested in the mainstream films or cartoons, i liked only documentaries. I lived feeling like the interests of others where banal. Ok, this can seem even original and alternative, of course i was, but i had also very obscure sides in my charachter. I struggled all my life, since the maternal school, with inferiority complex due to the fact that i was a bit fat, and some made fun of that, i ve never been very fat, but i was on that way, thanks to my mother who bringed me to the dietologist i ve nevee become obese. I ve always been very short, but this wasn t an issue during childhood. So, i was shy, complexed, sad, introvert during maternal and elementary school. In the middle school i was cast into a world that seemed more the world of adults, but with the behavioural scheme of a child, although i lost the innocence of a child. Middle school was a nightmare to me, i was ridicoulized with no reason by others, also by certain females, there was a group of people that had several offensive nicknames, and we made fun of each other, but i was the one with most nicknames (the bullies didnt have nicknames). The consequence of this period was that i had to make continues effort to rationalize such a brutality, and make it not to distract me to my student s tasks. Anyway, i faced the situation and when i was in 3rd grade of middle school i was feeling very changed, although i knew that those years will have haunted me for years. So i didn t develope any interest and my joy of living consisted in hoping that in high school i would have a better dealing with my schoolmates. In all this i had only one friend, who was in my class in middle school. In high school i was cast in an avironment that was the opposite, because it was a school in the center of my city, but the shith with different smell still smells like shit. Anyway, here again i isolated myself, i didn t manage to socialize, only in 3rd grade i started socializing, in 4th grade i punched a classmate because he was making fun of me because i m short (i m 1,55m, or 5' 1''). Plus, the amount of study was very big, and i didn t get out from that school only because of pride, i could admit that i wasn t able to deal with that amount of work, while my classmates were. The truth is that i was slow in study because my mind was full of complexes, obsessive thoughts and imaginative sceneries, that my mind produced to cope with the harsh reality. Those thoughts were not only due to emargination but also to sexual fustration, infact, my 0 social status, my embarassing height and my neglected look didn t attract any girl, only one time appened, when i was 16, but we never had a true relationship because i was always studying and because she used guys to fill her lacks of  affection. I also had a strange phenomenon, in which i losed completely the sexual desire, although still being eterosexual. Anyway, the high school was so hard, that i didn t think well about wich carrier was the most suitable for me; i thought to knew it, i wanted to be a politician, because i was always interested in social issues, so i decided to attend the faculty of law, but i abandoned after three months because i discovered that i had no interest in studying law. In the period up to the beginning of the new academic year, i thought which had to be my faculty, initially i thought philosophy, because i like reflecting about things and deep questions etc... but at the end i choosed political sciences because I wanted to know the mechanisms of the society, it seemed to me more concrete. Now i m in the 3rd year, and i can t say that i dont like it, but in three years i always felt like it didn t belonged to me, although they are very interesting things, that made me politically mature me...it s very strange. Now i m 22 1/2 and i d like to finish but this sense of unbelonging haunts me. I swing constantly between the thoght of remaining in my faculty and the thought of leaving. I cant say what is the best for me because i don t know what i like because i never experienced thinking freely, because my mind was full of negative thoughts. Fighting with complexes ruined me so deeply that my mind feels tired every time, if i read, thing that i like a lot, i can t concentrate because of intrusive thoughts, if i try to apply to some hobby i can t enjoy that, moreover i can t find time fore hobbies because i m slow in studying. In my country exists a master s degree that would allow me to teach philosophy in high school, but the consciousness of not have applied in the philosophy field  and the inhability even to know if it is my field, make me feel desperate, the complexes for silly things in teenage years have affected my early adult life. Do not forget to live a pleasant adolescence. Sorry for the wall of text, thanks to anyone who will read all this. Although i have a family who doesn t judge me and very good friends, i have the need to know that i am not such an isolate case.
Everyone has unique creative and destructive energies. You need to focus on your positive traits and try to turn your destructive impulses into something beautiful. Have you heard of Nietzsche? Also trying to reach out to people is a positive step - it helps find the beauty in yourself.

I hate my friends, family, and my life even. During middle school, I was bullied until mental breakdowns each day for 2 years, and do you know what my family and my consulers said "suck it up", or some shit like that. And after middle school, my family didn't have the guts to call a therapist, even when i was showing signs of depression and suicidal thoughts. I am in 11th grade and I am being affected by mental problems because of the bullying. I hate my friends because all of them betrayed me and when false accusations of me being a "fascist", a "racist", etc came from my bullies. All my "friends" told me to fuck off and kill myself. They even told my secrets to everyone. Do you know what its like to have everyone in your life betray you?   I have depression, mood swings, anger issues, dark thoughts like murder, suicidal thoughts, paranoid, etc.    Right fucking now, I have a "family" that thinks every thing wrong with me is video games fault. Video games were the only reason why I didn't end myself. It helped me feel important during a lot of dark parts of my life.
I(26m) damn near thought I was reading some of my own story here. I'm not going to lie to you and say it'll get better, I will say that you'll get better at dealing with it though.   My best best advice I can offer you is to try not to live a life that will make you "happy", but rather strive for a life of meaning. Ignore those around you who'd belittle your pain and treat their words like a foreign language you don't understand. Find something that will give you the drive to live, and dont make that thing a person! Persue meaning and one day you'll find that your happy more than you use to be even if its for a few moments a day or a week, and once you're there you wont hate life but just be annoyed by it.
I know what it's like to be betrayed.
I've had homicidal thoughts towards close ones in rage before - I know what it's like. Sounds like you're in a really tough situation but just remember that everyone has unique unrealised traits and creative energies in their unconscious. Find them and find a sense of purpose.
I feel you. I’m in the similar situation. I’m suffering from childfood traumas, but my family think I’m just lazy.
Let me guess, you had different political opinions than your "friends" so they harrassed you?  Teens get really horrible sometimes, I'm sorry that you went through that
i hate love...i hate you...i hate me
I don't know how to help, except to say that I understand.  When I was in school, I was bullied most of the time.  No one put a stop to it.  I was even punished sometimes, despite being the victim.  I have had anxiety and depression since I was young and, despite obvious symptoms, no one helped me.  They just blamed me for the symptoms and punished me.  Pretty much everyone has betrayed me and I'd never trust anyone now anyway.  And many times I've been told to get over traumatic things.  I've been suicidal for years too and the reason I'm still around is mostly because I'm not impulsive and that I'm a bloody coward (fear of pain, not death).
I’m in 11th too bro.  I can’t even get past homework without getting extremely mad or considering suicide because I feel so stupid.  I am also insanely insecure about how I look.  I have 5 exams coming up that aren’t even part of school curriculum. I am dead before I actually die lolz
I was bullied my self in school by a heap of guys . school didn't do much till I got other victims to note everything he  did  and got him expelled , another guy I almost broke his arm and had him beg for mercy. I am not the violent type . I told him give me a reason why I shouldn't  why should I show u mercy when u never showed me or the others mercy .he couldn't give me a reason. I dropped him. I started walking away. he asks me why I showed him mercy . I looked at him and told him . I aint you . bullying that we go through is just horrific . I am sorry u have been bullied  Also   "suck it up" isn't advice . I am sorry you don't have the support does your school have a school councilor.  ? Also but those who call u friend  and spill your secrets are they really friends . also video games isn't the issue . it's something that helps many with depression .  it can also be an addiction .
This is good advice. Could you please give an example for meaning in one's life? Does it mean working for a cause?
hey, your not stupid I think everyone goes through stress with those exam's a girl in year 11 when I went to school had a huge break I don't know if she even finished school  . but honestly take it easy . take a breather if your stressing  and come back
I can’t man. I have SAT subject tests, ACT, AP Exams, school, and then soon finals  The worst part is this is all cramped into 2 months.  I want to fucking die.

Hello, firstly I’m 21y old and dealing with depressions for around 3 years now. After I had a big downphase like 3 weeks ago I took holiday from my current job for 3 weeks. The first week was pretty ok I did some stuff also made Sport somedays and felt overall good. Then in week 2 I somehow sit down too much and also slept to much and from 10 hours a day it gets more and more and I almost slept my whole holiday, lastly on Saturday I was 20 hours per day in my bed and felt just shitty and useless. Yesterday on Monday I had to work again but couldn’t get up from bed and felt overall exhausted and also couldn’t motivate myself to go to work or either do something else. My mum was very upset that I’m again just sleeping all day and couldn’t get up for work (she was really pissed slammed the door and yelled at me) She told me that I have to do atleast a few hours of work at home like cleaning my room and get some wood from the garage in the house for the oven.  So yesterday I did for around 1 hour some wood work and sit down afterwards because I felt exhausted again  My mind was working as always very hard and negative thoughts and bad feelings came up again and I was just overall frustrated about everything. But especially I was angry at myself because I’m still at this point and can’t get out of this shitty depression   At this moment I remembered a scene from Naruto where he failed something and afterwards he took his kunai knife an slammed it in his hand and sweared that he will never let himself down again and this wound should remember him.  I don’t know why but I tried so many things but selfdemolish (if that makes sense) was never a thing in my live (once I smashed a tree with my fists because a similar moment, but that was the only thing)  So i grabbed my survival knife and ye did like a little ritual and told myself that I would swear by my blood that I will never give up again. So I cut myself made some thoughts etc etc. and I felt better after that the pain was kinda hard. I bandaged myself after that and overall had now somehow a motivation. Everytime I had a negative thought or I want sleep or I can’t do this type of thoughts I just moved my hand and felt the pain again and remembered that I can’t give up!  The thing now is that I can stop my mind from surrendering but my body feels still powerless and exhausted. I’m currently for 4 hours at work and I’m completely done and I wished I would be able to go home now.  Also a thing is that in 2 weeks are my final exams from my apprenticeship so I need the practice to succeed in this exam but I can’t concentrate really and ye I don’t know how I should get this all :/
You need to find your unique creative energies and leave your destructive energies behind. Everyone has unique unrealised traits and feelings in their unconscious - you just need to find them. But it's hard when you're depressed.
My mum is also a very spiritual Person  She gives me literally every day tips on everything also with that energy part  But as you said it’s hard to find your inner power  when your depressed
Yeah, it's a long complicated process learning to have to right perspective. I could recommend reading Carl Jung's Man and His Symbols. Carl Jung was a great psychiatrist. The book is about symbols in dreams and culture, and their psychological significance. It also tells you the meaning of life which is the process of individuation and lots of other psychological facts.
I will check it out thanks

You're no bother that's what the internet is for. I can relate to what you're saying. I got through very similar issues.

Wall of text incoming.  So I went to college trying to be like everyone else. My co-op experience was truly awful. Now that I'm working full time I can see how awful the situation my supervisor put me into was. He created a hellhole for me where I couldn't succeed at all, and every step I tried to take was ridiculed. My coworkers treated me like the plague and gradually I didn't feel alright anymore. The great thing about it all? He won. There's nothing I can do to erase what happened anymore. At the tender age of 28 I'm officially screwed. This happened to me 5 years ago, and there's no way to actually fix this situation.  When I went back to the same college that had screwed me harder than anyone ever had things weren't okay at all anymore. Those 6 months led me to become "cut off from the tribe" and I was lonelier than I've ever felt in my entire life. Everything hurt, and hurt in a way that cut me down to my very soul. You know what the fucking great thing is? When I went back I got rejected for so many co-op opportunities at my school that I started to give up. I had no real friends, and since that point I wouldn't even consider asking a girl out. I was dying on the inside, and it was long before I began to fail/withdraw from classes because I didn't feel like a human anymore. I was just a zombie walking around.  You know what my dumbass did? I went to my "student counseling center" to try to seek help. All I wanted was for there to be some sort of path for me to feel "normal" again. When society rejects you and makes you feel horrible you'll do anything to try to feel okay again. I went a year and a half trying antidepressants & therapy and none of it helped. None of it helped me feel any better. You know what the fantastic part of all of this? In spite of that now I have medical records of depression. I weaned myself off Effexor years ago but the medical records still exist. I just wanted someone to talk to...anyone. If I knew then what I know now, I would have never tried at all.  Do you know what awaited me when I graduated and got my useless degree? I got rejected from multiple jobs. It was horrible being rejected for jobs I was overqualified for. I ultimately ended up working at a small bank, something that didn't even fit my personality at all. I got fired from that job for telling a joke (not kidding either), which I guess you can chalk up to me being socially inept if you were looking for somewhere to park blame. I'm not exactly seeking sympathy here. Afterward, I got the privilege of driving 50 miles a day to another job that treated me like dirt. After 6 months of that I finally got a decent post grad gig. I tried to reintegrate into society using this job, but honestly these past few weeks have been harsh. The past trauma I've experienced is awful enough; I'll never be okay again.  To make matters even better, I come from absolutely nothing. I took out more than 100K of student loans to attend an institution which very nearly made me commit suicide & my credit card debt at points would have made Dave Ramsey have a heart attack. I literally paid to get tortured by people who hated the very idea that I could even exist. I didn't even attend my own fucking college graduation because I was hurting so much. The emotional pain I've endured in my 20s is so bad that it's left permanent scars that will never, ever go away.  Even though I stayed stable through the pandemic & continued to work it's not the same. I got back into the same bastard institution for grad school and even with a free ride & an excellent job I'm miserable. I paid off the credit cards and am making headway on my student loans, but it doesn't fucking matter anyway. I'm so far behind other people socially now that all I can do is think about what made me this way in the first place. I get to be the moronic weirdo living with his parents at 28 since I have to save every dollar I can to pay back the loan sharks. I can't even join the military or do something to change my circumstances because my dumbass decided to seek "help". You know how wonderful it is to hear that even though this happened years ago that the slightest medical record makes me ineligible to even join the military? It fucking makes me feel awful.  I guess the real reason I'm writing this is that I just wanted someone to know that I existed. In spite of everything, I just wanted someone to know that I was a person just like you. I wanted friends & to build a life of some sort just like everyone else. Knowing I will never have that no matter how much effort I put forth is fantastic. My 28 years on this planet was (and will continue to be) just a series of failures.  I'm done.  Edit: not suicidal. Just acknowledging the obvious at this point. The things I want aren't achieveable; not now, not in the past, and certainly not in the future.
I'm sorry for all this but I just don't really understand what happened because your post is a little vague. You mention bad co-op experiences, loneliness, and bullying but why did this happen? Like, your supervisor and coworkers have no reason to treat you in this way. Such things don't really happen in universities unless you really make an effort to display bad character. I'm not trying to bash on you OP, just trying to understand what you're going through.
I'm 22 I feel the same way dude I barely leave home and because I'm depressed I get attached to people that give me some kind of attention and I get hurt because the just play with me because I'm weak and not very social anymore. I changed countrys at 13 I never went to a "friend's" house. This destroyed me but last year I went to my first party I went to a friend's house but that doesn't even makes me feel any good or better. I don't have a gf, I don't have a job, I barely have friends, I didn't even got my degree in university, cause I felt so alone so excluded that I stopped going to classes, I shaved my head cause I was losing hair and looking for some attention, I started having digestive problems do to stress and no one even noticed not even my parents. I was scared to go eat alone so I would only go the morning or the afternoon so I could go eat home. I still have scars from this. You're not alone in this and there's always a way out we just have to find it (or at least I hope so)
> I guess the real reason I'm writing this is that I just wanted someone  to know that I existed. In spite of everything, I just wanted someone to  know that I was a person just like you.

Life may not have been kind to us, but at least here, people understand.  Thanks for sharing your story.
Society as it is,  the media, the average mindset. Its not showing struggle & suffering. Smile for the cameras and laugh it off. But look at the back of the tapestry the stiches look neat on the front but on the back theres all types of shortcuts, messyness parts where you almost didnt make the stich. That is the realness of life that if you look into the lives of people who got ahead and got somewhere. They refused to give up.
I got botched last year so my life literally destroyed back then. I'm just a zombie atm.
If I lived in your country, I would be happy to be your friend. You wouldn't be sad anymore.

The thing is, in that case I didn't. If I was going around doing something I shouldn't have been doing that'd be one thing (and in retrospect, I didn't). I made every attempt to be successful and make connections at that job. I was excluded from everything; there was no conceivable way for me to even attempt to be successful at that position.  Now that I've climbed out of that hole years later, the damage it did was so severe that it ensured I won't recover. I can't even do the things I want to do at this point (i.e. military, etc.) because I've got it in the back of my head that I have a medical document out there somewhere that I tried to use Effexor for a year to make me feel better. To make things even better, if I told someone that they would fail classes, be turned down from every internship, and then have to take out a 60k+ private loan to finish college I'd find it even crazier if they didn't try antidepressants.   I'm screwed, there's no way around it. I have debt, I'm a 28 year old virgin because after my glorious college co-op I can't open up to anyone.  I'm being honest that if I was evaluating my life I'm pretty much a failure. No amount of effort from me can change that.
A glorified internship.

I've never felt so small. I feel like I go to the ends of the Earth for people that I care about and claimed they care about me is well. However, whenever I need reciprocated energy or a boost, no one is available or cares enough.  It's as if I allow people to use me in exchange for even just a little bit of love.  I honestly feel like it would take weeks for someone to realise that I was missing. Sometimes I want to go MIA for weeks just to see who would notice. We truly accept the love we think we deserve.
If I can give you a rude shot of my thoughs as I experienced the same feel. It may take some times but it'll grow you stronger, your first step is to stop those thoughs in your brain, they are useless and you can freely live without. Count on yourself on do not stop helping your friends, you're as it and if you act only to expect something back it'll only be disappointing.

Words cannot describe how scared I am for this... I also know there is unlikely to ever be a followup. I expect to be diagnosed and then abandoned by them, because around here there aren't psychiatrists you can stay with, even if we desperately need it. I just hope it's worth it...I feel I need to be honest, but that scares me a lot... What if I jeapordize myself? What if I compromise my future? Or my pending surgery approval? Or my freedom itself? What if I can't get what I need? What if it doesn't work out...  &#x200B;  ...So many what ifs, and only 1 awful unknown outcome... but I need this. I admit it. Hard to expect the worst and hope for the best, when you don't have hope... I've felt trapped for so long, what positive outcome could be...I hope I'm not ruining my life worse... Wish me luck.
good luck boo, we're all rooting for you and that you get the help you deserve 😊
You should write it down. Write down questions you have and concerns. Help organize your thoughts but also bring it with you. It’ll force you to ask them and talk

So recently my wife and I took a huge leap and moved 4 hours away from our home town, moved in with some friends who were generous enough to let us get on our feet and apartment search.   Well these friends didn't realize how much of an avid gamer I was. My wife has always known and has always been pretty fine with it despite not being a gamer herself. Gaming was there for me growing up when nobody else was. It is my happy place and my hobby. Not that it goes yo the extreme or anything,  I would just rather play games than watch TV, which is absolutely bizarre to our friends.  The reason I bring this all up is because they look down on me so hard for enjoying them as much as I do. They find any reason to blame these things on us not finding an apartment. Last week alone I did about 20 hours total of apartment searching. The area is extremely difficult to find renting options became  they're either too expensive, for 55 or older of age, or allow no pets. (Which we have 2 dogs.).  So where am I heading with this? I'll cut to tonight. I have felt like absolute garbage all day. I have a disorder with my thyroid that acts up some days.. I didn't do any searching. I called a few apartments to find out they were either busy or close on Mondays. Okay, no big deal. I'll call tomorrow when I feel better anyway. I think to myself, I have enough sick time at work to get paid, I'll call in and rest.  Ha. 20 minutes after my shift would have started my wife comes down stairs. Asks "so you're really not going to work?". They were all upstairs talking about I haven't done a single thing help aid in this search. How I have no priorities and would rather stay home and play video games like a child than go to work (which I hadn't touched a single game all day at this point. I was asleep mostly.)  And now my wife and I are on bad terms because I feel like these people who I thought were good friends are slowly brainwashing her. Keep in mind I don't say a word to them about their hobbies. Which include watching Disney movies religiously. I sweep? "He hasn't done anything in weeks". I clean dishes? "He hasn't done anything in weeks" hell I walk their dogs when nobody is home in the afternoon‽ "he hasn't done anything in weeks ".  I'm sick of feeling insignificant.  I'm sick of feeling like my wife is a totally different person. I'm sick of anything I do at all is like I'm invisible.  Nothing goes noticed. That is until I put a controller in my hand. Tomorrow I'm going out for about 4 or so hours to search again. Let's see what happens? Ha I already know. I literally feel like if I disappear everyone would benefit from it. Does this mean I'll do anything to that extent? No. I love life to much to leave it. I just feel this way.  Did this have a point? I don't know. But I got it out somewhere.  And I guess that counts for something.

I've been feeling like this for a while but this year it got worse. I don't enjoy anything i used to do. I don't enjoy talking to my friends, games, drawing as much as before. The only thing i like is watching some series. I don't even have a goal in life. I don't care how good or successful i am. I am not always like this. There are times i feel happy but it's so rare. I feel like this %80 of the time. I don't know what i should do. Sometimes i think about ending all of this but i am scared and more importantly i have a family and i don't want them to suffer.
ah that's what depression does, it sucks out all the happiness like some black hole 🤧 what tv shows do you watch? i'm proud of you tho, for still being here
I’m in the same boat. Been struggling like this for the past 9 years about. Seeking professional help can help. But at the end of the day it’s all up to you and what you truly want. If you give in to what’s engulfing you, or fight for your life back.
I remember feeling like this. Everyone has unique creative energies in their unconscious waiting to be found. Search deep.

Well I'm going through a lot right now . My mind and body feel like someone hooked it to a electrical box while simultaneously running ice water on it.  I can hear my heartbeat and my hands are shaking. Food has no taste and I don't even have the craving for alcohol.   All I am doing is just replaying these last months and being bombarded with how utterly fucked up I am and how I ruined my life and how it ended up with me here on the streets again.   It really feels like the end of the line and at 26 it feels worse because everyone is getting their shit together I am just floating.. But not anymore.  I always get the energy to be better when I have chose and I hate it because I am so aware that if I wasn't in this situation I would lazy as a cat.

Created this account just for this post.  I was wondering if you stop feeling feelings as you get older? Or if feelings and passions deminish over time?   I'm 35 now and I think the last time I kinda felt something was when I was around 30 and the last time I felt passionate and excited about anything was probably mid-20s.  I've gone to concerts with family/friends and they were left absolutely amazed and excited.  But though liking the performance I honestly felt nothing; feeling wise.  It was more of an appreciation of talent thing.  And that made me wonder if that's what they are expressing or if they are moved and i am not.  I don't feel anything anymore.  Not really. It's like my soul has departed and all that's left is my body with it's memories running on autopilot.  Now all I feel is nothing ... just nothing... I don't even think emptiness is a good description, it's just, non existence of feeling. On the rare occasions I have felt it was usually the bad feelings: deep, unfathomable saddness, or anger.  I still do things, still keep myself occupied, still talk to friends. I still laugh at jokes, but it's more of a face than anything. Or an understanding of what's funny and an auto pilot mode, or an appreciation of a good joke I guess, but without the happy but it gives.   ... I really want to know if this is just part of growing older or that I'm broken? ...  Mostly I can live as I am. I mean it's not bad pursay, it's just nothing. I can live with that.   But there is one thing I miss and want back. I was very creative. It was a bit of cheesy cliche creativeness but it was the one thing that I loved. It drove me. It was an obsession that I wished I wasted more time on now, because that love and drive is now long gone.  I was writing a story (I still am but the motivator that drove me is gone and it's now just an action to pass time rather than my every waking hour obsession) ... I actually spent more time drawing and sketching and world building than I did writing. I'd start writing and get super excited and than start drawing. I had bits and pieces everywhere with little scrap drawings and notes. From characters to scenes to lore to props to cities. Everything. A lot got dumped and things changed but it thrilled me. When I was supposed to be studying at uni I was sketching my characters instead. I couldn't wait to get home to work on it more (I also loved uni and other things but they were my secondary interests)  I worked hard to build this world and to write my first book (badly mind you but it's still an achievement) ... But then ... I don't know... somewhere along the track I noticed that I wasn't drawing every moment I could. I wasn't thinking endlessly about my story every waking hour. I wasn't having conversations with my characters in my head like I used to in the middle of the night or while on my walks. My heart wasn't in it now, my heart wasn't anywhere now.   I'm still writing my story but it's more methodical rather than the exciting passion that drove me. I still draw pictures from time to time but it's purely for visual purpose rather than the passionate excitement to visualise things. I'm still moving forwards but it's like from the memory of it being the most important and awe inspiring and fulfilling thing I was doing rather than actually being those things.  I want that back.  Can I get it back? And how?

I've been so down for months now and have little to no interest in anything that usually I would enjoy. I don't really know if it's because I don't see myself going anywhere in life or what, I just can't find my happy place. Yet all of this I don't know if I've just been sad for a while and I'm just telling myself I'm depressed or if I actually need help. I've tried talking to a few close people, but they didn't seem to understand the level of what I was telling them, so I just gave up. I'm not sure why I'm posting this in the first place, maybe I just want to know if I should seek help or not, or if I'll get over it.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0htkf/is_this_a_symptom_of_major_depression_could_it_be/
Hello. I was diagnosed with major depression in 2017. I could explain many details about what happened to me in the past, the medication and therapy I already tried, but I'll be brief and just explain this symptom:  I am constantly triggered, so I'll remember of certain horrible events that happened to me in the past, the ones I absolutely cannot change. Some of them are sad, and make me feel the worst person in the world. However, in other situations, I'll remember of things that make me absolutely angry, pissed off. "That person who betrayed my confidence must die in my eyes", etc. So I will just keep torturing myself mentally, screwing up my sleep (which is already screwed up), feeling worse and not doing the stuff I was supposed to. This has been happening almost daily.  Does any of you feel the same?  Is this a symptom of major depression?  Could it most probably be inclined to bipolar disorder instead?  That's what I would like to ask for now. Thanks.

Hello everybody,   So recently my parents have announced that they will be getting a divorce. I knew this day would come and was expecting it, but right now everything seems so surreal.    I’ve been studying to apply for my MA non stop since the beginning of august, each and every day, barely had any days off,  I study for 15-16 hours a day, but three days ago I just broke down crying and I haven’t stopped since. I was exhausted, for the past couple of weeks I barely ate and sleep 4 hours a day. I can’t go and see my therapist because my last depressive episode was two years ago and I haven’t talked with her since.    I want to have a proper day off, like not the kind where I sit and play videogames all day, but something that is helpful in this kind of situation.    I desperately want to leave my home, go somewhere I’ve never been and stay there as long as possible.    I’m scared, I don’t want to give up and let depression consume me once again, so I’m trying to prevent it as much as possible.   How do you think is the best way to take time off and just let your brain and body rest for just a bit? I’m absolutely clueless, the things that come to my mind that used to help me seem like the worst idea ever and I don’t know what to do.

It feels like the only place free of judgment or pain. Just moving to the swell of a wave. Head falling back.  I started imagining these neutral headspaces about a year ago.  Does anyone else do this when things get to be too much?
I kinda do this, but not when I'm having a crying breakdown, just nornal feeling down times. I either imagine floating on water, or being submerged and watching bubbles rise. I dont imagine the feeling of water tho, just the weightless sensation and a lack of noise
Are you dissociating?
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0drpl/is_being_unconditionally_kind_even_worth_it/
So in order to have a more positive outlook on life I’ve been trying to respond to any jerks I encounter with kindness and understanding. I was told growing up that the best way to respond with rudeness is with kindness but I never really tried it until recently, because my view of the world has gotten really shitty and I feel like maybe if I go out of my way to be nice even when I wanna be a jerk then it’ll help me have a more positive mindset. Plus, indulging in my anger in the past almost always made me feel worse   The only problem is that I’m starting to feel like unconditional kindness doesn’t really do jack shit... and it’s been kinda discouraging because I thought it could really help some people.   Tonight was the night I basically realized that so far, being nice hasn’t done Jack shit and probably won’t in the future. I had [this interaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l0289h/whats_your_wildest_whew_that_was_close_moment/gjs2suc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) tonight with an internet troll and I got really excited because I saw it as an opportunity to maybe help them see why it’s so much better to be kind instead, but as you can see I got absolutely nowhere. I think that was my breaking point because so far, every interaction where I’ve tried to help people see there’s no point to being a dick hasn’t done anything, and usually they just double down on their insults. But those were all in-person interactions. I thought the ONE place where it would be easier would be online, where I’ve got plenty of time to think of a way to respond that’s convicting but still kind and doesn’t resort to insults.   It’s discouraging to see how many people will put genuine effort into being dickheads just because they can, and it makes me sad to realize that there’s probably nothing I can do to change it. What’s even worse is they likely don’t even realize how much damage it’s doing to their psyche. Or to the damage of someone else’s!! I mean seriously, do these people never think about all the possibilities that come with this? What if the person on the other end of the screen is a young person struggling with self-esteem? What if it’s someone in the midst of a depressive or suicidal episode that’s trying to scroll through their phone to distract themselves from it and is *barely* holding it together, but when they get degraded by some douche who’s being rude for kicks, it sends them over the edge and they kill themselves? Fuck man, there are *human beings* on the other side of the screen.   I essentially just have to learn to stop caring about it I suppose, but it really makes me sad to see people act like that when I know that it’s because deep down, they’re just really unhappy and they’re trying to feel better by spreading that same feeling to others.
Treat everyone with kindness, and if they’re mean back you ignore them. You can also be very kind to people you care about. Just make sure you’re not hurt in the process.   I think it’s worth it to try and like everyone.
Life’s strange man. The people with the happy out looks really have to look at the dark stuff that nobody else sees. They hide the dark stuff from people. Sometimes, you really need it the other way around. Sometimes you need somebody else telling you that everything will be alright.
[deleted]
Yeah you’re absolutely right, I just don’t wanna cross over the line into kissing everyone’s ass that’s rude to me ya know
Yeah, you’ve definitely got a point. It’s kinda just the way it goes I suppose
I’ll admit some of my frustration leaked into it, but I really was trying to be chill about it.   Deep down, what I wanted to say was something along the lines of “fuck you, you stupid troll” but obviously that wouldn’t help either party  I figured if I had any chance of actually getting this dude to have a change of heart, I’d have to be nice but still call him out on being a dick ya know? Not in a rude way, but in a way that’s still convicting. Otherwise I’m just kissing his ass.   I mean let’s be real... lots of people who actually put time and effort into trying to hurt other people in any way have something else going on that’s hurting them and they need somewhere to let it out. And I thought maybe just saying “Yo, I know you’re not really mad at me because this is a stupid-ass thing to get mad about. What’s *actually* going on? I hope you’re alright.” could actually have an impact you know? I mean obviously I was horribly wrong but that’s just what my thought process was going into it
Yeah, don’t do that. I learned a lesson yesterday. I can’t help people that are really mean. It just hurts me in the process. I did so much for someone, and they’re beyond crazy, beyond heartless. I should’ve given up on them a long time ago and help people who aren’t like that. Life isn’t like an anime. I shouldn’t be trying to save everyone like that.

Damnit I can feel my depression worsening and I was looking for a way to perhaps try and receive counseling or medications so I found out about K Health and decided to give it a try but I guess I answered the questions too honestly (I'm such an idiot fuck if only I could go back in time 2 hours) and they said that they only treated mild to severe cases... Does anyone know of any alternatives that are similarly priced(they advertised $19/month)? I don't have much in savings and the only way I can get around at the moment is through Uber/Lyft so an online method of treatment/visits is the only way I can really manage. My parents are the only people keeping me afloat while I'm away at college and if they find out I'm depressed they'll disown me so I can't get help through there so dammit, please help I don't know what to do anymore

I just needed to vent. I have a lot of pent-up emotion and idk where else to turn to. Hopefully letting it out will help me sleep   I dread waking up everyday. I feel like a pest to everyone in my life. I hate my physical appearance and even when people tell me they think I’m pretty or have a good figure, it all feels like a lie to make me feel better.  Sometimes I feel like if I fell off the face or the planet, nothing would change. Nobody would notice and people would move on with their lives. I have a loving boyfriend and family, who I love a lot, but that’s it.  I never had many friends growing up. But especially after making zero friends in college and my best friend of 8 years ghosting me for no apparent reason, idk if I’ll ever find a group of friends who value me. It’s funny bc I always wanted friends. I used to dream about being popular and people wanting to talk to me. And I try to put myself out there and reach out to others. I usually get a response or two then radio silence. I never realized how badly rejection hurts until I got rejected platonically.   I developed epilepsy this past year and was hospitalized twice because of it. And discovered I have thyroid problems. I’m only 22, so it’s hard to feel like I’m deteriorating so young. I just feel like a bill (one night in the hospital plus an ambulance ride is around $13k out of pocket for us Americans) and a stressor for my family.   I feel bad for my boyfriend. He witnessed me having my most recent seizure and I think it traumatized him. He’s been anxious, stressed, and on-edge since. I tell him to see a therapist but idk if he’s looked into it. Even if he does see a therapist, it makes me feel horrible/guilty knowing something I did (even unconsciously) affected him so poorly. I’m scared he’s going to break up with me because I’m such a stressor, but I guess I wouldn’t blame him.   I work a 8-5 full-time job as a copywriter and I hate it. I used to love writing and got an English degree but now I hate it more than anything. It drained me of my life and any joy I had. I dread going to sleep and waking up every morning because it just means I have to work. And then be criticized by my boss and editors. Maybe I’m a giant baby but it still hurts.  Honestly, my life hasn’t changed much in quarantine. I never had friends to hang out with or do anything with. I always just woke up, did nothing all day (until I got a job), slept, and repeat. I feel like I’m wasting away. I wish I wasn’t born.   I have goals and I have dreams, but they feel unattainable. I simply don’t matter. I’m not suicidal, but I can’t keep going on like this.

I’m 26 years old and still live off of my parents.  &#x200B;  I have been very spoiled all my life, and when moved out, I had free rein over myself and my money, I let loose and lost control of my money, and to an extension, my self.   &#x200B;  I do not come from a super well off family despite being able to afford an education abroad. My parents worked very hard and save a lot of money for me to go and study abroad. They have since stopped working and have no proper income while I have been taking my time with my bachelor degree. Although I had a part time job, I spent most of what I earned without saving. I enjoyed myself while abroad without thinking much about the consequences.  &#x200B;  I always thought I would be ok, which was a lie I told myself, which I fully believed. Obviously, it is now not ok and has never been ok.   &#x200B;  I recognize how fortunate I am, and how lucky I am to be where I am. But I’m still  afraid that I will never be able to change. Despite knowing that there are many issues that I have, I never seem to be motivated to make any change.   &#x200B;  Everything that’s happened to me happened due to my reckless decisions. That I know and accept. But I am afraid it is not enough for me to change.  &#x200B;  I’m still in school, and its my last semester of my bachelor degree that has taken me 6 years to complete. I don’t know if I am ready to become an adult.   &#x200B;  I don’t even know what I want from this but I know its not sympathy for I’ve received plenty. I do want to change. I just dont know if I can
Small change. It’s easy to overwhelm yourself and try to bite off more than you can chew. This leads to failure and giving up. So start small.   I don’t know your life but here’s an example. Do these in order/ 1. Make sure grades are ok 2. Start doing some more things around the house.  3. Apply for jobs 4. Start a routine like running or some other hobby  No one is ready to become an adult. You’ve for time. Just keep slowly adding to it.

I really don’t know why I feel like this and I just want to slip away into the darkness and never be seen again. I have a loving family, a warm home, two cute pets and anything else I would really need because my mum (it’s just us two, nothing sad, he just “went to get milk”. (It’s actually a *lot* more complicated but he’s not worth it)) always puts me first. She’s been quite ill recently (not COVID) and I don’t want to pile more pressure on her especially as she’s 15 years older than most of the other parents. I know it isn’t because of lockdown and having to be indoors, because I’ve been feeling like this for about two years now. Getting to this point was inevitable anyway, but the worry of coronavirus probably sped it up.   After reading everything I’ve just written, I feel like I’ve read someone else’s post because I’ve never talked about this, and if you told me a couple of years ago that I would have just written that. I’d would’ve told you that you had the wrong person. I used to be so happy. And every smile now, is more of a grimace to hide the pain behind my eyes. I don’t like being like this, but I can’t help it. Every time I start to feel a *tiny* little bit better, something else will just come along and punch me right in the stomach and make me revert to my depressed state. There’s no way for me to speak to, online or face-to-face, a therapist/counsellor. We don’t have the money for that. Also, my mum has probably got anxiety with all the different types of worries and pressures she has to face, so adding any more on at all really wouldn’t help.
where are you from? if you don't mind me asking, because i'm from england and counsellors and therapists are free through mental health organisations like PAUSE and FORWARD THINKING  also i think it's important to remember that depression doesn't always have a cause, it's not your fault, it's mostly due to an imbalance of chemicals in your brain. it's not your fault, depression isn't a choice. i hope you'll keep yourself safe and you'll be okay. if you want to talk, i'd be happy to.

I always get depressed when I disappoint others, or hurt them (intentionally or unintentionally) in any kind of way. It could be a lifelong best friend or a stranger I met 3 days ago. I guess it's a sign of another mental illness/issue but nonetheless, how should I deal with it? My self esteem drops significantly, I feel like a burden and a punishment to the world, I isolate myself and have desctructive and suicidal thoughts. I can't feel joy, I only feel emptiness and hatred towards myself.  It's been an ongoing cycle for most of my life, and I want to know if you have any tips on dealing with it because I don't want to do anything bad that could disappoint or upset my family.. thanks in advance
I have the same issue that disappointing others is a much bigger deal than disappointing myself. What I do is use it to my advantage. I use that to actually motivate myself to get shit done. That assignment that needs to get done ans only affects me, I’m skipping it. But if Jojo needs it, I’m going to get it done.   Also, talking to the people you disappointed. Usually I haven’t to the degree I thought, and even when I have the apology goes a long way.

Long story short I started taking Xanax aback in july and wound up getting a dui. I stopped after that for little bit but I’ve been abusing it off and on since September. I just bought some tonight I just wonder if I take them all if I’ll die. Like I really want to and I know that’s awful. When I’m not on them I just feel like I’m worthless and not myself. And the anxiety kills me. I was in the process of trying anti depressants but my doctor passed away of COVID last week and I just don’t know to do. Any advice would be so great full.
I don’t think taking all those pills would be healthy. I think you just need to wait for the next person to tell you what to do and how to cope. I know you don’t want to wait but it’s better than dying, I promise. Keep your hopes strong. I’m counting on you responding tomorrow.

I have a friend who only really puts in effort to talk to me when im clearly upset. If im feeling good and ask him about his day hes short with his responses and doesnt really want to converse. I can tell he only replies to be polite and that he doesnt actually want to talk. My family is the same way, nobody cares about talking to me until i mention feeling lonely or something. I dont share my happiness with anyone because of this...when i smile or laugh, im the only one there. Its nice that they care when im upset...but i want to laugh with my friends not just cry... its a very lonely feeling...he's my only friend too, so i was straight forward with him about how i felt, but since ive talked to him about it he still carries on the same as before...

She broke down while I was on the phone with her. She told me that somedays "I feel so bad. It's so painful."  She tried painting, waking up early, exercising, yoga, maintaining a clean environment but she still cant keep the 'darkness' away because it always comes back and it gets bad.  She has asked me not to tell this to her roommates. What should I do?
Don't try to relate with her feelings dont condescend her feelings by comparing them with people who have it worse it wont help. Just be by her side and let her know that she can tell you whatever she is feeling without dismissing a single point.
yeah support her and don't tell anyone else if she doesn't want you to  its really hard to tell people so let her know you have her back
I am doing that but she is losing hope. She has tried everything she could but still no result. She is quite frustrated by this.
Its normal but she has to try things she has not done before get out of the routine she is in and slowly slowly things will improve and im not talking about drastic improvement or extreme happiness im talking about appreciating the little things in life the small moments we collect throughout our life because life is not like the movies from start to finish with a smile its about living through difficult moments and keeping the small ones that made us happy
I will convey that to her

I was never happy. I was often abused as a child verbally and physically, by parents and schoolmates alike.  Finally I moved to the capital city for university at the age of 19 (I live in middle-eastern Europe) so I could be away from my family. I hated my uni course, I suffered a lot due to failed or problematic relationships but I felt somewhat free. However, my health started deteriorating, severe hormonal issues (I am a woman, and it affected me in the worst ways like excess body hair), constant fatigue and chronic hair loss, anemia, mood swings, frequent infections...I completed my masters degree at the age of 27, by that time my hair was almost completely gray. Now I know I should have quit university but I was still under the influence of my toxic parents and I am also very persistent and a perfectionist, I have very high expectations of myself.  Then one day my father called that his boss wanted me to work with them, in my hometown. I accepted the offer as it was very difficult to get a job with my degree (my then boyfriend still can't find a job after 3 years). I cried for a week.  My maternal grandparents had been saving money since I was in high school to help me buy an apartment when I finished university. After my grandfather became ill and then died my grandmother fell into depression and got super obsessive about this apartment buying business. Said things like it was her only life goal now to help me get my own home. Which is really nice, yes, but she was clearly pressuring me and my parents.   I did not want to get an apartment in my hometown, I wanted to move back to the capital city, I had problems with workplace integration and conflicts with colleagues.  I felt really exhausted and empty, as the financial and political situation in my country got so bad it was then completely impossible for us to buy an apartment in the capital city.  So I said yes to my grandmother. I got my apartment, while becoming moderately indebted. It was just all the same to me by then. I did not feel anything.   I am now almost 30, locked in this sad imitation of a life, no friends, no fun, nothing. I don't want a relationship as they all end with disaster. I hate myself, I have so many physical/emotional flaws no one could be with me anyway. In november I decided to change my lifestyle, work out and eat healthy, but that also ended with a disaster (I was never overweight but I have a really disproportionate pear shaped body). My body with its f-ed up hormones could not handle the workouts. I also developed binge eating disorder (uncontrolled eating) and gained 3kgs.  I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to disappear. Nothing I do ever ends good.

I'm objectively ugly, and while I've accepted that and have worked hard on my life and am very proud of my accomplishments I still can't shake the depression and sadness from being ugly.  The general comments, never receiving complements, zero luck dating in...any way shape or form, get passed up for allot, kind of get ingored etc   I have a good physique, I guess, but I'm very flat chested. My face is not fantastic, by any stretch of the imagination. Excessive surgery is financially not viable. It just kind of sucks and as much as I work hard and I'm proud of myself, the depression and general sadness never really goes away.  I'm 30 this year and I just feel kind of horrible.

Hi, I'm a \[14M\] teenager. I am asking for your help because I'm a bit confused. whenever I say that I don't want to do this or this is not good for me I always end up doing that shit. And my parents always make me feel like what I'm doing is always wrong even though I'm not. Now, I know what this sounds like that I'm just a teenager and this happens to everyone. But this is different like I can differ from a feeling that I get when I'm really aggressive and angry to this feeling.For example,A couple of days ago when I was there helping my mom and whenever I did something she didn't like or wasn't 'her way' she would start shouting at me and if I talk in my defence she would like not to talk to me and sometimes when she tells it to my dad he beats me up.And I am kind of an introvert and I don't really talk to people. So, I don't have anyone to share anything with.  Anything that I do now just feels that I'm wrong. At this point I even start get thoughts of killing myself or runing away but I so scared of doing anything.Please, tell me that this will get better because whenever I think it is I just Gets worse.Thanks to anyone who helped.
Do you have any family members besides your parents that you could reach out to for emotional and physical help?
No, I only have four people that I live with, and due to lockdown, this has gotten worse.

I occasionally have this sort of feeling (like right now) wherein I start feeling very low and insecure about myself. It's like a sad wave of sorrow crosses into me randomly. And the weird thing is I can't find the reason for this, it just happens involuntarily.  Anybody have this feels too? What do you do?
yup, I listen to deathconciousness
Yes, but sometimes I also experience the opposite, where I suddenly feel very thankful for everything and am completely saddisfied with every aspect of my life. I don't know where it comes from or what triggers it.
Yeah, happens all the time. I just assume it's some weird hormonal thing.
Have a nice life dude!

I'm so angry and disappointed by people, I can't shake the anger. Every hour of every day is spent in rumination of what was done to me and the awful pressure that was put on me. My life has been spoiled by others.  I can't bring myself to focus on anything for more than 5 minutes without spiraling
I’m in the same boat... I grew up hanging around the wrong people that groomed me to be an angry/violent person though...I got away many years ago. But i can still feel that anger...when I get really tired or my depression starts to pick up, like it started to a couple weeks ago, I shut down. I distance myself and just try not to talk to anyone in fear of messing my life up. I have a decent job and trying to work on school again. I fear I’m just messing up my life every day. But i know if I reach out no one would understand. I can’t talk to my peers or boss. My work ethic has been declining and I just feel like I’m letting my team down and I don’t know how to fix it. I know it’ll pass. But how much damage will be done by them? What if I can’t pull myself up again? What if I do lash out...
Exactly my thoughts
It’s a struggle and just exhausting suppressing everything. I don’t even have energy to watch shows at night...I tried to play some games yesterday to distract myself or have a little fun and just couldn’t do it...
I'd rather be dead
See I use to think that, but I know I want to live. Just can’t find the energy or motivation

All my friends always do drugs, I don't. Today we had a classroom for ourselves and they smoked weed. I got contact high and now I feel like giving up. I barely have the energy to type this. I'm just feeling like I've fucked my brain up, that I never should've gone to school this morning, and just depressed. What should i do? I feel like I just wasted my brain's development
Weed is one of the least harmful drugs you could do. You just got a bit high from second hand smoke, think of it like a second hand coffee buzz.
Whatever amount of THC you passively smoked, I guarantee you its less than Elon Musk smoked, and he is considered pretty smart, so don't worry ;)

Sometimes i wish i could see what would happen if i wasnt here, what my loved ones would say. Who would care, if they'd cry.. im so tired all the time, its so hard to enjoy anything at all. All i want is to know im loved and that people care, but it seems like no one tells eachother these things anymore. Growing up my parents never really said i love you, me & my siblings didnt either. Now its so uncommon it makes them uncomfortable. I just want to be told im loved and that i matter but in detail so i feel it from somebody significant in my life. Does anyone understand?
I think it is important to find comfort in someone maybe you need a partner or to move away from your family and find people who you know care about you or maybe even therapy but it’s just my word I’m not an expert I’m just a 12 year old kid
I'm positive I've been an ass for so long to everyone around me that they might rejoice when I'm in the grave.
You bring up a good point, good wisdom for your age. I do have a boyfriend though, words of affirmation don't come easily to him i dont think.
Maybe tell him how you feel. Idk if you’ve done this already but I’ll mention it just in case

i am pathetic, i am just a failure who can't get anything thought through. i lied myself into thinking i was "different" and "special". truth is, i'm different in the worst way. i planned everything, i know i'm doing everyone a favor.  i hate myself so fucking much, i hate the thought that i have to wake up tomorrow and go through all this pain again. i have been alive for 16 years, and somehow i have 0 friends, even my siblings don't care about me. and honestly i don't blame anyone, i'm just unbearable idiot. i am sick of the walls staring at me for the entire day, while i don't even have any motivation to at least take a walk. all i can do is cry like the stupid scum i am. i can't even think about any positive experience in my miserable life. the only times i sought friendship with people around me were times i made a joke of myself. no one even cared when i was bullied almost to my death, no one even pretends to care, and no one will.   if people are determined to just shun me away like that, i have accepted it long ago. i know i have too few days left in my life, i will spare everyone the burden that is me. i just wish I had someone to say goodbye to.    i never asked to be born.
No, do not talk to yourself like that. You're not the things you say to yourself, you are not those things. You need to keep moving forwards, because you owe it to yourself. You owe it to yourself to get through this.  You are clearly suffering, im not here to diagnose you but it's obvious something is wrong. You need to rethink yourself, what is important to you? What interests you, what do you hate? When you know who you are you can improve, but do not ever give up.

Hi all. My wife has been struggling with depression and anxiety for a few years now, and we've had some incredibly dark times, the worst being when I had to talk her out of committing suicide over the phone while I was in a different country with work a few years ago.   I won't give you all the grisly details of how bad it's been over the last 6 years or so but emotionally, I'm exhausted and it's taking its toll both physically and mentally on me. I feel so selfish talking about my own feelings when she's in such a bad way but I can't see any end to it, and we've tried so many things. Without divulging our whole life to you but I'm her entire support network and having to be relentlessly positive, even when I'm feeling this bad is getting harder by the day.  I don't even know what I'm asking for here or if I'm just trying to let off steam but I really don't know where this ends. This is absolutely dominating both of our lives. I'm starting to have some pretty bad thoughts myself and the last few years have my life just seem to be a joyless blur. Do people really fully get over their depression? Hers only seems to have gotten worse. I'm starting to feel resentful now and I don't want that. I guess any chat or advice would help.  Thanks.
My small recommendation is to make sure you are practicing self care for yourself too. Whatever that means for you. Make sure to have time for yourself, which will allow you to be better prepared to help your spouse. It might even be helpful to have your own therapist, or join your spouse in couples therapy. Thank you from all of us struggling with depression. It must mean the world to your wife for you to support her.
I know you probably love her, that’s why you’ve gone down this road for so long. I’m not here to tell you what to do, but I can give some advice. Being around people who are seriously depressed has a deadline before you become seriously depressed too. In high school most of my friends were depressed on some level, and it got to me as I spent a lot of my energy thinking about depression and why they were sad, and before I knew it I was right there with them. Depression is a bitch, and it may never leave for good, but if you give your all, it can become manageable and sometimes be rid of for good. I don’t know your wife, and maybe she has been trying really hard, but if you feel your putting more effort into the situation than she is, she is nothing more than a parasite, as harsh as that sounds. Feeding off your mental energy, slowly cracking away at it is selfish of her and she’s an adult too, she should be able to be good on her own, and at her best when she’s with you, that’s what a healthy relationship looks like.   It’s unbelievably hard I’m sure, but you have to think about what’s best for you. If you feel the love strongly enough, maybe stick it out and see where it lands, but if your questioning it, do not ignore that, listen to your heart and your head and make the right decision. I made the decision as hard as it was, to slowly cut off the people who were only furthering my dark thoughts, even though they were the ones who were closest. It hurt like a bitch and I still talk to them here and then, but making new friends who were mentally healthy and learning how to be with people who are mentally healthy was quite the learning curve, it was extremely hard, and I wanted to go back to my old friends because I knew they’d always be there. I’m still not completely healthy, but much better than where I was when surrounded my self with that dark energy. The dark side is easier then the light, that’s why many of us end up there. No one has to stay there is my belief though, at least not entirely. Be firm with your wife, tell her it’s taken a toll on you and you need something to change. She might fight you or tell you that it’s out of her control, but that’s not your problem.   Ask her if having you in her life is worth fighting for, and get a real answer. Having one person as your entire support system is too much to ask of someone, even if they love you and you love them. For some of us unfortunately, it doesn’t get better, as we don’t live in a perfect world. Years is a long time man, and 6 years is enough time for someone to (at the MINIMUM) show improvement. Life is short, spend it in ways that will give you fulfillment and happiness. Imagine wasting another 6 years trying to get someone else to see their life the way you do, only to realize you never got to live your life because of it. There’s lots of people out there who aren’t in that dark place, and with your current situation, it might just be time to end things. Good god, I’m amazed you’ve stuck it out this long, I could never and I admire you greatly for that. We only have so much to give, make sure you don’t spread yourself too thin. Sorry this was a whole essay, I can just see that your struggling and it resonated a lot with me because I remember the feeling of being someone’s entire support system, it’s happened in relationships and friendships, and it just doesn’t work a lot of the time. Best of luck to you and your wife as well, I’m sure she is lovely when she is in a better place.
As a person who has mental health issues that affect my own personal relationship and are right now.   Look after yourself. Get some therapy, leave if you have to. You do not need to give your life and enjoyment to a situation that is dragging you down and has been for years.  Bad mental health is selfish and will drag down others with it. You need to be firm, and you need to stand up for yourself. She is her own person and needs to to a certain extent deal with her own problems. She should already be seeing a therapist, as I said above you both should be. I assume she's on medication? And taking it -_- so many people I know who desperately need the medication either don't take it or take it erratically.  I know you've tried lots of stuff and I preaching to the choir. But you leaving may be the kick she needs to get herself together. When she realises the only person who can save herself, is herself. And if she does commit suicide, and she does succeed? That is really sad, and very hard for you to come to terms with. But it is not your fault, and not your responsibility.   A healthy relationship is two trees standing tall next to each other. They can lean on eachother sometimes but it cannot become unbalanced or the trees become warped and unstable, unable to exist without the other. That's how a relationship was explained to me when I was in a bad place and it made me very aware of how my actions affect my partner. And how you need to both look after yourselves in a relationship.  It sounds like you really love her and I am sorry you are in such an awful situation.
You need to find your unique creative energies and traits. Everyone has unique unrealised things in their unconscious. In depression some of them are hidden.
Nobody is helped if you make your wife's depression your own  It's not selfish to care about your own mental stability  One shouldn't expect to cure other people's mental problems. This puts pressure on oneself and leads to even more stress. Nobody can 'fix' a broken person, one can only try to create a more pleasurable environment
I don’t have any advice but I’ve had clinical depression for years. It’s a bitch and I’m sure it’s hard to deal with.  My ex wife couldn’t but she is also an alcoholic and prescription med abuser. She used to tell me to go kill myself quite often.  I finally got away from her and doing better but depression does not go away. I take my meds and smoke weed and try to get through each day.   I have found meditation to be helpful.  I wish you and your wife the best. Remember, it’s not her fault.
Wow. I don't have words. That must be so hard just sounds dumb. I wish I had some helpful insight but I don't.  All I can say is my heart truly truly goes out to you.❤️❤️❤️
Relationships need to be two-way. You cannot keep giving and giving. Until when? Until nothing is left of you? It is unfortunate, but it seems your wife can only take and take. Even if she may not intend to or want to, that is the consequence for you. For the sake of your own health, please think about what's best for you. Also, if your wife is thrown into the deep end, she may learn to truly swim for herself.
Your wife is mentally ill.  You are on the path to mental illness.  You can't save your wife, i do not mean to be rude just honest. It doesn't seem like she is getting better.  You can save one life here though. Your future life.  Leave her. Or you will end up depressed like her, her support network will crumble, she will kill herself. You are already repressing emotions. You will then feel guilty and already depressed for years at that point, off yourself too.  I know this will get down voted. But its a splash of cold water in the face.  Give your wife a deadline mentally. If she is not getting better and shows no signs of wanting to or being able to, its time. Im sorry and i wish you the best possible life and to your wife also.

Short, not so uplifting story: I dated a beautiful, intelligent, crazy woman for three years, and to say that I was in love was an understatement. This woman had everything; gorgeous curly brown hair framing a delicate face with plump, delicious lips, a brilliant scientific mind with passions to pursue a career in medicine, and most importantly an entirely unique outlook on the world that she never wavered from. She burned with a fire that I had never experienced before, and her bubbly personality quickly dismantled my self-enforced isolation. She was amazing. And I was convinced that I was going to marry this woman. But life never really turns up where you want it to. I found myself being berated for being the human being that I am.   A very, very sad one.  Life hasn’t been particularly cruel to me, and I have no crushing backstory to solidify a reasoning for this gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach. It’s just always been there. As long as I can remember it has.   Anyway, after three years, this woman had enough. Told me to pack up my things and hit the road. Being a college student, and not living so far from home, I was not cast upon the street and had a decent fallback.   I withered in my sadness for what seemed like centuries. A far worse panging in my stomach had taken hold, and as the weeks went on it showed no sign of letting up. The therapist that I was speaking too didn’t understand a damn thing I said. A parrot squawking the same things to patients all day. Incredibly important details slipping from her mind and repeating the same things week after week made things even worse.  And then I got a phone call.  She missed me. And she wanted to see me. About a month and a half had passed and I had asked her if anything had transpired between her and other guys during our breakup. She told me that she hadn’t. I went back up to school for a week and we only left the bed for the essentials. I found out she had slept with two guys during our break, and left feeling like my balls had been pulled over my head.   I know we weren’t together. I wouldn’t have cared had she just told me the truth. Honesty was always an obstacle for her, and I think this time it cost us the relationship that I dreamed of making into a family.   And as for the title of this post, one thing that really helps me out during this bullshit I’m dealing with is writing. I’m going to try and post stories and creative ideas on a whole bunch of different subreddits. Anything to find pleasure in a world full of deception. Find your pleasure. It truly makes life worth living.

Hi there. I’m new to this group..  Yesterday I had a really hard day. I was restless/uneasy the whole day, not knowing why. I simply just call it an “uneasy seizure” where I pull on my hair, pick my skin, go in fetal position, rock back and forth, hit myself etc. I’ve had this a couple of times the past months. It’s different from anxiety though.. I wasn’t able to sleep, and began crying hysterically, with thoughts about killing myself. I cried because I saw (in my mind) my boyfriend seeing me dead. I sort of planned out to write a long text explaining why I killed myself, writing letters to my friends and then cut my wrists in the shower so that it wouldn’t be hard to clean up. It really scared me, you know? I don’t want to have these suicidal thoughts. They are killing me. But I don’t want to kill myself.  I have a boyfriend whom I’m living with, we’re engaged, I have a nice family in-law, and a sister who depends on me, and I really adore my friends. I’m soon done with my education, and might even have a job after graduating.  My life is perfect, but my mind isn’t.  I had a traumatizing childhood with psychological abuse from my narcissistic mother, and my father is in jail for killing a child when I was 2 years old. I don’t have contact with him. Any advice? I’m on antidepressants, and I recently just started talking to a psychologist.
Find that one thing that sucks you out of your life and ignites a passion in you. It can be literally anything! Food, good wine, reading, singing, skiing, or literally anything else can pump the brakes on depressive thoughts as long as it’s a truly enjoyable activity for you. Go out and do something fun tomorrow!
I’m really passionate about drawing and singing. I try to do it sometimes, but I end up losing motivation or interest. I love food, but as I’m trying to lose weight, I only have 1300 cal per day. I don’t have any restrictions though. If I want pizza, I can eat it, but I’m more aware of the calories in it, so instead of eating a whole pizza by myself, I’ll take two slices. I’m trying to overcome many parts of my life, and overeating is one of them. I’m currently down 1,4 kg in almost two weeks now :) I don’t have any energy to workout, but I take a walk now and then..

Today was my 2nd anniversary with my girlfriend, it’s been hard for us to see each other due to the fact that I had Covid in December and the lockdown or whatever ever you want to call it. So I thought regardless of the limitations we both have I can the make the best of it! Unfortunately, her family just wouldn’t let us have our own time. It made me so angry and frustrated because I just wanted her time. I can feel myself cracking mentally, there’s more bad then good days and with school going on(I’m taking 7 classes) my mental health is going to be every where. I’ve been strong for 20 years but man today sucked. I’m losing my will to live and to keep going on. I want to give up so bad. I can’t run anymore because my lungs are damaged. I can’t do out because it’s too dangerous rn. I can’t see the love of my life because I don’t want to get her sick, I hate life. I hate it so much. Why can’t I get a damn break from once? I’m kind, charitable, selfless, and always there when people need it but I’m always getting the short end of the stick. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

I don’t really want to do anything anymore. I would like to think that I’m fairly intelligent and skilled at many things such as makeup,reading,providing etc,however I generally feel that I have nothing to live for. I want to not feel or think. In everything I do I am alone with my thoughts everyday is the same. The people I live with drain me. I see them everyday. I just want to escape this town and these people. I would often think of living on my own and taking the train to work and then coming back to my own place in a state of peace that I rarely feel. I am not interested in knowing anyone at all beyond a surface level. I do not enjoy talking and I don’t have much to say. I am not as interesting as I think I am. I am better than no one. I am simply a shell walking amongst social creatures. I’ve been walking alone for nearly all my life. Nobody truly knows me because I do not know myself. In my dreams I die only to wake up and suffer in a dying world.

Pretext: I know this isn't particularly good writing, but this is just me venting my emotions in my own exhausted way. I just wanted to get it out of me.  &#x200B;  I listened to the funeral march as I died  and I cried those notes  Given a ripe apple by God  I let it rot  now must the worms devour it  my torch passes through the dim ground  carried by crows at night  the day has ended.  Why were we given the sense of inescapable nothing?  the deprivation inspires pain  and pain inspires deprivation  as the nothing isolates itself  morning has rose with sleeping lights.  Exactly as everything lives it will die  with no purpose  scattered  propagating  cycles continue  motivation stabbed  fingers following the mind  but the mind is nothing and has nothing  like the apple  it was all a cruel trick;  it was always nothing.

Recently had my boss try getting me fired. They kept me locked in the office all week while they investigated and found I did nothing wrong. I was a wreck all week. And I’m still on edge because I feel targeted. I feel like they’ve had a grudge against me for a while now over a separate issue that I was involved in but I had no control over. I had to do what I had to do. I had one of my subordinates come to me about complaints about another supervisor, which happened to be my boss. He wanted to go to hr and I am obligated to give him information. Well I was called down to hr for an interview about the interactions with those two and I had to tell them what I was told. Ever since then I feel like I’ve been targeted and just non stop been yelled at about everything. Even issues that I had an explanation for and were out of my control. When I first started here I know I made mistakes and effed around a lot but I have done a lot of growing up and am trying to get them to see that but I feel as if it just isn’t going anywhere. I do what to do anymore. I feel like a failure. Like I’m fucking worthless and I’ve been thinking more and more about milking myself and that call to the darkness just keeps getting louder.

might sound dramatic.. i just really can’t stop thinking what the point is. i have had crippling anxiety and depression for the past 4 months, been feeling generally hopeless for the better part of a year. my ex just ended our relationship. i loved him so much. our apartment was the first place i felt at home in years. now i don’t feel like i belong anywhere. it doesn’t feel natural. i have no friends. no hobbies. no real goals. what’s the point? i’m suffering everyday. i don’t have a real, genuine connection with one person in my life. it’s getting harder to find reasons to hang on. i don’t want to do it anymore.
I also feel like I can’t handle life. I feel like I wasn’t cut out for the perils and troubles I need to overcome. I have no motivation and no direction. Shits tough. Hopefully one day we can say we are glad we made it
i would say the exact same. i have no healthy coping mechanisms and all i really have is myself. i’ve struggled with my mental health long before this, but the breakup with my S/O has really ruined me lately. i hope the same for us, too.

I basically have no support system other than my husband. I try to let him know what's going on with me, what's got me down at any given moment (if it's particularly bad).  I think I have a tendency to do that in unhealthy ways sometimes. When I try to sit him down and lay it out, I don't think I get my words quite right. Sometimes it comes out in passive aggressive ways. Basically when I'm really at my lowest, he tends to avoid interacting with me. It hurts, but I don't blame him.  He may have SAD - he gets into a depressive state in the winter months (but hasn't sought a diagnosis or therapy so idk), so I would think he can relate to these feelings on some level.  But he deals with them differently.  The last time it happened, he didn't really talk to me. Things were awkward and I could tell he wasn't doing well. My natural inclination was to check in with him. His was to pretend nothing was happening.  I felt emotionally disconnected from him so tried to explain that (poorly), he got upset and told me angrily that he had been depressed. I didn't know that at the time because he wouldn't tell me despite my asking. It drove me further into my own spiral.    Basically we deal with our own (and each other's) emotional issues differently. And for me it is painful. He does not check in on me when he knows I am down.  So when it gets particularly dark, I try to take the initiative to just open up to him.  The last time I tried to open up, it was about how I basically lost all my friends during my last bout.  We relocated and I am trying to form new connections, but it is difficult for many reasons.  He also knows about my traumatic past with my family. So at the moment, I only have him.  At one point during the conversation he said he doesn't want me to feel like I need to seek emotional support from others. At another point he told me he thinks that I enjoy being miserable.  I don't know what to do with that.   I felt like I was getting better for a while, and now I am at a point of stasis. I feel paralyzed in this, and I cannot open up to him. The original issues I tried to open up about don't even bother me as much as what he said, and where we are now.  Sorry for the wall of text. I hope this all made sense. Any advice appreciated.
It must be hard not being understood by the only person you trust with this. You sound quite open with your feelings which is healthy. I'd say you need to find your unique unrealised traits and things in your unconscious and accept all of your feelings - beautiful or ugly; but they all have beauty. Idk how you can get your husband to understand.
Thank you. Would you mind elaborating a bit on what you mean by unique unrealised traits, and how to find them? What's interesting is that this is partially precipitated by me coming out of what I now realize was a years-long depressive state.  I have learned a couple new things about myself. I have also become more emotionally open, but that part doesn't seem to be going so well.  I feel like a yo-yo. I can feel myself pulling out of it but this kinda keeps sucking me back in.   I feel like I've lost so much time. I wish I realised some things much sooner. I think I could have led a more fulfilling life. My twenties were basically a dub.  I am 31 and now I am faced with pressure to build a family. I would like to, but I am not ready until I know I have fully seen my way out of this, until I feel fulfilled in my own right and have a healthy support system. He wants children years ago. I feel I have wasted so much time. I know that I'm young, but this is all making me feel like my life has already passed me by and now it's time to focus on bringing new lives into the world. It is an extremely uncomfortable feeling.
It's kinda hard to explain. Just search deep for unique feelings and thoughts. I know how it feels when feel like you've wasted your time. Connect with people. Maybe you could find a new way to connect with your husband.

Out of my 4 brothers, I’m the shortest and the second ugliest, I’ve got no friends and they are all popular. I pull no girls and I bet my 7th grade brother could get more then me, he’s literally taller then me and I’m 20.  I was thinking today how little I’ve done and how if I ever want to do stuff I’m always going to have to do it by myself since I have nobody else
Looking at your pics  And I’m straight btw, I feel like you are a pretty good looking guy. You are pretty symmetrical to me and you also got a smooth face   If you really feel ugly, work out. The dude’s at the gym are so fugging nice.
25F and I don’t think you’re ugly at all, rather good looking actually.  I don’t know what’s up with that poll result, unless there’s some mysterious standards to rate people’s appearance that I was not aware of, which the whole earth would be average and ugly at that rate lmao Also 5’10 isn’t that short, be more confident in yourself.
Haha four brothers that's beautiful. Hope you can get your confidence.
How, I’m 5’10 and 20 years old. My brother is in 7th grade and is 5’11  They are all football players and I have nothing going for me at all
Ask your parents tell them your concerns.
I’ve tried to tell my mother and she just says “you aren’t ugly” it’ll never matter anyways I can’t change out I look
Keep asking her for direction and just follow it. Please bro. Don't let the brain direct you.

I feel like my sanity is slipping past the point of no return.  Those people who end up in psych wards for doing crazy stuff like cutting their own ear off, I get it now.  I don't know what to do but I feel like my grasp in reality is coming to an end and no one will ever quite understand what I mean when I say that.  Maybe I'm just extremely lonely on top of depression, but I never thought my mind could ever get as fucked as it is now.

Same here. I've always had depression and last year my girlfriend dumped me, I developed some kind of dependency and since that day I got so worse. Also the pandemic f*cked up everything.
I don't know if there's anything we can do besides just try to live a normal life and hope it goes away.

How old were you when you started saying “I wish I had never been born” to your parents, or was that just myself and the kids growing up in my house?
Hmmm... gotta say about 5 years old?   The only solid proof I have though, is my random journal scribbling from my diary (age 7) where I just repeatedly wrote “I want to drop dead” along with an illustration of me yelling at my parents.   ....kind of disturbing, now that I think about it.
I started wishing I was an inanimate object (a tree to be specific) when I was younger than 4.  I started wishing that I would wake up a completely different person in a hospital bed waking from a deep coma around 8.  I've only ever shared this with my wife. When I was a child, my mom told me how much she wanted to die. When was there time to share?

Watched emotional moments on YouTube today so I could cry, and although it felt a little nice to cry I still couldn't get a good cry out afterwards when I thought about all the things that aren't going right. I just wish things could go back to the way they were. People could be happy. I came here to vent because my family isn't the most open about our emotions, being my dad was raised by a neglectful father so he doesn't really know when he is invalidating feelings, and I feel like my mom is always trying to guilt trip me.. like i know they love me but they just make it so hard to ask for help. Every day i seem so happy during the day, but the second im not distracting myself I just can't stop thinking about how much I fucked up my life, and I'm only 16. I dont know what I want to so with my life, I have no real skills, sitting on the computer all day doing the same thing over and over and over again messed up my wrists so in the long run I'm fucked anyways. I just don't know what to so, I dont know how much I can take anymore. The other week my 18 year old sister asked me to help fix her Xbox, because it was connected using ethernet and wouldn't work, and because I'm the only one in my family who can technology, they came to me. Long story short I fixed her issue, made more for everyone else, had a breakdown, then fixed everyone else's and nobody mentioned it afterwards. I'm so tired of everything I cant sleep for so long each night and I wake up at 4pm on the weekends, and the only response I get is "must've stayed up too late playing on your computer". Like no im struggling please help please but you don't see that because even though I want help so badly I hide my hurt so well and I dont know why I cant stop I wish I could stop, I wish I could ask for help but I can't, my body won't let me. Sorry for the long annoying post, but thank you if you actually read it all the way through.
your reddit family will always be here for you if you wanna talk :).
Thanks, it means a lot that someone is listening.

I’ve tried Zoloft Paxil Wellbutrin Prozac Cymbalta  Lexipro   Some did nothing. Others worked for a while then stopped.   I want to try ketamine or psilocybin but don’t know how to get those.   I think of my own death constantly.
For ketamine, you can get in touch with a ketamine clinic to get infusions or nasal spray, or contact a provider who prescribes oral ketamine.   I added Abilify to my Vyvanse, Wellbutrin, and Zoloft and it's been a game-changer. The thoughts/urges are gone, and my mind is crystal clear. The side effects sound scary, but the severe ones are much rarer in 2nd-generation antipsychotics like Abilify. Most likely you'll feel heavily sedated for a few days, but it should clear up.
You take all four?
5 counting the Adderall I started a few months ago. I have ADHD as well so that's what the Vyvanse and Adderall are for, for the most part.
I’ve never been on more than one antidepressant at a time. I’ve been on an antidepressant and an ADHD med before simultaneously. I dropped ADHD meds ages ago. But maybe I should be on them

I just feel so empty. Nothing has a meaning in my life, I wake up everyday and it's always the same thing, I'm always in pain. I just can't handle it anymore, this emptiness, this loneliness, these memories haunting me and torturing me.  I think in killing myself 24/7, no matter how hard I try to distract me from these thoughts.  I don't wanna live anymore.
Neither does anyone to be honest. They're working 5 days a week to come home and get over abuse at work. Then two days off then back to work.
Everything is so exhausting for everyone since the pandemic started tbh, my mental health is worse than ever.
Yes that as well. Mostly life in general sucks. However it's good to start at least I'll be waiting for that day.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0ibtw/every_am_i_wake_up_the_same/
Every AM I wake up filled with hate against myself turning over all my failures in my mind. I want to die but can’t bring myself to do it. It would hurt my parents and my kids would be affected too.   I just can’t keep going on like this.   I am a failure in so many countless ways.   I wish I were dead.
Everyone has the potential to be something beautiful for someone - and I'm sure you are in some sense already. Everyone has unique unrealised traits and things in their unconscious waiting to be found. You will have lots of ugly and beautiful emotions but there is beauty in all of them. Try to find a sense of purpose and connect with people.
At least u slept
I sleep for a few hours and then I wake up filled with hatred and worry and stress and just wishing I could disappear into a hole in the ground
Oh nvm

It's hard to explain how I'm feeling right now. I lack stability as far as income goes and it is starting to stress me out. I cannot keep a regular job for more than a month due to my mental health. Everything will be fine for a bit and then one random day I will just be physically unable to go to work. I convince myself that I can just do something else for money. And with that I kind of screw myself. But I just cannot go. It's hard to explain.  I do many small side jobs like pet sitting, reselling things, and DoorDash. However, I really lack motivation to do these things most of the time. I want to apply to unemployment but I don't qualify. I want to apply to disability due to my diagnosed mental illnesses but have heard that that's a long, difficult process and I really don't want to depend on that forever.   I am graduating this year and I am planning to buy a house in the next few years which will require a steady income source, and currently I just don't have that. That is what brings on many of my worries, along with not being prepared for an emergency even though I do have a small emergency fund.   My dream is to stream or do YouTube. I have most of the means to be able to do these things but I lack the motivation, quite honestly. This is not a silly dream, either, as I am skilled at gaming (the content I would be creating) as well as technology such as editing and I also have connections. I know if I don't start doing it now I will beat myself up for not doing it while I can.   I just need advice, or kind words, or something. I'm feeling terrible about all of this.
Shit man sorry. What are your parents telling you they're always right.
I'm an adult, my parents aren't around much sadly so I don't really have that guidance.
Okay. You have got a lot of things going for you. It makes me feel depressed that you do. Sadly what comes from nothing is nothing so carry on.
I guess I kind of do but I didn't mean to make you depressed.
It's all good I'm a man I can take it. I grew up in a pretty crappy school I had a definition of what success was and no one else had that. To have success I needed to move school early I didn't. 20 years later depressed, 4 years no job, don't go out at all and no partner.
I'm really sorry. Keep your head up man although I know it's hard.
Thanks brother. You have 4 things going successfully for you keep going.

I'm a first time poster. I'm sorry if I somehow violate the rules.   Idk what to do, I just got hit with overwhelming feelings of sadness, anxiety, hopelessness.. just ALOT. I usually feel very meh, and alone. Right now, it's just so much, and idk how to get relief. I want to cry, but it doesn't happen. I don't want to do anything destructive. I'm sorry, I'm just feeling exponentially pathetic. I can't even be sad the right way. And I don't really have anyone to go to. I'm usually the one everyone goes to for advice and when they are in the dumps.   I thought I saved a post, idk if it was from this sub, but it was basically like a zoom meeting, where people feeling bad like I am now... Can just kinda vent and get the support they can't find anywhere else. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? I can't for the life of me remember.
Man why is this so relatable

It sounds so disgusting. They started to smell so bad but I just could not find the energy to do it. I turned to noodle cups, cans of energy drinks, microwave meals, Uber eats etc...stuff I could just throw out the packaging. Or I just didn’t eat at all. A few times I got my depressed ass to go buy bananas or grapes so I actually had something good in me though. At one point I even bought more bowls because it seemed easier than washing the ones in my sink.   TW: gross lol- Some were plastics and I just had to throw them out. Not only were they slimy with food residue that became a gelatinous oil sticking to the sides, but I think mould had embedded into them and I just didn’t want to take the chance.  -End TW  It was so hard forcing myself to do it. I know if I just washed them right after I used them this wouldn’t happen, but it keeps happening regardless. Wish I had a dishwasher honestly. I just don’t understand why this shit is so hard. But finally they’re done and it doesn’t smell fucking horrible. Big win for me.
I was just like you and thought it was due to anything but the food I was eating. I stopped drinking and eating junk food and I'm feeling waaaaaay more energy and my lethargy is almost minimal.
I know this feeling pretty well. I'm really proud of you dude.   I've done this plenty, where I just let old laundry, dishes, etc stack up and I don't even recognize the smell anymore. Then I have my "cleaning" days where I realize I'm sitting in filth and just fix everything. Doesn't last long though. Those days are good though, when you clean everything.   You mental genuinely improves, even if only a bit, based on how clean your area is, takes a huge weight off your shoulder and you stop worrying about it :)
Is there any easy way to make everyday a cleaning day :/

Wake up each day wanting to go back to sleep. Get out of bed wanting to get back into bed. Put on a smile wanting to cry. Everyday is just an endless loop, wake up, eat, cry, sleep, repeat. Watch everyday as all my friends go on, while I stay here, wanting to go but stuck. I just exist, they live. Hoping for someone to pull me out of it, but when they try I resist. Scared that if I try I will fail. Wanting for it to end but scared for it to begin. The never ending feeling of dread weighs me down. Scared that no one will love me, push them away so I have nothing to lose. Longing for someone to hug me, but scared of being touched. Cry for all that you're missing, but can’t seem to be there. Angry all the time, just anger. Why did I just yell at you. I’m sorry, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me, I didn't mean it. Sleep, more sleep, always more sleep, never enough sleep. Darkness I need darkness. If I Just do this one thing everything will be alright. I want to die. No I'm fine, I'm just being dramatic. Why would anyone ever love you, your stupid and worthless. Just toughen up, your fine. Help me please. Leave me alone. You can do this, I believe in me. I want to crawl in a hole. They all think your stupid, stop talking. They all think you're a joke. If you tell them how you feel they will think you just want attention. They don't want to be friends. Why doesn't anyone like me. Make them laugh that will make you feel better. Just fake the smile, they won't notice. Thinking I can fix my whole life at 3am, doesn’t work. I'm hopeless. I am nothing, a nobody, so why go on. What's the point. It's going to end anyways why not today. Stress, so much stress. I'm going to explode. So many thoughts. It's too loud, I can't think I need to get away. Too many thoughts. Hide under the blankets. Rock back and forth. I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay. Wishing it would all just go away. Why is everything slow. Why is everything so fast. What am I even doing here. Dance party. Lie on the floor. Scream. Cry. Numb. Tired. Sleep. Repeat

Everyday its the same, wake up, eat something, brush my teeth, play video games or watch youtube which both bring no entertainment now, and then maybe shower, then go to bed. Half the time I don't even change my clothes everyday! My rooms a mess, all I do is play videogames or watch youtube as I said before, the only happiness I get is when I can go to bed. I feel sick everyday, no motivation to do much at all, sometimes I just sit there staring off for probably hours. Whenever I do feel good its a random mood swing. The meds only make me worse or at least that's what I think. I'm a pessimist all the time and I'm apathetic. I don't do any school work do to lack of motivation. What's the point of it if its all the same everyday? How do I spice things up? Anyone else feel like this?
Cos you’re depressed. That’s kinda the point of the whole thing 😂
It was more of a rhetorical but I mean you still answered it correctly I guess so...
The meds shouldn’t make you worse though, they should make a real difference over time so if you’ve been on them a while change them.
I did and these ones don’t seem to do much either. Maybe I should just wait a while but I’m losing hope.
Things do get better. Trust me. I had a total breakdown and managed to get better. It just takes time.

The knowledge that I’m shitty and ugly and I don’t belong here and I don’t deserve anything good. Sometimes I forget. Hell, sometimes it doesn’t even bother me that much. But I can never escape that; separate myself from that. I will always be worthless, no matter what gilded jewels may be placed on my crown of shit.  I try to fit in but I will never belong. I will never be one of them. I’m a square peg trying to squeeze into the round hole. I can wear the flowery pink dress or I can drop a fuckton of weight, but nobody will ever see me as more than garbage. I look like it, I smell like it, so I must be it.    I fooled myself into thinking I was fine. I take the pills and I have my routine and have the pets and the husband that make me feel like maybe I can have some kind of a future. But it’s an illusion. Because sooner or later it will be taken from me, or through some typical dumbfuck actions that I will idiotically make, I will lose them. And I don’t deserve them, so why should I have them? I should be alone. I should crawl into a fucking hole and die.    I thought somehow I was growing up, growing out of this seemingly eternal phase. I thought I was winning the fight and overcoming the dark cloud and rising above it all. But I wasn’t. I was just sampling the kind of life that real people have. A life for people that aren’t fucking garbage pieces of shit like me. Boy was I really blinded by how shiny and pretty that life looked. But it’s not meant for me to touch. I’m meant to writhe in the filth like the little worm I am. Doomed to a longing that cuts so profoundly that every other sense goes numb.    I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to care anymore, I don’t want to think anymore. I wish there was a peaceful way to end this but at the same time I feel like I deserve all the pain I get. Perhaps it’s good that I’m practically invisible. It means nobody will notice when I’m gone.

Have any of you had a moment where you suddenly just fully understand that no matter what you do you will eventually die and not exist anymore. Like i woke up in the middle of the night about a year ago and it just hit me that everyone i know and love is going to die and everything will come to an end. all the memories i’ve made everything will just be gone when the lights go out. every since i fully realized this i’m so hyper-aware of the situation i’m in and constantly thinking in my head. i feel like i’m living from like a 3rd person point of view now. anyone else ?
i've had that moment about a dozen too many times. you think you've got over it, that you've beaten the fear of death an can live your life freely until the cold and gripping realisation strangles you and you feel the urge to puke all over the floor and punch the door into wooden flakes and scream to the heavens in sheer terror and misery  ok maybe the description was a tad graphic but the point is, you're not on your own for as little as this means.

Does anyone else have pretty much all physical symptoms of depression? I feel weak and drained most of the time. Had tons of blood work done, all fine. I had some major life changes, and I never feel happy but in my mind it’s because I’m feeling bad physically. It started after having my first child, and it’s been a year and a half and the feeling never goes away completely & keeps coming back. Does this sound like depression? Anyone else have mostly physical symptoms? It’s like the weak feeling of when you have the flu.
I suffer from physical symptoms all the time, whereas the mental symptoms come for me periodically. But I feel tired and drained all the time, sometimes I even feel light headed. It could also be due to low iron, anemia, poor sleep, but I have felt the same way for years now.  I unfortunately don’t have any tips for how to overcome it, but you’re not alone!
I've had the same in the past and so has my ex. I don't know where it stemmed from for me personally and neither does anyone who I've spoken to about it. In your case I've never had a child and I won't because I'm a gay guy but it could be postnatal depression then again it might not. The thing that I did to help me overcome my physical symptoms was to find all the motivation I could, even if it was a little, and force myself to move and get stuff done. As soon as I started getting things done I slowly improved and was able to overcome the feeling of being drained constantly.  Yes there will be days when you feel like that even if the day before you were feeling great. Just make sure to remember that you are in the driver seat, you get to control how you react to traffic and at what pace you drive. You can go as fast or as slow as you want.  I hope this helps, apologies for the poor analogy at the endm
Yes. I had post partum depression but no time to deal with it. Eventually it "went away." After a while, I started getting sick.  I landed myself in the hospital with physical symptoms. I had no idea what was wrong with me - stomach issues to the point of dangerously low potassium levels, which then caused heart palpitations, was constantly vomiting, etc. I just never felt well. We threw everything at it, tested for everything.   Turns out, it was depression. I was put on medicine and it got much better for a long while. I've also since discovered that I have a severe gluten allergy and since coming off of gluten have also seen a massive uptick in energy.   You're going to have to be your own advocate in a huge way. Push for yourself. If you don't click with your doctor, find a new one. Make sure you have someone that listens to you and also HEARS you. Good luck!
Yes I totally relate--I feel the physical symptoms all the time and mental symptoms sometimes. Thanks for the reply!
Thank you, this really helps! I really relate to feeling great one day and feeling drained & sick the next. It’s exhausting.

I’m writing this to hopefully save someone’s life out there, if you’re feeling lonely I just want to say I’m here for you, I’ve been dealing with depression the last couple years and it’s tough you’ll have times you’ll feel worthless thinking that if you reach out it won’t change anything or it might be telling you that nobody cares that it won’t matter, which leads you into a hole in which you constantly feel like you’re digging yourself out of one, the truth is life is tough, I tried taking my life a year ago, when you’re mind is having intrusive thoughts that their isn’t anyone to help you that it won’t get better it can be scary... What’s even scarier is telling someone you’re having those intrusive thoughts, just know there’s people out there that really care for you and won’t look at you any differently for expressing yourself.
You are a good person.  The world needs more people like you.

Whenever I really feel like putting some lead into my thinking sponge the last thing I feel like doing is talking with a stranger over the phone.  Do we have statistics about their efficacy?  Am I'm the only one that feels a bit angry when these helplines always pop up first when the topic of suicide is mentioned? Like, seriously? A fucking telephone line for something that kills  800 000  a year is the best we got?
Just wanna say thanks for making me laugh the thinking sponge did it ...also good point
i know, right? but it’s the sort of thing where you have to say “what can you do?” because as individual people we can’t make much of a difference. i’m mad too because a phone number is not at all what us sad fuckers need
yeah it’s kind of annoying. Tho my depression has been making me into this crazy irritable bitter person. Every time i see someone on social media post the helplines like they’re doing something and they care it just seems fake. Like “here if you wanna die go call this random person. You’re welcome, i care about mental illness, i’m so kind and nice! follow me!!!” ugh. feel you.

I've gone through this dozens of times, just thinking about what notes or messages I'd leave for friends and family before I'd killed myself, if I did.

Does anyone else become clueless sometimes because of anxiety and depression ? I get too blank and I struggle to do even basic things.
yeah definitely, depression causes a lot of brain fog for me and anxiety makes me nervous to make decisions and honestly, because of both combined, i have no idea what i want ever. i just want someone else to make the decision so that i don’t stress about how i truly have no idea.   the brain fog also really causes that struggle because it makes me kinda zone out and it’s hard to think and process what people say sometimes.
Yes, 100%, particularly when it's really bad. The hard part is having people around you that understand. Work is particularly tricky to navigate sometimes when you have a cloud of fog around your mind.
Yes I can totally relate with these. Like when I feel anxious I can't really understand basic things. I get too scared out of no reason. I feel I am just stuck somewhere and it really feels so terrible. I really don't know how to get rid of it. It's badly affecting my personal life and academics. When I am not anxious I really do very well with my academics but when I get anxious I even struggle to speak.
I started staying at my home because of this. But I guess this is not the right approach. Hiding away won't help me. Its impact on work is very terrible. Like people around me really don't even admit that there is something like depression and anxiety.
yeah, anxiety can make you just freeze up and be so nervous that even if you know exactly what to do you just can’t do it. as far as getting rid of it goes, i’m not sure if you have mentioned this to anyone else but if not i think it’s definitely worth talking to someone you trust or a doctor or therapist. there are solutions and options that can help you feel better and manage this. i promise, even though it feels like it, you aren’t stuck. there are always options and i believe in you and i know that you are stronger than your anxiety. i can tell just by the way you’re talking about it and the fact that you are seeking help/someone who understands. remember that you are definitely not alone and there are ways to get through this 💜
It's difficult, because the urge to runaway and hide is always there. But I don't think, particularly if you have anxiety too, that's the best way to deal with it. We live in a strange world where people are talking about these conditions more, and yet I don't think people's wellbeing is at the forefront of every companies concerns still.   Plus, many people push on and pretend everything is okay. That's not healthy either. For me, it's about understanding that what you're feeling is okay, accepting it and looking at ways (if possible) of addressing it though self-care.
Hey Thank you so much. I am definitely considering taking help. From last three years I have been fighting on my own. But I guess it's not enough. I am too tired and exhausted now. So next month I am planning to open up before my sister so that she can take me to a psychiatrist. I really don't know how I am going to do this. I really don't know how things will go but I do accept and acknowledge that I need some professional help.
I don't have to work as of now. Technically I should have started my internship but I dropped out from my college and because of my anxiety. I used to get Anxitey attacks in college. I used to freeze out and feel sharp pain my middle chest. I am running three years late. I have to carry the so called guilt and regret of dropping out too. Now I have decided to start all these over again. I want to continue my studying.  I failed to help myself on my own so I am craving for professional health.
Getting professional help is an important, and brave, first step. I went years not worryingly particularly about my mental health. I thought it was normal, until eventually it became too much. I finally got myself a therapist and a diagnosis from my doctor. Knowing what you're facing and having the space to talk it through is really helpful.  And don't be too hard on yourself. Life is difficult anyway, even without mental health challenges. It might not feel like this now, but it does get better.
Yes, I have been normalising my anxiety and depression and that was the worst thing I did with myself. I thought it will get better within a day, it didn't. Then I thought it will be fine after a week, then months and now it's been years. People around me made be believe that this is normal. But they don't know at what extent I was facing this issuee. Now I want to do justice with myself. I am still very scared about opening up but I have to eventually.

I'm not okay and I'm tired of pretending I am. I've never talked about my problems to anybody because I feel like telling them would just burden them. I hate myself. I have a voice in my head that's constantly telling me that I'm worthless and should just disappear. I can't do it anymore. My expectations for my own capabilities have gone too far I went from a happy go lucky kid to the mindset of "If it's not perfect it's not good enough". I'm scared to tell people. I know I need help but I can't reach out and ask for it. Would it really be that bad if I was to disappear?
Listen, I know how it feels. I also think I would be burdening anyone if I told them my problems. In the end, this life is a test. Some of us are tested this way. You just have to have faith and hope!! If you ever need anything, I'm always here for you!! I hope this helped and have a wonderful day you amazing soul!! ❤❤💖💖💕💕

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzpufz/im_ending_my_bloodline_with_me/
Yeah Im not gonna dare to have kids. I have both sides of generational trauma and I'm not spreading that shit. Idk if my brothers going to have kids, honestly I kind of hope he doesn't. Our family has physically healthly genes but holy shit has no one been mentally stable in a while. My parents set me up with their shit and were like "why are you depressed and bipolar even though we are both super emotional and irrational people?"   Anyways but high functioning anyone? 👋 I just do the old "lol I'm depressed 😌✌️" even though I wanna die 100x over.
I made that decision as well last year! Got a vasectomy in July for this exact reason (also with my condition, being bipolar, I cannot bear both the financial and personal responsibility of raising kids). Mental illness runs in my extended family but I'm the only one in my nuclear family who is neurodivergent. Don't want to pass this torture onto anyone.
Bloodline or family name is overrated as heck lmao, especially when looking at human kind as a whole.  Agree with you too. To be born into the world, especially in this economic and climate, is freaking brutal. Lots of depression to enjoy.  Okay I got full quota of my daily dose of depression now, peace out OP 😌✌
I never asked to be born so why should I create another human being with my mentality. Also even worse - me as a parent lol.
Both sides my family are seriously messed up. A slew of physical health issues, mental health issues and abuse was rampant in my family and extended family. Why the heck would I want my kid to have to predisposed to all of that? On top of that, I'm not prepared to take care of a kid because I'm working through all of my own trauma, and mental health issues. Also just, there is nothing appealing about childbirth or being pregnant (to me anyways.)
I feel you. I am more and more interested in vasectomy. Not sure how much of my recurrent depressions are genetic, I think is more due to my childhood trauma, but I don't want to take the risk and spread more suffering into this world.  Besides, with all this madness that humanity does to itself and our creative ways to torment each other and the Earth, fuck it, I end my line with me. Life will find a way with or without me. And if it comes down to reproduction, then our species didn't start with me and I am sure will not end with me either :)  If I ever change my mind, I can adopt.
Lots of people have normal genes but have children who are mental They say one of your great ancestors had it you were unfortunate to get it you can have children and the gene might not show up. Environment is important to the mind.
It's sad but for the best for many reasons. Personally I'm in the same situation, depression and other major medical issues are common in my family on both sides. Several family members have committed suicide, several have diabetes along with heart issues later in life. Plus I've spent so long alone I just can't see myself with anyone. Besides society is past the point where having kids is a must and it's thankfully becoming more common to not have any. I'd rather not subject another life to the hell I've experienced.  Point is I applaud you for being able to make this choice.
These disorders aren’t genetic, it’s more environment caused. Basically people are no longer living in ways that is how we evolved for in nature so more people struggle mentally as a result. It is primarily the way our societies are now structured which causes so much mental stress. We are not free from institutionalized violence enforced upon the population through the ruling class.
Maybe I don't have any mental problems but seeing how the life looks like and its difficulty is just making me feel totally repelled to make someone goings through it.
Yeah mentally illness and other stuff runs in my family. If I chose to have a child that would make me extremely selfish. Not that I really wanted kids to begin with though. They're stressful. And giving birth sounds like torture I would rather die than be forced to give birth ew
I honestly feel the same. Also why I refuse to have a relationship. Its just too much for me. I had one last year but I realized how emotionally and mentally draining they are
Yeah, me too.  I'm pretty sure my sibling isn't having kids either, so it's a true end for my family.  And good riddance.  My family, like yours, is physically healthy, but has terrible mental health.  Curiously, my parents are also like yours.  Despite severe anxiety and depression running in the family, my parents have zero empathy for me and expect me to be perfectly normal...despite showing signs from a young age.  Nope, all I got from them was abuse.  I fucking hate them.
Good thing blood lines don't exist. And while I can always get behind some anti natalism, I would say that mental health is more commonly more about environment and learned responses than it is about genetics and heritability. Hell, there are potentially numerous ways that simple factors of environment can alter genetic expression in ways that could potentially mediate development or progression of mental illness.   There is very little about mental illness that seems to be essential or intrinsic to a person's existence. It seems to be contingent on factors external to the person suffering combined with learned behaviors used to respond to those external factors.
It sucks when your asian because that shitty culture gets forced down your throat like you were manufactured for that purpose. If you're male you better have boys. If you don't you're a fucking degenerate. Glad you guys consider that shit.
This is partially true. From an article on the matter:  Scientists believe that as many as 40 percent of those with depression can trace it to a genetic link. Environmental and other factors make up the other 60 percent.
Yeah I feel you. They are not gonna get that from me tho, no way I'm gonna do that happy family and pop out little human just to please them. To much work for just tiny to non exist little pleasure.
This doesn’t make a lot of sense. Kind of creates a false dichotomy. Like either your depression is genetic or environmental, instead of the very real possibility that it’s a complex relationship between both factors.   So far we have no sound evidence for the “low serotonin” theory which would point to a purely biological cause, and it would make sense as bodies in an environment that we would be heavily impacted by the stresses of life.
I think the take away is it could be one or both. They even think they have even identified the “depression gene” chromosome 3p25-26. I personally can trace depressive disorders through 3 generations. My mothers entire family of 3, each committed suicide before I was born (obviously my mother survived). Before they knew about genetics, the mental health and counseling fields knew melancholia ran in families. But also there are environmental triggers that seem to account for the majority of originators. Im just pointing out it’s important not to dismiss either. Knowing you have it in your family can help head it off early.

i've ben crying a lot since idk Wednesday. friday i cried a lot in the shower, very loudly and dramatically, allowing myself to let all the pain to come out. spent Saturday and sunday sleeping eating sleeping again crying. so much loneliness and emptiness. Then today, i put on some very dark make up to make my crying look dramatic (idk why it helps me cope at least i feel like im in a movie or something its do stupid....) anyway i felf euphoric with the make up, felt so hot and sexy i couldnt even think of reasons to cry anymore. all the pain and the motives weres still there i just seemed to not care because i felt so powerful. then i went to the shower with the make up on and cried for a little. then i had luch, took a nap and woke up feeling so fucking empty. that was around 6pm. its now 2am and i've beeb crying since. i feel so empty. i feel so awful. idk why i just feel like no one truly cares for me. i feel alone in this world i feel like im grieving a loss but no one even died. i feel so awful for existing i feel gross i cried so hard tears fell on the floor and in my ear. i just cant stop. my head hurts so much my eyes are so swollen. my room is so messy and gross and i feel disgusting because i feel like there's nothing ahead of me life feels so pointless i hate existing like this i hate it i miss being hugged and touched and having people genuinely like me for who i am. i dont ever want to leave this bed again i just want to drown in my own tears im so exhausted.
i feel so abandoned but no one abandoned me
god so much mispelling in the text sorry english isnt my 1st language i meant its now 2am and i've been crying since 6pm
tw self harm all i wanna do is cut my entire body and starve
this post is ridiculous im so sorry guys i just cant stoo crying like i said a billion times and i reallly needed to get these thoughts out.
I feel you, some times the tears just won't stop. I usually open the window and just try to thing about something else it can be anything even stupid things like why is the snow white and not a differend color. Something that will keep your mind occupied with other thoughts. The fresh air also helps it's better if you don't actually want to go outside and if you are not comfortable with people seeing you do it at night. I don't know if this will help you but it's worth a shot.
it’s okay. you can let it out. And sometimes crying can be addicting bc it releases hormones like oxytocin. They kinda make you feel a little better. So cry it out. And when you feel a little better try to laugh it out bc that’s even better for you. love you.

recently I’m just overwhelmed with all the hatred in the world. Racism, homophobia etc. It makes me not want to live my life because every happiness would just be overshadowed the negativity in the world. I can’t stop paying attention to or thinking about it. And it’s holding me back in life. I hope this makes sense to someone because it’s really hard to put into words. But does anyone else get this feeling and if so how do you deal with it? How do you enjoy life knowing how many horrible people are there to ruin it?
There world is in many ways an awful place but you've got to find the beauty that lies in yourself. Everyone has unique unrealised traits and things in their unconscious that are waiting to be found.

I have had this problem for a while but I can’t seem to feel anything whether it’s sadness or anger or happiness I can’t even feel music anymore everything in my life is just bland how can get out of this funk I’m in ??
What's the problem you've had for a while?
It’s hard to explain but I would say like a deep pain inside my soul that just lingers there all day everyday it keeps me from feeling I just feel numb to anything and everyday is a struggle either my thoughts fuck my day and my brain is racing all day with thoughts and regrets and me wanting to change the past and before I know it I’m already drained mentally and the day just started idk it’s like what do I even do anymore
What kind of thoughts and regrets race all day long?
It is normal to feel numb after you had experienced intense inner pain in your soul. I felt that way before. I think it’s just a phase. Don’t panic. You will feel normal again
Just talking down on myself that I’m dumb and the day is going to suck and I’m nothing but I would say the biggest one is forcing myself not to get in my bed and be in a dark room I hate it but I deal with it everyday regrets I would say not going to college not being able someone my close friends and family can rely on and be proud of and probably my biggest not being able to get my dad to stay I was a baby at the time but still I think what if I was older I could’ve done something it really hurts
Yeah I’m trying I’ve started doing meditation but it’s been four years already I just want to feel happy I don’t that’s too much to ask for is it ?
You're not dumb.  This day is going to get better for you.  College isn't everything.  I'm proud of you.  I know you're hurting.  I understand.  And I appreciate you.
When I got to that what I would do was try to cry has much as I could and that would help with the pain and numbness. Not easy to do but if you can try to see how it does for you. I would just burst in tears and then I would get angry at my self and after all that things would feel a bit better, after the crying and the anger I would have some positive thoughts to help it all out.
My family thinks it has to do with not my having my dad in my life even though we live in the same city I want to talk to him but I don’t want him to yell at me and it really overwhelms me to even talk about it
Don’t be afraid to be sad about some things. Just don’t let it turn to anger towards anyone, including yourself. 41M...would not be alive without the catharsis of weeping from time to time. I had a rough relationship with my dad and he passed as soon as we started to mend things. Fix yourself up first and then what your dad thinks of you won’t matter, and you guys can get along or not as adults. Don’t let your adult parents’ issues drag YOU down...that is you unfairly throwing away your life for someone else and that isn’t okay. It’s toxic as you probably feel somewhat, yeah? It’s hard to not have expectations of people, but sometimes we just can’t. Hang in there.

Everything's going to shit, I can't eat, I can't sleep, school is just frustrating, and impossibly hard, I don't talk to or play with friends in my free time like I used to,  I stay up all night, and my only happiness is temporary, when I eat things I know are unhealthy, like candy.  I go the entire day like a zombie, I'm just barely motivated enough to play games, let alone get work done.Every day, when I wake up, I feel so goddamn annoyed, that I can't stay in bed, that I can't remember anything, that I don't feel like doing anything, but my parental figures come screaming at me, shouting, telling me all about how I'm affecting their lives, how I need to go to school, because school is the most important fucking thing in the world.  I just go through the day like a slave, I can't muster enough willpower to feel angry, so I supress it all, come home, don't get anything done, internet shuts off at 10PM, but I'm not sleepy, so I lay in bed, annoyed at myself because I can't go to sleep, check the time, it's 5-7AM, and I'm just barely getting sleepy. I don't even know who to tell this to, who to call. I only have enough energy to do anything in the nights, and all the help lines are closed then. Who do I even call to ask for a therapist? I live in a small place, so is there even a therapist available? It's like I'm stuck in this loop, and the only thing that aleviates the pain of existing is playing games, the thing my parental figures are trying to prevent me from doing so much of.
I’m 16 and I understand you dude. I’ve become so unmotivated I just spend the whole day sleeping and on my phone. I hope things will get better.
Thank you for replying, it's very nice to just get a reply at all, since nobody I usually talk to replies. It's weird, during the night I feel incredibly tired, shitty, and it feels like everybody hates me, though I know that's illogical, during the day, I just feel physically won out, but it's like the mask I'm constantly wearing is so good, that I actually convince myself I'm happy, which is one way of doing it I guess. I'm seeking therapy, gonna call tomorrow, as soon as it's open. I don't think that me spreading my problems to others is going to help, so this is probably my last post here, good luck seeking help with the problems that  you face!

Life’s not worth living if you’ll never be loved  Hope is a poison to kill the spirit  You will never be good enough  Why do you keep trying?  You are a lost cause  You never had a chance to be happy  You never will be happy  Why do you keep getting your hopes up?  Did you really think you were good enough for him?  You never will be  Remember this next time he reminds you that you hate yourself too  You knew  You’re just lying to yourself  You’re creating a mirage in a desert of loneliness you’ll never escape  No one will ever really love you  Every time he said it was a joke or a lie out of pity  You will die alone  No one will care  You deserve nothing  Stop deceiving yourself  Just because you love him does not mean he loves you  He never meant it  He never cared  He is just using you as a prop to hit on other people he wants more than you even if you think you’re both having fun, he’s just putting up with you  He’s better than you in every way  You’re lucky he wastes his time with you  You are worthless  You are a disgrace  Just because you have fun 90% of the time does not mean the other 10% doesn’t still remind him that he actually hates you  He said he loves you but he hates you  Why do you only try to remember the first half?  Months of being exclusive friends with benefits  How can you be this laughably bad at life?  This is as close to happy as you can ever be  Its unrequited love or a lonely death  Pick one  The end.

I can’t stop crying, and I can’t get out of bed I don’t sleep but I only stand up to go to the bathroom or eat/feed my pets. I don’t do anything except be in my phone, all day 12 hours a day, I’ve been contemplating hurting myself, the only thing keeping me back is my bf, he makes me happy and forget about everything. But when I’m alone I feel like there’s no point in living I’ll never kill myself because I don’t want the people that care about me to suffer, but I just want it to be over I’m a waste of space, literally I don’t do anything I’m garbage.

Everyday is very hard to pass thru, finding it difficult. Feel like I have no purpose in life and just passing the time without being productive. Not being able have anyone to share stuff is really difficult and the pain is really internal. Just a very sad lad deep inside with a tiring smile on the outside.
Everyone has unique unrealised traits and things in their unconscious. Finding them is difficult if you're depressed because all your positivity is suppressed. Tell me more about your feelings.
And trying to be something for others leads to tiredness and emptiness. Try to be more comfortable with yourself and your feelings.

Hi,  I've just started Prozac ten days ago (I was on it before but it's been several years), 20 mgrs, I am feeling very jittery and my heart is going faster than normal.  I'm also feeling restless but I can't really do anything because it makes my heart go even faster.   I've emailed my psychiatrist so it's not so much that I am looking for medical advise. I'm just wondering whether others have experienced the same and whether it will go away after a while.
I have not experienced this with prozac. I was on it years ago for about 2 years. I also just restarted taking it about 2 months ago. Years ago the only side effects were lack of libido, but it helped level out my overall mood. This time around I have no side effects, but it also doesn't seem to be helping much.

I don’t know really know why I keep on keeping on the way I am. I’m publishing a textbook in my field of work, but I feel more ashamed of it than anything: I was so unbelievably lazy getting it out, and the end product is just kind of... meh. This is the future I’m building for myself; I’m too lazy to send proper emails, too lazy to check for all my inevitable typos, too lazy to act as though I have any shred of competence. I will never be good enough for a PhD. I’d be out of a job in a heartbeat if people saw how utterly awful I am at so much of this. Being autistic doesn’t help.  I’m perpetually either pissed off or dead tired. I ache everywhere, and for being a young man I feel so old, what with all the pain as I get out of bed. Making a meal for myself and eating it is so much effort. I want to tell my long distance girl but I don’t think she could help, or if it’s right for me to treat her like an emotional dump. I don’t see how she could care for what is essentially a husk of a person. Long and short of it: I feel like I’m being swallowed up by a shame of myself. I have no passion, just an empty pit. I’m so weak that I can’t show up anymore for my colleagues or my friends or anyone I love in my mute, greyed-out way. Sorry if this all seems overwrought when so many people have to suffer with far worse; I’d love advice.

I feel like the last few years of my life have almost been a simulation. I feel like I haven't really been experiencing things but just existing, watching things happen. That's what most of it feels like. I've been out of work for a year, which has kind of sucked because I need the money. But even when I had work, and I did for over 2 years, I was a terribly, terribly lonely person.  None of my coworkers really liked me and due to my insecurity I never really gave them a chance to. For a long time they'd say "good morning" or "hi" every day and I'd almost always ignore it or mutter something back. Eventually they stopped saying anything at all. A lot of my life has been like that.  When I was in middle school, about 9-10 years ago, that was the last time I really had a sense of companionship off screen. And then my friends began ignoring me for someone more interesting or funny or whatever and being like 13, I didn't handle it appropriately. After that I lost basically all the in person friendships I had. One guy I was good friends with stopped talking to me entirely. I saw him around for the next 7 years and he never said a word to me again.  I tried to talk to people on and off the internet over the next few years but it didn't go anywhere. If I got into an online group I always ended up being ignored. I'm in university now and I still do, every time. I can never be as cool or as funny or as interesting as I want to be and because of this I feel constantly inadequate and shitty about myself. I've spent a lot of time in bathrooms crying or hiding because I can't handle the social environments I exist in.  This has led to who I am today: a deeply lonely, insecure, immature person. I am narcissistic, vain, and abusive and I hate myself for it. I don't know if I'll ever really change. In many ways I'm scared to and in other ways I like being a piece of shit. But that's also what I'm afraid of.
I have had similar feelings of being detached, being incredibly awkward with people and feeling like a narcissist. You need to try and uncover unconscious feelings, good or bad, and try to see your inner uniqueness but that's hard when you're depressed.

Everyday I encounter bitterness. Everyday I encounter stress. I forgot the beauty of being human and being around humans. Being that we thrive and create turmoil and drama on a day to day basis, I forgot what it means to not be selfish. I know things are not right in the world and they never will be. I just can't ignore this.  In my neighborhood, I'm surrounded by drug addiction, homelessness, and the elderly. The COVID rates are at its highest in this neighborhood, in my city. My grandfather slipped on the stairs and hit his head recently. He was concussed for a while until he was released from the hospital. Up until recently, he was following protocols to stay home during quarantine, but eventually decided to go to Church and conglomerate with everyone there. He caught COVID and is now in the hospital.  I just finished the semester. One of the most stressful and isolating ones of my life. I had a part time internship where my boss scolded me and I felt like a failure half the time. I cheated through most if not all of my classes, having learned nothing and feeling guilty for that. I ended up lashing out my stress at my best friend, who began ignoring me in the last few weeks. This past year, I gained about 40-50 pounds and now I'm at 195, which piles on top of the isolation I had at work (they favored the other intern more than me). Also, my sleep schedule is so shitty right now and my face as broken out into a huge acne fest. I feel the ugliest, loneliest and most brain dead I have been in the longest time  At the same time, I feel so disconnected from my feelings. I'm writing this not processing a single line that I'm writing. I can't feel sadness for my grandpa because I endured so much drama and angst in my youth up until now that there's not an ounce of strength in me. I can't feel genuine joy because I am always losing something.  Therapy doesn't help. ADHD doesn't help. Social media doesn't help. knowing I can't help some of my working class family members living paycheck by paycheck doesn't help.  I'm pretty much in isolation mode right now. I can't say or do anything without fucking it up and thinking about how I contribute to the misery of the world. Honestly I don't care if other people are going through what I'm going through because it sucks either way and I don't want to be who I am nor where I am. Yaaayyy.

My girlfriend and I had been together since June if 2019. We started living together in October. We did that for a while and decided to move out of our parents house.  In may if 2019 we had an apartment and roomed with her cousin, everything was going good. We were 19 at the time. We were in such a good place in life. I had a good job making Hella money, the love of my life was with me, we had everything so good that we decided we wanted a baby. We tried and tried and after months we finally got a positive pregnancy test. We were so over the moon and excited. But one day she felt cramping and went to the hospital we were there all night amd they told us her hcg levels were lower than they should be and they could be dropping which would mean a miscarriage, I had to call into work and the next day my boss acted like I wasn't even there. I went home and tried to support her. The next day while I was at work she told me we had to go back to the hospital the next day so I went to my boss and told him that I had to be there and couldn't be at work tomorrow. He then proceeded to throw every little thing that I had done back in my face and told me that I had work responsibilities that were more important and told me that if I was gone the store would be less profitable. I told him im sorry but this is my family and my child. Amd by the end of it he told me "I'd check to see if your on the schedule next week. That day I left work and never went back there. I told all my friends goodbye and left. We went to the hospital and they told us that the hcg levels went down and that she was going to miscarry. We were devastated. The hospital was aggressively trying to get her to have a dnc (where they surgically remove the contents from your uterus) and we wouldn't because we still had hope. We got into a really bad depression and were trying to handle it. One day while my girlfriend was at a store a woman came up to her and said that God told me to come up to you and pray over you because you're going through alot. We then became friends with these people and started going to church with them. We prayed and prayed for a miracle. Then she had her 6 week appointment at her ob/gyn they said the hcg levels were in a good but slightly low range and they had to check in two days. We had hope and were still worried, we prayed and prayed. We went back and they tested again. And they had doubled. They did an ultrasound and they said they found our baby's heartbeat. Due to covid I wasn't able to be in the room woth her so as she was walking out u was ready for the worst. Trying to see her emotions but I couldn't. She opened the car door and looked at me and said "they found a heartbeat" and we just broke down crying tears of joy that our prayers were answered. We went home and I started looking for jobs. And things were proceeding good. We were so happy I was talking to her stomach and giving it kisses and preparing for our family. We were going to baby stores and looking at everything and budgeting so we could be prepared. At around her 9 week mark she got concerned because she wasn't feeling any symptoms anymore. I did some googling around and found that many women lost their symptoms at around 9 weeks so I thought it was okay. She still wanted to go to get it checked out though so we went to the hospital. They took both of us in. And did an ultrasound. They tech seemed odd and wouldn't say anything. Then the doctor came out and told us that they found no heartbeat or anything. Just an empty yolk sac. We were devastated again they said the sac was growing but with nothing inside it. Things got really bad for us. We were depressed. My new job could barely support us. And our relationship was suffering. I started getting suicidal thoughts and didn't know what to do. We were in crisis and our families had to come to help calm me down, a few days later the thoughts got bad again and she called the police and my family. While everyone was there she finally started bleeding. Her miscarriage had started. We were really depressed and crying all the time after that. It got so painful for her that she had to go to the hospital for them to try to manage it. And we stayed there and I held her hand through all of it. Her cousin started fights with us constantly so we asked her to leave the apartment. She took herself off the lease and was gone. We had realized that we needed to be strong for eachother. About a month After her miscarriage she went on a trip to California with her family for a week and I was at home with the cat. After she got back we were so happy for a few days. We started arguing over little shit. And the arguments would get bigger. In November it got to a point where she packed a bag and went to her moms and that she was leaving me. I freaked out and got really suicidal. I tried to cut myself but couldn't bring myself to do it all the way. I tried to kill myself by choking myself with an aux cord ( didn't work obviously) i called one of our mutual friends and had a long talk and decided I needed help. I started venting in my journal about what I was feeling. I got sick at work the next day and came home early. An hour later she showed up with her family and friends to move her stuff out and they asked me to leave for a bit. When I came back they were still there and her dad was blocking my parking spot so I just parked in the lot across the street. While I was waiting a cop showed up and stared asking me questions about my mental state. They had found my journal and called the cops they cuffed me and put me in the back of a car and took me to a mental hospital. I got there and was so depressed. My doctor wouldn't listen to me and would laugh at me when I would tell him serious things. No one told me about anybmeds so when the med nurse called me fornmeds I said no. The next day a nurse came up to the psychiatrist while we were talking and said I refused my meds. He laughed and said oh well we'll have to keep you longer. So I took whatever meds they gave me after that just to comply. We had been talking in the phone here and there while I was in the hospital. And when I finally got out. I had to go get my things from my apartment because her mother broke our lease (she was our co-signer) while I was there I couldn't hold myself together and was crying constantly. I got all my stuff and went back to my moms house. We were talking on the phone here and there and we decided to meet to hook up. After that we kept doing that and I started staying with her at her dads again. I started going back to work again but while i was there i started feeling so depressed to the point that i would get suck to my stomach. This kept happening and they told me to see a doctor and to not come back till i did. And my dictors app wasn't until the next month. After the doctors i realized being near the food was also part of the problem so i quit. we were working on our relationship after a while of that things started being good again. We were back together. We were either staying at her dads or my parents house for weeks at a time. During Christmas time things got stressful because I wasn't working we were struggling trying to get people gifts. Her dad and I got into a fight and we were living at my parents full time. She went to her dads house for a couple days before Christmas eve and we were fine. She felt a little sick but took an allergy pill and felt fine. She asked if anyone was sick at my house and I said no because everyone was fine except for my dad. He is 65 and has had bladder issues to the point where he has to have a catheter in so he's been feeling shitty and laying around alot. I picked her and her brother up on Christmas morning and we went to her moms for breakfast. We went to my moms for dinner and at the end of dinner my dad said he couldn't taste it. We were freaking out because if covid and me and my girlfriend got into a fight about it. She said that I knew that my dad had covid and I purposely infected her. I had no idea. At my house everyone's schedule is different. My dad sleeps all day and gets up at 9, or 3 am to go to work. He comes home at 1-3, my mom leaves for work at 1 and comes home at 7:30. Our sleep schedule was fucked so we would sleep till 4. So I had no idea. She decided to quarantine in her room at her dads and leave me at my moms. The next night she called me and said we couldn't be together. My depression came back hard. We all got positive covid tests and I was freaking out. She was still talking to me but things were getting bad. My dad almost died and had to go to the hospital. She helped me through that. He came home and started getting better. We decided to meet and just take a drive since we were both positive anyways. We hooked up again and started talking more. I started going to her window at her dads and dropping off supplies since no one there could be with her. She had trouble breathing and had to have me take her to the hospital. After that I was staying with her till about 5am then would leave. At a certain point I just kind of started staying there with her. We finished quarantine together and after that her dad and I fixed our relationship but her relationship with my parents was dead. She still believes they hid the fact that my dad had covid even though I think they were just careless and oblivious. After a while of us being together we decided to get back together and continued staying at her dads house. Things were good but my depression was getting worse. I felt like I didn't belong anywhere. I felt like I couldn't please anyone. I have been talking to a therapist since I got out of the mental hospital and she told me to stop trying to please everyone. So after that I decided to just try for me and my girlfriend. No one else. But for some reason I couldn't hold myself together anymore. Little things would set me off and I'd start bawling. And u just couldn't handle situations anymore. My gf and I had a talk and I realized I needed to support her emotionally too because I wasn't the only one  who was going through shit. I started doing that. I had been depressed and suicidal during the covid time. I started cutting my wrist and came out and told her. She said if I was going to be doing that and freaking out she couldn't be with me anymore. I told her okay and that I'd stop. The next day she was laying into me about they way I was doing things on a little cat patio we were building. I got frustrated told her and left to the bathroom to handle myself. Just like she said I should. We had dinner and after dinner I asked if we could talk. And while we were talking my emotions started getting the best of me and I started freaking out. Ibknew she was going to leave me and I couldn't handle it I started hyperventilating. She asked if I wanted a hug but I couldn't focus enough to say yes. That is all I wanted in that time. I ripped my shirt in half because I was getting frantic and didn't know what to do. She left the room and her dad came in to try to calm me down. She called the cops on me and being afraid of being sent back to the mental hospital I left. Drove off crazy. On my way back home I tried to crash my jeep. I went 80 in a 40 just hoping I would lose control crash and die. When i got home I tried to call her. No answer. I was waiting in my jeep. A cop came to my house. He checked up on me and left. I went inside and called her. I got through. She said she didn't want to here me crying or she'd hang up. I told her I felt like she was holding my emotions hostage and she hung up. I kept trying to call back and started freaking out. Screaming at the top of my lungs. I broke my bed. Broke my door and my mom was screaming about me damaging her house and didn't even care about what ibwas going through. My sister came in and tried to comfort me but ibwas still freaking out. I grabbed a pair of scissors and tried to stab myself. My sister had to tackle me to the floor and take them from me. I kept trying to call and finally got through while I was pinned on the floor. She answered and my sister started talking while I was on the ground. We talked for hours and ended with an i love you. We still broke up but we still said it. We layer out things I need to do to help myself so we can get back together. I fell asleep crying. I woke up Today depressed and feeling weak and tired I just kept going back to bed. I woke up and called a psychiatrist to set up an appointment and put out job applications. I still felt empty and hopeless. I tried to eork on my jeep but once I opened the hood I just lost all my will to and just sat there staring at the engine bay. I cleaned it and went back inside. I started getting more and more depressed. And started reading more into suicide and I kept breaking down. For the first time, the thought of killing myself was calming. And that scared me. Because I just want to make things better. I tried and I tried to call her and after a few hours I got through. I needed to hear her to calm me. She is still willing to talk. I told her I want to make things better for us but I just feel so helpless right now. I told her I needed her support to get through this. And she said she'd be by my side through it. Not together though. But still giving me her support. I know I scared her. I just wish I could go back and re do this whole thing.   I feel so terrible. I really want to change for the better I just need support. I'm sorry this was so fucking long I just needed someone, literally anyone to hear my story and try to understand what I'm going through. I want to change and better myself so badly to win her back. There's never been something that I've cared about like this ever in my life. I think thats why I freak out the way I do. But for all the wanting to get better theres just a feeling of emptiness and wanting to give up. And thats why I need a push, I need support. Thanks for listening if you made it this far.

You should try to break the routine. Try finding a new hobby nothing to crazy just something that might help you take your mind of everything.

I feel so stuck right now.  Like I’m on a weird spot. There’s no progress towards anything really and I don’t like that feeling.  It always makes me depressed.  I hate feeling like I’m just standing still. I want to be proactive in my life and how it goes.  My sleep schedule is all messed up and I’ve just been playing video games non stop to fill the void.  I know there are things I need to do but I push them away because the thought of doing them is too bothersome.  I hope I can break out of this rut soon.
There's unique unrealised traits and things in your unconscious that you are hiding from. It's hard to find these things in depression. Everyone has unique feelings and quirks that can lead to a sense of purpose - even if it's just by expressing and/or relating them.

I only do chores around the house when I have to (no dishes, no clean clothes, etc) and even then it’s half assed. I only get cleaned up if I have to go somewhere, which means I shower twice a week at most these days.  I’m usually laying around in my yoga pants. My skin is a mess from ignoring it through the past year, my hair is falling out (female so that’s fun...), I’ve packed on even more weight from eating crap, and I just can’t bring myself to care.   I just don’t have it in me anymore.  I was struggling to pretend that I gave a shit about being alive before the pandemic. After a year of this I don’t know if I have it in me to go back to plastering a smile on my face and pretending I’m not pissed that I woke up that morning.

You can have goals and ambition in life. But deep down, you have absolutely no desire to live life. I used to have real life friends, not go on my phone a lot, join charity work etc. Always finding a hobby or someone to do. I cut off a lot of my real life friends, they were toxic and only cared about my money. I wasn't sitting on my ass, being a bum. I turned to the online world. Both in real life and online hasn't worked out for me at all. I still feel absolutely no desire to live life and I meet new people...that has always been dissapointing to me towards the very end. I just don't want to live life. Even if I die and there's an afterlife. I hope I can stop existing after that. I just want my soul gone. I really don't want to experience the afterlife.

I have been at my current job for three years today and I can't explain how much I hate it. I've been doing the same ish thing for 3 years, but I've also been working alongside projects that helped me build skills for future internal jobs (that clearly hasnt helped).  Despite having worked on pretty big projects basically probono, I didn't get either internal job I applied for (even though the projects were essentially those jobs).  I haven't felt this low in a long time. I feel like I've just let myself down, I'm a failure, and I have nothing to live for. I can't get another job and I'm stuck in the one I hate where it's full of confrontational people all the time. The job has annihilated my mental health.  To make matters worse, I am losing my hair, I hate how I look, I am socially isolated because of COVID, and my partner works away 5 days a week so I barely get to see him. I'm alone all the time and I feel stuck in this horrible situation that is my life and I just wonder what the point is.  The one thing I focused on before that kept me positive was our wedding day, but that's unlikely to happen due to COVID.  I am just so angry at life and the fact that other people are luckier than I am. I've studied and worked really hard, and I'm always the one who struggles the most. All my friends who have wealthy families don't do any of this and things just get handed to them on a plate.  I'm just so tired.
I have never related to a post as much as I do to this one. I know exactly how you feel. 🥺 I am going through the same thing. Thank you for sharing this
I relate so much to everything in this post down to the line “and I’m always the one who struggles the most. All my friends who have wealthy families don’t do any of this and things just get handed to them on a plate”   I lost my job last April and was unemployed up until October, and had many dark days of rejection after rejection from employers.  Just know that eventually you WILL find a new job. The only way to find a new job is to just keep applying and that’s what I had to tell myself (and I know that is the most annoying thing to tell yourself when you’re feeling down, but it has worked for me).   I don’t have much other advice other than to remind yourself you are not alone!
Keep trying, eventually something works out. Don’t give up
Thank you for responding, I'm sorry you're going through the same. It's fucking shit.
I want to find an excuse every day to not have to come to this fucking office but still need the job so it’s an endless cycle of miserable

I have been dealing with depression for a few years now and would love to get a diagnosis or something but am under 18 (so cannot go to a doctor myself) but could never bring it up with my parents. What should I do?
i brought it up to my parents and got yelled at and accused of lying and much more. it was hurtful of course but i felt so awful and i wanted and needed help so badly that i didn’t stop bringing it up until they listened or at least understood how much it was affecting me. my mom took me to my regular pediatrician and the journey continued from there so that could be a good first step if possible.  also, you don’t need a diagnosis of depression to start treatment. you could tell your parents that you just haven’t been feeling right and that you want to see a therapist to see if that will help. you don’t have to tell them the specifics if you don’t want to, hopefully they might agree to trying therapy for you. that’s also a good place to start because a therapist can help you understand your feelings and really figure out what’s going on. but if they won’t do that, you can ask to go to your regular doctor and talk to them about depression and they might be able to talk to your parents and help you get on the right track.
My parents would never yell at me or anything. They would most likely be very supportive. I don’t know why, but I could just never bring it up in front of them or really any sort of family member for that matter. I kinda joke around with it with one of my friends who is clinically depressed tho. I still just don’t know why. And it sucks
if that’s the case, your well-being is very important to them and if something were to ever happen they might even blame themselves for not noticing how you were feeling. i would suggest choosing the person/parent/friend you trust the most and telling them how you feel. it can get worse. it’s so important that you tell someone sooner rather than later. i care about your well-being and i understand the feeling that you just can’t talk about it but i really think you should try to get passed that because it’s so important that you let someone know how you’re feeling so you can get help. struggling on your own will only get harder, you need someone to lean on for support and if your parents would support you then please try to talk to them. it is so hard and can be very dangerous when you feel suicidal and feel like you have no one to talk to so please reach out before, and i hope it never happens because it doesn’t always, it gets to that point. they care and would want to know how you’re feeling and it’s just so so important.
i’m also not trying to invalidate your feelings or say it’s easy by any means, but it is so important that you let someone know because it could get worse and i would much rather you have support sooner than later. even with where your depression is now, you shouldn’t be dealing with it alone.

I fell asleep on the couch last night. I didn't want to move. I didn't have the energy really. I woke up this morning to my dog trying her hardest to play with me. That usually makes me somewhat happy but I felt so empty. I still do.   I've been thinking about my own death a lot today. I was thinking maybe I'd be sad, or that the people around me would be sad. But I don't have people, and I'm not really against the idea of ending it. See, my friends all stopped talking to me. I got myself in some trouble a while ago, and I got hurt in the process. A couple of years later, and Im still in pain. My arm shakes, my back kills me. I have a hard time staying on my feet. That's not even what bothers me though. It's the shame I feel. The loss of my career, and my place in an institution that gave me a purpose. I don't have one anymore. I don't have friends, because I don't know how to talk to people. The friends I used to have all put me aside for people that fit thier lives better. So it's just me and my dog now. And I'm tired.   I want to work so badly. I'm skilled, I'm qualified, I'm motivated. But nobody wants me. 134 job applications later and nobody wants me. I used to fix helicopters for pete's sake. I learn quick, I love to work, and keep my hands busy. But I have no opportunity. I can't even get a chance. I don't have felonies, hell even my misdemeanors are just charges and not convictions.   I'm drug and alcohol free. I'm in shape, and average looking. But I lack the ability to speak to people. It terrifies me. If someone wants to talk to me, I always talk back but I can't start a conversation when I have nothing to talk about you know? Nothing interesting is happening in my life and my hobbies are not very popular. I can't take my dog anywhere because I can't afford the gas to go out. So I just stay in. I clean, I cook, I watch tv. I reach out to my old friends but nobody replies. I tried internet dating but that's been a major blow to my self esteem so I just kinda gave up on that avenue.  I'm tired. I'm so out of energy that I can't even feel sad. I thought about how I would kill myself all day today. I thought I would feel upset about the end but it seems like the light at the end of the tunnel at this point. Why do I have this life if I can't do anything with it? I crave social interaction, but am not invited into it. I crave love but don't have any to give. I crave work, but nobody will let me.  I can't turn it around. I've tried. I'm so deeply in debt and am completely crippled socially. But I'm tired of wasting away inside away from happiness. My dog keeps me alive because she deserves the love I have left. But what happens when she's gone? I certainly will be out of my remaining purpose.   I just want to go to sleep and stay asleep. It would be so much easier than waking up angry that I did.   Anyway, today is almost over. Tomorrow is a new day. Maybe I'll find something tomorrow.  Tl;dr - I'm just venting. You don't have to read it.
You know sometimes life is like that i guess gives you a big L. I feel like i can understand you to a certain limit not entirely but enough. You feel like you hate yourself. But it's ok. It's fine. Sometimes you feel like you can't do anything. And that's because of your mentality. Trust yourself more and never give up. Because if you do give up what is supposed to come to you never will. No one in this world is meant to be sad. That's what i like to believe. Through our problems we are molded into people that understand things more. I'm 20. I got kicked out of my school at 16. Went to a new school and was hated by everyone. But i kept a smile on my face the entire time. Even though i wanted to take a knife everyday and just put it through me. But that smile kept me going till now. Even if it's fake just smile more often and it'll change alot of things in your life. Have faith in yourself and your abilities and eventually the world will come in your hands ❤️

If you have a trusted adult other than your parents you should tell them. Could even be a school Dean or teacher. A dean would at least be able to help with you not being able to do schoolwork.

I am 27m, through all my teenage years up till I was ike 25 the thought of socialising made me so uncomfortable I'd always find reasons not too, Ive lost basically all the friends I had growing up and feel like I wasted the part of my life when I was meant to be reckless and have fun and now I'm just getting older. I'm not sure how to deal with this thought, it's all I think about despite me being in a loving relationship with an amazing son. I hate myself for saying this but I am jealous of my partner for having all they experiences when she was younger. I'm not sure I can ever deal with the fact I wasted my life not getting help.
It's never too late and nothing is a waste. That's a fact you are aware now it's time to move forward and appreciate yourself and stop comparing yourself to others. At least that's what I think and an trying to do everyday. You and I have had similar experiences
It's a shame that you missed so much but you've got to move forward. If you were afraid of socialising you must have been afraid of feeling and expressing your uniqueness. Everyone has unique unrealised potential - you just have to look for it. Finding people who have similar experiences will help.

there are lots of apps that offer live chats with therapists and group chats with other people that can relate. i also think it helps to maybe go to your notes app on your phone or make a reddit post where you just type how you feel. there doesn’t need to be a point to it, just a vent so that you can get it out of your head. there is also the suicide hotline, which is obviously more of a last resort for if you’re really not feeling like living and are scared to talk to family or friends.
Parents they'll hate it but bear it for your sake. The only person though who can help you is you.

If "beauty sleep" is a real thing I should wake up in a couple days stunningly beautiful, because I've been sleeping straight for 2 days. My Dr put me on a new med and holy cow it knocks me out. I think it's working because it slows my mind down, but I cannot stay awake. I hope I adjust to it soon. On the bright side all this sleep must be good for me.
[removed]
would it be possible for you to cut the dose in half until you adjust and then increase to the full dose? i know how it is to have that extremely tired side effect and it makes it a lot harder to function. i’m sure you will adjust but if you’re able to cut the dose and then increase i think that would help.
Thanks!
also— you might want to let your doctor know how tired it’s making you if that’s possible.
Of course I'll let him know

My depression got the best of me and I wasn’t giving him as much as he deserved. I feel horrible for neglecting our relationship and he somehow put up with it for this long. I knew a break was needed but I can’t see myself coming back as a better person for him unless a miracle happens.  About a couple months ago I started getting into a really bad state of mind. I no longer found joy in anything real and as a result, I gave up on all things real. I stopped drawing, writing music, playing my instruments, being physically active. Now I spend all my time sleeping or playing games/watching fantasy shows so I can pretend I’m living there instead. That’s the only time I’m alright.  I want to get better and get back to reality, but I feel like there’s nothing to look forward to. I want to pick my guitar back up, I want to start engaging with my friends again, I want to give my wonderful bf a fulfilling relationship like how it was when I was doing better. I’m just not sure how or where to start

Hey everyone,  I recently started experiencing some depression related insomnia and crippling anxiety. Usually this is something I can handle myself, but it’s getting to a point where I don’t even know how to help myself. Is anyone going through a similar stage in life and want to talk about it? Please reach out!
I turn 23 in march and feel the same way, except it's not recent I've felt this way since I was probably 15.   I've been on this road so long, I can probably relate to anything or anyone, I'm pretty good at listening. I'd love to listen to how you're doing and even possibly offer help, and if you're not interested in help, I just wanna listen.   What's today looking like so far?
I dont do night eating anymore. I eat evening dinner much earlier. It kinda works.
What makes you feel depressed? What makes you feel the  way  you feel?
I'm 25 and yeah, I know how you're feeling, and yeah it got worse for me, I honestly sometimes wish I had the balls to step in front of a train or something
That’s helped my insomnia too! Another thing that has helped has been not going to bed until you are absolutely ready to sleep. Try not to stress about how late it is, just listen to your body and go to bed when you’re feeling very tired.
Thanks! I’ll keep that in mind hopefully that will help.
please don’t skip just eat everything but earlier!!!
That’s a really great question, to be honest I’m still figuring out and internally reflecting on what all of these new feelings/anxiety inducing stresses are, where they are coming from and how I can help myself without going to the doctor (ya girl does not have good health insurance).
I’m sorry it’s gotten worse for you, I can only hope things will get better for both of us in the future! If you need someone to talk to/ listen let me know
Food is just a big motivation for the body, you eat at morning its like "yeah now lets work work!" , when you eat early at evening, it goes "%1 battery going offline" at night.
How is your anxiety triggered?  I want to help you.
Thank you, I hope it gets better for you I mean, I feel like a lost cause and I'd feel like a weight so I don't know if you really want to talk you know?
Thank for wanting to help. It seems like I just can’t handle any stressful situation or any decision at all lately. I’ve been struggling at work and turning in my work on time at school especially and even when I can’t decide what to eat or something little like that instead of trying to make a decision I just will decide not to eat instead 🤦🏽‍♀️
What kind of stressful situations do you face on a daily?
I work a busy barista job so that’s my peak point of stress during the day, then it kind of just catapults to something much bigger by the time I get home and have to do my homework.
Catapults into what?
Me being so anxious that I get absolutely nothing done.
Do you get anxious about where your life is headed?     And how are you going to make it in life?
I don’t think I’ve really been thinking that far ahead to be honest, it’s more of a how am I going to get through the day

This has been happening my entire life ever since 6th grade or so. I do not understand it and I have only met one person so far who has the same thing happen to him. His therapist told him he will likely not be able to have a proper relationship and will have to just have friends and family fill into that affection (not romantic of course) aspect of his life.   It's not just stress or anything, I begin to develop depressive symptoms. It's been getting progressively worse and worse and this last go around it got extremely serious and I ended up having to go into a mental hospital because I ended up developing major depressive and anxiety disorder. I had suicidal thoughts practically non stop and it wasn't because of the relationship (it never was one, things were going fine and we were just talking) anymore. Everything was dull and I became extremely irritable.   I recently tried again thinking maybe it was just a hic up but sure enough the same feelings came back almost instantly. I immediately stopped. While I don't have much of a problem with it now and almost feel like I accepted this, I can only picture my future as being alone. I thought I could maybe just have friends and the like and maybe be that cool goofy uncle for my brother's kids but I feel like I'd just feel alone as everyone progressed me in their lives.   Is this perhaps a type of anxiety? Possibly unrelated (?) but I have a very shy bladder to the point that I cannot use the bathroom if anyone is within distance. I end up driving away from school for a few miles just to find a bathroom that is practically secluded and completely private.. it really does affect my every day life as I don't drink enough water as a result and hold it until it physically hurts. And even then I sometimes still can't go. So I'd classify that as a relatively harsh anxiety, I know it's a common one but not common to be this extreme (I think).  In social settings I don't think I have any anxieties but I naturally get a little anxious with relationships. The problem is that anxiety doesn't seem unnatural and seemingly normal, but for some reason things just snowball. Things could be going great, things could be going okay, or things could be going horrible and I'd still end up feeling the same way. I genuinely do not understand it.   I'm not looking for a diagnosis but if anyone else has this or if this is a semi normal thing?
How is your relationship with your parents?
This is interesting and really caught me off guard.  My parents are awesome and incredible!  However, I want to hide everything from them for no reason. My healthy goals, my unhealthy habits, my relationships, my feelings, practically everything. It is another thing I do not understand.  It's also possibly worth noting that my dad is and was often gone throughout my childhood due to the military. He was gone for a 6 month deployment and I didn't miss him. The atomosphere in the house is less tense when he is gone even though he is a good dad and a good person.
So there's stress when you are too close to someone. You say it's not just stress but you even become depressed. Sounds logical to me and there are psychological theories that see depression as an attempt to regulate one's arousal by reducing active engagement in stimulating matters.  Do you feel your parents (esp. father) respect your privacy and independency? It sounds to me as if you feel close relationships are overwhelming you. Maybe you didn't learn to articulate that you need more space when they become too close so your only way out is depression which is a withdrawal from others in a way. Maybe you feel that close/romantic relationships are just too intense and you have a need to downregulate and order the emotional chaos you find yourself in.  Just speculations.

I am 13 and my Mother and Step-father just got out of a brutal divorce. I want to tell my family without it being in a joking manor to my friends. It doesn’t help that 2020 has been a bitch, I lost any point in religion, and am extremely pessimistic. Please someone help me, I know people are going through what I am going through but I just want to curl up in a ball and not exist.
I’m really sorry you’re going through this, I know how you feel wanting to curl up in a ball and not exist. 2020 really was a bitch, and I lost my ability to see a point in anything greater than the suffering this year too. It’s a struggle to maintain any sense of optimism when everything in the world feels like it’s falling apart. When I was a teenager and started feeling really depressed I didn’t tell my mom about it for a long time cause she was dealing with a lot of stress in her life too through my parents splitting up. I talked to her recently about how I used to lay in bed at night alone feeling so anxious and hopeless and just wait for the sun to come up and she told me that she wished I would’ve woken her up and told her so she could’ve helped me. It made me realize that I shouldn’t have kept that all bottled up back then just to spare my family what I considered to be just added stress. It’s not easy talking about depression to anyone, but I think your family would want to be there to support you no matter what’s going on. The pessimism will pass, shitty feelings come and go. All that can be guaranteed is that no feeling will last forever, bad or good. I hope you feel better soon, hang in there.
Hang in there.  Things are rough right now but that won’t always be the case.  You’ll be in a better spot later on - keep thinking about the better days that are on the way.
Thanks and may the rest of your years be filled with good luck my friend
Hard due to my pessimistic view on life but thanks for the support

I keep trying to ring samaritans bc im not feeling good and i have noone and just needed someone to talk to. But i cant get past letting it ring for more than 40 seconds before i get too nervous and hang up. Ive never called them before and its really scary
Do you want to talk a bit here ? It's not that much but it's better than nothing.  >samaritans  What is it ? An association where you live ?
If it's a helpline, they're there to help, and will gladly talk to help you! I hope that if you feel the need to talk, even if just to a friend, or a parent, call them, if they don't answer, try again in a while!
Sometimes it feels like if we don’t take it seriously, if we don’t make that call and say it out loud then it will disappear- but it doesn’t. Don’t fall into that trap
Talk to us here.  We've got your back.
Its a uk suicide helpline. Ive never called them before
Id never thought of it that way. Thinking about it like that made it seem easier for me to call if i need to in future again :) thanks
Ho. Why are you scared of calling them ?

My depression steals life from me. I look in the mirror and see a disgusting face, an overweight body, a failing student, a useless life, an unworthy girlfriend, a disappointment to my parents, and an empty shell.   I can never feel confident about my face, body, and style. I'm terrified that I'm overweight, and that I'll never look good enough for anyone. This is what bugs me the most. I never feel pretty, I never feel comfortable, and the only way I'll go into public is if I'm wearing a full face of makeup and baggy clothes. I've had some people on reddit tell me I look okay, but I've had so many tell me I'm ugly and disgusting. I just want to feel okay for once, but I can't.
Nah, you're definitely seeing ME in the mirror... 😕
It will never get better if you continue to let these types of thoughts dominate you. Its okay to feel these emotions of unworthiness and self-hate, but try to use these feelings as motivators to improve yourself. Also, fuck trying to get validation from other people. What matters the most if how you feel about yourself.
Nah, I'm sure you're beautiful <3

I'm completely stuck. I have been deeply mentally unwell for about 17 years now. I have been physically unwell during this time period. Without going into too much detail I think I have tried everything and I am only getting worse.  I don't know what to do next. I drop off into a mental abyss and see nothing. This either makes me very internally isolated and numb, outwardly painfully anxious and phobic or in a deep despair that makes me want to end it all there and then.  I have sought help multiple times and have tried antidepressants, anti anxiety drugs, CBT,  counselling, exercise, natural supplements, meditation, diet changes etc etc.  I am in the UK and I used the NHS to seek help again last year. After a year of being batted back and forth I eventually was sent to see a psychotherapist. I knew I desperately needed help after being as close as I've ever been to a suicide attempt. I very nearly went through with it. I went in and saw this very intense woman and she had 3 other women with her all watching and making notes. After an hour she told me I just need to take responsibility for my life, that because I've tried antidepressants and they didn't work there was nothing they could do and that I'm not depressed I'm just morose. I was intimidated, humiliated and came out utterly hopeless.  I just don't know where to turn. I feel I've hit a dead end and can't take things anymore.

I posted this earlier on r/trueoffmychest but i wanted to see if people here shate similar experiences   Ive been struggling with depression since my early teens. Its a constant feeling but I tend to go through bouts a few times a month where i flip between feeling numb and really sad all day. I take medication for depression. It helps a bit but whenever I have a crappy sleep i just go through this awful cycle for a day or two. It feels like i have a void within me on such days.  Throughout the day I always feel an intense need to do something that will make me feel something other than the numbness. My obvious go to is either sex or alcohol. I seem to want those things even more on these particular days. I'm pretty much numb emotionally except for desire.  Whenever i have sex with my partner on these days i can't enjoy it physically or mentally no matter how much i want to. The desire is there but otherwise theres just a feeling of nothingness... like I'm empty. My partner can always tell, they stop frequently to ask whether i want to continue. Its obvious neither of us get too much enjoyment out of the moment. Yet whenever my partner turns me down on these days, I'm usually saddened... upset... even though i know i won't enjoy it and it won't give me what i truly need. My sex drive is higher than my partner's so maybe thats why i feel the need to have sex in these situations regardless of how i feel in the moment... in hopes that it might help this time. If sex doesn't happen i just look at porn for a bit. That doesn't help either but i guess i don't really expect it to.   Then i turn to alcohol. I usually have only one or two drinks. It helps temporarily but then it only drives me deeper into sadness, go figure. I always have my partners voice in the back of my head telling me i don't need to drink any more. I definitely see huge signs pointing towards alcoholic tendencies but so far the words of wisdom from my partner have kept me from going down that path. I always want more. I crave more sometimes. Thankfully i am still able to back off and know when enough is enough.   Nothing i do ever seems to fill the void i feel. A few days later I'm back to normal. Does this happen to anyone else?

Im living in Finland with my dad and my mother lives in Estonia with my sister and a brother. Recently I visited them for 2weeks and been visiting them for the last 3 years as I only visit them 2 times a year since of school and work. Well I came back home today and been feeling sad because of the fun things we did together and memories. My step dad (who lives with my mother) is also a cool guy. Basically I have 2 homes. The thing is that everytime I come back after visiting my mother and friends I feel like shit and sad for a whole month. Even though I know I will see them again in the summer and this might sound weird but my mom washed my hoodie the other day and when I came back home I smelled it and my eyes started watering. The smell just reminds me of my other home (where my mom lives)
I understand that you are doing your best to manage. Sometimes even the smell of loved ones is a lovely reminder of memories.  I think you've made the right decision to admit you are feeling this way.  It's okay and usually quite normal. Often you feel better after a while. Have you spoken to your parents about this? Or other family members? Perhaps they will be able to help you more. I'm sure both families care for you.  Keep going and stay safe.

I've been battling depression for over 7 years now, in therapy for over than 3 years. I live alone, i can't sustain any kind of a relationship, I have a weak will. I wanna give up. And one thing for sure, is that I'm gonna quit my job soon. It's my only source of income, and though my boss is supportive and understanding, I can't continue to take advantage.

I dont want to do anything. I dont want to hang out with anyone. Im losing touch with everyone i know and the loneliness is driving me insane and making me overthink. Like how much of a loser i am for being so reclused, shy, and avoidant. i feel like theres just no point in anything and my lack of motivation is so frustrating. What is there to do even when you dont want to talk to anyone or do anything. I have no energy so I get out of bed at like 6 pm and my only distractions are music, youtube, and tiktok. And when i do talk to people my voice cracks since i barely talk and i keep worrying about what they think of me, and how i can seem like im normal and basically the opposite of depressed and anxious.

I went down a bad rabbit hole in terms of gore/bloodshed. It’s both terrifying, depressing, and amazing that someone’s life can be taken away instantly.   Starting to hate life more and more and coming to this understanding, idk. It makes me feel like I can just end it and it’ll be that.   All I ever wanted to was to be known and remembered by everyone. I’ve always wanted to be known in a community, known by lots of people. I’ve come to terms that even so people will forget your death. Just like any other random person that passes.  In the end I think we all just die out. I could get shot in the head and bam my whole life’s achievements out the drain. Boom you have cancer, good luck! It’s cruel but it’s the reality I think I don’t want to find out by someone else’s doing.

Today's flavor of depression is apparently empathizing with the bad guy in films and totally thinking how it's understandable how they got there and how I could easily get there as well. And sometimes thinking they might not really be the bad guys, that the film is framing them.
Films are films for a reason because they are not real bad guys and not depicted how they really are in reality
For me my depression has been making me feel like a bad guy at every opportunity lately. So I think it's almost trying to normalize being bad or evil so I'll accept that part of me.   It just leave me wondering sometimes tho. Am I a bad guy that thinks they're the good guy? Or am I a good guy that's dealing with his shadow...
Probably just dealing with your shadow m8

Im 24 years old and I feel like my life is over. I don’t have any friends, I don’t have a boyfriend and I’m all by myself. I wasted my university years being too mentally ill to have fun like a normal person. And I had a binge eating disorder that made me gain almost 50 pounds when I started university. The opportunity was there to go out, have fun and make friends and I didn’t do it. Instead I wasted those years just being sick, obsessed with how I looked and what everyone thought about me but I never did anything to change it. I’ll never forgive myself for throwing away what should have been the best years of my life.  I no longer see a future where I can be happy. Even when I was really sick, I used to have goals. I used to be able to work towards things because I believed things would get better and I’d eventually be happy. But it hasn’t happened, and somewhere along the way I stopped believing that it ever would. I think that even if I get everything I ever wanted, and even if I become the person I want to be, I will still be miserable. It’s so hard to keep going because I don’t know why I’m still going. I truly don’t see a future for myself anymore so what’s the point.
Same here. I see zero hope at all, everything just goes from bad to worse. Why should I keep going. I don’t even get out of bed anymore.
Same I’m 23 and life is really exhausting with very little reward.  I’m just existing with very little purpose

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l04db2/moonlight_sonata/
Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven speaks a lot about what I feel. Whenever someone asks me on how I view depression, I just tell them this.  Moonlight Sonata has 3 movements. I am imagining them as a three horizontal parallel lines (2nd movement on top, 1st mvmt on middle, 3rd mvmt on bottom).  The 1st movement sounds sad but in a calm manner. The type of sadness that you know will just past. That is what I feel all the time (except for the sadness that will eventually go away feeling if that makes sense because I know for sure this would be a long journey lol). Neutral but there are still "mild" high and loud parts, and also the low ones. Awhile ago, I realized that I don't really feel any emotions. I just dictate word per word to myself what should I feel and how should I react to a current situation then completely mask the hollowness with that instruction. That's why I see it as the middle line, neutral. I feel somehow safe here.  The 2nd movement sounds cheerful and joyful. Genuine happiness, but there are still hints of that sadness. This sounds like the moments I really want to enjoy. But there's a catch... it's the shortest one. :(  The 3rd movement sounds so heavy. Literally DUN DUN DUN DUN. There are times that your mind suddenly just want you to bring somewhere down there, really deep imaginary places. It's heavy on the chest and lots and lots of breakdowns without knowing why. AND without knowing why leads to overanalyzing everything that is happening in your life. That even the most trivial things become devastating. This is like how the sound (I don't know the right term) changes a lot of times. Different thoughts keep coming in to shred you. There are parts on this movement that you'll hear a bit of hope and sensing that you're almost there somewhere comforting, but then a second later, it's actually not. It just spiraled back to the shitty start. Also, this sounds raging and that's what I mostly feel towards myself while on this level, which is the third and lowest line on my imaginary horizontally parallel lines. Ones I'm here, it's so hard to come back up.  Moonlight Sonata has always been somehow calming for me and now I kinda figured out why. I guess the emotions left in me automatically connects to this music :D
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0burj/told_my_mom_i_was_suicidal/
About 2 years ago, I think, I was suicidal. It was due to our family's declining financial status (also because my sister cannot get the college degree that she wants, long story but I blame myself for it) . I remember myself having my thighs (sometimes wrists) cut using razor blades and cutters. No one knew this except me. There were also times when, on the way to school, I got to a rooftop of a mall and thought of jumping, ending it all there. Even to this day I don't have the "motivation" to get out of depression, but I still managed to "partly" get out of it. I think I did it with the help of books and working out but I don't think I've gone away from all of it.   My sister wants to be a nurse yet she is taking an engineering course at the moment. She chose to study engineering for it was one of the very few courses that is offered on the state college she was attending to.   Today my sister was arguing with my mom about school, she wants to shift courses, they've had this since last year, I talked to my mother afterwards. I told her to not push her too much. I'm worried about her getting to the same position as me. I told her that I noticed my sister being too sad these past few months and suicide is a very real thing. She shouted at me and told that I was stupid. That suicide is a fool's way of taking in things. Maybe she was right. Then I told her that I was suicidal in the past. I don't know if she believed in me but she became more infuriated. The only thing I can remember is her furious face, I believe she was also saying things. Before, I was ready to show her the scars I got from self-harm but her reaction was unexpected. I shutted myself and sat. To be honest, I have trouble remembering what was it like in that moment.  I think I'm starting to again fall into the abyss of suicidal thoughts. This wasn't the only event that transipred but this was one of the significant ones. Maybe it's all in my head. I think I'm fucking myself up even more because of what I am thinking but I do not know what else to do. I'm aware that I may be deluded by what I am thinking but... I dont know anymore.  My life is full of this kind of shit. I'm tired of it. Plus, maybe if I die, my sister could go to a medschool since they won't have to spend their money on me or my education.  Just wanted to share. Don't worry about me I'll think about this more throughly.  If you are wondering why are our parents still paying for our college it is because we live in the Philippines. Search it up, there are numerous accounts (of this culture) in the internet.
Hang in there man. Suicide is a real thing. Stay strong
Thanks mate❤️

I don't expect therapy to solve my problems. Honestly I dont even think they can do anything besides give prescription for anti-depressants. People of reddit I'm open to hear your experiences with therapy...
I started with a new therapist today and have gone to therapy in the past. I’ve found that if you find the right provider for you it’s worth it. It may take a while to find someone you’re comfortable talking to but I have found that having someone with no bias in your corner is helpful.
Depends what kind of help you need. I think they can most help people who haven't even identified or sorted out their own thoughts and problems yet. If you are an overly analytical person who has already examined everything a million times, if you don't have some deep dark repressed memory that a therapist needs to help you dig out, then I think there is less that they can help with. Somewhere I got the misguided idea that they ever offer actionable advice, that they tell you what to do based on the information you give them, but they pretty  much just sit there and want you to find your own answers. Or like you said the other option is just if they provide you an avenue to getting medication if you think you need it. I didn't get much out of therapy, and at least one person in my family has spent their life going to therapists and never really solved any of their problems. But I am not saying this to suggest not trying it. It's definitely worth trying to see if you are someone it will benefit. Plus you can't generalize about "therapists", there are skilled ones and there are bad ones, so other people's experiences don't really matter, it all depends on the specific person you end up seeing.
I went to therapy a while back because of issues with my dad . I would watch the way he talked to other women and it hurt because they were family . He would verbally abuse them and I would have to watch it . It soon became too much and my mom would find me hiding somewhere, having to drag me across the floor, into the car because I had no desire to be with him . she took me to therapy and that seemed to help . this was when I was 8 and so I don't have that much memory of it . it helped me a while ago but I'm not sure if it still would, as it's harder for me to talk about it now . I'm dealing with some things right now and will eventually have to go back . I look at therapy as just a friend who essentially tries to help you with your problems and listen or give advice . that is hard for some people because it could be more difficult for them to open up with someone they don't know or trust 100% .
I would personally say yes. It’s expensive, but if you can afford it, it can be very worthwhile. Therapy has helped me a lot.
I was in a very tough place.  I saw a councillor and through talking and through Prozac things got better.  Still have depression always tugging at me but for the most part I can stop it from going too far down.  That’s what I experienced.  I recommend therapy.  As for Prozac, I’m no doctor so I can’t give advice on antidepressants.  Hope this helped you a bit.
That's nice to hear. Completely forgot about the bias that therapist could have towards their patients.
I would say I over think every little detail, but I feel as though that me doing so has made me lost in all my thoughts. Thats why ive been thinking about therapy to see if they could help me sort my though, and make the next step forward.
I meant a counselor/therapist has really no skin in the game in terms of your reason for being there. Whereas family and friends and gonna always placate you and tell you what you want to hear. That third party will give you the honestly you need.
Barely understand but I think I get the general gist of it and from i could understand I think you are right.
It’s hard to take that step and go to talk to someone. When you’re ready, go for it. Don’t let anyone make you feel bad about doing so either.

I feel like I can physically feel it. All that emptyness is slowly killing me.
Same, I wish it was over already
Talk to someone. Anyone, a stranger from the internet, a person from a help line, many people are in the same boat, and going at it alone isn't any good.
You have to fill it with love. Maybe get a dog or a cat or find a hobby. Call someone who cares about you and say how you love them. Call an old friend with whom you haven’t talked for a long time and ask how they’re doing. Just try to find ways to fill that hole.

I [F, 25] just had it hit me that... I've almost gone 2 days without eating anything. I struggle with a cocktail hell of a diagnosis of Depression, PTSD, and Generalized Anxiety, and I've been in the middle of a serious episode lately.   I've been feeling horrible about my life, myself, and my future. A fight with one of my best friends earlier today really didn't help things, and I've sunk into an even lower, and, if I'm honest, much darker place. Just feeling like a bitch you know? Overall, just an extra shitty day to another shitty part few weeks.  But the reason I'm writing this is that... the last few days I've lost my desire to eat. Like entirely. I'm coming up on two full days without even a spec of food. I rarely feel hungry, and when I do I lack any motivation to eat at all. Nothing sounds good either. And, well, I could really use some encouragement or advice on that.  I just... I don't want this to become a medical emergency and I'm scared I'll slip into an even darker place soon... I just... I need help.
Eat something!  Do it!  Don’t search for a reason - just do it!
In the past, I force myself to eat small frequent meals. Other option is using a meal supplement like Boost or Ensure.
Set an alarm every few hours to eat something.

Nobody calls, nobody texts, nobody cares.  Why do I even bother?   You get close to someone and you’re filled with this mysterious thrill of emotion. You start to feel like somebody cares. That you’re not alone. That there is somebody watching with this oddly distinct feeling deceiving you. You begin to question reality, but this is it.  Self-blame, self-hatred, self-isolation.  I was lied to.   You’re confused. You want answers; Where did it all go wrong? You blame yourself. You’re ashamed. You hate yourself. It’s your fault for ending up like this. Nobody likes you. Trapped. Can’t breathe. You hide yourself from the world. It was never meant to be this way.  Lost, troubled, disoriented.  Where do you go? What are you supposed to do? No motivation. Everything is a blur. You want signs, directions, a pathway. Nothing. You’re hopeless. Is this life? Nothing remains, it’s over. There are no choices left. It’s better to die painlessly than to be alive suffering.
Life is so depressing
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l01b4k/going_to_a_party_while_being_terribly_depressed/
So yesterday I decided going to a techno party but the past few weeks I've been feeling like total shit, I do not care about my life at all, so I got wasted, no surprise, I just didn't want to feel anything and I wanted to forget about everything, I did coke, xanax and shrooms and just got completely lost, the next day I couldn't believe that I did those things because I usually know how to control myself and to say, the worst thing is that I don't regret it, I was so lost that all my problems dissapeared.
wow. did they sell drugs there? how can you even get all this stuff lol. anyway, be more careful , but i understand the desire to not feel pain and to not feel lucid
sounds like me. Just makes it a lot worse honestly. Did molly this weekend and instead of making me feel happy it amplified my depression, made me suicidal and gave me panic attacks. guess there was no serotonin for my brain to release.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzdrh4/a_tip_for_you_guys/
Get off this subreddit if you're depressed. It sounds counterintuitive, but just do it. Seeing people who are going through the same thing as you is very comforting at first, but over time it instills a sense of hopelessness over time. That you're never going to get out of depression, because you're surrounded by so many people who are seemingly stuck.  If you're here to help, you are an angel. Take care of yourself.  If you're here for help, try not to linger here too long.  Edit: I'm going to try to read all the longer comments, or at least updoot them. I didn't expect my inbox to blow up. Thank you for responding if you did
r/depression is absolutely a double-edged sword, you are completely right...
reading through this sub, reading what other ppl r experiencing help me realize / understand what I'm going through. once in a while it clicks like, "oh, thats explains what im going through". it helps me to understand myself better.   perhaps it will help me overcome some of the things im going through
I disagree, I came to subs like this in my lowest point. I got through it with the help of Redditors and I now have the privilege of helping others going through that now.
I gave up hope long before I found this sub, so I see no reason why I should leave
Absolutely agree. I joined this subreddit some months ago when I first joined Reddit, and I thought it was nice to be a part of such subreddit because it would make me feel less alone about my struggle with depression. But after a bit time I started to realize that it only would make me feel more shitty because when I opened reddit (and would be in a fairly good mood) I would see some post about suicidal thoughts and other depressing thoughts from this subreddit, and it would really fuck up my entire mood and remind me about my struggles.
I'm here to feel sadder
i think you’re doing something rather dangerous with this post: assuming you know the minds of others, and how they will respond to even a single given factor. the simple truth is you don’t. it is not possible for you to. you may be trying to help, but you need to temper all advice with the conditional. if someone who doesn’t know their own mind listens to you, but the exact opposite behaviour would have saved them from something awful, you will have hindered—whether your intentions were well meant or not. all depression is different because all people are different. what works for you is not by any means sure to work for everyone else. i had times over the last couple of years when this sub was the only place to turn for answers and for solidarity.   for those of you in hell right now, if you are not sure what helps you, try things, and try to observe what works and what doesn’t. those things that work will eventually become your crisis strategy—which may or may not change over time as your needs change and you learn more about yourself and your particular brand of depression.
It really doesn't matter one way or another. Life is still a stupid thing.
This subreddit is important, it's so important we know other people feel the same way. Things are starting to feel better for me, though I was at one point trying to build up courage to muffin-top myself. Get your fill, realize millions feel the struggle, and then hopefully make a plan and defeat this shit everyone. Leave when IT'S TIME.
It’s like something my therapist told me a while ago before I was almost forcefully admitted. My parents wanted to put me in a ward but my therapist talked them out of it because being surrounded by it 24/7 could possibly make everything worse.
I feel like there are also helpful posts on here and comments. Encouraging threads.
Some of these posts have been really triggering
I only say helpful things on here, but I admit reading these is hard on me. I have my own problems going on and I find my emotions being more intense here
Honestly, the depression meme subreddits do more for me than this one. It sounds harsh, but it feels like I'm just reading peoples pity parties. Like I know thats the point, and they need that, but its not what i need..
Is it weird that I have been depressed for so long, it's almost like my brain **wants** to be sad? Like it almost craves it
Thanks for pointing out.  As someone who has been thru depression I think this is a vital info. :)
I like the memes on this subreddit because I see myself in them. I lost hope long ago but some memes help me to explain it to people who may care about me. Also I feel like the memes are the only ones who understand me
Wanted to say this but thought I'd be down voted to oblivion. This is extremely true.
I agree. See you tomorrow.
Here to help. I try to help the best I can
I come here as I for once feel accepted and can open up to anyone, I can tell things I would never tell anyone as I'm staying anonymous here, and always intended on doing so, because nobody wants to listen to me anywhere else anyways.
Your tip is good but I'll try to improve saying that you should not let none of this posts let affect you, I mean, if u can help with an useful comment do it, but focus on your own life and try to improve something for real everyday in your life, make at least a small movement but remember it and apply it in your life. If you are going to be here please stay but in a positive way learning and helping others, dont let the someones life reaffirm your depression and using it to stay in the line of "woah this world sucks" we need to get out of here asap but being realistic and working, yall can make it i wish the best for you all
I'm sure it's a different experience for everybody, but based on the comments it seems that a lot of people are relating to what you say.
100% true.  Also if you are starting antidepressants DO NOT READ UP ON BAD STORIES AND SIDE EFFECTS!!  Most people start to think they are getting the side effects when really its your anxiety making you think you are.  The general rule is if you notice a side effect without thinking about it, it means its real and a real concern.  I stay on these forums because I like to help others since I'm older and have tried many meds. I am in a state of helping but also sometimes think about leaving when I see the same posts. I will leave at some point but not just yet. I like to soak in everything first.  The depressing posts dont annoy me its more the fact its the same thing with not much new original posts.
I am here to help mostly, but I get what you’re saying. It’s comforting to find people who feel the same, but you should also hang out on some of the chill subreddits that have to do with maybe a hobby or random interest of yours just to keep yourself in an okay mindset when you need it. I personally love memes
I made a friend through this sub 3 years, one of my best mates. He was someone that understood depression on a level I thought I only knew of.  Its important to be mindful. If social media is heavy impacting you then a break is good in general
Doesn't matter, the next day or week is gonna be any less of the hell it usually is just by not coming on this sub reddit.
I totally disagree with you. I think everybody is different so your opinion is a narrow perspective you should probably think about all the different people involved and how actually talking about what’s really going on is not only healthy it’s part of the healing process. If someone is stuck in the process then they need to be stuck for awhile. It’s different for everybody. I have seen people talk about some real shit on here. so I’m going to encourage the real topics unlike this one. I also don’t appreciate you segregating us and them. Like “if you’re here to help your an angle.” See now you sound superior and have made it an “us” and “them.” When no one is better than anyone. Last time I checked there’s no cure for depression it’s ongoing process that everybody experiences off and on. So for you to be here to help It’s kind of confusing. I feel like everybody should be here because they can relate not because they think they know what other people should do. Everybody is different. You should post this on unpopular opinion. It’s kind of discouraging. it’s a depression blog. I would never make the Decision for other people. Kind of arrogant. I know there’s been quite a few times I’ve been looking for a rope to hang myself with and this group was talking about some real shit and it saved my life. Multiple times. I mean that. To think about people Not posting things because of someone’s perspective. It could actually be pretty detrimental to the process. We are all angels here...these conversations need to happen. Everybody struggles with depression in different ways Even the people “here to help.”  “thoes other people” let’s be honest statements like these focused on making the “depressed” feel like an outcast and sick. The mental health field has been doing this since the beginning. Sending people away. Making them feel alone and wrong and ashamed. Everybody is the same everybody feels like shit sometimes. The more approachable we make it the more people will feel comfortable with getting help. The more uncomfortable conversations the more solutions and knowledge. You should start a group and call it “shit you shouldn’t say.”
Not a bad idea. Changing up shit rules
Good advice. I come here for comfort when I feel lost and alone and in the end I just leave feeling worse.
Everyone here has become comfortable talking about their problems and I think that’s great to start off your journey to becoming healthier but the only way things will get better is if you take the experience from here and move on to something better. Being content with just talking about being miserable and not fixing it will leave you stuck here forever
You’re so right!
SO TRUE! Make it happen! I've been trying so hard to turn my life around. This post really helps me a lot! I was thinking about all this lately as well! Thanks for sharing!
you're probably right..
Agreed. It was cool at first but I wasn't getting better.
I actually legit experienced that after my first post, thx for stating the facts
I agree with you to a certain extent. I thought I was getting better by reading the posts here, but it actually gave me ideas to become that way and attempt SH or whatever.
kinda agree with you, but when i see other depressed people, i like to give them my sincere thoughts, try to help even if it's just by text or giving some advice and it makes me a little bit happy inside.
It's comforting to not feel alone.
Why tf would I leave? I've already lost hope. I want to get to know some people who are on the same level as I am.
It's a delicate balance, just like life. Sometimes we need help, sometimes we need to know we're not alone. Sometimes we can help, sometimes we can't, and that's fine. What's important is to be mindful of how we're feeling, know and understand our boundaries (which are not fixed from one moment to the next), put on the oxygen mask on ourselves first, and then give something back (a kind word, a safe space, a metoo). Be well, take care of yourselves
Correcto mundo
You’re so right. I have this second account just for negative subreddits where I can vent. Otherwise it eats at me.
I was thinking this recently
It’s a prisoners’ island
Reddit platform is trash anyways, I’m just here for memes
This sub has helped me when I'm having an episode by reminding me there are others who know what it's like & can relate. I do respond here & there. But I only spend so much time in this thread & no longer...stay here & scroll for too long & the hopelessness will get to you.
Agreed. At first when you're still coming to grips with what you're dealing with, chatting online is helpful. But once you've had it a while and are trying not to fall further, the stories can be very triggering
I agree, it makes me cry when I read some of this stuff because I realise my experiences are so similar to other people
[removed]
I can't. I crave validation that i'm not alone in my feelings.
So I came here become I’m having a bad one of many in a bad week. Weird but seeing this post somehow made me feel better. Some paradox that is. Like I shouldn’t be here. This isn’t a place to come when you are down and having those thoughts. OP should probably be pinned if that’s a thing.
From a scientific and psychology based standpoint, you are 100% correct. Thank you for the reminder.
Very nice of you to give something back <3
Same. I was talking w a friend tonight who is struggling w being bi, and I told him to go on Reddit because it often helps me when I’m at my Lowest point
Yes.
Yeah, same. It's like I want to be more miserable, because whether I want it or not, it only keeps getting worse anyway, so I might as well just want that.
Yep that's absolutely me
Thank you 🙏! Well said.
I did accidentally generalize people. It was a little arrogant, I apologize. Thank you for pointing this out, I agree
Stupid and meaningless are two different things, so if you want meaning you have to determine it for yourself.
And I was arrested like a criminal  and taken to the ward  for a month by parents as my psychiatrist suggested  it.
Your therapist made the right choice
Yes, those are great
/r/soulcrushingjuice
I think it's because you'd subconsiously prefer to feel sadness than feel nothing.  ^(also, I'm just a thriteen year old spewing whatever crap comes to mind. don't take anything I say too seriously.)
Glad you agree :\]
Sometimes it's like the memes explain it better than I'd ever be able to with words honestly.
wait, there are memes on this sub? wut
I wasn't expecting much either, but it's true with some people
thank you for doing that
It's good to open up to people. I hope you can find the help you need here.
Yep, I've gotten a few comments saying I generalized people on this subreddit, and I kind of did. updoot for you.
I apologize for wording stuff wrong. Separating people was never my intention, and I agree that this subreddit is very good for getting help. It's just usually not beneficial to casually scroll through and think "wow there are so many people like me here". Thank you for giving me your perspective.  ^(Keep in mind, I'm thirteen years old so stuff I say should be taken with a lot of salt.)
Glad to help ;D
It's comforting, but not good for some people in the long run.
haha, that's a good way to think about it
Yeah it does trigger my depression sometimes or makes it worse
I found out I’m bi this year, I had the same struggle. I still do a little bit, but r/bisexual and r/lgbt definitely helped me understand and deal with it
well, i hope i didn’t lay it on too thick. i know how it is when one has a revelation—and all that enthusiasm bunches up and makes one want to help. i just know that absolutely the most important thing one can learn with regard to one’s mental illness is to stop condemning oneself because one believes one is falling short of some imagined standard—any standard at all (even if it is meant to help).
Very true. Similar advice saved my life years ago.
That's horrible, I hope things are better now
That's a good theory, you're probably right.
My bad.  I thought this was another subreddit. Memes you can find on depression memes
Then again, based on the reactions, it seems that you hit the nail on the head for a lot of folks! Thank you for your contribution, I'm sure lots of folks needed to read it.

I am having another breakdown. My meds aren’t working. I stopped taking one and haven’t refilled it because there has been no difference. My relationship is failing and it’s because of me. I can’t cope, figure out ways to manage my symptoms, I’m becoming toxic to my husband. I’m a terrible mother because my daughter has witnessed me multiple times break down. Even when I pretend I wasn’t just crying in the other room she can tell something is wrong. I can see it all over her. I ask her if she’s ok and she tells me yes but the look on her face makes me think otherwise. I hug her tighter so she feels better. I’m an awful mother. I’m hurting my daughter because of my own actions. The solutions are obvious. Get therapy. Ignore the voices in my head telling me I’m awful. Don’t fall prey to toxic behavior. Stop picking fights or assuming my husband doesn’t love me when We are fighting. I’m crying while writing this. I just cut myself. I use to do it on my hip so no one could see but now I’m moved to my arm. Because I want someone to see it. That isn’t right. That is so fucked up of me to think or want but I did it. I can’t be a good person by continuing this but I’m a coward. My husband can’t take it anymore and I don’t blame him. He’s right. I’m stupid. I’m a dumbass. He’s right about me being an adult and needing to act like one. I’m 30 years old and I am cutting myself and crying like a teenager. An adult doesn’t do this. I’m too immature and childish. What do I do? If I die, I hurt my daughter beyond words but being alive isn’t doing her much better. I’m an awful parent. Please some one help me

I don't really know what's going on. These feelings that I am feeling right now have gradually built up over like the past 6-7 months. I just feel like I am in a daze. Everyday I have a slight headache. I lack energy and motivation. I did not always feel this way. Prior to this period I felt happy and energized. I've gone through depressive periods, but they were always temporary. This has not been going away. I wake up and dread going to work everyday. I feel like I am just existing, not living. I'm only 23.  I just want to get my energy back and feel happy again. I don't want to continue going on in this state.

i’m a first year university student. my flat at halls is empty. ive made two friends and i’ve realised we aren’t right for each other, since we sit in awkward silences all the time. i’m grasping at anything to pretend i’m not lonely. i don’t want to live at home because of my parents. i’m always scared of bringing the virus home to them. so i’m stuck here. never met anyone on my course, no friends, no flatmates, and a dark small room to waste away in. someone please make me feel less alone, cheer me up, anything
Things will get better.  You will find people and friends that will be a good fit for you.  It takes time.  Sometimes it takes a very long time but it will happen.  You will be in a better place - just keep holding on to that.

I wake up in bed with my outside clothes to go to my TMS therapy. The minute I come back from therapy I immediately want to go into bed. I have a bunch of laundry slowly taking up a corner which I am trying to wash little by little but I think to myself why bother? I'm unemployed, not in school because I owe money, and most of all stuck at home. There are times when I feel glad I'm unemployed because I want to treat my days like a mini vacation. But then the despair sets in and I realize I am wasting a lot of time. Covid has not been helping the situation but oddly I feel better that we are all inside if that makes sense? It's like if the world stopped turning and we are all experiencing it at the same time. Society is shut down and weirdly I feel better knowing I don't have to interact with anyone. But then again my despair hits and I realize I have no routine, no lifeline to keep me in check with daily normal tasks like brushing my teeth and showering. No work, no school= no routine. So this is my dilemma.  I think I've hit a wall again and it's harder to surpass this time. How does one do something soley for themselves? Not for a job or school or keeping a routine based around these things but just for myself? I just thought how all of my routines surrounded other things and my motivations weren't for my own self care but rather to keep up with myself.I never use these routines for my own benefit or keep up with them with the sole intent that it's for my care. And now I've lost all semblance of a routine or a regular schedule in all areas of life.  I would love it if I actually cared about myself enough to warrant these changes with my own will and motivation but I have none.

I don't think I can go on for much longer, I don't have a terrible life, I have family and some friends, but I don't feel like I deserve nor need it, I don't enjoy food anymore, my grades are dropping and I don't go out anymore, I rarely talk to people, and I've seriously considered suicide, multiple times a day. It's not like I don't have the courage to die, It's that I *want* to die, I don't see any point in living if all that I have to look forward to is death anyway, I just don't want to deal with all the shit thrown at you along the way. Does anyone else feel this way, too?
Yes. Every day. I’ve had good life with a lot to be thankful for but I always just feel so hopelessly alone. Almost every single night I think about how it would be so much easier to die. I think I’ve just been putting it off until the point when my life finally becomes so bad there’s no turning it around. Part of me wants to hope it will get better. Part of me wants to spend all my money and go on a wild ride for a month then die. And part of me just doesn’t care about anything anymore. Really all I want is that one special person I can dedicate my life to but that’s like trying to win the lottery. It’s just not gonna happen
I can relate with constantly wanting to throw the towel in, it’s a sucky feeling. But idk, there are those moments that are worth living for, even if they come far and between
I feel you, I have not had an amazing life but for sure better than many people could say. I should be happy because I am currently in college and I do have hopes and dreams. But I can't see any of those dreams ever coming true. I have close to zero friends, I can barley socialize, and I don't have any hope of myself getting through college. I feel like I am too much of a worthless piece of shit who will never be happy or accomplish anything. Sadly the most likely future I see for myself is another mental breakdown that pushes me over the edge and then it will all be over.
I get that, It's shit, but here's the thing, I don't want to find something or someone to live for, I'll only end up disappointing them too
Even if there are those moments, I don't think there's enough of them to look forward to, the 'bad' outweighs the 'good' in this scenario
Yeah, I don't have mental breakdowns or panic attacks, I'm completely sane and rational when I plan it out, that's what terrifies me, that I know that I mean it and genuinely want to commit.
Maybe your right. But maybe that person doesn’t care and they just want to be with you. Maybe you make each other happy and better people. Maybe nothing else matters in life because you both understand each other. Just gotta give it a chance
Yeah, it is definitely not easy. What and when would you say your last good moment was?
I have never really planned it out, I'm normally always depressed and have those thought's in the back of my mind. Its during those breakdowns where I can release everything I have pent up and lets me seriously think about ending it. I fully mean it so I don't know why I have not done it, I must have some slight hope that the next day won't be painful like usual.
Sure, but I haven't ever met someone who hasn't left me because I was a letdown
Maybe around 11, 12
Hmm... Makes sense, but I don't see myself letting out pent up stress by crying or hyperventilating, I usually go out and play a bit of volleyball. I guess that's why I haven't died yet. Because I want to play volleyball. And I hope that you'll eventually have a great day, and do great things.
I haven’t even been in a real relationship. All I have is a glimmer of hope but I’m keeping it alive because it’s my last
I’m not sure if a lot of time has passed since then, but it’s something right?
Thanks man, I hope you have a better day than the last and feel better :)
That's what separates humans from each other. Hope. You need to hold on to that glimmer of hope, cause it's all you have, but I don't have any hope, I'm just a shell, empty and cold with nothing to my name.
Not really, I was just in a bit of a better mood than before, and that's because I had gotten my favorite food for the first time in forever
I think deep down you have hope. I hope I’m not being annoying. I just hate when people feel bad. All I want is to help
good food always helps, what’s the food that you got?
1. I might have the tiniest sliver of hope, waiting for someone to "rescue" me 2. You're not being annoying 3. Good thing, that you wanna help people
Meatloaf, weird, I know
Thanks. I hope you find happiness
Lol ain’t nothing wrong with some good meatloaf
To you as well
Nothing at all, but some people seem to think otherwise
Who cares what other people think, if you enjoy something, that’s all that should really matter to you
It isn't about what others think, it's my lack of happiness of the food
Oh I see
Disappointing I know

like, i can hardly think of things to talk about anymore, because all i can think about is how bad i feel. and obviously i won't make a conversation about that. i fucking hate this. today is actually a better day though, which is why i started thinking about it. i realised that on better days, like today, while i'm still not happy, even i can see how pathetic i am most of the time. it sucks. i was extremely talkative and full of life before, idk when this even started. anybody else?
I stopped talking to people years ago for exactly this reason.
that honestly sucks :(    also, happy cake day :)
It does suck, it's a sad lonely existence. Try not to let yourself get this far, do anything you can to reach out to people.   And thanks, not so happy though. 😕
I am sorry, I know this is a very personal question but can I ask you if you don't have the people to reach out to or the will anymore?
Both, I pushed everyone away because of this and when I reach out to people I realize I never have anything to say.
When you reach out to them do you find it pointless because you  can't really talk about your mental state to them because you feel that they have no idea how to handle it anyway and/or you don't really trust them and/or you don't want to bother them?
Yes, they can never truly understand how I feel or offer anything to help. It's the same reason why I stopped going to therapy, I came out that room the exact same person I was going in. Plus, I have trust issues no one genuinely cares.
To put it in perspective, I actually think that it is great that you want to talk about it at least even if you feel that you just got DonoWalled everytime. Well I am not sure how you define genuinely caring, I guess my definition could be different than yours, because I don't believe that there are any truly 'selfless' acts.

I (19M) am In a pretty low place right now. Its alot to go over though. I'm at that point where it feels like your mind is physically in pain. It feels like none of my life prior to this moment really happened and I am not a real human. I am drawn to suicide, but am trying to think my way out of it. I dont want to exist any longer. I've been feeling this way for I'm not sure how long, but its been awhile. I fear this is neverending and it seems like it is at this point. I dont know why I'm posting this. Maybe I'm hoping someone can talk with me and make me feel better, but I dont think anyone or anything could take me out of this. I don't know.
Well my young friend, I’m sorry you are experiencing such difficult thoughts and emotions. Fucking sucks. The road won’t be easy but you must take it. Therapy, medication, self care. These things will add up. Suicide is not the answer.
Take a freezing cold shower and force yourself to stand in the water. Cry it out. Let’s both try for a better day tomorrow.
I've tried man. This is different. This isnt like anything I've ever dealt with. I've had suicidal thoughts and depressive feelings since I was a kid. This is different. This feels like torment. It wont fucking stop. I want to tell you how long I've felt this, but it's like my memory isnt working
Thanks man. I'm willing to try that. I hope we do both have better days ahead

there is no realistic or unrealistic scenario of life that i would be happy with. I just dont want to exist. I know people "arent supposed" to feel that way and knowing self harm wouldnt fix my problems is all that keeps me from doing it. I spoke to a healthcare person but it was a zoom call bc of covid and she was in her car the whole time and i just felt like i was being taken through a flow chart. Im not good enough at communicating to talk to someone like that. I dont want to try again. I dont want to talk to any friends or family about it either. i hate the feeling of people being "wary" around me. I want the people in my life to tell me they hate me so i dont have to feel guilty about leaving.
I feel the same way. I see people that look so happy all the time because they are doing what love. I haven’t found that for myself yet but I hope I do. And I hope you do too
[removed]
I hope you find it i really do
Change point of view sounds a lot like "live in denial". I already know everything sucks thats why im miserable.
[removed]
What do you even mean by change your perspective. Are you telling me "stop being sad" ? Im not interested in doing drugs.
Should i "change my mind" about having anxiety attacks or compulsions to hurt myself? i dont think you understand this isnt just me having a bad attitude im really not okay

I was on the highway and I got one of those intense waves of just not wanting to be alive and my whole body aches from the inside out and I just started crying then laughing bc I couldn’t even cry right. If anyone was in the car with me they probably would have been scared for their lives. I tried to focus on other things but I felt like I was on the verge of a panic attack the whole way home. I almost missed my exit because I just got into such a daze. I made it home safe but I’m so miserable. I have turned to s/h in the past when I’ve had this ache/angst but I know I cannot do that so I’m just in a limbo phase of numb pain until it passes.
Just glad you got home safe dude.
Thanks. I’m not sure I am. I think the only thing that kept me on the road was the fact I was borrowing my dads truck because my car broke down.
Well, if you can't make it through whatever is going on atm, I'm up and willing to talk. That sounds pretty lucky to me though friend. :)
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0edyi/cant_see_a_future/
I'm struggling to see the "bigger picture."  Right now I stay up past 5 am, sleep in until early afternoon, and usually nap in the early evening, and repeat. I barely eat, drink water, and I haven't been able to get back into exercising. Certainly, these are all things I need to figure out and work on, but my main concern is my lack of ability to see a future for myself.  I've never been able to think of myself in the future. I just don't see myself succeeding, or doing anything particular. One passion I've come to realize is learning about history and literature, however, attending university for such seems impossible. I get so depressed working minimum wage jobs and don't make enough to get by ***and*** attend university, I have no idea how I'll ever be able to do it. Even if I made enough to get by and attend university via student loans or whatever, I couldn't possibly study and work and be able to pass my classes, it'd be too much, and part-time studies would take too long and cost too much in the long run.  So I'm just sitting here crying, so tired, at 24, of essentially accomplishing nothing, no direction, and I can't see a future for myself, whatever that means. I have dreams, I just don't see how I can possibly achieve them. It all feels so impossible.   Not looking for any toxic positivity or "you can do it!" comments.
I recently started working a direct care professional job, so I’m working in a group home assisting mostly independent people with mental illnesses (ironic ik) and it is not light work but it is rewarding and it keeps me busy for the most part. I’m personally taking a break from college right now because I realized I was just too depressed for it. I’m hoping focusing on one thing (a job) will help me start functioning like an actual human being. So far it gets me up and showered, fed, out of the house and interacting with others. I don’t see a future for myself so I’m doing my best on focusing on the now (hence dropping out of college). I definitely don’t have a fool proof plan, I barely have a plan, I’m just doing my best to take it one day at a time.

Every second is just another reason to go.  I'm scared of life and I'm tired of myself. I don't know what to do anymore and dying seems like a convenient path I   can take whenever I want to.
What’s story about you to make you feel that way? I’m not going to comfort you, but just let you know I’m the same.  3am in midnight now... I can’t think of suicide anymore today, just tired, very tired that make me can’t even kill my self
I'm a 13F and I don't have much of a story. I... Y'know I'm not sure. I don't have much to say. I have a loving family and good friends. But sometimes it's hard. 2020 hasn't been the best and online school is stressful. I think it's kinda pathetic for me to feel this way seeing how easy I've had it but, I'm just really tired now.
I can’t say I understand you because what we upset for and depressed about is totally different. But talk to your family and good friend. They may not able to help your hard feeling gone but as long as you know someone listen to you or by your side, you will feel better. Trust me.   I’m alone in my room, no friends no family.... but I have here to talk to..   We all find a way to get out of depression.   I hope you can feel better soon

Hey, I'm a 19 year old Eastern European guy currently in the military, and I'm not sure if I'm gonna make through the 6 remaining months of my service, I just feel miserable, sometimes I do feel upbeat when my fellow comrades cheer me up, we joke around and stuff but...Then I just always return to what seems to be my default mood, feeling like an failure and hating myself for it, like damn I constantly tear up thinking about that one girl I feel in love with around 6 months ago, I feel like I would do anything for her in my abilities but I just ghosted, she didn't even want to stay platonic friends with me.. I don't understand how I can't get over her, and her leaving me just intensified my feeling of inadequacy. Constant anxiety is also something that plagues my mind, I just can't stop thinking about the failure and further pain that awaits for me in the future.  I tried, or well still am trying to practice Stoicism to combat this way I feel, it helps but only momentarily, all of the principles that I learned from this philosophy just flies out of the window as soon as I encounter something unexpected again.  It just seems that one bullet in the chamber would stop all of the pain, and this being the military afterall I get my hands on guns loaded with live ammo quite often, I'm just too tired to stay, especially while spending my time in the military.   Sorry for this incoherent mess and any grammatical mistakes, god I felt pathetic writing this, I'm not even sure what I'm trying to achieve by posting this here...
Just ask for help being in Europe they give you meds for free and other treatments
It isn't that simple, also unfortunately there's a huge negative social sentiment against seeking help for mental problems especially as a man, as they aren't viewed as "real" problems, my family would just look down on me for that, also there's no realistic way I can seek help while being in the military.

i don’t think this may be the right sub. but it will all add up in the end just bare with me.   I got into loyola marymount university last year, I graduated high school june 2020. in august, my biggest scholarship got cancelled and I had to withdraw because I couldn’t come up with the money in time. it was too late to enroll in community college because the fees would’ve been due that day, because it was late as well.   fast forward to today, I was hoping to start college this semester. but I have come into the same barrier. i’ve been communicating with financial aid since november and my fafsa is still not cleared, and the fees are due wednesday. if they’re not paid i’ll be dropped. my fees this semester were 6k.   I feel like I am failing. I graduated from one of the top high schools in my state. I graduated with a 4.0 gpa. and now I can’t even pay for community college. mind you, the community college is in california (i’m in chicago) because I hope to transfer back to lmu or usc. but that’s looking like it’s never going to happen. and I know if I go to a community college in my home city, I won’t get accepted to a top university to transfer.   I put this here just to rant because i’ve been dealing with depression and self harm or years and this is making me want to cut.

22 hours in, I feel great. The world slows down, my social anxiety near zero. I dont give a single fuck what anyone thinks about me. I can walk into the store and my head will be completely clear as I grab a coffee, *this is what it feels like to be normal*. Its amazing, all the confidence and lack of fucks I give when im running on empty. I wish I could be like this every day, instead of being a freak show.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0e8u9/im_always_stressed_out_and_cant_cope_in_my/
So basically, I don't know if this is the right sub to post this... So straightforward, I'm always stressed out and I don't want to see someone better than me— in Cosmology/physics and other fields I loved— this may be a bit weird, but I took it seriously, and sometimes I can't cope in my failures, academically during my grade school,  because I was a mediocre student before and I've been bullied by several years, absolutely EVERYONE IN MY SCHOOL, even my best friend... I was beaten up in school before several times,  especially when I was around 7 y.o, and I have no choice but to fight back against them even I'm just alone fighting back... I struggled A LOT, and sometimes, I want to end up my life... But then, I realized, I want to pursue my dreams... My Best Friend didn't know the pain I've gone through... Like, going into school and hoping the time will come when no one's bullying you... When I was around 6y.o, I asked myself, how many years should I endure this bullying... And I was surprised that I endured it for at least 7 years... And now, when I reached out to those depressed/stressed people, they told me that I didn't know the pain they went through... Like, what about me? I can't cope with the failures I had before, and it stressed me out, even though, I'm continuously improving myself, reading books every day, I feel I'm still not enough... Some people amazed me, but they didn't know how stressed I am because of it... Everywhere I go, I'm always overthinking, you may say it was pretty normal, but it isn't, it's very difficult... So yeah, I want to change my mindset, but it's quite difficult... I didn't tell anyone how stressed I am, and I'm not sure whether I'm depressed or not, but sometimes, I can't sleep overthinking about such stuff, like how can I improve myself? About the future of humanity, and much much more. People around me didn't even realize how stressed I am. I wanna seek psychiatrists or whatever, but I don't wanna anyone else to know about it... So yeah. It's quite difficult.

i want to end everything  this guy who told me he was interested in me and wanted a relationship with me back in december had become quite distant ever since i got upset when he cancelled on his plans to come out to see me (long distance type thing). i called him out on it and he went ghost, after a few days things went back to normal (or so i hoped, clearly they weren’t lol). the last month has been very turbulent. we went from texting and calling all day every day to texting maybe once a day on a good day and no more phone calls. he says it’s because he was off work when we were texting and calling constantly and now he’s too busy to do that which i get but i see him active on reddit on all the days he works, when he says he doesn’t have the time or energy. when i try to set aside a time to call he blatantly ignores me, he wants to avoid calling me like a plague. i don’t understand how things have changed so much from just a fucking month ago but i am done.   the kicker is that a year and a half ago he blocked me on everything and we lost contact for a year due to an issue we were having back then. we’ve since reconnected and the first few months were amazing, he was so considerate and friendly and pretended that he actually cared about me and then nov/dec came and things got more heated, we expressed our feelings for each other and agreed to try out dating each other. about a week after that, no more, was when he canceled on his tentative plan to come out here. then things got shitty. long story short i feel like a complete fucking dumbass for even accepting him back into my life and falling for his bs a second time.   i’m also devastated because we got in an argument due to his ignoring me for days at a time then gaslighting me into feeeling like the bad guy for calling him out on it. at this point my self-hatred is at an all-time high and i want to kill myself but also him. i want to watch him suffer. i obviously can’t get to him physically since he doesn’t live near me and i would never actually kill or hurt him physically but the desire is so strong. he hurt me so bad, he ignored my calls and voicemails where i was SOBBING and having a panic attack. he hasn’t contacted me since then but he hasn’t blocked me either. i’m so devastated and defeated i have literally no desire to live in this shitty world for one more day
I don't know how you feel, and I also hate my life as well. You're not on your own. You have all of us to support you!! He's not worth you or your tears. Someone better for you is already in your destiny. I know it can be hard to get over it especially if you've known them for a while. I hope this helps and if you ever need anything, I'm always here for you!! Have a lovely day!! 💖💖❤❤💕💕
you don’t even know how much your message helped thank you for reaching out. i can tell you’re a good person and you deserve the best. 💖💖
Aww, I'm so glad I helped!! Of course, anytime!! Aww, you too!! You're a beautiful person!! 💕💕💖💖❤❤

I have absolutely nobody to talk to, and I feel like everyone i ever cared about is slipping away. I can't spend this much time with my damned thoughts. I have low social skills as well,  im too damn quiet and shy. Even if i want to say something i just get anxious and can't spit it out sometimes. Its a friggin curse. I hate this. I've ruined a close and long lasting relationship because of my anger, because of my neediness. Its always my fucking fault even when it really isn't.   Another person I've displayed genuine interest in wouldn't talk to me, this was very recently. I understand why and i don't hold any grudges. But because of my situation it still hurts a bit. I don't ever talk to anyone from school either. Im always the young weird kid to stay away from. God I fucking hate it. And to rub salt in the wound, this isn't happening because of shit i did but shit i didn't do. I missed out on so many things because of my awkwardness.
If you need someone to talk to, I am here. I am in a similar boat
I’m in that boat too.  Unfortunately it’s a super big boat - lots of crew members.

I just. Idk. Everything is a chore. I’m on winter break rn. But when school starts back up I’m fucked. I have zero motivation. None.   I feel directionless. I’m almost 20. Have no skills no passions. I have trouble opening up to my friends and even though I make cry for help comments I say I’m fine. Everyday I just tell myself to toughen up. If I delve into school the thoughts will go away and I’ll be happy. Ergo therapy is a chore as well. I just. I feel like I have no one close to me to tell what’s up.   Everyday I wake up at 12 and do nothing. It’s tough to put my clothes in the washer honestly. I haven’t read my book in weeks. I just have nothing to look forward too. I don’t want to be busy all the time but idk what to do with my time. I just can’t see a path forward in life. I don’t want to do anything.  I gave up all my hobbies. Yet I gaslight myself and say I’m fine I’m just growing up. Maybe I am. But it feels shitty. Everything sucks. And I have no one.   Idk where to go and what to do but everything feels wrong and hard. I just don’t like to do things any more. My attention span has gone from meh to nothing. Motivation at an all time low. I’m so bad at keeping up with friends and keeping good relationships  I’m sorry ik it’s a rant and my grammar has been awful  TL;DR. Everything feels wrong and hard I have no passions in life nothing that I care about. Nothing feels worthwhile. All I do is watch TV and get high

17 male ASD ADHD  I've been stuck doing practically nothing for ages since I left school because I was failing and I just hated it. I try to do projects (I love computer programming) but I often lose motivation to do them, only to occasionally bounce back for a few days/weeks so I can't get anything I want to do done.  I'm talking to my friends less & less because it feels like too much effort and I don't feel like I have a future anytime soon if I can't do anything productive. I'm bad at getting help and all I really want is for someone to pull me out of what I'm experiencing so I can have the life I want.  Should I just drop everything and try and get into therapy or something? I feel extremely hopeless & dissociative.

One year ago today I attempted suicide my overdosing, it failed and I woke up the next morning surrounded in my own vomit and my mom yelling/hitting me. One year ago today I was sure that it wasn’t going to get better, but it did. I stayed in the hospital for a week under suicide watch staring and a blank wall never knowing what time of day it was until my meals were delivered wishing that I didn’t fail. I acted how they want me to and was able to be released right after the iv was pulled from my wrist. The next couple weeks were rough and I looked it, so many people found out because I have a problem with over sharing when things get silent. My life since then has been better and worse I’ve been put on medication that has helped me tremendously I’ve made so many friends and memories but I’ve also been more bold with my actions, sneaking out and going with groups of strangers alone in the middle of the night( I’m a 17 year old girl so kinda scary thinking back), police encounters, drugs, and bad friends who use me. But I’m slowly getting better and my grades are starting to go back up, I feel nimble sometimes but I know I will never ever try to go through that pain again, I struggle with self harm which I know is a bad habit but I’m working on it and I have a new escape from reality going snowboarding and I feel more alive. My life is getting better and yours will too! I’m sorry this is kinda long but I’m really happy right now and wanted to share🙂
Reading your story, I'm sure a lot of people will find hope. You are very inspiring and strong for pulling through! Thank you sm for sharing 😊

Bare orange wall,  Crazy how if you stare at something long enough you start to fall,  I just got another phone call,  Guess I’ll respond after I’m done doing nothing.   Faceless figures like flies-  Safe but not without sting,  Try to lift me up with them but I don’t have wings,  So easy to remember the things you used to care about,  Nowadays its rare to even hear myself speak aloud.   Running in circles around me,  Buzzing humming drumming voices,  Vomit arousing,  I can’t even comment about it,  Guess I still care about somethings.   Bare orange wall,  When its dark I can almost see insects on it crawl,  Morning sun slowly brightens the hall,  Fuck, I really wanted to sleep.

Hi guys, Need to vent.  I'm an 18 year old lad living in the UK. Life SHOULD be perfect for me on paper. I have a beautiful girlfriend, extremely loving parents, and have just started a new job which I'm both very much enjoying and that carries excellent prospects.  For those unaware, we've just been plunged into ANOTHER lockdown. This is the 3rd one now, inbeteeen periods of localised restrictions.  All of my hobbies have been taken away by covid. I used to see mates all the time - multiple times a week - and despite my mental health problems, was generally enjoying life before lockdown. Obviously things were not perfect - I had some extremely hard days, too - but incomparable to life now.  I'm working from home. I don't see anyone, other than my parents, and my girlfriend. I technically shouldn't even see her - but I often need to give her lifts to work (she sometimes has literally no other option) so it feels pointless not seeing each other at other times.   I really don't know how much more I can cope with. I literally can't sleep anymore, and I'm working 9-5 Monday to Friday. It's so taxing.  I feel so lonely and hollow inside. My hobbies are all gone, and due to their nature, will likely not be viable for a long time yet. I've drifted from mates I was extremely close with a year ago. And overall, I just feel I've lost my way.  My life is mainly consisting of walking from my bed, to my work PC, and back to my bed every day. I don't have motivation for much else.   And as soon as I go to bed at night, I get completely overwhelmed with nostalgic thoughts, and feel crushed by the desire to go back to how life used to be (hence this post at 2:30am).  If you've read until here, thanks for listening. It's nice to have somewhere to vent. Hope everyone is keeping well - we will get through this. I'm just struggling hard right now.

So yesterday I probably had one of the worst days for my depression that I've had in a while. I'm not going to go into too much detail but it was pretty bad, almost to a point where I didn't feel like I could keep myself safe/manic. But the thing is today I feel a bit better but why do I miss how much I was struggling yesterday? I feel like it's because of the blue monday thing and idk I guess I feel like my depression is only real when it's at its absolute worst. Does anyone else feel like this
People often return to their sources of abuse. Depression can feel like a home, as it is known to you. It is almost comforting. Its completely ok and normal to feel like that, your not alone - no matter how much you think you are.

I’ve struggled with depression, self harm, and suicidal episodes since I was just 12 years old, but this past year has been a nonstop onslaught of pain and depression for me. I feel guilty even complaining about it because obviously 2020 has been rough on us all, but damn. I just need to vent. The beginning of last year things were finally looking up for me, then I met the first person I had ever been able to imagine a future with. I was so, so excited about him. Like, from the first date just felt like everything was right. Maybe I’m romanticizing that. He broke my heart, and it’s a year later that I’m still trying to figure out how to piece it back together. I never told him I loved him. Covid hits hard right about the same time, and I lose the job that I used to be excited to wake up for, the only thing really helping me hold it all together. I try to break my lease because my roommates were toxic, end up moving and still getting harassed by them- yelled at on my balcony, because they can see me from theirs. My new job begins with me being sexually harassed by my trainer and ends eight months later with my ex bosses stalking and bullying me, and following my ex and my ex roommate on social media as a weird way to get back at me, weeks after my quitting. Today I found out the guy I’d been dating the past few months was lying to me the whole time and hooking up with someone else too. He broke things off over text ~2 weeks ago while I was in the middle of isolating because I was symptomatic and tested positive for covid, which I got from a coworker. He posted a picture of her today, and she posted one from his bedroom.   I graduated college early, am now unexpectedly unemployed, heartbroken, and scared of the future being more of the same. I haven’t even written anything about my family problems. I am just completely alone and the few people I do have are moving out of state this summer. I feel like I’m trying to run through quicksand but the harder I try, the faster I sink. I still love someone who only ever saw me as a hookup. So many days this past year have been spent not getting out of bed, not showering, not eating. I feel defeated, and I feel like shit about myself for feeling this way. I’ve been in this depressive state for so long, I truly don’t even remember what it feels like to be happy. I have some days that I don’t break down in tears, but I want to feel happiness again. To feel anything but this. Every time I see light at the end of this tunnel, someone snuffs it out, and moves it 1000 miles further away. It’s usually me who snuffs it out, I think. I feel like I do it to myself. I don’t know if I’m perpetuating my own misery. After all, the common denominator in all of this is me. I know I need therapy and I’ll probably delete this when I wake, but I needed to get it out. I’m just exhausted.
Damn, it sounds like you've had a rough couple months. I'm sorry you went through all life change at once... That would be hard for anyone. I know its hard to see that light but it will come. If you're at the very bottom there's no place up to go but up. Keep expressing your feelings and letting it out. I know what its like to have no one either.
Thank you for the reply. Every time I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom, I keep sinking deeper somehow. I’m still here though, just trying to figure things out. Finding out yesterday someone I’d spent so much time with replaced me before even breaking it off with me was just a punch in the gut, I had to let it out somehow. He was the only person I really had around, shitty as he was. It just piled on and hurts. Thank you for your words

I don’t have anyone anymore, none of my friends talk to me, and i don’t remember the last time my parents said ‘i love you’ i don’t even remember the last time they gave me a hug. they saw my scars two times and they said they would help me, they said things would be better. When will it be better? Why haven’t they done anything? I haven’t had a normal sleep schedule in months, i’ve been staying up till 4am hoping things will get better. They lectured me about this thinking that my depression went away the day after they noticed, they put a screen time on my phone so i can’t distract myself from all the shit going on in my life past 9pm, 9 fucking pm. Last time they did this, i had a mental breakdown while they were laughing peacefully in they’re room. I’m going get away from all this, i’m going to end it all, the pain, the sadness, i hope my family is proud of what they’ve done. Goodbye.
Not worth it honestly waste of time even if your not receiving the love in the abundance you have to do yourself don’t depend on others for your love and self support or gardification your amazing person smart strong and a survivor so why quit now? Hey I don’t know you n I want you to live so imagine that hurt to the ones that want you to live also you know there’s someone out there I promise close to you but all n all ironically enough I love you n you deserve to stay here with me
If you kill your self if we hear that you died everyone would be sad and one more step closer to where you are now if you have a pet it would be so sad it might not eat or sleep just imagine what it would do to a human your parents your family on Reddit just please post something in a week please don’t give up hope

I have compassion for everyone here, i drop by regularly and even though I don't post, reading the posts, everyone's story, it makes me really sad actually.   I just wanted to tell you that even though we are strangers on the internet, we are still human beings and this form of connection that we have may seem miserable but it's still better than nothing.  You are not alone in this mess!
Thanks for the nice words! :) Good to hear that some people just care, cause they are empathetic.

Whats the point anymore? My mother listens to me, but she doesn't do anything. My dad is severely disabled and my friends are suicidal. I cant help anyone, any progress I have made is destroyed. My sister is one of the few people I can talk to.  I rarely smile and I'm always on the brink of snapping. or maybe I snapped already. Sometimes I cant even tell myself.

Sometimes when I go on social media I’ll see posts like “it’s okay if all you did was get out of bed” “you’re doing your best”, like how is that doing my best? I feel like such a failure if I’m not doing something. Idk... can someone explain this to me. Maybe I’m being to harsh on myself but I really mean it, how is doing nothing okay? I feel like a break is only deserving after accomplishing something. I hope I don’t come off as harsh, I’m genuinely trying to understand the other perspective.
It's not okay. It's part of the snowflake attitude. Just like saying you don't have to improve because you're just fine how you are right now. You can always improve. You don't have to stick to a bad habit just 'because that's who you are'.
I agree. The problem with this kind of attitude is that you ignore the fact that someone has a problem and instead you try to turn that problem into a part of that person. Not being able to do anything is not fine. It is not doing your best. It is doing nothing and it is wasting your time.  People should stop sugercoating things. If you have any kind of problem in your life, then you have that problem in your life. Acknowledging your shortcomings is the biggest step towards fixing them.

Externally I seem nearly okay.  I am good at my job and well liked by my co-workers.  My boss thinks I'm a hard worker.  I don't have a formal swcondary education but I'm fairly intelligent, I graduated second in my class from highscool.  When I have tried therapy in the past my therapists always tell me that I'm so smart and insightful or a really interesting person.  I hold 2 jobs (one is my own business).  I'm a dutiful partner.  I've done volunteer work with animals. I help my family out even ones that I'm not fond of.  I basically never yell or get angry with people....  But in reality I'm boiling under the surface and have been for years.  I feel hateful and out of control on the inside.  I indulge in self abuse and self pity.  When I'm alone at work sometimes I cry while going about my daily tasks.  And sometimes I feel like I hate nearly everyone in my life.  And I try to avoid thinking about big life decisions because sometimes it leads me to think about not wanting to be alive at all.  Recently it is a new joy in my life that has ironically made the pain seem more piercing.  I have a partner that loves me and supports me and tells me how wonderful I am and how proud he is of me.  He has told me I am the best thing in his life and that I make him so happy ...  And I feel like it is bullshit.  I feel like I have sold him a lie.    My parents were drug addicts that used to belittle and beat each other. I was molested at 4 years old by my elder brother's best friend while my parents were busy cheating on each other and fearing stupid things like their house being "haunted".  My mom was regularly so high she would drive into on coming traffic on the way to my school when she wasn't gone in jail.  My brother started calling me queer for liking normal girl things and then telling me not to be a sl*t before I even hit puberty.  Later my mom started telling me she wanted to leave me or commit suicide because of how awful it was to be a mother/wife.. I was bullied in school for being fat and a nerd. My first boyfriend was abusive, wouldn't tell his friends about me and regularly threatened to leave me if I refused sex.  My second BF would threaten to kill me as a "joke" fairly regularly.  Basically my whole life from 3-24 was full of some kind of neglect or abuse.    The positive people in my life now think I'm pretty great from what they say to me. My friends say I'm strong and I do well for myself.  I'm brave.  I'm funny. I'm smart..   They tell me I can do anything.   But I hate myself.  I feel like I'm a liar.  I'm some broken thing walking around taped together hoping no one realizes how fucked up I am.  I don't feel okay.  I don't feel brave.  I feel stupid.  I feel angry at my family for bringing a child into that mess.  I feel angry at myself for wasting years on abusive people.  I feel like a waste of potential and space for not getting a degree or making something more of myself than being an independent landscaper.  I feel out of control in my life.    I feel like I don't know how to make the feelings go away.  So I just shove them down.  I cover my pain with a fake smile and a nervous laugh that I hate having developed.  I avoid emotional subjects because I can't handle speaking on them without crying.  I try to be tough because it's the only crutch that has saved me all these years.  I can feel it all.  Or I can feel nothing.  There isn't a in-between with me.

Sent this and never got a response back..💔  I can’t keep doing this over and over again. I want to be with you. I do love you. I do care about you. I do miss being with you. It’s obvious we’re both still affected by stuff in the past. I don’t know exactly everything you are affected by but whatever it is I want to be able to talk about it so we can move past it. I’ve been trying to tell you how I’m still hurt but it just seems like every time I do you get offended.   All I want is for you to listen and understand that there are just so many unresolved issues between us. I’ve made plenty of mistakes in our relationship. I own up to my mistakes and genuinely apologize to you and go out of my way to let you know how truly sorry I am. I feel like I’m the only one left actually trying to fight for what’s left of this relationship. I feel like I’m pulling all the weight.   I just feel like you give up so easily on this.. I can’t continue to be the only one trying to resolve things. We can’t build an actual healthy relationship when there are still cracks in the foundation. I don’t know what you really want out of this relationship..but I do know what I want and need to be happy in this relationship.   I need trust, to be able to not feel like you’re constantly talking to someone else or that as soon as things go south you leave. I need honesty, to be able to be open about things even though it may hurt one another. We are both going to continue to make mistakes in our lives. It’s just how we handle our mistakes that show the healthiness of our relationship.   I need to be able to feel safe expressing myself and I want you to feel the same way towards me. Just like our late nights staying up and just talking about whatever popped up in our heads together. I miss just feeling comfortable around you and not feeling like I was doing or saying the wrong things all the time.   I want to be able to just lay here and cuddle with you. I want to be able to play with your hair, face, ears. I want to go out and do things together like just driving around and listening to music. I want to be able to spoil you and take care of you. I want to wash your hair for you and shave your face again. I want to steal your clothes. I want to wake up in the middle of the night to you rubbing my head or cuddling me. I want to wake up in the morning and get my daily dose of morning wood.   I want to make those stupid ass candy apples together that we never did because I was just so out of it. I want to watch you play your stupid games that I never understood why you liked them so much. I want to make you wear certain shirts and beanies so I can get that weird feeling when I look at you. I want to have head rubs and back rubs. I want you to use my toys on me because I haven’t had an actual good orgasm in so long and you always did a really good job.   I want to take bubble baths together even though we barely fit. I want to be carried around like you used to. I want to be able to talk about our baby together and make decisions together. I want to be able to hold your hand while I drive or just in general. I want to be able to go on random adventures with you like a cabin in the woods or an amusement park. I want to be able to get high with you again one day.   I want to watch you bond with our son. I want to watch you become an amazing father. I want to watch you fall in love with him. I want to fall in love with you all over again. I can honestly keep on going but for a while I honestly forgot a lot of good things in our relationship and now being able to actually recap them and just blurt it out makes me realize so much more how much I do care.   I not only want you in my life but I honestly need you in my life. That may sound so selfish but right now I’ve never needed you more and it scares me because of how broken we are right now. I just wished you would come here and just go through all this bullshit with me and work through it so we can come out better than before. All I really have to say is I just need you here by my side to get through this together.   Also I hope that you try and think about what you really need and want from a relationship. I hope that we want the same things but if not then I understand..I will still love and care about you but we both know it wouldn’t be for the best if we both want different things and if neither one of us is willing to truly comprise it will just hurt both of us in the long run. I’m willing to listen to what you need and want to try and compromise to work things out because I do really want to be with you like actually be with you face to face.
stay strong, I hope everything falls back into place, don't give up champ ♥️
Just reading this makes me see that you are a beautiful person. Stay strong.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0dabu/i_feel_no_empathy/
I don't care about other people and I hate my self for it. I don't care about my parents, my family, my friends just no one. I can't really feel any empathy 99% of the time. I also can't socialize as I avoid any deeper interaction and don't befriend new people anymore. On some days I be hating my self because I am such an worthless asshole however when the opportunity comes to help someone out & care for them I just don't do it. Maybe I am just a bad person who cares only for himself.   I have anxiety and depression but I start feeling more and more that this can't be the only thing. I do nothing to change it. I am often very unsure if my lack of empathy is caused just by my depression or if I am just a lazy, selfish fuck who doesn't care about people. I am unsure if I am so asocial just because of my anxiety. I start feeling there is something else wrong with me. I want to feel empathy towards others but I don't and idk why.I also need to say that I have loving parents but I don't give a shit about them. Maybe it would give me a reason in life if I'd care about others. Sometimes I think I might have antisocial personality disorder since I can also be manipulative often but then I just tell my self that I am just an asshole and it's causing me to be more depressed. . I don't want to be like this but I just don't feel any empathy towards others.
Totally normal

I'm an introvert who struggles with making conversations, and In have no friendships. I'm not too bothered about having no friends because, i feel safer alone. I used to volunteer to help myself gain experience talking to people but the pandemic has set me far back. I've been depressed due to some family issues for years now. When i try to express my feelings to my parents, they ignore it, then they yell at me when i refuse to tell tehm about my personal life. My sister emotionally abuses me and i've lived with her for a while now, thought about moving out but i don't have the finances. Thankfully she's getting married soon and moving out. I feel trapped and tired, like i'm in a cycle. I was feeling suicidal for a while but i had to struggle to have it pass by myself. Now, i'm battling a lot of anxiety with depression and i'm now feeling a lack of empathy, to the point that it scares me and i feel like i'm spiraling out of control, my brain is screaming but i can't even respond. The pandemic made it worse and I could use some advice if anyone has any? Sorry for the long read.
I don't have any advice because I'm in the same boat. Just thought I'd let you know that you're not alone in this.
I think you should focus on cutting off from your family. Sorry if it sounds like bad advice, I can't know your situation exactly, and it's not always the solution. But right know you don't have an environment where you can let your feelings appear, it's totally normal that they have shut down. Don't try to feel good stuff, just try to work on creating an environment where you can escape the negativity. One thing at a time. Once you're alone you can go to a therapist and learn how to talk about stuff to someone. Stay strong.
You can only create a better place once you have a blank space to start with, you know what I mean?

I don’t know what’s going on. It looks as if I’ve done something bad, but I really didn’t. Or maybe just looking like I did it was stupid on my part. A lot of my friends know this and know what I did and are okay with it but one guy just can’t get over it. I’m sad but also disappointed in myself. I didn’t think I did anything wrong. But maybe I did. My friends say that I didn’t do anything that bad but then why does that one friend hate me? He won’t even listen to me, he just ignores me. I didn’t even do something that directly affected him. I took the blame for one thing and that’s when it all went downhill. I wanna give him time, but I lashed out when he first stated that he’ll ignore me and now I don’t think he even wants to hear me anymore. I think I made him sad. But the thing is, if I tell him I didn’t do these things then he won’t believe me. I just don’t know what to do.

I don’t go out in public because of my height. I even go as far as to try and not walk around my house because I feel so short. I haven’t showered in over 2 weeks because I’ve felt so badly and also have lost around 7 pounds since August. I’m 5’9 1/2 on a good day and it bothers me to no end. The thing that sucks the most is that I can’t get taller. I’m already 21 so I won’t grow anymore...I’ll only get shorter. I would literally do anything to get taller. It’s gonna be the reason I end it all within the next week or so. The thought of suicide scares me because I have people who love me very much and I know if I do it I’ll miss many things coming up...I just can’t take it anymore.
You're not even short, some guys are 5'5
But I am. All my friends are 5”11 plus
Those are not the 2 inches girls care about. Focus on being a person worth dating. Are you interesting? Hard working? Loyal? Dependable? That matters a lot more.
I’m none of those either
Nothing can be done. No matter what anyone says I’m ending it because of my height.

36 and feel like I've made so many bad decisions since I was a kid and now they're all coming back to bite me hard. I never knew how too make friends. Was too immature and thought other kids hated me because I was  annoying and kind of gross and had add. I'm still a virgin and the last person to like me got fed up and left. I don't blame them, but there's no one now. My mother got tired of me too. I don't blame my parents, but there's no way to fix it all now. I'm unemployed, hate every job I get and I wish I could start over, but I have so much haunting me now that there's no way at my age I can begin to try to get up and start over. I feel invisible. Just want my time back to fix what I broke.

I’m so tired of wondering when the next issue is gonna come up, because it always does. I’m so helpless and feel so worthless. I could be getting taken away from my mom in the middle of February after being in temporary custody of my grandmother for a year and it might seem like not as bad of a thing as it sounds. My mom has had many surgeries because of her many health problems and right now she has nowhere to go and she’s staying in a hotel right now. I want to help but what can I do??? I worry about my mom all the time. She’s been there for me forever. I want to help fix everything but I can’t. I’m so lost and I don’t know what to do anymore. My heads too loud and it never shuts up. I just want quiet and for things to be alright for once. But they never are. The thought of the future and what could happen eats away at me everyday and I can’t take it.

My depression due to lockdowns has caused me to make impulse purchases for things I don't need nor really have the money for. I feel like a piece of crap after my payment has gone through. Does anyone also have this issue during covid-19? Thanks!
I’m usually not one to purchase things for myself. But I’ve been doing it more lately. Not sure if it’s related to Covid or not.
I'm not afraid of COVID, but I am cautious when I'm at work or running errands. I think mine has to do with loneliness. It's strange.
It might be the same for me. IDK. I’m a mess. So it could be a number of things.
I feel the same way. It's so difficult to find the root cause when it could many reasons why.
Definitely.

I fucking hate myself.  I had a relatively privileged childhood and got admitted to a good Catholic school for high school -- where I knew no one.  I struggled through most years.  I graduated with a 2.3 GPA despite scoring a 1280 on my SATs.  Had I actually worked hard in HS maybe I could've applied to Cornell or Colgate.  My parents moved the day after from Atlanta to Dallas.  18 years later life still fucking sucks.  I can't do anything right.  I'm too lazy to study for the GMAT after finally going back to school completing two degrees -- with one a B.A. in Economics with a 3.3 GPA in NYC.  I don't have any friends in Kansas City.  I want to get out of here and move back to NYC.    Most notably, I'm ugly as hell.  I had visible ribs right before I hit puberty.  I was maybe 135 lbs.  Puberty and college destroyed me.  I went from 135 to 225.  The one time I was successful with women was when I got down to 185.  Now I'm just disgusting at 250.  My family has fat faces.  It's not a good look.  I would give an arm to have a gastric sleeve procedure -- my company on their health insurance rider excludes bariatric surgery.    It's just over for me.  I wish I had the guts to do it.  I do not.

Im 21 years old now, today is my birthday and I just cant sleep. Its 5:45 am in Germany right now. I have some friends but I feel like I could not trust them even If I tell them everything. Its like I see them as friends but I think im not important for them, don't have a real best friend either. I never had a girlfriend or even kissed a girl. I never wanted the girls who wanted me cause I felt like they dont want me they just want a boy (some of them were these "bitches" and they only wanted a good boy.) Im a person who need others to be happy even though I can have fun on my own even though I get lonely at the end. Im scared cause I feel like im never enough and I will never be happy no matter how hard I try and nobody will love the way how I love. Nobody ever will understand me. I think like this for a long time but finally I lost all my last hope. But the worst part is that I cant escape. I dont have someone to run to and I cannot kill myself cause I love my little sister to much to do that to her. Im brocken now and dont know what to do...
Happy birthday brother its 5:03 here in the uk and don’t think about suicide call your suicide hotline and pull through this for your sister
Happy birthday UK as well
Ich kann dich verstehen du beschreibst grade mich vor ein paar Jahren. Ich würd supergerne versuchen dir zu helfen aber dafür kenne ich deine Situation nicht gut genug  („I understand you, you describe my life a couple of years ago. Would love to help you but i don’t know your situation well enough“)
Yup in germany too and I think we have a real bad social climate around here. I feel that our productivity defines our worth so that you get into a vicious cycle. At least from the sight of society. I'm sorry for your situation. Cuddle your sister when she wakes up. Tell her you love her. Sometimes that's enough for the other person give you at least a bit of a worth feeling...
I don't know its just the thought that our youth is our "best" time and if this is already that bad..what happens in the future? Im supposed to get a job I dont like and work till I die, no kids, no wife and then just die alone after a life without happiness

I'm a broken person. I don't fit anywhere. I don't belong. I don't have friends. I feel uncomfortable even around the family I have left (non-toxic ones). I've been ostracized by my own siblings. By fucking support groups.  But at the same time, do I really want to fit into a society so profoundly broken and disgusting? I don't want to be a wage slave - wasting 1/3 of my life and all of my energy just to make money that goes to paying bills for a place I can't enjoy because I'm so damn exhausted. I don't want to be part of a society where half the people believe masks are oppressing them and won't wear them for the greater good. I don't want to be part of a society where people are abused and cast aside for circumstances beyond their control.  What do you do when there is no good solution? What do you do when you know that you and the society around you will never both be fixed at the same time? What do you do when you believe neither can be fixed at all?  I feel so alone, but I've been thinking all this over for months and months and I still haven't come up with a single viable solution, let alone a good one.
This is something I contend with every damn day... And I wish I had the answers.. Truly I do... I don't get it... I don't fit in... I don't understand why it is this way... I'm so tired.
*Everything* in this post is something I've been thinking about and struggling with for a long time. All I've thought to do is to do whatever makes me happy and I enjoy, if it makes me money then it's a bonus.  I'm not going to waste my life away doing education or getting a job that I don't even like or takes away all of my time. There are toxic people, idiots or just anyone that don't get you, but eventually you can come across some that are nice and will stick with you, it just might take longer than we'd like
Exactly my problem. I act so normal in public, but it's like I must be emanating something that says "stay away". It's frustrating and tiring.
I wish it were all that easy. But food and rent and goddamn insulin are all fucking expensive. And people just don't stick by someone as much a mess as I am. They never have. Every friend I've ever had has left me.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l08kkd/can_you_personally_feel_a_difference/
I've been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember, so it's somewhat hard for me to distinguish between "good" and "bad" as far as emotions and events go. It all really just blends together and I only think "oh, that was probably not a good thing" when I tell someone else and they seem uncomfortable. Since I typically feel a general numbness and sense of apathy, I've been keeping a diary/mood/activity tracker for the past year as it comforts me to see that data.   Anyway, my memory and sense of time constantly feels hazy so rather than thinking "I'm getting worse again" I'll notice it through my diary's weekly stats and other people's reactions. I feel as tired and irritable as what I consider my usual, if anything the only difference is my muscles ache a bit more and my appetite seems to have disappeared, but my mom has been offering to wash dishes and do other chores that are my responsibility lately and today my boss even texted me asking if I was okay, which confused me. Does anyone else relate to this? Since I've lived like this for about 10 years now, even after 2 failed suicide attempts it was more of a thought "as expected, no one noticed. It'll be inconvenient for a while until I fully recover."  Objectively, I can tell I'm not doing well as my room becomes a mess and my sleeping/eating/hygiene habits become worse. However, I never think "I have to get better" it's always "it's such a pain to hide this from people who wouldn't understand." Really, I just feel tired and it doesn't make a difference to me whether I end up with bruises that day or not, even if I cry for an hour straight it's just a nuisance and I hate myself for wasting time like that. When my depression seems to get "worse" it's not a noticable change for me personally, but seeing others' reactions stresses me out. I try so hard to seem normal, to not inconvenience others, I don't want their pity and hate when they "try to cheer me up." I want to hurry up and "improve" soon so I can go back to quietly doing the bare minimum and being generally ignored by everyone again.

I’m not at the point where I want to kill myself just yet, but if I do decide to go down that path shooting myself is the only way I can imagine doing it. If I get the gun, I will keep it at a storage unit without any ammo. I’ll buy the ammo if I make the decision.
10/10 have done this. Then you start collecting them, with weird justifications. At least for me. Haven’t used it yet though, obviously.
I’m not going to spend much money to buy a Glock or a Beretta, a cheap six shot revolver will be enough. Whatever will do the job if I decide to end it.

Been dating someone with severe anxiety and depression 2 years.  Mostly it manifests as anger and he always says a lot of horrible things and breaks shit on bad days.  He's seeing a therapist and trying though.  It's been bad lately because he lost his job and his father is dying.  His father was not a good person. I went home with him when his dad went on hospice.  Today his dad died, and he's lost it.  Broke shit screamed horrible things at me and his mom.  I'm trying to help but he's dumped me anyways during the rage (doubt he means it, he said "its what you want anyway the usual bull).  He and his mom aren't speaking and I'm just sitting in the bedroom and intermittently trying to comfort his mom.  I want to go home.  I don't want him in my life anymore because I am not equipped for this.  I'm scared he will kill himself if I try to leave I don't know what to do.  Posted here because depression doesn't seem to be something unaffected people can understand, and I was hoping someone could tell me if I should leave or keep trying to help.

I (23F) have had depression/ anxiety all my adult life, since i was a teen really. Never really was a people person, never really kept friends when moving schools, never really felt connected with people. Ive tried. Ive tried different meds at different doses, therapy, exercise, vitamins, drugs fuck all of it. But that pit never goes away, that ... but it would be easier if you weren't here. Makes me angry that people dont give a shit, but if i were to finally take the next step everyone would cry for the social media likes. You ever just feel so unworthy of it all, like it all just washes past you, never really touching anything, like a puff of smoke.  I try to hide don't get me wrong, im always too quiet, not funny enough, too loud, too something for other people. Im starting to think it won't ever get better, that ill be a miserable, needy, pathetic fuck my whole life.  I used to walk past this bridge on the way home from work before i moved, every single time id think about jumping, just falling and it being over, there is nothing like that where i live now, i just wish i had jumped.
You're not pathetic. You're very hard on yourself. If you had a friend talk to you the way you do, would it still be your friend? 🌹

I’ve only ever been off mine for a week or two at a time but I always seem to turn into an absolute mess. Well a lot more of a mess than I normally am lol. I know it’s not good to just stop them like that. I think I’ve been on them about 10 years now so I honestly don’t really remember much how I felt before but I feel like this gets a lot worse, I don’t know if that’s normal withdrawal but I don’t think it is. Makes me wonder if I’m dependent, or if any happiness I do experience is even real, I don’t even know

hi all. mental illness runs pretty heavy in my family. I was in therapy for the first time in my life from may-early December. I was diagnosed with bipolar depression and anxiety with ptsd. Because of some insurance problems I currently don’t have access to my therapist or medication but I’m trying to get it fixed.  I’m having constant anxiety about my life even though I have a very solid, very practical plan. The only issue is, I’ve given up on all my dreams and I’m taking the easy way through life. I sleep all day, I can’t take care of myself properly (going days without brushing my teeth, eating maybe once a day if I can manage). My house and my car are a mess. I love my friends, I do, but for years I have felt like there is a glass wall between me and everyone I love and I can still see and hear them but something is just off. I just don’t feel connection. I had a bad run in with mdma almost 2 years ago, and due to my job I stopped taking it. But I crave it now more than ever because it gave me an epic sense of forgiveness, empathy, connection, understanding, friendship, love, love of life and people in it. I haven’t felt that for a long time. I almost killed myself on impulse the other day. I don’t have access to guns so my only choices seem like vehicular suicide or overdose. I’m too afraid to do either because I’m afraid to fail and lose my job and have to go home to my family with a totaled car or a suicide attempt lingering over me forever. I miss my dog and my cousins. I had to cut a toxic friend out of my life and I miss him dearly. I feel so alone in the world which is really messed up considering I know I’m not. I haven’t felt this terrible in months and I miss my therapist. Does anyone else have that experience of feeling like there’s a glass wall between you and everyone else? Feel like there’s 2 people in your brain all the time? I used to cope with impulsive decisions and bad behavior and promiscuity but due to being in the military and a pandemic, I can’t do that. I don’t know how to cope. I just wake up every day and keep going because it’s all I can do, but I’m so deeply unhappy. Everything is hard. Hanging out with my friends takes so much energy. Nothing is interesting. I have to listen to podcasts to sleep just to not feel alone. Having a hard time

This morning the words "I'm happy" went through my brain. I was stunned. I thought, "I just thought 'I'm happy.'" I said it over two or three times. Such an unfamiliar emotion. But I have worked hard to bring it out.  The last time I said those words was in the summer of 2016. I was on a vacation. I was 1000 miles away from my home. I was happy that sunny morning--the first time I had been happy in at least 3 years--And four hours after saying those words, in 2016, I woke up in a hospital bed, having been in a terrible accident that would leave me stranded, alone, for months, with only a part-time aid to help me a few hours a day. I would scoot to the bathroom, or kitchen, as infrequently as possible, and other than that I was just in bed all day, alone, watching TV, healing. It seemed then, as it had seemed so many times before, that I was being punished for daring to be happy.  So, today I woke up and said "I'm happy" and tonight I am wondering what catastrophe lies ahead. I know I can't control it, I know I won't do anything deliberately to cause it, that's not how this works. And I have thoroughly enjoyed being happy today because you never know what the next minute or hour or day will bring, so you may as well enjoy the moment, however fleeting.  But maybe, just maybe...could I be happy tomorrow, too? Or is that too much? We shall see.

Hello, I am 22 soon to be 23 years old.  In 2019 I graduated from "High School", I am not from the USA or UK but I think the equivalent would be High School with good enough SAT scores to study at universities, thats what I did in 2019.  So the first year I did nothing and tried to work somewhere but it didn't work out.  In 2020 I was about to start studying at university and around the time my first semester should have started my mother mental illness got extremely bad, also covid really messed up my first semester and thus I didn't attend anything and to this day didn't do anything for university.  I blame it on my own laziness but I think my mothers mental illness and the constant stress everyday played a big role but I think in the end its my own fault.  Since then I am depressed all the time, I am just at home all the time I can pretty much quit university.  I graduated from high school with slightly above average scores even though I am extremely lazy and only studied maybe some days before every exam but still I always compare my life with the lives of my friends who are studying at universities for rich people almost being finished.  I really hate my life and sometimes just hope that one day I will get struck by a car or something, my mother is mentally ill and when I was around 18yrs old she tried to commit suicide which I think traumatized me, since that day I think she died for me because she is not the same as she used to be.  My father calls me a failure and once said that my entire future is "fked" even though I consider myself not that stupid and only in my early 20s, but when comparing myself to my friends I truly realize that I might be a failure..

There is no one I could ever spend my life with. Every friend I had just left me for better people while I just could go to bed and cry a little. My family never cared about me; I had to find a way to survive as a kid. I am just a human, different from you, but at the same time equal; tired and hopeless, I am waiting for my final.  &#x200B;  I wish I had less time than I was expected to have for this life. You can laugh at me, you can sympathize with me, or you can just ignore me. I cannot even cry, even if I want to, because there is no reason for me to waste more time. I wish I could end this, but it seems I will have to wait a little bit longer for that end.   &#x200B;  I am just a human, limited by this body and brain. I hate these emotions I experience. I hate myself and feel old every time I look at myself in the mirror. I am just a lonely human, waiting for my end.

I watched this movie with my parents a few days ago and Ive never cried like that. At the end when he was playing the piano, and 22 was a lost soul, and then when he was given that second chance. And that last line, I was holding the crying in and almost couldn't hold it in front of my parents. They just said it was weird or stupid, while I ran upstairs and cried myself to sleep. Ive never cried like that. I have cried because of someone dying in a game or movie, but that movie made me cry about me. I'm a waste of life. I'm just taking up space where another person could be living much better in. I have done nothing with my life, and I don't think I ever will. I have no purpose, and Im a waste of life.
That's tough. I'm sorry your parents couldn't see how moving the film was, and that you feel worthless. I cried too, my bro and I watching this disney movie at 2am cried, it's ok. What I was able to get out of it after some time was everyone has something to live for, and for virtually all of us, it's the little moments where we are witness to the magical simplicity and beauty of authenticity, it just takes a certain combination of experiences and observations to see it. Some get it right away, some change or see it a lot over their life. Some need a major life event to see it. I hope you can find some peace, and no matter what you are already worthy of your life. Be present, it's where the magic happens. Remember to slow down and get lost now n then, it's in the world we will find ourselves, not our heads. Cheers
I hope one day I find peace too, thanks for the kind words!

So I finally decide to vent to someone about how I'm feeling and they block me. It took EVERYTHING out of me to vent to them and their response was: 'oh'. That's it. 'Oh' to me pouring my feelings out. I'm so fucking done. I can't anymore. Why is it that whenever people vent to me I'll put aside HOURS to talk and listen to them, but when it comes to me nobody cares?? I sound so fucking selfish right now, oh my god. I literally can't anymore. Fuck this shit. Fuck existing.
First of all I am sorry you needed to experience something like that. I wish you would not to feel that disappointment. Happened to me 3 times now, which made me have trust issues of course, so I feel with you.  You are not selfish for feeling the way you do. I totally get that, if you put a lot of effort into a person, you kinda expect to get at least simliar effort back. You seem to be a good person. I am sure it is definitely not your fault.  What I noticed (sadly) is that most people are not capable or willed to deal with other peoples problems. Idk in which relation you where towards that person, but even friends tend to let you hang, if it gets to personal or "depressive". The "problem" with that situation for me was, that I needed to tell someone, which forced me to trust people. I failed a lot, which was hard,, but after a long time I was able to find a few persons, who took my problems seriously, cause they could relate.  That beeing said: I know that feeling of needing to vent and if I can't, I always feel like exploding. So if you want to vent here again, I will listen. I might be just a random dude on reddit, but I want to help, cause I can relate so much :)

Please give me some advice here. This person and I live in different countries, so I can’t be there to help them physically. They’re going through a really bad downward spiral and told me they barely have enough energy to get out of bed each day. They do not have a strong support system either (no family member who cares enough), and I don’t think they’ve been to the doctor.      Is there anyway I can help them at all? How do I convince them to seek help? Any insights would be appreciated, thanks.

I’m a single mom. I gave birth just before the pandemic began. I had to leave my son home with my boyfriend so I can go back to school and finish my last year of nursing. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for years and have been diagnosed with ADHD just before I found out I was pregnant. I have tried to killed myself 3 times. I didn’t exactly have a fairytale childhood but I’ve been rebuilding my relationship with my parents and I live with them together with my son. There are times I want to pull my hair our because I constantly get told how I’m doing everything wrong with child rearing.  My boyfriend, the father of my child, has had history of verbally and physically abusing me. The physical abuse stopped before I got pregnant in 2019. Our entire relationship has been rocky throughout last year and we’ve been on and off together since my son was 6 months.  I am so exhausted. I am staying home to take look after my son and attempt to study for my NCLEX. The never ending bickering with my son’s father. The parenting comments from mom and dad. Finding the motivation and meaning besides my son. I am so tired.

I’m 19 and turning 20 next month and I don’t know what I’m doing. I haven’t had a “real job” meaning I haven’t had a job where I have a set schedule I have to commit to. I work summers in the fields and I enjoy that but not having free time drained me after a while. I know it’s something I have to do but everything about growing up seems negative to me because I don’t have the drive to do anything because I’m tired of failing at everything. I’m not sure I’ll ever have a girlfriend because of these issues and because of my social anxiety. My brother is 33 and he still lives with us and hasn’t ever had a relationship and that’s where I see myself going because of how similar we are. I love my brother and I know he means well but now the thought of things changing just hurts because of how comfortable I’ve gotten. Seeing my parents age and still working hurts and I just wish I could get them their first house because that’s all my mom has ever wanted. The only thing that brings me joy is playing guitar and attempting to sing lol. I wish I could just do that for a living but it isn’t realistic and I don’t want to feel like Im letting my parents down again by turning into a broke failed 25 year old musician. I know how much I’m whining and how typical this story must seem and how I just need to man up but it’s just how I feel. I’m so behind compared to my friends and I shouldn’t be comparing but it just happens. I just needed to write this out to make myself feel better.

Does anyone have this feeling they just want to be in their bed all day and sleep but when you want to sleep you can't sleep so you stay up till 4-5AM just to wake up at 7 or miss the 7AM alarm and get late?
Hey friend - I’m really sorry to hear that you are struggling. Really, depression is hell and it’s debilitating. I’m not going to go into detail about my story but just know that I am also climbing back from major depression, issues with suicide, and PTSD. And I’m making progress for the first time in my life. Here’s what is helping me, and I hope maybe some of this can help you in some way:  1. Try to be kind to yourself. Your brain is sick, and anytime any other part of our body is ill we treat ourselves with care. Mental health requires the same care. Fuck the stigma, you didn’t do anything wrong for feeling this way, you are just sick and that can get better with care and treatment. Give yourself a hug.   2. Try baby steps with a routine. Sometimes we focus on all of the things we think we should be doing. Accomplishing everything isn’t feasible and it’s not going to come overnight. When I was in the hospital I started by doing a journal once a day. Then I started making my bed once a day. Then I improved my hygiene. Make a small list each day and check things off. Don’t put too much on the list, but you may find in time that you are knocking more out over time. Give yourself all the credit for trying. Checking one thing on the list is a win. For me it was “get out of bed”. Even if I went back to nap, I at least got out once. That momentum will build.  3. Push yourself to find the right therapist for your needs. It takes lots of trial and error. In my experience, depression is a symptom of my untreated PTSD. I didn’t know that for years. Thus, I was only working on my symptoms and not a root cause. Find a professional who is invested in you, your story, and working with you holistically to improve your quality of life. Pair it with a good psychiatric doctor or nurse practitioner to regulate any meds. For me, meds are 30% supporting the 70% I work on with my therapist in trauma therapy and CBT.   4. Set boundaries and communicate your needs with any family or support you may have that need to understand. Unfortunately mental illness is an invisible enemy, and people just don’t understand. Focus on what you can control and build your life around what you need to be your best. Set boundaries and limit any interaction with toxic people who don’t understand that this doesn’t resolve overnight.  5. When I got home from the hospital, I decided to put up post it notes around my house with my favorite quotes and inspiration. Could be “keep going” could be “you are loved” could be “fuck the haters”. Anything, you’d be surprised how much that can help boost a mood.    6. This pandemic has been hell and being alone and isolated is gas on a fire for so many of us. If you are able to drive, go drive. Just drive around, listen to music, reward yourself on a drive by getting a coffee/snack/soda whatever makes you happy. For me, at the end of each day I’ll go for a drive and it makes such a difference.   7. Try to remember that the spectrum of emotions and reality is hot and cold. I guess what I mean by that is kind of yin and yang. Good days and bad days. With depression we live in the cold. But there will be good days. When my day sucks and I’m stuck in bed, I try to remind myself that maybe tomorrow will be different. Not better, different. I like using “different” because that is guaranteed.   Best of luck to you mate. Hang in there. Focus on the basic needs of life and take good care of yourself. Sir Anthony Hopkins said something recently that really spoke to me: “today is the tomorrow you were so worried about yesterday”  You can do it and you will make it through. Fuck depression. Best of luck to you.
I'm stuck in this same loop right now. Everything feels like a massive weight on my chest and I just want to sleep.
When I'm going through a bad depressive episode, I try to remember that anything at all is better than absolutely nothing. I'll pick one small, achievable task and commit myself to doing it tomorrow. Examples include changing my bedsheets, vacuuming one room, tidying up one corner, etc. If I happen to be in the mood to accomplish more, sometimes I do. If I don't, at least I can tell myself that I did one productive thing that day.  Everyone is unique, so this may not help or make sense to you, but I hope this helps someone.
What helped me were magic mushrooms. I could stop taking duloxetine SNRI which was killing me. I wanted to kill myself when I forgot the pill. The withdrawals were true horror like in these stories r/cymbaltahorrorstories and I ate the shrooms and POOF withdrawals gone. depression gone. I wanted to cry and laugh and dance and LIVE. I LOVE IT.   I LOVE! THAT"S A SURPRISE. I couldn't feel nothing on antidepressants.   Magic mushrooms saved my life.      I do not recommend it to anyone, because it is illegal in many places still yet we are waiting for change. I urge you please contact your politician representative that you voted for and ask him to legalize magic mushrooms for medicinal use. Decriminalize all drugs. Let's end the war on drugs please people help me! Contact your politicians, send email at least or write to them or something. WE NEED END THE WAR! We lost dozend of years worth of research. We lost I don't know how many lives because of it .   PLEASE HELP
I hear you. I like to stay in bed in the dark, cozy in the security of my blankets and pillows. I’ll think about the things I need to do, knowing I might feel better if I get up do something.   But then I still feel down and dissatisfied and can’t wait to get back to my bed. For me, feeling constantly dissatisfied with anything I’m doing but knowing that doing something else won’t ease the feeling is a big part of my depression. Like there’s no escape, but being in bed is a close to relief as I can come.
This is how I feel today.
I feel you that is a really hard stayed.. Sorry I can't give advice or so because I'm in that shit myself
This is how I've spent this whole weekend, literally couldn't make myself do anything.
It’s a vicious cycle
I feel ya. The pain of getting off the couch is worth the gain!!
Circle of life.
Me, constantly...
Fell you :( . Hope you can find something to take up.
So much me...
I hear you, I came here to write something similar
Finding the motivation to get motivated.
Add one new aspect at a time, as it fits.
You’re not alone
You too?  I've been deeply depressed because there's a lot I want to do and a few things I \*need\* to do and the exhaustion of depression makes it unbearable.
I’m pretty sure this sums up the life of half the people on this planet (including me)  The tiny advice I can give is start slow to change your routine like do a new thing a day, like waking up early, making your bed, read, write a cv, look for a job, go for a walk, discover something new ect   Like this week give you one goal to achieve, doesn’t have to be a huge thing, could be something like cook your own meal at least 3 times this week or idk   Of course I’m giving you all this tips but I barely apply them for now, all I’m starting to do right now is cook for myself, listen and dance to music at least 5 minutes a day, I also started journaling (that’s kinda nice) and I started using melatonin gummies to try to have a normal sleep schedule because I stopped smoking weed (I needed it too much to sleep so that wasn’t good) but stopping it means insomnia, anxiety, panic attacks ect so that is fucking hard + I’m trying to do all of that in a toxic household so yeah I have a long way to go but that’s just all of us I guess  Just remind yourself that unfortunately this feeling won’t go away quickly but your have to start somewhere so it finally fades away at some point Hope this helps xx
Its hard, cycles are hard to break. I want to live my life to the fullest and I cant seem to get myself out of bed in the morning. Its a step by step thing and we'll eventually make it forward.
This is the cycle ive been trapped in and i feel like theres no way to get out
Fuck this has been my life the last week.
Use this moment to get up and do one thing.
Haha me all the time. I can go to work but sleep as soon as I get home, and feel depressed, but feel at least I did something. But during the weekend, I spend all of it laying in bed and can’t seem to will myself get up and then feel shitty that I can’t.
Break the cycle dude. Get up and move, try your damned hardest to text your friends or meet new people.
I hate the days like this. Happened to me around Christmas. I was supposed to shop and decorate and all that good stuff, but I just laid on the couch and cried all day while a YouTube video I wasn’t even watching played in the background. I know it’s hard, but when you feel you just don’t have the energy to do something, think of doing nothing as self-care. You’re resting your body and mind. I hope you feel better soon.
I'm too afraid to confess this to my family, that I'm not lazy. 😓
I sort of feel the same way. All my friends have a job and are going to college. I just stay home and do nothing. I play video games and help around the house but I don't enjoy doing it. I also don't text anyone or call no one. I know what I have to do, but I just can't for some reason. I can't get myself to do anything useful and I fucking hate it. When people from school or relatives ask me if I have a job or plans of going to college, I feel so fucking bad because I feel like their judging me and think I am a loser.
I was just going to post this. And I looked up what that was, and apparently it’s called Anhedonia. The crappiest form of depression; according to the article I read.
Do something. You don't have to feel like doing something to do it. It's one of those little tricks that seems too obvious to be meaningful but its true. You do not alleviate depression through inaction. Depression is as much a disorder of inertia as it is of any sort of lack or absence of anything. The only way to counteract inertia in one direction is by generating inertia in the opposite direction. Another way to phrase this that will be familiar if you ever have done dbt, is that a form of opposite action is necessary to counteract the tendency towards depression. This doesn't require doing a lot, especially if you aren't up for doing anything. But doing something, ideally physical like walking or stretching, helps fight depression. The mind and body do not simply have stores of energy that they draw from in order to act. They actively generate energy through various types of action. That's why people who work out testify they feel more energized on a daily basis.   Sometimes the only medicine available to take is bitter.
I'm sorry you are going through that. Just curious you said you are depressed because you aren't doing anything. That means you weren't doing anything before you became depressed. Why not? Depression wasn't causing that since you weren't depressed yet. Everyone gets in a rut so it's ok.   My suggestion for you is to make small goals. That's what my counselor suggested to me and it helped. When I say small I mean small. Something as simple as making your bed. Completing goals (no matter how small) will make you feel like you accomplished something. After a while you can make the goals bigger.  In the meantime you should talk to a counselor. Whatever the reason for you not doing anything before you were depressed you need to correct that. Counselor can help with that. I wish you the best.
Exactly me at the moment. I have no idea how to get out of this. I just want to be sonewhat happy and live life.
I wake up sad and bored every day, wishing that the day would end, counting the hours so that it is tomorrow and thus sleep and end the pain, but the next day the same thing happens and that is how it is a vicious circle.
Hey man, I know you got lots of comments and might not read mine but I'll still try reaching you. I'm in a bad place nowdays, I have no actual idea if I have actual depression but I think I might because I found myself in that exact state. What I did to get out of this was to take my ADD meds and that shit stimulated the shit out of my brain. It broke the cycle, I started doing shit because of the mental silence and desire to work it gave me. I know this is probably not a solution, but if you ever get to try something alike I'd highly recommend. Still feel terrible most of the time though, just being productive while doing it now.
play sports and you will be fine
I don't know why doing things makes me feel pain
Yeah, same here, I spend a lot of time in my head. Lately it has gone so bad that I can't even concentrate on people who are talking to me or activities etc. + other problems...
Add this and anime addiction = daydreaming about being in an anime (highly reccomend )
I don't know if I'm alone here but this only makes it harder, because as you said, those things will never happen.
So is there a psychiatrist here or someone who can help us get out of this circle
me 😌
i slept 9am-8pm today
This comment just made me notice it’s 4am
Yes me too.
That is really good advice, really well explained, thank you and I hope things are working out for you xx
I keep hearing about the routine thing, and I keep trying different things, but after a week or two I find I often give up. How do you keep the motivation up, and keep rolling the ball instead of dropping it?
>“today is the tomorrow you were so worried about yesterday”  What a beautiful quote. Truly wise perspective.
Why is so special to drive?
Me too
Covid and it’s winter lol
finally someone who put it into words. thank you so much
take care friend. life is a long long journey with ups and downs. i wish u more comfort today.
I hate whenever I cannot find a new anime for this type of needs
i found i've reached a point where most anime's or game's message on hope and optimism doesn't satisfy me these days. what's there to look forward to? work and more work for your career?
**atleast day dreaming gives me pleasure for some time instead of depressed whole day. And sometimes feels good for a day or two. So I don't want to stop this, even if this just a dream**
Yikes yeah! 11am to 630pm. Woke up mad confused and upset that I did nothing. I’ve been up for two hours and still haven’t done anything
Thanks very much. I’m glad you feel that way; honestly anything we can do to help each other on these subs. Things for me are improving. I’m not 100% but I’m improving over time and that’s what matters. I’m hopeful. Take care and all the best to you!
Doesn’t have to be driving, but I guess for me it’s been tough being isolated at home because of COVID. So I will drive around to get out of the house and carve in dedicated time to relax. Doesn’t have to be driving, rather, doing something you enjoy maybe?
Thanks friend
Yeah I used to imagine myself in naruto and mha
Oh, like pass the time? Damn i want to take the bus into town but it's so cold
Yup exactly. I feel you with the cold 💯

I feel very lost and hope somebody reads this. For almost two decades now I suffer from chronic depression with barely any phases of relief. I'm stuck at a low wage night job still working on a B.A. degree (I'm 31). I can't concentrate for longer than 5 minutes until my brain goes into toast mode. I get tired so easily and almost always work or lie in bed - so exhausted but mostly can't sleep. I have no friends other than my sister who is better in every aspect of life than me although she's younger. I have no interest in anything and if I had a gun I probably would've shot myself already to end this agonizing emptiness. All my goals are fake, all I say to people other than my sister is fake. I don't know who I really am anymore. Somehow I've lost touch with my true self.
Hi friend.  I feel your hurt.  You don’t know me but KNOW that there is someone out there wishing you well.  You are not alone.

I’m so fucking annoying and clingy, I know it and I just want to stop, and I’m sorry about the format i’m on my phone.  I’m just tired of being lonely, of feeling like I don’t matter that I don’t exist and that I can’t achieve anything. All i did was play videogames hoping that would make me happy but ti did nothing. I drew before but it did nothing. I try to talk to others but I’m just annoying, there’s nothing I can say or do that makes me a likeable person.  I get yelled at by my mom everyday. I’m trying to help her because she gets so frustrated but then just pushes me off and tells me to shut the fuck up, and I just try my best to help everyone I can but it’s like I’m nothing and that I can’t do something right or that no one needs me at all, and I just feel this intense heartache and feel useless and I’m just trying ti help but why? Why am I always like this?  Everyone has their own friends that they call up all rhe time, but no one calls or initiates anything to me, I have to. And i just feel so unwanted. I hate myself so much and I just want to stop it. I want to stop being fat stop being so tired of all this crap, of being hung up on. I wish I wasn’t so clingy. I just want to feel important or at least happy and I can’t. I feel so hurtful ti myself because I have my boyfriend but I still feel so unwanted and unneeded and it’s like... why? I’m so undeserving of it all, of anything good and I just want to know what I can do to stop myself from being this annoying little cry baby. I just wish I can be better, and not feel so lonely b ut I can’t. I’m sorry if I misspelled shit I just wish I could stop my own pain, I just want to stop existing, no one even needs me and I just wish I could talk but people are either busy or can’t talk, or don’t want to and are short with me. I just want to feel something other than a deep hurting and hatred for myself. I just want to stop crying.

I might make a longer post another time that is more personal but I’ll try to keep this one shorter as my main question I want answered right now is how do I motivate myself.  I’m 18 and in my 2nd semester of college. I had a good first semester with all As and a B+. The thing is, getting good grades doesn’t feel as rewarding anymore. Even in my last 2 years of high school it wasn’t doing the trick. Now in college I have to take classes that I’m uninterested in because they require generals and I have a hard time focusing in those classes. Some of the classes we literally don’t even meet with professors weekly. I had a bad first week of the semester. I hardly did anything. I am ashamed because I know what I have to do but it’s just so boring and uninteresting that I pretty much chose to slack. I’ve been struggling with motivation for a while now. I like to think I’m not lazy. For example I did an internship at a bank this past summer and I got a lot of good feedback and they said they really liked having me. It was something I was interested in and there were clear expectations of me which helped me thrive. I had people relying on me to do my part which pushed me. During class nobody really cares about each other. There isn’t much interaction. You basically just have to do everything yourself and it just is tough when you aren’t too interested or engaged. I did great in classes related to my major because they interested me and were more engaging. I know some people will say it’s only and a couple months and maybe you can just push through but I’ve been doing it since junior year of high school and I’m just tired of it. Maybe I have something undiagnosed, maybe I really am just lazy but I don’t know. I just wish there was some way to feel motivated and excited to learn again.
You've used up your passion drive too early in life.
You need to look for the motivation in yourself. Interest comes from the beautiful things that lie within. You must have traits and feelings hiding in your unconscious. Maybe you need a new perspective on what your studying.
Are you only doing general ed stuff? That might be your problem. Why don't you use some of your electives for stuff that seems cool or interesting?
F\*ck it feels like I've written it myself. Stuff about not feeling rewarded by good grades anymore. The thing with me that I had to realize was to face the fact that I didn't like my studies, I was just pushing through it because all my life was about having good grades. If you're like me, I would just advise to accept that you don't have interest in some stuff. You don't have to be good at everything, you don't even have to try everything if you don't see the point. It's amazing that you have interest in some of your classes. Focus on that, find interests outside school, and do the bare minimum in the rest. Think about the future where you won't have to go through stuff you don't like anymore: it's normal to be fed up with college but the workplace might turn out better for you. Reach out to your professors, lots of them are actually really understandable on the matter; it's very common to be lost in your studies and some of them have probably experienced the same. Good luck.

I've been through a lot in the past year (I'm sure everybody has a story from 2020). I had to take a job I don't like in order to pay the bills. I got arrested for DUI in the summer and had to pay thousands in legal fees (thankfully I got it talked down to a ticket), I lack the self-confidence needed to get a girlfriend and go back to school, and I drink around 6-7 beers on average a night and have done it for close to 2 years with the exception of a few days. The drinking really started after my first and only girlfriend dumped me 4 years ago and I needed something to cope with. I'm still not completely over her.  I want to go back to school but I'm too scared to do it because I work full time. I've been seeing a therapist for the past 4 months and she's helped me a lot, but I still feel helpless and bitter about life. Like there's times where I just don't care and there's the chance I might go off on someone or hurt myself. I get suicidal thoughts on occasion, particularly if I'm sleep deprived or really drunk.   I know I shouldn't let the success of others bother me, but it seems all of my peers are now in successful relationships with at least halfway decent careers they enjoy, and I'm stuck working a retail job I despise and barely making enough to pay the bills with what's left of my lawyer fees.   I get easily angry at some of the slightest things, whether it's forgetting something from the store or eggs not sticking when I cook them on a frying pan, and I'll pitch a fit and throw stuff while talking down on myself (the latter of which I wasn't too aware of until my therapist brought it up - negative self-talk). Last year I almost got fired for cursing out one of my managers (who a lot of other workers didn't like) and on another occasion hung up on a costumer on the phone for giving me a hard time (I'm terrible with talking to people on the phone for the most part). While it was situations that triggered me harder than usual, these are things I didn't do at my job in the past.   I really want to go back to school to go into human resources or be a consultant. But I'm scared I can't handle the work load and my full time job along with my drinking would be a problem for that (and I'm terrified of the thought of going into more debt, especially since I'm not great with school anyways and I'm in thousands in credit card debt already).  I have a lot of problems and they just seem to keep building up. I'm 33 and I feel like I don't have the control I should have. Part of me is almost to the point to where I'm questioning if life is worth it anymore because I'm so fucked up. I understand why people commit suicide and it's to stop the pain in their lives. I don't believe necessarily that that's the way to go but through my perspective, I get it.   If anyone can relate or/and has some sound advice for me than that would be great. I apologize for my lack of structure in writing this post but I wanted to get this out there before I head into work.  Side note: I do work out regularly and besides the drinking, I stay in good shape and eat a mostly healthy diet. I keep my apartment clean and I take care of myself hygiene-wise and stay in touch with good fashion. Just some positive things I wanted to bring up that I do maintain despite my issues.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzztn2/i_get_into_toxic_relationships_on_purpose/
the title says it all. i guess it's a way of self harming? i get mentally and emotionally damaged more and more. and no, i'm not into it. i have severe attachment issues and it fucks me up even more when they leave. i fucking hate myself. i cut more and get closer to death every day.
I've been in a toxic relationship that I felt a need to stay in but I was just so lost without him. It's hard being drawn to people who are not good for you. You need to find your unique hidden traits and find a sense of wholeness.
I've been there with self harm it i know how it feels. I'm not sure what attachment issues are I'm  sorry i wish i could help more but you should get some therapy if you don't then you should get some it really helps. also why do you hate your self if i may ask ?
Have you done any reading on toxic and abusive relationships? Your brain literally gets used to them. It's like an addiction. The roller coaster of the highs and lows become your benchmark for all relationships, so normal, healthy ones seem boring or even frightening. Your brain wants the comfort of the familiar ... situations and dynamics that you know how to navigate, that feel comfortable to you ... like if you spent years being yelled at, then being yelled at can actually feel safe to you, because it's something you *know*. Meanwhile, someone who treats you right is scary and uncomfortable, because you've never been in that situation before, you don't know how to react.  I'd really recommend doing some reading on this stuff, it can help you to understand why our brains are fucking stupid.
At least you get into relationships
yes, i have been in a healthy relationship a few months ago and couldn't continue because he was being too nice to me. it was something out of the ordinary and just did not feel right. i wasn't used to someone actually giving a fuck about me and caring for me. i was always overthinking about how i'll possibly ruin it all and he'll hate me forever -which actually happened- that was just exhausting. i don't know. it's like something that's wired in me. it just doesn't feel right when people are kind to me. i don't know. i'm so lost.
It probably is wired that way. Again, brains are stupid, they form habits and reward systems even for unhealthy behaviors. The good news is that the bad wiring doesn't have to be permanent. Just like your brain got used to toxic relationships, it can get used to healthy ones.

I've just been feeling really down, and it sucks not knowing why. I was fine two days ago, but yesterday I woke up realizing yet again how lonely I am. Not necessarily alone, but I might as well be. I check my phone more than a doctor checks a pulse and I get disappointed every time. I just want people to think about me. To think well of me. To check on me, even if it annoys or upsets me initially. I feel like I push people away, but I wouldn't love anything more than to be connected with someone. But I don't want to be a burden. I figure that I will always end up as that, so that paired with other issues just messes up my chances of enthusiastically interacting with people, even those that I already know well. This sucks so much. I can't even think about it without wanting to cry, let alone actually living it.

I'm bored all the time and the one thing I find fun is also something I really hate. I'm not good at anything, I'm ugly, and I have nothing but hateful thoughts for myself and for others. I am not happy where I am in life and I look forward to nothing every day except going to bed. Maybe that's why I sleep so much
Got to think positive .  I bet you the friends you haven’t met yet think you’re not ugly.  I’d put money on that.  Besides, looks are overrated.  We live in a stupid culture.  Better days ahead, okay?

I'm 25 years old. I'm married. I have a 6-year-old child. I can't hold down a job. My husband doesn't care when I have mental breakdowns about being a bad mom (he isn't the father of my child). I am most definitely a bad mom. My kids dad could probably take care of our child just fine without me. I've been suicidal since I was 6, but have no history of abuse in my family. Meaning I was just born depressed. Meds don't work for me anymore. Nothing works for me anymore. I feel trapped. Trapped by motherhood, trapped by wifehood, trapped by my inability to work, trapped by the idea that I can never be independent but that is all I want so desperately to be. Wondering why I'm even bothering to struggle to survive when I hate ever moment of my life, and I can't see a way to not hate living.

Yikes.. I just don't feel capable of doing anything. But then when I lay around, I feel anxious. It's like there's no escaping it.  I got dumped a year ago from a long term relationship and just can't seem to recover. Therapy...helps. But only for a short period. I just want the pain to go away.  I probably need to stop being in contact with my ex. It gave me hope for a while. What I now know was false hope. I need to just tell her that I cant do it.  Ugh i feel so anxious and upset right now you guys. Like i'm on a nightmareish merry go round that wont stop

I live alone. I’m unemployed. I have no friends and haven’t since high school. Even then I barely had any and never hung out with them outside of school. I have no degree and have lost all my financial aid so I can never afford to go back to college. Even if I did I have literally zero idea what I would go for. I have no hobbies or interests. I’ve never been in a real relationship or had sex. I’ve never even been kissed. The last time someone asked me out was my freshman year of high school. Ten years ago. I’m overweight and even if I lose it at this point my body is ruined with stretch marks and stretched out skin, especially on my boobs which I have literally hated since the day they started growing.   I look back on my life and I’m just embarrassed. It’s so pathetic. I have wasted the last 10+ years. I hate every aspect of my life. I don’t even know how to fix it at this point. I keep trying to get my weight under control but how do I do that when the days are so fucking long and I have nothing to do and no one to talk to? I end up just eating out of sheer boredom  I would anything to go back in time and start over. I spend literally all my time thinking about what I would do differently and then I just cry for hours because that’s obviously not an option. I wasted my one chance at life and now I’ll never be  happy

(This is my main account, I don’t really care if someone I know sees it. It’s nice to get this all written out. If you do know me, you may not want to read it, though.)  I just feel so alone. I’m in college, I have friends and a girlfriend who I care about, and I still feel so alone. It seems like I’m no one’s favorite person, and it feels like everyone just tolerates me. It doesn’t feel like anyone cares about how I’m doing or who I am anymore.   I had one really close friend who I used to tell everything, but for the past few months she just doesn’t seem to care about what I tell her anymore. And she criticizes me a lot (e.g., my singing, my writing (I’m not a good writer but I try my best)), which just hurts so much. I never speak up for myself about how things affect me (conceal don’t feel) because I’m afraid of how people will react, which also ties into the next paragraph. It’s a horrible, self-destructive trait I have, but that’s just how I’ve been my whole life.  I also don’t feel like my girlfriend cares about me as much as I care about her. Now, we’ve only been dating for about 2.5 months, so it’s not like I’m expecting it to be like we’ve been together for years. But, it seems like she never really wants to text me (one small example is that she never sends me good morning texts anymore, which is a little thing that made my whole day in the past), and when we are together in person she still just seems distant. She’s told me that her love languages are quality time and physical touch, but I always have to initiate anything physical like cuddles or kisses. I really care about her deeply, but I just don’t know if she feels the same anymore with the mixed signals. It just adds to my feelings of loneliness, and I get incredibly anxious whenever I think about it.  I’m also worried about what will happen when my mom dies. Hopefully it won’t happen for awhile (knock on wood), but when she and my grandma go I won’t have any family left since I’m an only child, I have no contact with anyone on my father’s side of the family, and no one on my mom’s side seems to want to talk to me outside of holidays anyway. I’ve spent many nights over the past few years having breakdowns about her passing away, and a few times I’ve told myself that I just won’t worry about it, that when that happens I won’t have anything left and I’ll just end my life. So, I don’t know what’ll happen then.  I starting thinking about suicide in high school. I never really had any plans back then, but it’s been sitting in the back of my mind ever since. For the past two years, I’ve thought about it at least once every week. Almost exactly a year ago, I was a hair away from going through with an actual plan. I haven’t ever been that close since, but I still frequently think about what would happen if I decided to do something.  Lastly, I don’t know what I want to do with my life. Almost everyone around me seems to at least have some plan of what they want to do, like become a vet, teacher, nurse, etc. I feel like I’m wandering around aimlessly, and I have no clue what I want to do. I’m not really great at anything. I keep telling myself that Tolkien quote that not all who wander are lost, but I think I really am lost. And I don’t know what to do.  So, to sum it all up, despite being surrounded with people, I feel very alone. It’s nice to type this all out, and if you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading. I hope you have a great day.

I started seeing a therapist along with a psychiatrist in the summer because i was feeling suicidal. It took months of nagging but they finally agreed to let me see them.  The therapist was nice but it was only 6 sessions because it was an acute session for ppl in crisis and I didn’t have time to get everything out. While it wasn’t life changing it was nice to talk someone who would be empathetic to the issues in contrast to my parents (who would just tell me to grow up and stop whining) and some of my friends (who would probably not understand and mock me)  The psychiatrist visit was what helped the most due to getting access to anti depressants. When I started taking them I felt a lot better. Before I used to have random mood swings where I’d feel miserable and suicidal for hours triggered by thoughts of my past failings (you can also look through the previous posts on my profile to see what are some of the things that cause this). I would brood for the rest of the day and not want to do anything. With the antidepressants the impact of this was reduced significantly and if I did have negative thoughts I could push them aside. It wasn’t perfect but it was much much better than what I experienced before.   Now come to January I’m almost out and haven’t had an appointment in a couple of months to get a refill. My parents stopped paying for the appointments because they said it was a waste of money. I can’t get a refill because I need to take an appointment first. I asked my mom what I’m supposed to do then and she just said, “Deal with it.” She went on the say that “other ppl suffer from depression and they aren’t whining and are learning to push on.” I got into a fight with her after that and have again fallen back into the same misery I had before taking the antidepressants. It pisses me off too because my parents are a good chunk of the reason why I’m very depressed and suicidal (again see previous posts for context). I would pay for the appointment but I don’t have much money (and I’m trying to save up enough to move out of this shitty family and get my own car). I offered to pay for an appointment but she refused to let me, and I don’t have access to insurance stuff and other aspects so I don’t know how to book one.   I don’t know what to do. I was doing much better under the antidepressants but now I don’t have access to them anymore. My parents don’t care about my depression, so I guess I’m stuck waiting until I make enough to pay for an appointment. If anyone knows any ways to get easier access to anti depressants or ways to fight of suicidal thoughts and misery lmk. I only have one pill left that I’ve been saving.

I met someone wonderful and we had a great connection in many aspects but the closer we became, the louder my depression was telling me I'm not good enough.  So of course I did what I do best, hurt him by pushing him away and letting my inner critic win. He has so many lovable qualities and all I can dwell on are the ones that make me unlovable. It seems like once I started developing feelings for him, I started doubting why I'm worthy of reciprocation. I can feel my thoughts slipping lower and lower. I wish I was stronger than this.

I just am tired, my brains constantly depressed and I don’t want to move or get out of the house or talk to anyone, I got this one guy who jus wanted to mess around and I feel like useless trash like always but maybe that’s just how I feel to myself. I dont know I got no life, no real friends, no one I feel is strong rock support really and I feel lost and like every second is just a burden and I wish I was never born. I wish I was blind or deaf so I wouldn’t have to see anything that would upset me again or deaf and hear something I don’t want to hear again. And I wish I could kill my thoughts so I don’t have to think anymore. I disassociate a lot and Live in my head. I got no schedule besides sitting in my bed doing nothing but thinking about depressing or bad shit all the time. I just wish my body would shut down or me just constantly sleep. Yea i get it I’m a piece of shit, worth nothing and a no one, and I wont ever will be, My body is useless and my personality means nothing and my confidence doesn’t exist. I’m tired. I’m gay, in a small town, I sometimes wish I wasn’t gay, and had no sex drive because everything in my life has been surrounded by sex and no love and just being used. I hate everything about myself, it won’t change and I’ll probably grow up to be some piece of shit some how. I dont know the future but I think it’s all fucking stupid. No one will help me.

Sometimes I feel like I am losing all my happy emotions and that all I do is go through the motions. I’m not ugly poor or don’t have “friends”. But I feel alone and get no enjoyment from anything. I feel if I died the world would go on and no one would miss me and after a little while no one would notice I am even gone. Slowly with time I feel like it wouldn’t be that bad to end my life. I tried to join a church to see if I can feel the void but I don’t feel it working. Maybe I’m not worth even saving

I have an appointment booked for Wednesday, but I’ve decided I want to keep off of medication for as long as I can. Like, I wanna try other things like therapy first and if that doesn’t work, then I could think of antidepressants. So now I’m thinking that maybe it’s dumb of me to go to a psychiatrist if I don’t even wanna be medicated. But at the same time, I wanna get a proper diagnosis and maybe he’d be able to recommend some therapists to me so it might not be that dumb to go see him?? What do you think?
It doesn't matter who you go to. All you need is a caring person in your life. Take a brake, stop working or studying for a few weeks, serch for someone you can spend time with. It will help even it takes a long time.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0axgh/medication_side_effects/
So I'm on 300mg of Effexor (Venlafaxine)... I was originally diagnosed with a major depressive episode and an anxiety disorder (6 years ago). Mental illness is quite common in my extended family, so I know I likely will be medicated forever. In the last couple years I've been suffering from night sweats and sometimes hot flashes during the day. I've been tested for everything else possible, so I'm now attributing it to my meds. Today I had an appointment and checked my blood pressure, it's quite high. So now I'm staring down the possibility of taking blood pressure medication on top of everything else. But I have no known family history of high blood pressure. Again, Effexor has high blood pressure as a possible side effect. My thought is to try transitioning to a different medication, hopefully with less side effects for me. Has anyone had an experience like this? Or have a medication that has worked for their depression and anxiety? I have a phone appointment with my doc next Monday, so I wouldn't be doing anything without her approval and support. TL/DR: Taking Effexor, hot flashes and high blood pressure as side effects. Thinking of switching meds. Any advice?

I haven’t cried since end November of last year and honestly I really feel like I should. It took me a while to realize how much you let go when you do it but the problem is that it almost looks like I’ve lost the ability to do it. It’s not that my tearmakers don’t work but whenever I feel bad or just extremely lonely it never comes, no matter how hard I try. I’m apparently quite good at masking or distracting myself from everything that bugs me day in day out but sometimes it just strikes me all at the same time. I really wish I had more friends, a soulmate, that I wasn’t this ugly, that I didn’t think this much, that I didn’t worry so much, that I didn’t care, that I could do more, that I wasn’t autistic and that I didn’t get crushes so easily. You might think some of this will come in the future but to be honest I doubt sometimes if I will make my spot in this world. See this thing it forces you to go with it and whether you resist or not, you will eventually die. Now what I like to do is shit with music, gaming and helping people but it all either feels like an escape or something that I’m not sure of if I do it out of ego or that I actually am wise and deeply care since It seems like I’m not able to cry because of someones death either. I’m not suicidal anymore but I still know why I used to be. See this earth sure is a beautiful one but I’ve never really felt like it was made for me or that I was made for it.  Pls don’t take this too serious. Perhaps this is just my regular vent. Idk why I typed this all at midnight and at this point idk if this is all even true and if I’m not crazy or anything but I just felt like sharing the shit that goes through my mind sometimes.  Peace out I guess.

It might sound ridiculous but this is the only fear I have. For the longest time ever I’ve been trying to avoid thinking on the past or remembering things from the past or even having that nostalgic feeling, while listing to a certain song, text, image, objects, etc. Basically I’m really afraid of thinking on the past and feeling that im getting older and those moments will be only in my memories. I don’t know how to stop this but is growing stronger every day. I can’t look at old pictures or listen to old songs or even scents that remind me of something or somewhere I went in the past.  It sounds like I’m 50 years old but I’m only 21 and this has been terrifying me and afraid it might get worse over the years. I really don’t know what to do about it.
I know how you feel. I’m 27 and I feel this more than ever. When I look at an old picture of me I start hating on myself now and get sad/frustrated that I’ll never be like that again... it sucks but I feel you. 😔
Aging used to bother me a lot. I’d buy a crapload of supplements, and cosmetics, and even cut plastic out of my life for a couple of months. Looking back on it o laugh, because accepting it’s a part of life will lessen the impact. 21 is still so young as it is. Have you ever sat down and thought about what this fear comes from?

Do ppl gaslight you with your mental illness and your opinions about them?  I have a friend who has seen me through (and been on the receiving) of my manic episodes, suicide attempts and depression.   She snoops through my phone apparently because she read my manic text about her that I sent to someone else. So those things are also held against me.   However she is no walk in the park, even her sisters agree (but probably wouldn’t tell her) that she thinks she’s perfect. A huge peeve of mine is ppl being inconsiderate because I am a super accommodating, helpful, considerate and generous person . I’ve told her countless direct and indirect ways and everything goes back to me. I’m sensitive, I’m unable or the good ol SHE HOW SHE IS!   Wtf. People don’t understand we can have our issues but still make complete sense and not be overly sensitive and making things up? MIND YOUUUU I’m on my meds and doing better than I have in a while. I’d say I’m 68 % compared to -82%.   Does anyone else experience this in your relationships? I’m tired of it. I’m also tired of paying for my manic episodes, I take responsibility buttttt shit I can’t help mania. I don’t want this shit !   Any advice ?
My ex did this. She made me feel so weak. It is the fucking worst.
It’s really hard right? Makes me feel like having no one in my life is the best bet for me.
Anytime my ex was going through a tough time or feeling down I would muster up every bit of energy I could to comfort her. No matter what I was going through I would do anything and everything in my power to help her feel better. But the minute it got tough for me she made me feel like such a burden. She would also say things like to depression isn’t real and people that are constantly sad just aren’t strong enough.

Took my first dose of Effexor last night. 75mg Er.  I've never had a negative reaction to anything before, stuff either just doesn't work or gives me a headache. Then again I've never tried anything for mental other than wellbutrin. So I waited until right before my wife was supposed be home from work. Take it. Get back to washing dishes. Forget about it. A little bit later I have this overwhelming urge to cut my fucking arm off with the kitchen knife I'm washing. Only last for a few seconds and then I start uncontrollably laughing about it. This kept happening back-and-forth for roughly about 5 minutes and then it just stopped. I've never had thought like that.  I didn't think it was anything to worry about since it came and went and I thought that was the end of it but oh fuckin boy when I decided to walk away from the sink I got a surprise.  I took a few steps, feels like I'm tied to a bunch of helium balloons. Oh shit. Take a couple more steps, OK these are normal. It's over. Take a couple more steps. Goddamn when did I turn into a bag of bricks? And all of this is happening simultaneously with the feeling of being on a rocking boat.   Then the most annoying part. I start trying to think of what I can do to minimize this. And I'm trying to communicate with my wife what's happening because she's worried and I just can't very well. Like it was like a lobotomy in a capsule. Half my brain was inaccessible. And I kept freezing mid sentence, mid thought, mid stride. Like a movie that keeps buffering. I don't know if you've ever watched Rango, but there's this lizard that keeps freezing. Like that.   And at some point during all this my wife is like "Woah. You're eyes. You're pupils are fucking huge."  Even funnier. I couldn't focus my eyes on anything and so I just walked around wide eyed like a weirdo like that Samuel L Jackson meme. Its been roughly 24 hours and feeling foggy.  I was wondering if anyone has any explanation as to why I would react this way. Given that the drug is supposed to take weeks to work I don't even understand, logically, how I had any type of reaction at all much less one this severe. Has anyone else had a similar reaction to this or anything else?
I had a bad reaction to this stuff a few years ago and immediately got off of it. I was extremely sensitive to light and sound and felt like life wasn’t real. It had also given me a seizure. The doctor way overdid it for me with that stuff and I was taken off of it right away.

But in truth your crumbling down. Your brick wall is weak and quickly decaying to the point where it’s hardly standing. Behind that smile is actually you screaming in pain, wailing for everything to just be over. Please be over. God just let it end.  But you keep picking the bricks up one by one. They’re so heavy and your body is weak but if they don’t get put back together then there will be nothing left. Then people would see the truth; behind that wall there is nothing. Just an empty void where you used to reside because this disease has erased everything you truly used be.

I had long hair for like 6 years but I cut it really short recently. Finally after like forever I actually love myself and how I look . I forgot how that feels like. I had to beg my mom and threaten her that if she doesn't cut my hair I'll cut it myself she didn't wanna do it because she was scared I'll regret it. I showed a best friend and she didn't like it, my brother just noticed today and said I swear to God you'll regret it (swearing to God in Islam is a *huge* deal). I look like I'm coming outta the 70s but I live how I look finally. My mom and other best friend think and say that I look great but negative comments stick easier and I'm starting to doubt if it actually looks good. Also my mom tells me to keep it tied back or tie part of it but I ignore her. Idk what to do and I'm a people pleaser and I hate that part about me, I literally out everyone before me and I don't know how to change. One of the reasons that I wore hijab was because I was very insecure about my hair and never really liked it until now.

I don’t know how to continue with these thoughts and feelings. I want to end it all and I have really contemplated it multiple times. I promised the one I love most that I wouldn’t do it myself, I just want someone to do it for me. I have failed at everything I do in life, and I have failed her. I can’t live with these thoughts anymore but I can’t go either, for her. I am in a struggle that I cannot escape, one that is eventually going to end me. I don’t who to turn to, who to talk to. I need that most now, I just can’t burden anyone any more with my presence and my issues. Asking for help always makes me feel worse, especially from the love of my life. I’m really sorry for such a weird message, I just needed to let things out.

Hello, one major part of what you said really struck with me. I used to be a mix of wanting to die but also being terrified of death, in an odd way it made me feel trapped in a odd state with no escape. Something I found that really helped me when I was in those moods was a quote from Stephen Fry. He spoke about depression being like the weather.   When it is raining, it’s really raining. It’s real! You can’t deny that it’s raining but what you have to remember is that... at some point that sun always comes out! I hope your okay my friend
thank you for reading my post and sharing that quote. teared up a little because sometimes it helps just knowing someone out there is listening.

Since the day I was born nothing has been positive. 90% of the day I stress over completely irrelevant things like school homework. Nothing goes my way and anytime I am happy, it only lasts for 2 seconds. For 2 seconds is the ONLY ok thing that happens to me all day. Even then I probably won’t happen. Every day of love seems to get slightly worse. My mood swings happen way too often and at the worst times. My mental health is an absolute dumpster fire. I barley socialize with any other people besides my teachers.   I just LOVE life

My mom just uses my past whenever she gets mad. But will then act like nothings happened. She gets into my private life and relationships yet says it’s not her fault - that she’s “hispanic”(wtf).  I have a girlfriend who won’t leave. She’s toxic and knows it yet my mom likes her and even when I don’t even say anything, she manages to win. Ngl I’ve thought about hitting her-but I can’t. So I’m stuck in this weird place where I’ve lost my life and no matter what she will never leave. She’s hit me multiple times to the point I had to push her away. But I’m scared to do anything. We’re nothing alike. Tbh I think she only keeps me around bc she doesn’t want to be lonely. I’m afraid of going to the cops-she’s smaller than me so who’s actually going to believe me? I’ve tried multiple times to end it-one time she grabbed my things and ran away like a kid. Today she just yelled and screamed and my mom came in (living with my mom-I’m trying to move out...it’s just expensive in my area and she always puts me down when I try) My mom and her use my past against me. I hate my life.

I just got them today and I'm nervous having them makes me nervous, thinking of taking them makes me nervous, I just don't know what to do. I took the first step by getting them and now I don't want them...I keep wondering if I actually need them or if I can keep doing it on my own (not like im very successful at it) but idk I'm scared they'll work and I'm scared they won't work and I'm scared they'll change me and I just don't know what to do with this anxiety.   Does anyone here take them? anyone have advice?
I take them, sadly I can't give you any advice. Medication works differently for everyone. The best thing to do is speak to your doctor about your worries, they'll be able to give you guidance and tell you the most information about the medication. I hope this somewhat helps.
I was nervous too before I began taking them, they definitely changed me as a person (in a positive way!) but that doesn't mean everyone else has. I go on two antidepressants and it's helping me. As might you've heard it can be rough in the beginning till 2 weeks for it to fully work. There are multiple ones to try, but personally I think it's worth it to fight. My advice is to drink lots of water. You'll feel more thirst when you begin taking them idk why but it's for my mother too haha
Once you find the right meds and once they start working, you’re going to feel so much better. I recently got off of meds that I was on for several years and regretted it tremendously. They’re a crutch. And once you’re on them, it’ll be hard to be off of them. BUT, you’re going to feel better. It’s the price we must pay to feel somewhat neurotypical. Just know you’re not alone in this and with these nervous feelings. I’m going to the doctor today to get back on meds because life is just better with them.
I’d say go for it. If you feel horrible or they don’t work you can always stop taking them. Some are harder to get off than others if you’ve been on them a while, but you can take things one step at a time and start out by seeing if it works or not. Which one is it?
Thank you!
Thank you for the advice ! Did you do a physical before taking the pills ?
See im scared of this too them helping and then being stuck on them for life. I don’t see it as a problem for others its just me like its also like im ashamed i need them but if my friend was the one getting it id be so happy for her. But yea im scared of needing them forever or needing them at all
You mean like exercising? No, I do began working out after being on the meds for a couple of months after feeling less and less heavy :)
I’m also afraid of this, but I’m trying my best to accept it.   Earlier today, someone replied to one of my posts where I talked about how I felt guilty for being the way that I am and needing to be on medication. They said something along the lines of “what if you needed medication for acid reflux or what if you needed an inhaler? You wouldn’t feel guilty about that. Because it’s necessary for you to be healthy.” That really helped me come to terms with being on SSRIs. I hope it helps you, too :)
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l067gu/feeling_quite_lonely_at_night/
Very recently, I started feeling much lonelier at night. I get the strong urge to text everyone I know in hopes of a response. Just a single response makes it. Sometimes I get one or two and that feels like a high. A short lived high sadly but still.     I recently started smoking dope, to help with my tourettes and that helps a bit, mainly cause it makes me tired    Anyone feeling this?
Except the tourette part I totally can relate. I can't really sleep mostly, so I stay awake, but usually no one is around in the midst of the night. Feeling pretty lonely all the time though. The night just makes it worse in a way.  It might be actually even the weed giving you those feelings. Sometimes it makes me feel disconnected and lonely in a way too. That's why rn i try to stay sober for once. Dont know, if I feel better than.
Feels good to read, bro. I doubt it's the weed since that was my first attempt at a solution and it makes it a bit better.    The night really is a bitch. Im trying to play video games till I cant stay awake. Something to keep my mind off.
If the weed helps you out, I personally would say stick to it. Just be cautious. You don't want to end up like me smoking everyday for years.  Distraction is the best you can do for yourself. Should you ever find a night active friend though, your situation might get better.  The thing for me with video games is, that I am still thinking no matter what I play. So lately I am awake all night, cause I can't sleep, but feel even more lonely, cause nothing helps keeping me distracted. The night just really sucks.

What do I do? When nothing brings me joy, or even- simply contentment? What do I do when I let myself rot away, holed-up in my bedroom, wasting? My heart fills with the heaviness of being a burden. I didn’t want to live to 18, yet here I stand, at almost 23. Why do I feel guilt over the thought of just how much relief I feel over the fantasies of ending my own life? Over and over and over.   It never stops.
Hey, it doesn’t always work for me, but maybe a change in scenery would do you well? Can you get out and walk around outside?...think about what’s going on and what steps to take next. You need to see a doctor and get some meds if you aren’t. If you are, please contact them immediately and get an appointment.   I have 19 years on you. If I’ve managed this long, you can to. But I wouldn’t be here without meds. Don’t be afraid to reach out to the [Suicide Prevention Hotline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) There’s no shame in seeking help, you’ve done it once here already...you haven’t given up. Just keep taking a step at a time. It gets better.
I feel you man. I have been there. I would recommend you to read Ikigai: the japanese secret. It might help you develop some hobbies and creative skills. I would keep my mind busy to ward off suicidal thoughts, so you can always try that. I hope it gets better for you. Best of luck.

I've been having a real problem lately dealing with people around me. I feel like I'm a nuisance at best to the people in my life, and a burden to a number of them. I also can't seem to bring myself to talk to anyone I know about this.  Now, I've heard a lot about "the importance of self love." I like to think I recognize a number of positive traits in myself; intelligence, impartiality, compassion, and determination. But I can never see anyone else seeing me that way, even people close to me. I always figure they see me as irritable, petty, rude, and hypocritical. I think other than immediate family, nobody would be put out by my death or suicide more than a day or two.  So, a few questions. How likely is it that I'm just being paranoid about how my friends and family feel about me? How can I tell what they really think? If I ask, how can I tell if they're being honest? And, maybe the biggest question: if I feel like I see myself positively, but I don't believe anyone else does, do I REALLY love myself yet?
Idk what your friends think but you need to focus on loving and expressing all your feelings and traits. If people think you're seeking attention then so be it. It's hard, ya know.
We're all too burdened with ourselves. No one perceive others to much anymore. Even your parents, if you're mature enough you know parents are just humans with their own inner and outer struggles. So that's liberating isn't it? When you feel like a pain to others, that's probably what others think of themselves, sometimes more stronger sometimes less. But don't worry, you are as much psychological and physical entity as anyone else. Use your amazing possibilities for good. Surprise the Universe with kindness.

I don’t enjoy being alive one bit. I’m so tired. I can’t focus. I don’t want to do anything. I just want to sleep. Let it be over already.
Hi,   Are you in any mess, supplements or anything?  Do you always have these feelings or do you just get in this mood every now and then?

Hi warriors. A little about me: 27, trans guy, married, with a three year old. I've been depressed since I was 13 with a lot of trauma. I've tried almost every treatment: almost every medication, therapy since 13, inpatient places short and long term, electric convulsive therapy, ECT, everything....  I'm here sitting in several states away from my home. My family and I are trying to get back to our home state and find a house. My son needs treatment for his severe ADHD and I'm feeling like the world is on my shoulders.  I just want to go home....I have an eviction on my record that wasn't even our fault. The plumbing kept backing up in our old apartment because of rusty pipes. I feel like I'm going no where. I'm trying so hard to get back. I'm going to get a job as both my husband and I are in disability and don't have much money.  I'm just waiting for life to get better but I feel so hopeless. Just a vent. Needed somewhere to get it off my chest. I just don't want to be here anymore.
It might sound trivial, but honestly, exercise. Work out. But dont expect too much of yourself. Fitness can be one of the best antidepressants, but if you set too many goals and you dont achieve them, it could make it worse.

I don’t understand. People are impossible, and I can’t understand how living life is possible. I’ve tried so desperately, so immensely hard to do the right thing; to be a good person. It’s soul-crushing, but I believed that the outcome would overcome the pain. I was wrong. Not only have I been broken down only to be built back up and destroyed time and time again, but now I see that it’s never going to be fulfilling. I will never get the peace and satisfaction of friends, family, or love. I am, and always will be unbelievably isolated. Humanity is a broken race, and for some incredibly angering reason; I can’t help but help others. I hate myself for that, and everyone seems to hate me for that. I’ve been hurt too many times, and I don’t think I can trust anyone else; I don’t want that anymore. I just can’t keep this in anymore. I used to be suicidal, now I just want it all to stop. It’s like being in a white room, the agonizing torture of the constant bland, desaturation of existence. I’m so angry, but I can’t be because of the moral hypocrisy, I’m so sad, but I can’t be because humanity won’t allow such displays, I’m so hurt, but I can be worse, because my pain brings peace and pleasure to others. I’m too afraid, too angry, and too hurt to live. But I can’t die. I’m broken, and I know I shouldn’t be, because I know others have it worse, but I’m just as selfish as everyone else who hurts me. I can’t do anything but hate myself, even when I hate those around me, my self hatred always makes me serve them, because I know I’m worse. Despite everything that I do, I will always be the worst villain humanity sired, and maybe, just maybe, everyone knows it, and they act on it.

... Dont know where to start, but I'll try  At the moment there's really a lot of stuff in my life tearing my head up. My dads sick, my dog is being a barky prick, I feel my and my (few) friends have nothing in common anymore and only meet to get drunk and talk about random crap, my girlfriend and I are very different places in out lives and want to do different things, my jobs suck and general sadness/feeling down, while I have to smile and laugh when being arond people.   The only thing I still love is my big passion for photography, I spend all the time I can researching and working on projects - this gives me so much energy and joy in life. This means everything to me.    I called in sick for work today (and will again tomorrow) because I really cant go out my door and just want to stay at home doing  the things I love to recharge my feel-good batteries, but now I feel like I betrayed my boss. But I told myself this morning that it's okay, and wrote on a piece of paper that I will tell my boss the true reason why I called in sick. I'm sure he will understand, I guess?   I really haven't felt this sad and fragile for years, though I have allways felt depressed/melancholic to some degree, but now it's a bit to much.   Sorry, I just had to get all this out of my head

I see a very fatal future for me. I dont want to do this anymore. I dont want to be alone. I want to relate to people of my age. I dont want to do things that i’ll regret. I want to have less worries. Life can suck so much.

I don’t know if this should go here or r/SuicideWatch or whatever it’s called (new to Reddit lol), but I do not have a plan or note or anything of the sort so I’m resolving to post this here because it’s more depression-fueled than suicide-fueled (though the latter is definitely present). I just need some advice.  I am a recently-graduated-out-of-high-school 19/f, and I’m currently 2 and a half months into my first job. I currently work a full-time, 12hr swing shift (5-5) for a paper mill and I don’t know if it’s the right job for me. I suffer from severe anxiety and depression (of which I have almost attempted once), and because of the former I focused more on school than I did a job, as I feared I would not graduate if I did not focus all of my waned attention on homework (I have diagnosed ADHD). I have medication for my illnesses, but I do not take them because my biggest barriers are that I fear they will change me, I have poor time management as a result of my ADHD and always forget to take them before I leave for work, and I get extremely nauseous whenever I take them. I’ve been on 4 different antidepressants and they all make me almost vomit aside from barely doing anything at all. It’s awful and it feels like I’m never going to find the meds that work for me. I know I should be more open and that it’s just my depression assuming the worst but I am paranoid of losing what little I have of myself left.  The job makes me extremely depressed/suicidal because I feel like I have no control over anything anymore and I’ll never be able to leave the job I’m at to stop these feelings from coming on. I am an avid drawer/writer, I enjoy video games/tv shows, I like going outside and walking/skating/swimming, I like collecting Legoes and making stopmotion videos, I could go on but for brevity’s sake I’ll leave it at that. It feels like, to me at least, that nobody else there has any time for the amount of hobbies that I do (for example, both of my parents have little to no hobbies, my dad golfs and my mom very rarely went horseback riding while she worked there) - and I do not want to give them up. They have been a part of my life for many years and I am very bad at dealing with change (I know it’s a part of life, but to have moved from my childhood home to my parents getting their divorced finalized and my grandparents moving from their house and so many of the shows I rely on ending all within the timespan of 2 years, it is starting to crush and terrify the shit out of me). I’m partial to believing that if I worked a job that is 8hrs, or at least something that isn’t 12hrs, that I would feel as if I have time to do the things I enjoy. I have nothing else to live for if I do not have those things present/cannot daily perform them in my life, but the job hunt might be a bitch to do.  I mostly took the job because my mother pressured me to. My family has a history of working there (both of my parents and both of my grandpas, my dad is currently the only one still employed and has been there for 40+ years, my grandpas worked for a similar amount of time and my mom quit to go back to college after ~12 years) so I felt as if I was obligated to buckle down and “carry on the tradition”. The pay is very nice, but I have also never worked before so the impact of $20/hr is significantly less unless I’d worked a retail-esque job beforehand. I know, I shouldn’t even be thinking about quitting with that kind of paycheck, but every time I go there I feel like I am going to mentally combust.  Everyone there continues to tell me how “all the new hires keep quitting, don’t they know how good this job pays”, “I’ll never understand kids these days”, etc etc etc. I make it seem like I’m not considering leaving when they talk to me about this but it’s getting harder with every shift that I work. I am not strong, I am not experienced, and I am not okay with being in a work environment where if my ADHD distracts me hard enough I could get severely wounded or potentially die (those machines are scary, man).  All of my coworkers are over the age of 27 (60% of the employees are over the age of 50). I had a very rough experience in grade school and was bullied to the point of becoming so introverted that I do not know how to communicate to anyone without feeling like I am being a nuisance, and the fact that everyone feels like a teacher to me or better than me does not help. I don’t feel comfortable talking face-to-face or in a “let’s be friends” context with anyone that is over the age of 30 - or at least ones that give off a “I’m better than you” vibe. They’re not mean, per se, but there are definitely some people I’ve worked with that are assholes to me because I am new (I am on extra crew so they throw me around the 4 different schedules from time to time, which sucks in its own right because I have no say and it feels like I am basically working unprovoked overtime with no extra pay) and it’s very discouraging.  I hate the noise. I have very sensitive hearing and small ear canals to the point where I have to wear earmuffs instead of the standard earplugs, which doesn’t bother me, but it is the noise and fear of losing my hearing that scares me. I love music, and it is one of the things that held me together during my junior and senior years of high school. I know it probably won’t impact my hearing that much, but I am still scared nonetheless. The earmuffs are also irritating the eczema in and around my ears (even when I apply stuff for it) which does not make things any easier, and I don’t have any earplugs that do not fall out of my cursed, tiny ear canals, lmao  I am unsure if I should quit and find a job that is more suited to me, or if I should stay and tough it out - but I fear that my unchecked anger issues and past history of self harm will come back one of these days while I am there. I have considered calling in for a mental day or calling a hotline, but I always back out because I don’t want to let the person I switch in for down. I have thought about going up to my supervisor to express my concerns, but I only have a few minutes of breaktime in between each roll of paper (which take about half an hour to get through) that I cannot leave for more than 10-15 minutes because we would be short one person (me) that we need in order to stay on schedule. I have applied for different positions but so far I have heard nothing. There were other people with seniority that applied before I did, and since over half of the people working there have been there way longer than I have, I doubt I’m going to get out of where I am for at least a few years, and I don’t think I’ll last that long (even if I do there is no way I’m skipping on going to college in the next year or so, so either way I’m going to have to quit eventually, I just don’t know if I can handle much more of this).  My mom is extremely pissed at me for even considering quitting - which, in a way I understand, but it seems like she’s mad at me without even thinking how this is taking a toll on me mentally. My dad is much more open (even willing to help me find something somewhere else) but is really bad at emotionally-driven conversation. I am scared of what my mom will do if and when I quit under these circumstances. Hypothetically I don’t even know if she’d be supportive if I decide to tough it out and quit, say, the end of this year to go to college (I’m thinking about being a programmer or something in meteorology or photography, or maybe just something simple like a librarian. I don’t know why I took this job either, but my mom basically did everything for me to the point of agreeing to the interview for me, and I know she’s just looking out for me and trying to help me, but I just don’t think I’m cut out for extremely labor-intesive jobs. The biggest drive to stay for a while was to just save a lot of money so I don’t feel like I’m swimming in debt by the time I enroll, but man, if I end up killing myself in the next few weeks I don’t think that will matter).  Even if I do decide to quit, I don’t know how to convince my mom I am struggling other than to check myself into a mental hospital - which, I don’t want to go back there, but I’m running out of options at this point. I just want to work somewhere that I don’t fear for my life if something goes wrong or where I just shelve things. I love organizing. I love being helpful. I enjoy feeling like I am apart of something. I do not love running 50 feet at a moment’s notice while I am severely dehydrated (with asthma >_>) to sit in a paper machine that is hotter than Satan’s asshole and wait for 10-20 minutes for the paper to get back onto the roller. I do not love cutting the extra stubs of paper and shoving the 40+lbs stack of paper manually into the pulper and risk clogging it up and having everyone tear into me and then break down. I hate crying at work and then breaking down in the car after my shift. I have done it a lot. I am at my breaking point.  Sorry for the long read. Thank you if you read this far. I joined Reddit to ask for advice for this because I have nowhere else to turn to; I’ve asked friends, but I wanted (a) fresh, non-biased opinion(s) because I don’t know if the friends I told were just saying what I wanted to hear.   TL;DR: I just started a new job a few months ago and the stress and pressure it is putting on me is making me want to end it. I am afraid to take my meds and fear that if I stay at this job any longer I will lose interest in my hobbies/interests, and essentially the biggest part of who I am and therefore not have a will to live anymore. My mom is extremely against me quitting (even to go to college) because she thinks I am incapable of doing things on my own (like looking for a new job) and doesn’t realize the full extent of how depressed I am. What do I do?
Wanna talk to me about it?
How do ADHD meds change you? You do know stimulants have withdrawal that causes deep depression
you should either take a vacation or quit. i had a similar experience with my mother not supporting any idea of quitting jobs, almost mocking me for being soft. but next time i had a dEcent paying job suddenly she was fine again. idk, i suggest dont worry what your mom would think. in a year or two you both will remember it as a distant dream

For a while I felt empty but I realized that I have passed this stage now in addition to not feeling anything anymore I inhale the emotion of others so that it becomes as empty as me and I do not know  what to do to get back to the previous stage before people leave so as not to become like me
Numbness and emptiness is from a defence mechanism. It's where your feelings and some personality traits used to be that are now in your unconscious. What are you empty of?
Of social interaction, laugh, feelings of fulfillment, love and went to survive.
You need to find your unique energies and traits. Love them, nurish them. Everyone has unique things in their unconscious - you just need to find them.
It's look very good but how I find this unique thing?
Idk but know that there's lots of uniqueness in everybody and search deep.

I'm trying to get myself out of my parent's house and all of the different obstacles and challenges I have to meet just makes me want to give up. I feel like I am working every hour of every day doing the only work I can find as an unskilled/uneducated person. Every day there is no true rest. If I give an hour of free time to myself I only have reason to kick myself for my irresponsibility. Idk man this hand to mouth bullshit demotivated me so badly.     I really just don't know how I'm going to continue on each day. Everyday I learn I have to make a new sacrifice in my life and I'd like to say that I need to make these sacrifices to 'get ahead" but the abject reality is that I have to make these sacrifices in order to keep a roof over my head and to keep my head above water.   Idk man.  I'm just so tired of all of this. I. Struggling to see how life can be anything but cold and grey. I just want to lay down and die but I'm too scared to kill myself. Too ashamed of myself to let myself stay in the same place. But I just don't have the wherewithall to keep moving forward. It's all so tiring.
Hey I hear you. The grind is tiring, that’s why it’s important to have some time for yourself to de-stress. It sounds like employment is causing the most grief right now. The trades are very easy to get into and pay amazingly well. You can get a certificate in a year for some fields. Have you looked into that? It could be the first step to solving many of your challenges.
Yes but I need to wait until I can piss clean. I have been a very heavy, dailey marijuana smoker for many years. I actually quit smoking just last week as one of the many things I've been doing to just get my shit together for once, but I know for a fact that it may take (will probably take) up to 3 months until all of the thc is out of my system.   That's based off of what I've read on the subject, but also personal experience. Last year I "tried" to quit and I was still pissing hot on those ~$20 tests you can buy at a pharmacy after two whole months of complete abstinence and working out every day. Anyways you're right. The trades are actually my only solace or hope of only needing that one 9-5 job to support myself instead of a handful of shitty jobs. Thanks for reaching out.
I just want to start by saying I'm proud of you. That is amazing to hear, taking steps to get things together, very inspirational. Within the trades there is so much variety as well. It gets a bad reputation for no reason. Some of my wealthiest peers are in the trades, laughing to the bank. Let me know if you need some help finding a path, I know a few things about the industry.

I suffer from depression and anxiety. I could sleep all day if given the opportunity. Yes there are times when I am feeling exceptionally down that I sleep to have a reprieve from the depression. But even when I am not I am still tired all the time.  I’ve done an at home sleep study and have been tested for the following: A1C, vitamin d & b12, testosterone, celiac, anemia, thyroid. All came back negative.   Have any of you dealt with this in the past, or are currently dealing with it? Have you had any success in overcoming it, and if so, what exactly worked for you?   Thanks
Any events in your life that have also contributed to the depression ? You mentioned at home sleep study ? For sleep apnea ??
No events really. And yes it was to test to see if I needed to do an overnight in patient sleep study.

I have schizoaffective bipolar type. I have been hospitalized 16 times in the last 3 years. I went completely off my meds a few months ago because I felt like I didn’t need them anymore and everyone around me agreed. I have been struggling for about a month or so. It has gotten worse now that my biggest support person through all of this has passed. All of the symptoms are back. A few weeks ago I was really manic and now just completely depressed. I am seeing and hearing things. Either I don’t sleep or sleep too much. I’m extremely anxious all the time. I have thoughts of self harm. I’ve seen my therapist 3 times in the last week. I have contacted my psychiatrist 3 times and he got back to me Friday night but nothing has been done to put me on some meds. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m letting everyone down for being sick and I cannot do the hospital thing again
Hang in there. I’ve had major issues coming off meds before and it can seem more insane than the feelings before ever taking them. It will eventually pass. Keep trying to get in with your doc! Take care.
I'm so sorry your support person passed. And for all these hospitalizations you've been through. And for all the pain involved in what you've been experiencing. Why isn't your psychiatrist doing anything to get you more medication? Did they say?  I think that what you're going through has to be one of the most difficult, excruciating things out there: I don't think it makes sense to frame it as letting people down. You didn't intentionally choose this - you didn't know this would happen when you decided to go off your meds. I think the main thing now is trying to take care of yourself, trying to survive this time until you can get another prescription, not a time to focus on the idea of any sort of self-blame or the stresses that could bring.
My psychiatrist said he was going to send prescriptions over to my pharmacy to help until we could meet later this week. Nothing was sent over and I messaged him again today about it and when can we have an appointment this week. No response yet
I hope he gets back to you soon!
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz4j2r/bought_a_gun_with_my_stimulus_for_suicide_posting/
Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice  I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff.  My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a "perfect" "son" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way.  As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly.  My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo.   I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over "no one really cares about you" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships  But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem  All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. "No one really cares"   I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult   I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from "I hate myself and want to die" to "I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive
I'm realizing now how absurdly long this post is compared to the others I've read. I apologize and thank you so very much for anyone taking the time to read it. I hope to whoever is reading this, that you have an absolutely amazing day and an even better year. Again thank you
If me a random is willing to read what you have to say and care about someone i know nothing about im sure that there are people who care about you the same way you care about them. Fuck everyone else dont give in to what they say about you and all this suicide will do is prove your mother and step father right. So just focus on what you think matters. If i was in your place i would get an apartment with my girlfriend even if there is a sense of abandonment and that something could go wrong but thats just life full of shit one after the other you dont know what will happen but remember you have a choice for everything.
Yeah, get it out, I hope u don’t do it.... things may get better in future... keep some hope and hope ur ok
Honestly, I wish i felt something. I know how it is so i dont think i can persuade you not to. But, a tip for doing something I think would be to just devote yourself to something bigger you believe in. You'll still feel this way for awhile but you might find some semblance of closure and healing like I did. You'll never really shake this feeling but you can learn to manage it and feel so free. Trust me, I know you probably wont but trust me, just take a leap of faith and get out there. Do some good and try and be a part of this generations solution. What have you got to lose?
From what I’ve read, in a glimpse of your life, Its apparent you crave stability and love, a familia love, and its so hard to find a support network when you don’t have the one that should’ve been provided with at birth. I think its tragic to say the least. I genuinely feel very empathetic in your case, with similar friends that have had no family and it fucks u up.  I have gone from 7 years of depression to a optimistic person with occasional dips in mood in 13 months, i don’t need to tell you how or my story. Its an understanding that your mind is your worst enemy and time is the great equaliser. Wish u luck my friend, theres more to you.
Growing up with depression, I always told myself if I got to the point that I wanted to kill myself, I would go do crazy stuff first like travel by myself to some random part of the world and try to live there, or sell everything and drive across the country, living in my car. Because if I have nothing else to live for, if I truly want to die, why not experience something really awesome or beautiful before you go, and see if it changes your mind.  The same could be with relationships, trying to get an apartment, therapy, etc.... so you think you're worthless or you're not capable or certain human relationships or whatever.... well what if you are? Why not try it? What's the worst that could happen? You've lived through every down and difficult as fuck moment of your life until now... that's how resilient you are... why not give yourself a chance to have something more? Find a person you care about and make their life worth living, find a cause you care about and make an impact there. If you don't give yourself a reason to live, life isn't just going to give it to you. But those reasons are out there. Just use what you have left to look for them before you decide to "go". I promise you that you deserve it.
The wrong parents or stepparents can definitely screw up someone's life; I've seen & heard of too many examples. But it is possible to move on from the trauma. You have a few things going for you already, you listed them!...& we've all read them.  As has been said here, if a bunch of randos on the Net are willing to spend time reading your post then obviously _someone_ in this world gives a damn. Also, you're young now. You have time on your side, so you still have the opportunity to improve your life.  I'm glad you haven't bought any ammunition. Let's keep it that way.
You say nobody ever visited your grandparents, but you forgot one thing, your grandfather and your grandmother had each other, a partner for life, and sometimes that's enough, and you can have that too. You can start your own family, with children and pets, and even get closer to your SO family, maybe they'll embrace you and make you feel loved and actually have nice family.  I'm just saying some possibilities but everything can happen, and you'll only know if you live for it. Most people have a turning point in life and everything change, and I truly believe it's gonna happen for you too, at some point, you just have to be strong unitl that happens, love yourself more and turn that wish to die in a wish for a better life instead, because that can and will happen if you fight for it, and I hope you do fight.
I read your post and it resonated with me, because I have been depressed since childhood too. Although you did not ask for advice, I would like to share what helped me. Two or three years ago I was suicidal and had a lot of intrusive thoughts about dying. I weighed my options and reached out to my doctor. He set me up with a therapist and a psychiatrist. Medication has helped me immensely.  Therapy has not. I've been to 3 therapists in my life and cannot open up to any of them. Anyway, medication, giving up alcohol, and exercise has helped me tremendously. Also losing yourself in a creative endeavor like making music, drawing, gardening, etc is really important.
I hope you feel better after writing everything down on reddit. When I feel depress, I do the same. I write everything down. I just want you to know that there are people like me who care about you. I can't give you a hug but I want you to call suicide hotline in America is 116 123
Hi, I don't know you but kinda have been in that situation 15 days back where I felt no one really cared and it's better to die than to live a miserable life (full of mistakes and regrets, for me). But after that phase of 3 days, i went to a psychiatrist and got medications for depression and anxiety. I was already in therapy. Waiting for the meds to start working, and making me motivated to live life.  If I had been in your position, I would get an apartment with the girlfriend. Let her know about my situation, and get medical help (if that's possible and feasible). I would minimise my time alone with the bad thoughts.   I have huge fear of abandonment, and I kinda live from crisis to crisis - so it'll take immense effort and self care and therapy to become functioning, trust me. But please, don't give up yet fearing the worst! There's so much to the world! You'll get your tribe very soon!
wow, i 100% feel this to the CORE. i too am in that “nothingness” point in my life and honestly I’m not even living for “me” right now, more like I’m living because I wouldn’t want someone to feel terrible about my passing or worse, to feel like there was nothing they could have done (even if thats what it feels like.) your mother & step dad are super insensitive to the situation (ur bio-father being out) and just because your biological father killed his gf doesnt mean there was something biological wrong with him?? thats the only real way it could possibly be passed down to you?? so the fact that they “fear” this from you really just screams “i dont know and therefore will be scared of you” but in no way is that your fault. as for your situation, a credit-score as high as 700 can most defff secure your gf & you with an apartment if that’s something you’re really considering. suicide is a cry for a help, its when one feels like there is no other option left but there is, and although all you know is nothingness you also know the feeling that your gf ignites in you. and if you can feel that shouldn’t there be hope to maybe one day feel MORE ??   also, i hate calling those suicide hotlines (not sure if you feel the same) but i just feel pathetic saying it out loud SOOOO if you’re anything like me, I’d recommend you texting the crisis text line. text home to 741741 and say mental crisis once they ask (this is from anywhere in the United States & confidential)
Think about your grandparents and how much they were good to you, how they've give their lives to take care of you. Now prove all those people that didn't care about you wrong and don't do it. Live your best life with your girlfriend, take her out, find a job, move in with her, start a family and be the family you never have. Think about how good that would be. There are people who care about you I am sure. Not always your relatives, sometimes family don't come from blood. Go to therapy and to a psychiatrist. It changed my life, made me want to live again.
Hello! I read your whole story and it seems you’ve involved many, many family members in it.   I recently decided to cut my dad off, after he has called me a failure, “going nowhere in life”, and a slew of other insults and cuss words.   The thing is, whatever people think of you or names they call you or opinions they may or may not have of you should be irrelevant. Do you think highly of yourself? Do you think you’re a psychopath? Or a good person? It seems you may definitely need some therapy to help get rid of all these unnecessary outsider opinions and focus on your own identity. Our parents and those who raised us can ruin their children for life, but it’s important to remember that you’re an adult now who can (through therapy and help, of course) leave those things behind and learn to cope with them. Your childhood doesn’t define you, and your life is so important❤️ I sincerely hope you don’t follow through with this, all the love
Trauma based therapy needs to be done and I’d suggested there may be a chemical imbalance that medicine could help with. Feel better. Don’t give up. Many more ways to try and get better. You have an illness, depression, you have taken the steps on your own to feel better, but now you need some professional guidance and ongoing support and care.
If you're willing to kill yourself then you're willing to give up everything...why don't you do that in a different way? Move somewhere entirely different.  Perhaps somewhere less career motivated and more family motivated? Somewhere where you can work to earn your keep in a small community or something?   Visa stuff is tricky but there are places your passport gives you the freedom to live, there are also places are free to live if you're willing to do jobs there thta others aren't.  Just the fact that people are responding to this post means your life still has to chance influence others' lives. Don't give that up so easily.
As I understand your emotions there isn"t much advice I can say besides if you are contemplating, please don't go through with it. Even in the worst times should you persevere. Eventually will you find your breaking point and at least have a sliver of wanting to reverse your course.  I believe you're an aching spirit, suffocating under their heavy issues, just wanting the satisfaction of a pleasant life to live without the pressures of resenting it. That is what we all want, after all. Just remember to take a step at a time, don't make any massive leaps so you don't fall past your goal. Keep putting yourself to the work you can handle and eventually you'll start to feel the growth.  I believe in you, even if I don't understand first-hand an abusive situation like that, I still can't help but believing in you.
Nah, you don't need to apologize. This subreddit is here just for this; to let it all out. I don't have much advice, and I won't say everything will get better. Because alot of people say that, and usually it never does. It never gets better, you just become numb. But I will say that there will be a time where you will appreciate not going through with shooting yourself. And most of the time, you're realize it from the little things. Maybe you'll be able to see something worthwhile, maybe you'll own a cat or something. Do you like cats? Maybe you'll be part of someone else's happy moments, and that makes you happy. Hell, maybe you'll just walk around in the city and find a nice place to chill and realize you couldn't have done so if you weren't here at that very moment.   It's always the little things that get me, maybe it'll get you too. Maybe one day you and your girlfriend could live it all out and forget about this. But no one ever forgets fully, perhaps you could think of it as your own momentum, how you grew to be who you are in the future. There will be one day where you look back and appreciate yourself, I can say that confidently. Because no one needs to be in a good place to think that. You just need to be in the right mind, and have the right spirit to think it. Think and know that you aren't a sociopath, that your parents albeit were jerks, you strived to be better. You are better. I don't know who you are but you sound better. I know you are better.   I'm rambling, see? We all do it in the heat of passion. No need to apologize for this post, you're a good man. You're letting it all out, and however long it is, we still listen. It's okay, dude. Wish you luck in life.
I think you should find an apartment and move out and just live your life with your girlfriend. You’ve worked so hard for what you’ve been able to accomplish, weight loss, paying off debt, etc. It’s time for you to make a new and better future for yourself. You deserve happiness.
You need to talk to a professional. Might need meds for a little while. Some talk or emdr therapy. I only say this out of personal experience. Nothing changes if nothing changes blah blah you know the drill. You've got a ton going for you brotha I hope you don't do what you say you're going to do.
Going to live with your girlfriend in a small apartment sounds wonderful, it’s a challenge but it would make me so happy, I say go for it, give life a try, you’ve been doing it for years why don’t do it a bit more? You might find out life is beautiful again
Please check out r/cptsd. I think the info there could possibly help you x
As far as no one caring…listen, no single person can properly love and be there for everyone in the world. So that's why "the world" has this apathy and doesn't seem to care. But decent people all care as much as they're emotionally able to, with that restriction--just read these comments. We relate, we hurt for you, we want you to feel better. But we can't truly connect because of time and space. So all we can rely on is that we take care of our loved ones, and they take care of their loved ones, and eventually that chain covers as many people in the world as it can. We want someone to take care of you like friends should, like your parents should have. We want you to take care of other people that are missing it.    So if it feels like no one cares, that's not it. We can't care properly for everyone, but we do care to the degree that we can, and you have to find the right people and form bonds with them for your own mutual caring. Your grandparents had each other and you. You don't need tons of people, you just need a few of the right people.
I’m not good with words but I can feel that you are a good person deep down. I urge you to not choose the suicide route but instead seek to find whatever happiness/pleasure u can and keep living life. Especially so when you’re so healthy. There will come a time when u will meet the right people and you will be thankful to have given life another chance. Good luck to u I wish u all the best.   -stranger with chronic depression
I relate to what you wrote so deeply that it feels almost as if you somehow had some glimpse of unsettling things popping at my mind.   Reconnecting to whatever is wrong with me hurts, but at the same time it seems like the only way to fight the fight against the roots of these thoughts
I hope you live to see a brighter tomorrow.
Sending you love and strength to fight ❤️
I can relate to this so much. It's my faith in GOD and hope for my family in the future that I haven't gone down a similar path. Existence indeed is pain and on this planet that's all there is. Pain. The world is a shitty place and the people are even worse. But man....... Don't give up. There is always a reason to see this life through you just have to find it. Try giving back and helping someone who actually likes being here. Their joy may work for you. Suicide has dabbled in my mind once or twice as well. But then again. After that then what?
i was going to skip this read, but for some reason my attention span once was pretty good and... wow. i don't wanna say any meaningless words or pretend i know how you feel or promise that life will get better soon. i'm not professional and i don't wanna recommend anything, but if i felt like i had nothing to lose, i would try the girl and apartment first. btw the first half of your story reminds me of someone in AZ i used to know  i'm sorry
I too own a firearm (9mm pistol)... I tell people I own it for self defense but in reality I bought it because it gives me comfort knowing I have a way out of this life.  I read your entire post. It’s not that long. Writing can be cathartic. Get it out.
I’m so sorry you are suffering so much. i have suffered form depression and PTSD my whole life. I know it sucks.  i’m a counselor. first of all know this - Depression lies, it is a really convincing liar but it’s bullshit. second, really try to practice meditation. Insight meditation specifially, which is not about having insights but training your mind to see that our thoughts are often just scary stories we believe that cause us suffering. the thought “no one cares” is just a thought. Just. a. Thought. a mental phenomenon . nothing else. it isn’t reality. look how many people have cared enough to respond to you? i highly recommend the book “Real Happiness” by sharon saltsberg. also look,for online Dialectical Behavior Therapy videos. DBT taeches you the skills you need to regulate emotions, tolerate distress and have successful relationships. good luck
:( I could tell (and many others) how much you needed to get this out. Your child self deserves healing and to feel stability and love. It’s no wonder you interpret your thoughts as truth. There is so much love for you out here, friend, even if it is impossible to see it right now.
Let me say, mentally having the idea that suicide is an option also helped me out. It’s so weird, haha, but makes me feel better. There used to be a pro-suicide subreddit and I swear it actually made me less suicidal to go talk to people in similar situations. Helped me find a bit of peace.
I feel your pain you don't have to apologize for feeling what you feel. Whatever other people are saying about you is not about you, it is only about them. Who knows if they are just projecting the situation with your birthfather.  You mentioned that your stepfather choked you. If that wasn't an act of self-defense, then it is completely unnaceptable and tells a lot about who really is dangerous in that room.   We cannot choose our parents, but we can choose our tribe. This summer my grandma, whom I perceive as my mother, was hospitalized with cancer. My  biological parents did nothing, only blamed me that I didn't contact them and 'ignored' them (both wrong). However my true family, true tribe, my friends, saved both me and my grandma. Find your tribe.   Hugs 🤗
Suicide is thought of as a way to “escape” but as you mentioned if there is hell after or even reincarnation then that won’t work. You could try to decide to just tough it out. Just accept your sentence until the universe releases you, which it will.
Check out Marisa Peer on Utube x you are enough.. her videos are free & very very helpful...
People keep telling me I’ll get better and so I keep going so you should too. Find how you can truly feel more loved.
Jokes to the left bro I been like that to I be like if this life shit go wrong ima just kill myself not on no sad suicide shit but because why deal with all this pain and misery if you can just escape and by looking at your life I'll be lucky to have money and get girls I'm broke asf
I'm just a stranger on the Internet so I won't pretend to know how you must be feeling, but for what it's worth, I really hope you get through this. You'll come out stronger than you were before, and please know that there's nothing wrong or to be ashamed of when you feel the negative thoughts creeping up on you. You are strong.
You are being extremely hard on yourself , for being so young. Remember everyone makes mistakes and life is hard for different reasons. Goats use those reasons for growth.
Excellent effort to be vulnerable and to articulate your experiences and feelings. You are not as alone as you might think. Check out an ACA self-help meeting because you might find people just like you - adultchildren dot org.
Instead of being suicidal try to help someone in need. It's better and more fullfiling. What if you reincarnate in some handicapped who can't even take his own life after you commit suicide?
My gosh....I’m so sorry. If I was able I’d come there and we’d get a burger or something....nothing helps the mind like bar food.
And then we’d try and figure this out. It hurts me to see people get abused.
I just want to say I'm 35F and I struggle with situational depression and I'm about talk to a psychiatrist about getting on Welbutrin finally. I say situational because I do feel like it waxes and wanes depending on my life circumstances.   I'm really good at pulling myself out of it- taking a hike, making art, talking to friends (which I feel like guys don't do enough of). 2020 has been a particularly hard year for me personally for reasons I won't go into and then on top of my personal reasons, is of course all the stuff going on in the world. I finally realize I need to give myself a fighting shot and try medicine.   But I did want to know that I feel much more hopeful now that this is temporary because I've struggled with depression since I was a teenager. It comes and goes and I know the feeling of thinking it won't get better, but for me it always did eventually. Just remember that happiness is not a destination you get to, it's something you have to work on every single day and choose every single day. I think when you're younger, the world seems so much scarier and out of your control, especially when you don't have a good relationship with your family. I just want you to tell yourself that things can get better. But you have to put the work in. There are people who care about you and maybe you haven't met enough of them yet... But I promise you they're there. I know our health care system sucks but if there's any way you can afford to talk to someone and seek treatment either just by talking to someone or medicinally, please give your self that chance. I'm here to give you hope as someone who's been in your shoes but has also reached true happiness. Nobody's got it all figured out and we all have our off days, months years... Some worse than others... But when you realize that everyone is just winging life and doing the best they can- you realize you're not alone. Life is hard as hell but there's also a lot of beauty and joy to be found if you look for it. Please continue looking for it and know that you are loved and you are worthy of this life you were given.
It sounds like you're doing a lot of stuff to make your life better. You've paid off debt, have a car, are saving money. Something in you wants to live.   Something I say to myself sometimes is, "why not?". Why not see where life takes you? Why not try?   You sound like an amazing, strong person. You've made it through so much. I think you can make it through some more.
My husband’s story is very similar to yours. As weird as it sounds, he has a cat that he raised, and was with him through all the hard times. She’s 13, he’s 25. He attempted suicide twice, and in our first years together I reminded him that (suicide) was ultimately his choice and it would be selfish for me to make him stay when he was ultimately unhappy... but also think of (cat) and what she would do without him. He’s been there for her whole life.   I guess what I’m saying is, you’re not alone. When you look at life for what it is—it’s bleak, man. All we can do is try to make the best of it. Your family doesn’t sound great, and you can lead an ok life without them. I got up and left my hometown for college at 17–never went back. I’m 26, don’t know what I want to be when I grow up, but I have a job and pay my bills, have some pets and plants, no hobbies, but I’m here and trying to figure it all out.  But my husband would tell you it’s ok to not like your shit family (he’s only kind of close with his grandparents), and take it all a day at a time, knowing some days will be harder than others. And I’d tell you there’s nothing to be ashamed of to get up and go somewhere and start over. You have a good foundation with savings and credit, so it’s what you do with it that matters. You got this. I believe in you.
I’m happy you vented. As a long term depression survivor it can be horrendous.  I am seeing a new therapist and doctor and I still have periods of hopelessness.  I’m lucky to have family support, but you just have to find support where you can find it.  After I had my first  go around with depression, I was doing okay but not how I wanted. Unfortunately on 10/12/15 we lost our only son and I crashed big time and felt like you feel now.  You a good person, you are important to this world.  You sound like an awesome person to know. See if there are any grief groups you can attend (loss of family, job etc. can all cause depression) to be able to vent and maybe get information on more resources to help you.  Please stay with us ♥️
Hey man dont do it please. I was depressed 5 years and getting out now. How many things i would have missed otherwise. All the best for you. We can chat if you want.
I dont wan’t to tell you to live your life when you are in so much pain trust me I know what it’s like but I read all of what you said and you seem a good person, someone that the world needs nowadays.
Thank you for giving voice to fears I've had for some time now - that when you get 'better' it just doesn't feel like enough.  I wish I had advice for you because you asked for it, but I have none. I'm just grateful to have read this and I'm grateful you're still alive.
you are loved and you are important. ❤️
I don't know who you are but I love you. Stay strong. It's so fucking hard. But tell that voice no and don't let it take you again.
Read every word, I think it's important for you to understand that there are people out there just like you who feel a similar way, you have gone through a lot and need to be kinder to yourself, give yourself some time please. I was ready about 2-3 years ago and I couldn't have imagined what my life would be like now back then(mostly everything got way better). Give yourself time, nurture vs nature you decide your own fate buddy. I'm not too great with words but if these last few could be the take away its that another stranger does not want you to go yet.
No wonder you feel the way you do, geez that sounds rough! Maybe set some goals and use your grandparents as motivation as a way to show ur gratitude?
Look how far you've pulled yourself. That is more than a lot of people can do. It means that you can also get yourself in a position to afford therapy at a sliding-scale payment.   You're only problem is that you think you're a problem. You haven't actually done anything wrong. Your feelings about yourself are a product of other people's problems, not about you. That is a great position to be in.  If everyone around had your gentle insight and patience and endurance and thought of other people's needs, there would probably be no wars and no starvation. I would much rather share the planet with people like you.  You have already taught yourself to have so much patience with yourself. If you remain process-focused and not outcome-focused on your mental heath, it will add comfort. Think of it like this: everyone in the world has something that fucks them up, and some start with much more support and safety net. Yet most don't learn to take care of themselves. So they stay the same or get worse. You are on an upward trajectory. If you celebrate that about yourself, it becomes easy to see that even if you compare yourself to a happier person now, in late adulthood you will likely have more peace and satisfaction than the same person because of your capacity for insightful personal growth. But more importantly, if you celebrate the growth process you have shared with us, you will have lots to feel proud of and will evolve beyond comparing yourself to others or an ideal/expectation. Happiness = expectations - reality.  I'm a psych PhD candidate who hasn't accomplished anything on your list besides having sex with one person and having a 700 credit score so trust me when I say you are impressive
That’s a hell of a story. I’m really sorry for your circumstances. I was super skinny before (eating disorder induced), and because of some traumatic shit I gained weight. I keep thinking “I’d be so much easier to love myself if I’m skinny again, then I’ll be happy”. But with my medications, that seems impossible. But your story has brought me a little comfort, even if I get myself unhealthily skinny again it’s not going to instantly change who I am and i won’t just “be happy”, I’m always going to find a flaw in myself. I was stuck for two years in my “trauma bubble”, still kind of am. I’m agoraphobic, I isolate myself in my house where I live alone, I don’t have meaningful relationships, shit, I haven’t even had sex in 2 years. But my “saving grace”, was EMDR therapy. I even put that treatment off for 6 months despite my therapist and psychiatrist telling me to do it. I looked it up and honestly? I thought it was bullshit. I was convinced the only way to “fix me” was electroconvulsive therapy, which does work for some people. But I’ve had a major seizure and “died” twice, so I’m too high of a risk, but I didn’t care. Mentality was “rather be dead than live like this”. But my therapist who I’ve been seeing for over a year got EMDR certified so it was a “fuck it, guess I have to at least try it now” thing. And for me personally, it’s honestly been a lifesaver. I’m not “cured” of being a walking talking trauma reflex, but my past trauma I have addressed, and worked through in all my sessions don’t affect me as much. I was even able to stop my Prozac since, cut down on my seroquel and klonopin and still be okay. I know it can be SUPER DIFFICULT to make yourself do something that seems as impossible as EMDR, the claims seem extremely outrageous if you’ve never done it. It’s like “yeah, that will never work, not even going to put in the effort for that”, but I can tell you, it’s helped me a great deal with my past trauma. Sorry to rant a bit
As another complete stranger reading this I want you to know You are extremely articulate and your ability to understand your own emotions is extremely important. I have a feeling you are not fully aware of your capacity but as a reader I am blown away by your words. I hope you find your way out of this temporary feeling. You got this. You are incredible!
Death is nothing. I know you cant comprehend this but even misery is better than nothing.  Nothing is nothing forever.   The numbness from antidepressants made me realise that life isnt worth living with no emotion. Even if misery comes with it. Nothingness is just like being a robot.
As a counselor who made it through my own battle with suicidal depression, I highly recommend looking for therapeutic help.   And most importantly, don't get discouraged or be anxious to try out a few counselors if you don't feel the connection you're looking for (which is super important in therapy).
I feel the same way i am ready to use my recent one to end the pain from this life. I have cried so much and people have hurt me so bad. I hate being in this eternal hell and we never know what truly awaits us in death.  I have came close to death and wish that guy would have shot me who stole the money from me. I have lived a life of neverending hell and no way to be locked up in a jail cell but the person who harmed me is getting all the therapy i hope one day life get better
This resonates very very deeply with me and I can relate slightly to some of the things you spoke on. I wish I had something profound or more helpful to say, but from one stranger to another, I am sending much love and good thoughts to you. Keep venting as you got to and stay as strong as you can. Just know I believe in you and take things one day at a time. Depression and trauma are a bitch!! Proud of you for speaking on something so difficult cause it can be so hard to do that a lot of times. Take care man, much love.
I've been there before. Haven't in a while but I can still clearly remember what it was like, seriously contemplating suicide. The only thing that stopped me was the inevitable pain I would cause, because one of my issues is always putting others before myself. That said, I've spent a lot of my time since then doing things people say I can't do just to show them. That helped me get through a lot. And music, an online community and getting lost in stories. Those helped me through the hardest times. I know it is hard and I wish I had better advice to offer but I don't. I'm better now but its after therapy and medication and even then it often just feels like going through the motions.   I moved away from my family to a different country because they were stressing me out pretty badly. I was also raised catholic so I understand what you mean about the fear (aka catholic guilt).   One thing was that I always felt like the move would make me happier, and I was right about that. It was a big weight. So if you question if being somewhere else will help you, there is a possibility that it will.   I don't know where i was going with this comment but I just wanted to let you know that I understand.
You sound like a caring, emotionally intelligent, wonderful person. It’s interesting about the apathy part because I would make the case that you are an empathetic soul. That you have been through a lot, and you think deeply and seriously about things that those who are feeling swell don’t necessarily have to think about. Things regarding existence and our place here, and your place here, and I am happy to know someone who thinks these things exists. It would hurt to think that you would end your life right now, as I think you are important to this world. Existence is so crazy and there’s no way to harness it. It’s all a mess. No one here is any more important than you are.
Anyone who threatens a wellness check goes to gulag.
Religion is fake af bro, theres no such thing as hell dw bro and also your parents suck dick
i'm still waitin' on my damn $600 check i don't know why it's takin' so long!!
I gotta say brother I can relate. I was planning on purchasing a rope with my stimulus. Not as fancy but you get the Idea. I also have been suicidal since I can remember. My only regret so far is that I didn’t do it sooner because I could have avoided a lot of horseshit.I could elaborate on my shity story. But that’s not the point. Be who you want to be. Don’t be what they say you are. They have no clue how abusive it is for you to know what they think. They usually pick out the strongest person and beat him down. It’s just what fools do. I’m pro-choice. Just make sure you’re ready. I heard when you are supposed to die you won’t fear death.
Please don’t kill yourself. You said you have a girlfriend, so think about how sad she would be if you killed yourself.
so first thing first suicide hotline in America is  116 123 . so please ring them. second get therapy asap . number three don't kill your self that would only make more people sad like your girlfriend your friends ect
Ask urself a question how much time have u spent worrying about the hells of other religions other than the catholic one. No matter what u do according to one religion or the other u will go to hell. Hope this adds a new perspective
give try to read about Islamic theology before you decide to kill yourself. Watch videos of Hamza Yusuf on YouTube. Please do it, it will help you loads. And if it doesn't you got nothing to lose.
Are you still in AZ and if so what part?
Hey, fellow survivor of a broken home life.  I know you've got mad comments on here and I hope some of them have spoken to you to give you motivation. I have often struggled with wanting to be in this place. It helps me, to hear stories like yours and know that I'm not alone in how I feel. I hope knowing there are people like you gives you some comfort. I hope you're doing better today.
Not too long at all. In fact, you're a pretty good writer. It sucks we have no control over our upbringing. We're just babies and then boom, adults with whatever tools we were given. I have no advice, other than live to experience more days, the good and bad... Keep writing and writing... Love comes when we least expect, until then we keep experiencing and growing from it all. I really hope you keep writing.
Firstly ,   now brother  reading ur post  i can tell u to stop thinking too much about things that are not really there or in the past.  U r wasting ur present by living in the past. What has happened has happened . The Past has no power to affect you in the present unless u urself allow the past to dominate !    Negative thoughts or negative memories can do u no harm if u dont allow them to induce reactions in urself.     Secondly , U r in america , people from world over  try to get to america illegally via boats or tankers or crossing the desert etc  for better economic prospects and get to bang ur women ! ( thats the truth )  . My point is if those lowlifes can come to america nad   make a living , find a job then why cant u finds a job and move in with ur girlfriend ? what's stopping u ? the answer to that is the negative thoughts that  u have ,  u yourself are stopping u . Dont be scared to take a step forward.      Thirdly , i would recommend some mind power course for u . try John Kehoe on the internet its for less than 100 dollars but im sure it will do u very good      finally brother  , to put it politely ...  STFU  with all this self pity/loathing mix   !  It wont do u no good other than reinforcing ur negative thoughts n beliefs about urself.  You r only trying to sooth away ur misery rather than actually doing something to end the misery .
Try shrooms and/or ahayuasca before dying, may remove your depression
take big ass loan and go play roulette and put all in red or black and see if you win it Gould change your life around
Please don’t do it  Live for me even tho I don’t know you If you want to we can chat privately
its ok its important to get it out
You're worth it.
I read the entire thing. It’s ok that it’s long.
I read every word. Thank you for sharing.
I read every word. I don't have much to say, I just want you to know I took the time.
I feel like you're right, especially about proving them right and living for what I think matters. Also that I have a choice for everything, thank you, I don't know why but that just really resonated with me and made feel a whole lot better thank you
Thank you so much, I will be honest I am trying to think positively (out of desperation lol), and I do enjoy it, I hate letting the thoughts win so easily
Also listen, no one makes your destiny but you, not your step father or mother, just you. On day you might make a difference in someone's life for the better just like your grandparents, and sometimes that's all you gotta do to change generations of people. Peace out my dudes.

Yes to this. Medication was a game changer for me. Eliminating alcohol and maintaining regular exercise are also essential.

As dramatic as suicide is, I was also wondering about just blowing my savings on therapy on the chance that it'll help, I mean not to sound morbid but I already have the gun so not much else to lose lol
[There’s a rule on this sub that highly suggests against that. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
You're so very right, one of the hardest parts is having to keep this in everyone day. Sometimes I just want to scream at a tree or rock to let it all out
Great to hear m8. You always have your reddit family which will never leave : )
I agree with #daylight321. Go as soon as you can with your girlfriend and if you can try to explain to her how you feel (at least the abandonment issues) it will help her understand that your "weird" behavior is not intended for her cuz of her but provoke by fear and pain, it will avoid miscommunication getting worse. Give yourself a chance to happiness, even if the ghosts of the past never go away it doesn't mean you can't feel happiness. And by the way, dna doesn't determine who you are, trust me, i been there, the blame, shame, hate and abuse, i can't purge my blood but i can learn what makes me different from "him". You feel for others, your post was clear about that, no psychopath/sociopath would care about their kidneys saving a child. They are incapable of compassion, you do, therefore you're not. Give yourself a chance
I think you can win. You seem bright and like you can advocate for yourself. Don’t be discouraged if various regimes or approaches don’t work. One will. I promise.
That's one of my biggest issues, is I hate **fucking hate** letting those thoughts win so easily.  I fight hard for each positive thing, and in half a second they disappear and those thoughts win another battle.
Its a bit long but i can if u want, i mostly come on here for nostalgia and trying to help people, i still get sad sometimes
About practical stuff like making money and finding a place to live...short term maybe look for jobs like construction or trade work since you're young and those pay well?   Longer term if you want a higher education go through community college for sure. You could just get started on a 4 year degree or go for engineering or health stuff. Or when you're 18, maybe you could work at a bank (don't need a degree to start) or do some training and become a real estate agent (also seems like a career you could get into without getting into debt).   If you want both adventure and thrifty living you could consider the van dweller life? Just some ideas. I think moving in with your gf if you can afford it would be very good. And I feel like a pet would be a good idea, someone for you to take care of and to take care of you, but if you're afraid of it getting in the way of your choice to live or die maybe you could foster them.
thats not true a human life is one of the most valuable things ever
Thank you for writing it out: it must have been painful and taking a lot of energy. I hope it was also somehow liberating; we’re here to listen and hope there can be better days.  I have a friend with suicidal thoughts who was abused verbally and physically by their parents, describing some similar fears and agony as you do. The reason I bring it up is not to say it’s easy for them, but it got better for them the more distance they could get between themselves and their parents / family. It’s pretty obvious how at times their upbringing and abuse translates into how they interact with new people in the sense of doubting strangers / new friends. It’s easy to give trust and be more carefree if one hasn’t experienced all this. Still, one thing that helped them was finding and building a new circle of friends from volunteering at a local charity with people who have a common cause, care deeply to the extend possible to them, and showed that more positive relationships with other people are possible. It also helped that it took away how much initiative they had to bring to making new friends and allowed for natural gradual bonding through their work.  It didn’t cure their anxiety, depression, and whatnot else, but it stabilised them to where they say not every day is pain, and some are even pretty good.  Your thinking about others, and your possible value to others here and in death shows you have a lot of love to give. You also seem high-functioning enough in your best moments to have a chance at getting away from those who abused you when they were supposed to care and love for you. I want to believe you could find some solace and love in safer environments where there are people that won’t misplace your trust.  You said you have no family, but then I’d argue family is what we’re born with and don’t get to choose. As we age we can start finding people who become family even if they are not blood related. Just like many people on this sub show compassion and empathy, there are people out there to engage with and befriend and build healthy relationships with that allow you to remember that only some very few people didn’t appreciate you, and your bad luck was that they were those closest to you and you didn’t have a choice back then.   I’m rambling, but I just want to send you love and hope that you can build a different life over time: you seem like a loving and reflective person who could give so much, maybe also because of what you went through.  Please stay with us
do you have any hobbies that can help you fell less stressed like listening to music or fishing ect.

True... Technically our life is the only thing we truly have in this world. Without it... We no longer get to have anything else. Our life is the key to our existence. It opens the doors to all the good and all the bad. Without it... There is only nothing... And I don't think it is a peaceful nothing that we're aware of.
Hello, I just wanted to say that I really agree and appreciate this comment. Also, to the person who made this post: so many people are here hoping you have better days :)) for me, listening to music helps!! I struggle with depression too, but it's gotten a lot better since I've started taking medication and talking to a therapist for over a year now :)) I also recently got a cat, which is helping me a lot :DD i suggest maybe thinking about getting a pet, or maybe volunteering at an animal shelter just to be away from people and be surrounded by animals instead!! I suggested getting a pet because falling in love with a new furry best friend can help immensely over time in my opinion!! I am not an expert, but I've read that some people felt more useful or relief on since they have to take care of another being other than themselves. Also, I feel like getting a pet can distract you from the painful memories. I know this wont help as much, but I am praying for you. I hope one day you will find people and maybe some pets that will make you say: I'm glad I didnt decide to leave this life.  :) please stay safe!!
depends on the sub-reddit you are browsing im talking about this specific one where its about people wanting to voice their problem and others wanting to talk about them and maybe provide solutions
Fuck it, eat some chocolate. It works on dementors, anyhow.
Yes then I 100% agree with you

I was diagnosed with depression sometime around 6th grade, and today I'm 18 years old. I've been generally pretty good in the past few months. Only recently I've been thinking about suicide a lot. I don't want to kill myself. I just think about it a lot. Like I'll just be walking on the sidewalk and a car goes by. I can be perfectly happy and still think "what if i jumped in front of this car" or if I'm laying in bed for a few hours ill think "what if i just stopped breathing and they found me in the morning". I have no plans on committing suicide. It might just be morbid curiosity, i don't know. All i know is it's becoming more of an issue in my social life. My friends say i look depressed, my parents always ask if I'm feeling alright. I am having trouble finding motivation to do much anything. School has just started and I'm already failing. I'm not sure what to do.

I’ve (31f) struggled with depression since 8th grade. I’m in a really bad slump right now. In October my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and then in December 10th my older sister (41f) was found dead in her apartment.   Obviously my depression has gotten way worse through all of this. I’ve almost never had thoughts or plans of killing myself/wanting to die. However I have had (and quite frequently lately) thoughts of just wanting to not be. Like I have the strongest urge to just lock myself in my room and pretend there’s nothing outside my doors - and want everyone in my house to ignore me/act like I don’t exist. If you’ve ever watched the good place think wanting to have my own Janet void or even to be marbleized.  Recently someone asked me if I had dark thoughts of wanting to end my life. My initial reaction was no but then I wonder if this desire to just “not be” is the same - or is it simply a coping mechanism (a horrible one, but one).  Thought?    TL;DR would you consider thoughts of wanting to not exist/be invisible/ go hide away from everyone to be suicidal thoughts?
Nope. I don't see that as suicidal thoughts. I relate 100% on the feeling though
Very similar but no

This is the most depressed I’ve ever felt in my 20 years of living. Usually I’m able to overcome my issues when they arise but now I feel stuck. It’s the same cycle of bullshit everyday. I really try to help myself but it’s hard. I feel like I have very little support. People will tell you that you can go to them when you need them but when it comes down to it, you can tell that they only promised you that out of politeness not because they really meant it.   I feel ugly and stupid. I’m a 5’4 female, 190 lbs. I know I’m beautiful but the mental and physical weight on me has made me look at myself different. I hate the rolls I’ve gotten under my chin, the gut that’s making it hard for me to fit my shirts, my bigger arms and things- I just fucking hate my body. The only thing my body is good for is making a guy cum and any girl’s oft can do that. The stress I’m dealing with the is making me look older than I am. I’ve been overweight for a little over a year and before I used to just accept the way I looked, embrace it and try to fix it. But that was when I was around 160-170. I was just 175 weeks ago and now I’m almost 200 pounds. Now I can’t stand to look at myself. I want to lose weight so bad but no matter who gives me advice or where I read I just can’t seem to do it. I realized that I’m overweight because I stress eat and I have little to no energy to be physically active because of my depression and lack of balance in my life. I eat ONLY because I’m stressed. Not because I’m hungry. Now when I eat I just wanna fucking throw up after. I just want to feel and look better I want to fit my clothes again.   I’m getting these headaches that make it hard to concentrate and think right. I can’t do shit right at my job and I work in a hospital. What if I fuck up really bad one day? I’m gonna get fired and I won’t have anything. As far as money, I will give myself credit for having as much as I have now but I can’t help but to me angry with myself for working as hard as I did last year and spending the money on stupid shit. I could have SO MUCH more but I chose to let impulsivity control me and leave me where I am. I’m moving to my own place in 4 days and I’m going to HAVE to be financially responsible or I’ll be homeless. My situation could be so much worse but I can’t help but to get chest pains thinking about what if I spend too much money on food or something and not have money for rent. Then what?  I’m tired of everything. Every now and then I think about killing myself but I know deep down I don’t wanna do that. I knew that if I really tried or if I found that one missing piece in my life I could be super successful. I want to make an impact on mental health. I want to influence others to take mental health more seriously.   But now I feel like nothing. I wake up, go to work, fuck up, come home, eat like crap from stress and sadness, go to sleep and repeat. It’s so frustrating and I hate it. I hate my fucking life. I wish I was dead now. I can’t fucking do this anymore. Or maybe I can? Idk. (Btw I have major depression, anxiety, PTSD and BPD). Idk how I’ll get through this.

Just ruined 2months free of sh and I feel worthless people all around me are being destroyed I sit back and watch as my sister is dealt the same abuse I was and I do nothing when I know shes gonna turn out just like her stupid sister. I cant think straight I'm constantly confused and forgetting words and I'm unable to do simple tasks like sending emails cus my anxiety tells me I'm just going to mess up cus I'm so stupid. What happened to me I was on the right track it feels like I was on  autopilot until the age of 15 then someone flicked a switch and now here I am unable to even phone my dad cus I'm scared I will annoy him. I feel like I should be doing something constantly feel like I'm on a dead line but my mind is full of cotton wool and I cant keep a thought. My step dads getting worse I feel like any day now hes going to get physical and theres nothing I can do except take it.mum just brushes it under the rug like normal it fine it's fine nothing is wrong we are perfect my daughters not a rxpe victim nothing happen my partners not an abuser nothing happened my sons not a drug addict it's fine its fine I'm not depressed it's fine it's fine I'll just unload everything every day on my daughter and when she breaks I'll laugh cus its finnnnneeeeee.

Just tired. Tired of struggling every day. Tired of depending on others. Tired of making people hate me. I feel every day like I have no right to exist in this world. I just need courage to finally take the last step and dissapear
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck

Fuck
Fuck
Whats the point
Nobody is here
I shouldnt exist
Fuck
I've had similar experiences but everyone has potential. Everyone has unique unrealised traits and things in their unconscious that are waiting to be found.
Courage is not to disappear, courage is to fight on!   I see that you are tired. Do you know what bought you to be this exhausted?   Im sorry you are feeling so low. Have you tried alternative things to help? 💜
Im just a worse person every day
I woke up this morning and didn't go to work. I drove around in circles. I'm homeless save that I have a child in two separate locations. So I sleep on a cot during the week and a guest bed on the weekends. I have no energy and all. I only experience life through the veil of depression and utter calamity.   I'm a veteran and father of 2 small children. Thankfully their mothers/grandmothers are still around in my absence. And to be honest I've been absent for quite some time. I cannot remember my last genuine smile. My illness is so bad that I've been considering living on top of flat roofed businesses.   When you feel you are a burden is one thing: To know in your gut is another. Just saying..
No potential here
Just falling apart. Lost my job. Started doing drugs. Pushed family and friends away. Now every single day I struggle and I just want to stop
For me, Good p0t helps. But the psychoactive effects aren't the same. All I get are "mellow" racing thoughts of impending doom and hopeless countenance with half a smirk. Yup, pretty pathetic.
I know 100 percent im a burden. If I eat, its because someone gave it to me. If I get food for my cat, its from someone else. If I actually make it to therapy, its because someone gave me a ride or bus money. Lost another friend today over this and im just tired of it. Im so tired of waking up every day and worrying about surviving and getting by. Im ready to just lose and let everything finally be quiet
You just need to find it.
I’m sorry you lost your job and you are feeling this way.  Drugs are an easy escape as I know 🤦‍♀️ and I’m sure you are aware. Try not to escape there too often as you know it just distracts from the underlining stuff.  You may feel you have pushed them away but take a few deep breaths and think , do they love/care for me, if yes then of course they are there. The mind can play crazy tricks sometimes to make you feel otherwise.   When you say you want it to stop, I feel you mean change.  I can do this 💜
Pot is the only thing that helps me. It slows down my racing thoughts and lets me pay attention to other stuff and not stress nonstop. I asked my friend to help me get some today and he blocked me. So im waiting on my crack dealer now, because he will front me.
Its not there. 30 years people have been telling me it gets better or to look on the bright side. Im tired of waiting its not happening I just want it done
When I say I want it to stop, I mean life. I want the darkness, the quiet, the calm that death would bring. Im tired of relying on chemicals for fake happiness to get me through each day. I just want the courage to take the last step
Even your negative thoughts and feelings can have beauty if you look. Your positive traits are just unconscious. Everyone has quicks. Tell me more about your feelings.
And reaching out to people who feel similar might help. Read the new posts in depression and see if you have people to relate to.
I know, but the next step is definite. Where as things will change. I have been here and still fighting.  It really is so very hard when you feel so low. What chemicals are you relying on?
Weed and cocaine. Weed actually helps but I can never afford it. Cocaine is making things so much worse, but its so easy to get. Im waiting on my neighbor to front me some now. And in return he gets my whole check tomorrow, thus keeping the cycle going.
Can you refrain from the Coke? I feel it’s something that may not help you right now.  Better having a joint than a line my friend 💜
That was the original plan. When I have weed I usually stay away from coke. But days like today where I'm stressing and I need something, the only one who will front me is the coke guy. So ill end up getting a front from him, which will take all of my unemployment check tomorrow, which makes it so I cant afford weed, which makes it so I get more coke fronted and owe next weeks check out. Its been happening like this every week its a cycle. Id rather have the weed because the coke doesn't really help, it just seems like it helps.
Did/Do you have any interests like walking, gym ect?   Are you open to trying mental health apps?  As happy to recommend. Feeling you need something to help your busy brain 💜
I tried a few things, meditation and whatnot, but I cant focus

We have been friends for like 3 years now. She had these problems from the beginning of our friendship. At the start everything was fine, we talked about her problems a lot and eventually she successfully recovered from bulimia. On the other hand she still struggles with depression and self-harm to this day. I listen to her vent every single day, but I think I just can’t take it anymore. I’m tired of stopping her from self-harm and suicidal actions. What can I do to make her seek a professional’s help or even what can I say to put her in a better place(no magical words, just some thoughts about what would you guys want to hear during those times)?

I cant go on anymore. I want to suicide painless but i dont want to go to hell. And im sick so i could cry until my body would fail, but that would be painful and i dont want to suffer anymore. I begged my parents to give me sleeping pills but they wont listen. At least when i sleep i dont feel the sadness and fear anymore (except for a few nightmares i had) i used to daydream and thats what it gave me hope but a month ago i lost the ability and i dont know how or why. Since then my depression turned worse and worse. The reason i got depression in the first place was because my parents emotionaly abused me but it was mild, but with time it got worse. The more i grew up, the worse my parents acted and the worse my depression got. I just wanted them to support me a little. Now im an adult and they told me im the biggest idiot and that i should suicide. I just dont have the courage. Theres no hope, i know there isnt any. I wont see my dreams becoming true, things wont get better and all i want is my ability to visualize and daydream back so i could work again on my stories and scenarios (i worked alot on them, i tried to show my parents a few but i kept got told it wasnt good enough i got scared to show them or anyone anymore) i needed to talk but ive been told to shut up, when i cried instead of trying to comfort me they just kept screaming at me to shut up and tell me how if i dont stop crying because im sick i will die and no one will care about me, wich maked me cry ever worse. Now its too late, i didnt talked when i needed too, i kept too much and now it exploded, now i guess i just need a painless death but im still a bit scared of hell. Right now ive been told that im gonna suffer because i cry so God will give me reasons to cry (for them i dont have any) and that it gives what you want. I ASKED SINCE I WAS LITTLE FOR ALOT OF THINGS AND WHAT I GOT WAS BROKEN DREAM ONE AFTER ANOTHER, THEN HOW CAN SHE SAY THAT HE GIVES WHAT YOU ASK FOR??????? I have to cry when im alone otherwise im threated they will break my stuff if i dont stop crying. IF GOD IS GIVING YOU WHAT YOU ASK FOR, THEN WHY I STILL CANT VISUALIZE AND DAYDREAM LIKE I USED TO A MONTH AGO???? I ASKED FOR THIS EVERYDAY SINCE I LOST THE ABILITY!!! I guess she ment it gives what you want only on negative. My parents say that im in depression because of too much good. Well, for the past few years ive been called a retard daily until i ended up beliving and becoming, ive been always told to shut up when i cried, when i tried to talk to them about how i feel they laugh in my face or told me than im weak, my artwork/stories were always not good enough for them and i used to like myself until they told me how retarded and ugly i was over and over that i cant even stand myself anymore. I do have food and a roof, but can it still be called too much good if my soul and mind are now shattered? If anyone has ever lost its ability to daydream and visualize but recovered please let me know... that was what helped me to deal with my depression alot, without it i cant do anything. I tried to paint and write like before but its just horrible what i do now... and i forgot to mention that ive been criticized for my tasted, being told how i have crappy tasted from music to food and clothes to pretty much everything. I was smart, creative and a bit ambitious when i had support (from friends before they left me) and now im a retarded piece of shit what dosnt diserve its breathing air

just had a massive fight with my mom, it felt like it was something bigger than me that I couldn't control (started crying and even slammed my door) and afterwords the only thing that I could think of as a solution was killing myself, I'm still feeling regretful for what happen, just want to stop being a burden to my family. This fight was one more confirmation that I hate being alive. I just feel like no one loves me they just "tolerate me" anyway so I want to know if you guys know/think that feeling these anger attacks may be a effect of being depressed or it's just me being fucking done with this life...
It's a sign that you have been avoiding your emotions, simplest way for a human mind to do this is to suppress them. Thus depression.  This isn't on you. You are worth more than you realise..you are loved more than you know.  I love you stranger.   After suppression of these emotions for a time, they tend to explode. Like compressed gunpowder. This is raw, untempered emotion. It will appear as anger, in fact it is a cry for help.   Go...now...to anyone you love.  Just tell them. I love you. I am in pain.

Please excuse my bad English, I'm not a native speaker. I'm depressed again aren't I? I've had a depressive episode before but I don't remember much of it. It feels like there's a black hole inside me, sucking all the life out of me, it hurts so bad and I want to scream and cry but I can't do it, in fact I can't do anything. I've been staring at a blank screen for 3 hours now instead of doing my homework. I absolutely loathe myself, I keep thinking 'how could I be any worse then this?' and yet every day I prove to myself I can and I know that people around think so too. It's obvious, the first thing in the morning I hear is an angry mum or dad yelling at me to come out of bed and that's the only reason I do or more accurately 'try' I try to hide how I actually feel, no one cares about it anyway, they never did. Even though I try to hide it, it doesn't always work and when I do show, they say I'm a crybaby, that I should stop overreacting.  They don't understand that I'm not just grumpy or sad, or that seeing a friend is gonna fix it. Or they ignore it and hope it will go away, maybe it will but not because I'm feeling better but because I'm better at hiding it. I've noticed that the things I liked have become a bore and even annoying at times, I wish I could like them again, so I don't have to pretend I do. But to be honest, I'm a bore too, or a burden. A massive one that won't go away, I'm sorry I'm still here, I wish I wasn't too. I can't even take care of myself, brushing my teeth or even eating feels like climbing a mountain, let alone sleep. I mean, I sleep more than ten hours a night and yet I can't wake up and stay up, I'm so tired it felt like I didn't sleep at all.  I'm so done... I don't think I can do this much longer. Then again, I probably deserve it, it's always my fault, I should get used to that. I should care less, but I can't. When I have even the slightest chance of having to speak in class my heart goes berserk. My mind starts flooding with fear and I can barely manage to get out a 'yes' or 'no'. There's no way I'm turning on my camera in class, I'll spare the class this ugly mug, I've been pretending my camera is broken that almost cost me my grade for a test. That was 3 weeks ago, I think… I don't remember. I can barely remember anything at all. That's no wonder when you don't even feel real. I sometimes feel like I'm a ghost looking over my own shoulder or that I'm in VR and the world around me isn't real, I wish it wasn't. I have considered hurting myself again, but I didn't. Not because I didn't truly want to or felt the urge to, but because I'm a whimp, if I wasn't such a scaredy cat I could've been outta here and yet here I am, sadly. I can't even go to a therapist myself, because I'm in wheelchair. Ugh, I need help and I don't know what to do anymore…

Please No:( You can be an engineer!!! As long as you’re still alive you can change your life to the way that you want it to be. I’m sorry that taking your life is something you constantly think about but just like you said how you supposed to be an engineer if you’re not here to become one. I believe you can do it:(

I just have to vent.  I fell into the worst depressive episode of my life in late 2019. Spent about a year in a hellhole I was certain I would never escape. Luckily, I eventually did, but still struggle with some residual symptoms. Currently in treatment.  2020 has been the worst year of my life and now 2021 seems like it's going to be just as bad.In early 2020, it turned out my father had stage 1 pancreatic cancer. He went through surgery, went through chemotherapy and all went well.  Then one of my cats got ill and we had to put it down.Then it turns out our second cat has a tumour and probably have about 6 months to live.When you thought it couldnt get much worse, my father became ill again.Now he's in the hospital and the doctors tells us he has about 1- 2 weeks to live. He isnt even allowed to eat due to complications of the surgery and his entire gastrointestinal system is completely fucked.  And just to top it off, I'm suspecting I have covid-19, in which case my entire family has it. And there's a 10 day mandatory quarantine even if the tests come back negative.I have no idea how to tell them. I have no idea how to tell my siblings they cant see their father in his last moments on earth because I might have covid-19. He have to die alone in a hospital, surrounded by strangers.  I'm sitting here just...  This is just comical at this point, but I cant even laugh. I cant even absorb this in any way, I've just emotionally shut down now.
I’m sorry to hear about your recent struggles, it can be suffocating to just have your problems pile up without relief, that feeling of just being fucked. I definitely would get tested ASAP, then as hard of a position as you’re in with your family, the right thing to do is to tell them you might have COVID and are  getting tested. Whether or not the right thing to do is what you should do, well that’s up to you. While others can relate to what you’re going through, only you know what’s best for you. I obviously can’t recommend you continue to (possibly) spread COVID, but in the end you’re the only one who can make that decision. If you want to talk more feel free to reach out
Thanks for the offer. I just have no clue what to do with myself. We're just sitting around waiting for the inevetable. We're all at my moms house and have been for the last 2 days.

Recently my dad found out I had a bunch of missing assignments in one of my classes, I could tell how mad he was just through text. I mean I never really see people type fuck in a text before unless it's a joke. I barely ever hear him say it, that's usually my mom. I told him I would try, and he said I had to do it, not try. I couldn't do it. I had 3 weeks and I got like 3 assignments done out of the 41 (we get like 2-5 a day). Any time I went to do them I would open the computer, and then either close it, or just start at it for 30min. I didn't have the energy for it or any motivation. I mean why am I even doing it, just so I can live a worse, more stressful meaningless life. Ever time my parents confront me about missing assignments, it gets really bad. Last time I felt so drained and empty, and I felt like they hated me to the point where I just needed to get out of there for a little bit. I started to walk down the driveway, and my mom screamed at me to get back inside, then told me that it was just missing assignments and that I have no reason to walk off like that. The rest of the day I just layed down in my bed telling myself how much of a disappointment I was. Then at night, I always say goodnight and tell them I love them, no matter how mad I would be I always say it. I wasn't mad at them anyways, I was mad at myself. When I told my mom I love her she just sat there and asked if I even meant it and nothing else. I was completely broken all that night. She didn't talk to me for a week too. It's my life anyway, like, just let me mess it up and move on, because life I guess.  That class I had a c+ in btw.  The class now, im going to have a D I'm sure, and it is already a C. And I got a 0 on the exam. And I told my dad I would do it. My mom doesn't know, because he found out before Christmas, and I didnt want to ruin my mom's mood. Now, I'm not only scared of what my mom will say, but my dad too, last time my dad listened to me after my mom went to her room. Now I have zero support. They don't know what this is like. They are going to say that I spent all the time I should've been doing the work playing games. Little do they know I've lost interest in my favorite hobbies and now spend my days sleeping and laying down scrolling through my phone, thinking about how bad the next day will be, just waking up to more life. Normally I try to fight back in these arguments, I don't think I could bring myself too this time. It's just pointless trying to explain everything. For once I tried, and just couldn't do it. Everything they say about me will be right. "You're just fucking lazy" they'll say, and "just do the fucking work". They expect me to be able to get all A's all the time, like there isn't a single class I can't do. I would get a B and they'll just tell me I'm not studying enough.  I'm afraid of how this argument will affect me and my relationships with my parents. And if they take my phone, I don't know what I'll do. Last time I had an argument, I was going insane, I was crying, laughing, and yelling all at the same time, i don't know what was happening to me, I just couldn't stop, I was just so mad at everything me, my lack of ability to do any stupid thing, and my parents for making assumptions.  If they take my phone, instead of spending all day on my phone, I will be spending all day laying down with me. When I am alone with nothing to do, my thoughts take over me. I rant for hours about random stuff I can think of, or I beat myself up over old stuff, or just for being me   What do I do about this? My dad is the only person I feel comfortable talking to about my problems, I'm afraid of being alone. Is there someway of going about this that doesn't involve telling them about my (self-diagnosed) depression? I know I should tell them, but I can't, at least for now.

Growing up I got made fun of. I was the only african american and hispanic girl in my family. I was called blacky even tho I'm caramel complected. I was also called shadow still to this day I never understood what the name shadow ment. I have really bad depression and anxiety as well as being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This all stems from my child hood and it has caused me so many issues as a adult. Trying to make friend while having anxiety is the absolute worst while most judge others I judge myself daily. I make it seem like I am ok but I am not okay. I have gotten called ugly my whole life so it's basically installed in me. Even on my preetiest days I feel ugly. I tend to push people away due to me judging myself for them if that makes any sense. Venting a bit on here. Anyone open to chat/ share your story with me?

I’m 22 M. Suck with women. Never gotten close with any women ever. Never been on a date. Don’t feel love or feel love for others. Severe depression has blunted my emotions. If I don’t have any success with women by age 30 I’ll just get a gun and end it. Can someone pm me about this or something?
Then go on a date, man. You have to try, even if it won’t work out. At least you will grow some skills and confidence. Don’t be afraid to ask someone out. The fear of rejection is the biggest issue. Men always get rejected trying hitting on girls and that’s okay, what is worse - not trying at all
And if you’re afraid that you won’t make it to 30 then ask yourself what would make you happy in this life. Maybe it’s getting a dog, or hiking every morning, or travelling or getting a gaming pc. Do whatever that can cheer you up instead of being sad. Bad thoughts lead to even more bad thoughts and the depression could get worse if you don’t do anything about that

Hi, I’m 20F. Basically my grandma died yesterday and it’s the first family death that has impacted me horribly. Everyone else was either really distant or we were prepared for it to happen. I’m so so so sad. I’ve never felt this, I knew it was coming. My heart breaks everytime I look at my mum because I just see sadness in her. Her mum and dad are both gone now. She lost 2 brothers and a sister. Her mum was her rock. I want to be strong for her but I can’t stop crying. And when I cry my mum gets even more upset. I just can’t. Like every time I think of my grandmas bedroom, or the fact we can’t FaceTime her anymore, or the fact that all our family back home is grieving right now, I break down. I make breakfast for my mum and sit with her in her room sometimes but it’s so hard because spending time with her makes me just wanna cry with her and at the same time seeing my mum cry is easily the worst thing I ever have to witness. Anyway I’m just wondering how you all pull through death of a loved one and comfort family. I can’t stop crying and I get migraines from crying so it’s literally the worst cycle. I’ve also been dealing with severe anxiety and depression over the past 11 months and I feel like the anxiety is putting really horrible scenarios in my head now that this has happened.   TLDR: how to comfort parent when grandparent died
Hi there do u want to talk
Both of my grandmothers passed this year. It is horrible. Grandmas are very special in one's life. It's cycle of life, birth and death and it sucks.  I supported my mom by taking her out for fresh air, walks and treats as often as I could. Just showing her that I'm there for her, hoping she would find some joy. And eventually she did. My father enjoyed sharing memories, we even had some sincere laughs talking about grandma. My therapist told me, which is maybe worth sharing that you can't take away anyone's grief and you have no right to. They need to cry, so do you. It's normal, and it won't tear your heart apart as it may feel like in the moment.

ive been taking Zoloft 50 mg for about 8-9 months now, it started a little difficult but within the first month i was improving nicely, i kept on getting well on it until very recently (past few weeks).. i read about this and some people suggested its because of life changes that cause new stressors which is true in my case.  i have an appointment with my therapist in about 10 days and i think i should bring this up to her but im scared because what if she puts me on a new medication and i need a whole month to adjust to it? i cant afford the time to do this because my midterms are starting and the side effects would make me struggle a lot more than i already am  also, i have been experiencing a lot of guilt for needing the meds and having depression in the first place, however im too uncomfortable to bring this up to my parents or even my therapist  has anyone had a similar thing happen and has some advice to offer? anything to ease my stress about the situation would be very much appreciated
Might not have to switch meds. It's likely that you might just get a bump in dosage, which shouldn't come with too many extra side-effects.  With the needing meds part, it's okay to be on meds. Plenty of people take medications every day for other reasons, supplements too. Some people have B12 deficiencies, D3 deficiencies, iron deficiencies, whatever. People take meds for UTIs, birth control, cancer, foot fungus, colds, whatever reason you can think of. They help make/keep us healthy, and there's nothing wrong with wanting to be healthy.
I'm not sure what the max dosage is for Zoloft, but odds are the first thing they would do is just try upping your dosage if you're not already at the maximum. Even if they switch you to something else, it likely won't be as big an adjustment as when you first go on antidepressants.   It's ok to be a little selfish when it comes to getting better. Do what you need to do to get yourself better. You can worry about what other people think of you after you're doing better.
Don’t be scared to tell your therapist and parents.  That’s what they are there for.

Today, after my dad told me to go on a zoom workout for my rowing team i used to be part of, and when i told him i already worked out today, i realized something. I'm a disappointment. It took me 15 years but i now know. My dad is disappointed in me. I'm just not sure what he wants me to do! Let me list off what he wants from me.  1. Be completely healthy and fit 2. Go to Harvard 3. Do stuff he wants me to do 4. Work in government  I cannot accomplish all of these.  1. I am fat and I am trying so hard to become better, but I don't have his support. I've seen results but he cannot accept that. It hurts every time. 2. Come on. Really? My dad is Indian and EVERY Indian dad wants their child to go to Harvard. And even if I do excellent in school and become a prime candidate to go to Harvard, there still is almost no chance of me getting in. 3. He doesn't like anything that I do. And I feel like I spend my life trying to please him. 4. I dislike politics. It always puts everyone in a bad mood. Why would I want to do this?  I just feel like I don't remember the last time my dad was genuinely proud of me. I don't want him to know how I feel because then he will feel like a failure. But the truth is. I'm the failure. He always talks down to me. I celebrate little wins I get but he can never accept it. I say, "Hey look! My arms have doubled in size, I have never felt more alive! The gym is working!" All he can tell me is that I haven't done anything and that I still have my gut. It's not right that I talk down about my dad but I can't just suppress these feelings anymore. Sometimes I just want to jump out of my window and maybe their lives would be better without me disappointing my parents.

A friend of mine told me 95% of people who kill themselves didnt know they wanted to kill themselves toll 5 minutes before they did which has me paranoid I'm going to get the urge to do it one day. I'm very nihlistic.i dont see much point in life but  I dont want it to end. The thought of death terrifies me and i think it's a foolish thing to do. I have depression and anxiety and feel life is pointless and sometimes get sick of living it but I've never in my 27 years felt an urge to kill myself... should I be worried it may happen one day? I dont take medication for my anxiety or depression because since I dont feel like killing myself I don't see a point further more I'm scared TO start taking medicine because I've heard so many times people have to find the right medicine and a lot of times getting the wrong medicine makes you suicidal.  I get sick of life. I feel like there's no point. But I figured people who kill themselves usually think about it for awhile... maybe I'm wrong. I dont want to kill myself and the way people talk it's like people dont have the choice when they do it and it just comes on randomly.
Alright—I am currently finishing a masters in psychology, dismiss what your friend said. Anyone can spout a statistic—show me the empirical support for that stat. You always have a choice. Don’t take that away from yourself. Nihilism was a dark place for me. I found a bit more meaning  in absurdism. Which is kind of a funny thing to say. Look into it if you haven’t already. I also think you should find a way to treat your anxiety & depression. Don’t be afraid of a statistic. You’re your own person.
Thanks dude. I dont thinking have signs of depression I mean getting sick of life is completely different then wanting to end it, right?
Well said!
Of course it’s different—it’s probably situational, you may be sick of the current situations you are in.

Living with dual diagnosis and expected to function “normally”  is so hard. The mood swings, disassociating, anxiety...on top of being a mom. I’m 26 with a toddler and I feel so trash when I she wants to play and I can’t even get out of bed. Or crying in the bathroom like it’s sound proof. I feel like a big waste of space. But if I die then she’s alone. And will probably be depressed. And so badly I want to be a good mom and give her all I never had.   I swear it hurts even more only living for someone else. What’s wrong with me that I can’t live for myself?

I've been on a collage course and my lectures are awful due to the work load I have had to work without eating or any free time for weeks on end. During this I've had no money and my mum abandoned me and my younger brother and now we have both been kicked out.  After a lot of other things one I realised I was abused as a child ( emotionally) and two I am currently being assessed for autism.   I pushed myself as an artist so hard for my course and eventually I ran out of ideas and just did that would set me the most marks. I now cant create any more I have lost my creative spark which is awful as it's my hope to get a career in the field but I cant if I cant make any art.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l095us/i_hate_who_i_am/
It feels like I have no control over being me. I have no way to change who I am. And I feel like the person I am, is the exact opposite of what people want someone to be like. I push everyone away, out of fear of actually having a reason to live. I hate the way I look, my priorities, my personality, everything.  I have no effort to start my assignment thats due in 48 hours that we’ve had literally months to do. I’ve been getting below average grades for months. I lie to my parents about reasons why, “oh my lecturer didn’t give us any help” and “oh it’s just a mock-exam” and I hate it.  I’ve been out of work since march due to the pandemic, but have been on furlough. I’ve been trying to make myself happy with impulse purchases, and even took money out of my savings that my grandfather left for me when he passed. It’s made me hate myself so much, knowing it’s going to waste.   Another thing is, I honestly hate sleeping so much, It probably sounds completely opposite to what most people suffering with depression say, and that they look forward to the escape from being awake. But man, it terrifies me. I hate not being conscious, despite being depressed 99% of the time I’m awake. The feeling of having no control while sleeping, terrifies me. I stay up until 6am everyday, and wake up at 3pm (the only reason is that my sister is a teacher and comes home around then). Sleeping, and feeling like I’m missing out on something, anything terrifies me.

Ok, so I want to start off by saying that I am 17, and I am a bisexual male. I live in the bible-belt of Wisconsin in the U.S. I grew up homeschooled and was a fundamentalist Christian. I deconverted a few months back after accepting my identity as bisexual and queer (in more ways than one) I realized it was all fucking bullshit. Now my family has a long history of mental illness. And I mean seriously fucked up. from the age of 15-16 I struggled with self harm. I really hated myself. And I pushed back who I was and it really fucked with me always pretending to be someone I'm not. I have had such close calls with ending my life, and it saddens me to think about how many other LGBTQIA+ teens who were never out of the closet killed themselves because of self hatred. Recently I have been doing a lot better with my mental health, but I'm still not out to my parents. And I present way differently then I wish I could. I really love who I am now, but I cant really express it. I want to be able to dress how I want, use the colors I want, paint my nails, get piercings etc. But I cant do that living where I do, my dad would be furious. And I dont want to be put in danger. So me and some friends are planning a trip to Florida on the 31st. We are visiting some friends and are gonna stay there for a couple weeks. I dont plan on coming back home.  My brother lives down there and needs a roommate, and I know of some available jobs down there. My parents most likely wouldnt do anything anyways. Maybe get pissed off, but I dont think they'd call the police. Ive lived away from them before. Anyways, I just wanted to vent...

it’s stupid, i know, because i can live on without any treatment, it’s just another issue to pile on to the mountain of other worries i have that make me feel like shit, it’s so tedious- why can’t doctors / gps / nurses help or at least give me a proper diagnosis for things for some clarity   nothing major, just issues with painful periods and me being hard of hearing,, not knowing what to do with myself about them just makes me feel so disconnected from the world, how can i begin to love myself if i can’t understand what’s going on with me in the first place?   and it’s not like i haven’t tried to get them sorted, i’ve been turned away by doctors for my problems, or they just do a few check ups and say it’s fine or how nothing is guaranteed, i’m just tired and want to know what’s really going on with me and how i can become better

Hi  I am a 20 year old full time student in a university in Florida. I'm currently in my third year of getting my bachelors in Finance. I work for one of the biggest tech companies in the world as a technical advisor at home (corporate sector), I work part time and even though I don't have a very high paying job currently, I have full time benefits and frankly there would be a lot of opportunities for me within the company once I graduate and be able to work full time and possibly relocate. I have a 3.6 GPA, and I am one of the best advisors within my team at my job (statistically).  I have considered becoming a professor, so getting my PhD in finance or a related field and staying in research/academia. This would mean that I would skip getting masters and go through getting my PhD right after getting my bachelors. Furthermore I really would like to get into a target school even though I am not in a target school for even my bachelors. (I goofed off in high school and did not try at all for my SAT), in order to even have a chance that would mean getting at least a 700 on my GMAT and have a great GPA and some great recommendation letters as well. 2021 would have to be the year where I have to do all of that in addition to working so this is where my challenges arise.  I'm severely depressed and have suicide in my mind every minute of my life(for couple of years now), the only reason I haven't taken my life yet is because I have a family that loves me very much and I don't want to make their life that much sadder and make my parents think that they were failures because frankly they have done their very best for me and I love them to death for that, and I don't have any more expectation for them. I also have Anxiety and ADHD, and I find it very difficult to get up in the morning, if I had the ability to erase myself from my parents mind and leave I would do it in a heartbeat but I can't, so i'm holding on as much as I can but I don't know how much longer I could do it.   While COVID-19 made me stay at home much longer and made me gain a bit of weight, I can still get girls and if I want to I do a great job socializing with all age groups. I drink socially but I tend to smoke a fair amount of weed, and there are a very few people in my life (girlfriends and EXs) that know that I have depression, and I feel the way that I do.(my parents don't know) My father has been battling with depression his entire life and I think that my mom is getting depressed too, but not close to how I feel I like to add, and to be honest other than my parents there are alot of cases of depression in my family. Idk if this is relevant but i added it anyways   So here is my dilemma, even though I know that nothing a person on reddit can say to help me with my depression and other mental issues, I need some advice for my professional career. I want to quit my job and only focus on my GMAT and school, this would give me some free time, and only make me focus on school but there are issues with it. First of all I have a great job and people in my age group would kill to have my job, I'm insured throughout and I have stock options and tuition reimbursement (even though i get grants from Financial Aid), I work from home, and i'm pretty good at my job(i feel good a bit after my shift but I feel as the job takes a lot out of me sometimes). So if I quit I would need to either stay with my parents or take out loans to pay for my housing (tuition is fully paid for) (i would take out loans from 1 year only since getting in a PhD program would pay for my tuition and housing) I recently moved back to my parents after my rent lease was over because all of my classes are online but I want to possibly move out very soon.   I feel like quitting the job and having more time for myself can be better for my mental health but I only work 20 hours a week and it’s a great job, so please give me your opinions.  Thank you in advance.

I have treatment resistant depression and I'm doing a treatment that basically puts you in a sedated, dissociative, altered state of mind. I've found that it makes the brain more receptive to new ideas and thoughts during the 45 minutes when it's at it's strongest. I find it difficult to direct my own thoughts in that state but I found listening to a video about letting go of your lonely core self really helped. Ideally I'd have my therapist in there with me but since that's not possible I'm wondering if anyone can suggest a good YouTube channel or podcast or something that is just like positive and healing affirmations? Something to kind of guide my thoughts in a positive direction.

Today coming home from school alone I wanted to murder everyone I walked past and all along the way moaned loudly enough that everyone could hear. Somehow I think that may not be healthy, I'm gonna go use my desperation as a jump pad to ignore my anxiety tmrw and try to get help somehow, I'll go try to talk about my depression to friends I sort of trust.   Hopefully writing this will remind me the importance of getting better. Someone on this subreddit said to not linger too long here to get better, I'll take the advice and call it a day. God damn self improvement is a piece of work. Will it actually get better? Not this year with this fucking pandemic. I've been an unhappy lonely introvert for so long, and before this pandemic started I actually was starting to socialize a lot more, and then BAM. Fuck you all your efforts were in vain. Now instead you have to live with the facts that you can't go to parties you finally enjoy or have any important senior high school experiences because of your paranoid family and because you've lived far from all your peers for many years.  Im so lonely wtf. Im surrounded with people who don't have these problems to this extent, and it just makes me so fucking sad because they all think I'm nice to be around, I'm just wondering how much I would've enjoyed this year had I more favourable conditions. Why did this pandemic shit come around right when I start to have a life, and on my last year of high school too, now I know my entire school life was been wasted.  Can't be bothered to reread this, I'm just venting here to maybe see if it will calm me down. It sort of did but also I still want to kill myself and I know that my past 7 years have been wasted and spent just unhappy. Ahhhhh-hhh fuck this man why is life so unfair fuck im sick of trying to self improve bye bye gonna take a shower now cause im addicted to them even though it just leads to me having further suicidal thoughts and also bad skin because of the hot water but whatever i just want to not be alive anyways might as well pretend to not exist in the shower

Selfishness. I look at myself and that's all I see. I bring pain to myself and others around me. I know better then these choices I'm making so that makes it twice as rewarding. My life only exists to suck the the life out of others, their time ,money and emotions... I'm like a parasite that takes others happiness in hopes of satisfying my own but remain empty and add guilt to the list. I lie to myself until I think I can convince them that it's the truth. But the ones close see right through it. Where is the lifeline?! Everyone talks about it but it's not there. I wish I could put an end to this. Right now. I'm trying to decide if the pain of me doing this to myself would be more detrimental to them than to have me drain their happiness slowly for the rest of my existence. I hate what I am. Always have. Desperately running after the attention of those I admire. Something in me desires love so ferociously but I'm unlovable. My life has only brought burden, stress, confusion ,pain and unhappiness to the ones I care about. I am better off not existing. I am unhappy and tired of what I should do and hurt others when I do what feels good. Nothing about me could bring happiness. I'm sick to my stomach as I write this, as I think of the ones I love. The only thing I have given to my friends is fake laughter. I am worthless. These thoughts are so loud in my head. These thoughts tighten my chest, they never stop just keep circling around and don't even fade during the high. God, if you exist,DO SOMETHING!!! Or do me just one favor and  remove me from existence.

I miss my old life when I could do whatever drugs I wanted to and have actually freedom to live my life but now I’m a medical student that gets drug tested frequently and I spend all my time studying and having panic attacks about grades and thinking about driving into oncoming traffic to avoid taking a test.  Sometimes I don’t even know why I did this. I thought I wanted to be something better than just working at a bar and rolling all the time. But now I’m 200K in student loan debt and there is no turning back.  Sometimes I wonder if anything is ever going to make me feel as good as I did back then when I was always high. I don’t really think so.

a few days ago i posted here about me being numb, and how it sucked because a family member died and i couldn't react, well, my brain actually only realized yesterday what happened, my favorite person in the world left me...  i cried all night, i cried at the funeral, i still cry.   listen, before this event i was already extremely depressed but now it's so much worse, i miss this person so much... i just want things to go back a few years.  now to what i wanna vent;  i think it's my fault, the death i mean, i really do.  i believe we live in a simulation and sometimes i cannot tell what is real or what is not, but i'm 92% that this was my fault, this because of two events;  in 2018 after my suicide attempt, i promised myself i would kms in november 2019 and no more than that, well i didn't and i went to 2020 alive.  in 2020, roughly in september i went to take my drivers license exam and the whole time i heard so many voices in my head telling me if i passed the exam something bad would happen and i would regret it, but i passed and i didn't felt happy; when i got home at the end of the day, my mom told me this family member was diagnosed with brain cancer and i felt so bad...and so guilty...  if only i died in 2019 or if i failed the exam, things would be fine.  &#x200B;  i'm so tired of my mind and my thoughts, it's exhausting, i just wanna be gone. no matter how much i try things only get worse.
If you feel like you have nothing why not dedicate your own life to trying to cure your loved ones type of cancer? Like the worst you could do in that scenario is help people
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzcvr4/depression_has_made_me_soo_dumb/
my brain is degraded and i also have brain fog. but the weird thing is... im even lacking common sense nowadays and critical thinking. like i cldnt understand anything or form an opinion on anything. put me in a debate, i wldnt be able to argue or defend my position..... but atleast im aware of this.   literally anything i read online doesnt register in my brain. i dont grasp much and i am not capable of giving a proper response... like if you are in a debate, you are required to know your facts and thinking critically... and i am not capable of that whatsoever.  god somebody pls tell me im not alone. this insecurity is killing me
I have similar problems too. Depression is basically brain damage. Humans are not equipped to handle major chemical imbalances in their brain. Depression affects cognitive ability as well as our aging process. Most people that live to 80+ live very happy lives. You won't find many depressed people reaching that age.
God me too. I'm 33, I've had depression and/or anxiety for the majority of my life. I used to be so sharp and I had a fantastic memory. Used to remember things so easily and was sharp as a fucking tack. Up until a few years ago, anyway. Now my memory is just dogshit. Retaining information is a lot harder now. I notice a huge difference. I can barely remember what i did a couple days ago, remember conversations, movies I've watched, or recalling information in general. I swear also when I started taking antidepressants, it's like my memory was further just fucking zapped (zoloft and wellbutrin mainly).  I've often wondered if i legit have brain damage from depression/anxiety lol
Yeah i literally cant focus for too much time on something because i get huge headaches, started when i was arround 13 so I figure out it has to do with depression as well
I cant tell you how much i relate to this my brains just all foggy and empty(or filled i legit cant even properly feel which one it is). I wanna enjoy anime or shows like i used to but i just dont enjoy these things anymore even tho ppl on imdb or mal tell me its good so i cant even form my own opinion. Its even difficult to write this comment bc my thoughts just keep contradicting themselves and i cant think of anything. But one thing that kinda helps me i think is the thought that i dont need to care what ppl other ppl think and even if i cant form a clear opinion thats just how it is.
same i thought i was the only one
Yup 29 here and since being depressed everything i've ever known or learned practically has gone out of the window. Including in some spots like you've mentioned. the common sense side. It's like... I should be thinking this is or is not a good idea but... it's not ringing any bells.  Things i used to know, used to be the family know it all... now? I'm the know nothing. its just gone
Is it possible that it’s a side effect from anti-depressants, if you take them? Perhaps you aren’t dumb but instead too numb to care about what’s going on? Or maybe you’re so overwhelmed with apathy, or drowning in the intense thoughts of sadness and hopelessness so much that you can’t focus on anything else?  I doubt that you’re dumb, just distracted or apathetic. I’m in the same boat and remind myself that I’m smart, but depression makes it hard to focus or care.
Yes x100000. When it was at its worst there was a couple month period where i could hardly speak to my own friends and family because i would stumble over words and say the wrong things entirely, just completely apathetic. I'd find myself arguing about things i didnt even agree with in an effort to convince myself i was still in there somewhere, ripe with opinions and a personality. In reality, me arguing was just nonsense rambling. Like i was in autopilot trying to force myself to be a person. I realized i had constructed a fake version of myself after months of doing so. I'm doin a lot better, but it's still painful to have to watch myself deteriorate like this.
> put me in a debate, i wldnt be able to argue or defend my position  It's pretty hard to formulate an argument in one's own head with no audience when one imagines every potential audience screaming incessant bloody murder and spouting off narcissistic word salad. At least that how I feel.
My grandma was a smart women, she use to have her own spot in an antique shop and she was really good at math because of this. She had a great memory too and she was well into her 70's.  Then my grandfather died in 2017 and she became extremely depressed. A year later and her memory became so bad from being depressed she couldn't even remember her best friend's name. She lost her great math skills so she ended up stopping selling antiques because of this.  So in short, yeah depression definitely messes up people's brains. It has to mine too.
I've lost any ability I had to retain important information, even though I was one of those "gifted" students with high IQ or whatever. I literally cannot remember anything. If I got into a debate, I wouldn't remember the facts, I wouldn't remember names or numbers. Nothing. I live my life very passively because I literally cannot remember anything.   I can't even remember my own life. I have almost no memories to look back at of my friends or family. I'm 24 and can't even remember high school or college. It all feels like a movie I watched one time a long time ago and can't remember shit but the main plot.
Same, bruh, same. I just can't. I used to be an AcHiEvEr but I don't know what happened.
I’ve felt that too.
I’ve found that it causes my brain to be in a kind of zombie like state? My reaction times when alone are awful now and I constantly forget things when cooking etc. My pizza caught fire somehow in the oven the other day and I kinda just blankly stared for like 20 seconds before doing something as my mind just didn’t put two and two together :/ I hate it :(
I have what you have I experience those feelings clouded consciousness it's something that stops me from living normally people can't see it I've decided to stop reporting it to people
i'm also going through this... sadly, my family keeps on telling me that i'm so fucking dumb and could not even think properly.. i can't even tell them that i have depression because my mom will only make fun of me while two of my sisters are aware of my current situation but they only think that i'm just some crazy person and telling them i have depression
I couldn't have said it better myself man I literally going through it right now
Yeah I have noticed some definite changes in my mind since my early teenage years when my depression was still new to me. I used to write poems and short stories creatively, but now I just can't -- I've tried, but I can't maintain the focus. I used to be able to dream about the future and what I want to do, but now all my dreams are nightmares caused by own anxiety. And my work performance and relationships with others (friendships because I can't find anything more) is/are awful because I can't concentrate on what's happening now. My mind is just stuck in a fog, like you said. It's so defeating.
Feel the same way OP
Same looool at least i make baby steps and im aware of this situation, which is good but at the same time kills me
I feel this. like it’s not that I’m not thinking I’m thinking about different things
Exactly the same situation with me.
Feeling similar. How do we go about fixing this is what I’m wondering?
There was a Ted talk to the key to a long life and it was long Stanford experiment I think. And it's conclusion was that meaningful relationships was the best sign for a long life. Basically everyone in this sub is fucked
Yup my brain is slow and i cant grasp nor retain information. On top of that, im extremely inarticulate, i cant talk coherently, i stutter and im v forgetful (my brain is rlly slow af); and i cant even form full sentences. Hell, nothing makes sense to me anymore, i can literally read anything online or a passage in any book, and id never grasp it whatsoever- how can you form an opinion on something or come up with insights if you cant even comprehend the material to begin with- even basic knowledge im lacking.  Whats even more embarassing is my inability to graso humor/jokes these days b/c my mind is sooo slow and just hurts
No... not the meds. Used to be the case at one point.  (3 years back) but nah.. its not the meds. And well thats the side effect of depression; being numb and apathetic... but it also drastically impacted my cognitive abilities. Im not kidding, i really have become dumb.
heating coil + backpaper ..sad memories ;/
ive taken it upon myself to make active lifestyle changes; fixing my sleep schedule; following a proper diet plan and working out on a regular basis (these things i do not usually do. instead, i just rot in my room), and i try to read as much as possible and just make myself busy. i see it more as an experiment to validate my prediction. also, i spend way less time on social media, i dont like the toxicity
Same, I feel like i stutter more than I used to, and like I've become less articulate too. I think I have ADD on top of it too...I can't focus or read long articles like I used to...I can't remember the last time i read an entire book. Like my brain just turned to mush...

I think the cruelest thing about depression is that it cripples the only defense humans really have which is their brain. I want to be like Viktor Frankl and think about everything so objectively that nothing hurts anymore. But my brain is compromised and I cannot defend myself. It sucks lol.  Sometimes I have a moment of rest and clarity where I can study my depression and the patterns I see. And I can formulate some sort of treatment/break the pattern based on my observations. But man, you really can’t do much with depression that goes in deep.   I feel like everything and my perception of everything is fucked up. I feel like everything is ruined and I have no doubt society plays a larger role in my situation than just my brain. Depression isn’t just a personal problem/brain illness, there’s larger systemic issues in our society which people aren’t addressing that contribute to people’s sufferings/depression developments. Anyways I just wanted to say that because when I first realized that I got so angry I couldn’t feel sad anymore- hopefully it does the same for you.    Do you guys have any good song reccs during coping time? I like listening to The Smiths, dandelion hands, girl in red, Bedroom, Teen Suicide, Wallows, Current Joys, Amine, and stuff. They’re mostly like indie peeps so hopefully  you’re into that I or you can give some recs . Sad music makes sad people feel better :)

While 2017 is the last year I can look back on and truly say was "decent" for me, I feel like I didn't appreciate every year before 2020 enough while it lasted even if some shitty things still happened. Last year was awful (both for obvious reasons regarding things that affected the entire world/the US, where I live and for personal reasons) and so far this year has still been just as bad as last year, if not more so. My mental health is getting worse, I'm getting stressed and angry more often and I have lost my motivation. I really want to do better, but I can't focus or push myself at all. At the same time, I always just have that voice in the back of my head telling me I don't deserve to be alive. One minute I'm telling myself that nothing matters so there's no reason to do anything, and the next, I'm chewing myself out for being lazy and worthless. I feel a sense of guilt each time I let another day pass by, since time is going by so fast that I feel like every day I've lived is a day wasted. I'd say I don't know what to do, but I know I could probably try to get help and I just don't because I get the sense that I'm faking all my "problems" and that other people have things so much worse than I do. I deal with the same things every day and can't find a way out. I've been getting headaches every day, I have no appetite for anything other than coffee and I have absolutely no energy or will to do anything but stay in my bed and live the exact same miserable day as I have for months. It's a miracle I'm even able to force myself out of bed anymore. I can't even imagine myself being able to succeed in life, so I won't even try to. Fuck it. I don't care.

My friend died from NeTs syndrome, I wanted to go to the funeral but my parents got covid and I didn’t know if I had covid or not so stayed home.

I felt vulnerable yesterday commiting that im selfish cold person who never appreciated someone's attempts of loving me unconditionally. Although im the kindest person you would ever meet but i would say he is much kinder.  This is not the first time i feel vulnerable commiting my guilt but its much harder because he means a lot to me, i didnt do him anything wrong but made him feel like im an agnel who keeps on loving him whilst im just tired of love as much as he is.   I feel awful not because what i did is a major unforgivable thing  But knowing that i caused him lots pf problems because of my angelic look.  How can i feel better? My back hurts now and i didnt answer a message, all my friends are worried but i couldnt answer,im ashamed.   Im fighting the suicidal thoughts cause im not this kind of people but i feel like i dont deserve living.

Hi friends. Looking for some relationship advice. My partner has been depressed for a long time and we recently moved in together. I don't think I realized how bad it was for him, and now I find myself taking on the role of a caretaker more than a partner. I want to be supportive and we regularly talk about his feelings. But I find that he usually doesn't care for his basic needs without help from me, and that's really difficult. It's hard to connect with him in an emotionally intimate way. He often seems distant, like he's hardly here. I'm questioning what role I play in our relationship. I can't be responsible for his basic needs like showering and exercise. But if I don't step in, those needs won't be met. I really want to stay together, I just don't know what to do. I feel that my emotional needs are also going unmet. Any advice? Thank you.
It is always hard to be in a relationship like that but it's really great you are there for him and are trying. I think even when he doesn't express it a lot (just guessing by my own experience) he is very appreciative of you and everything you do for him. I get the feeling that your emotional needs aren't being met and that's not an easy thing to live with. What I can maybe advise you is to openly talk to hin about it. Don't expect too much to change but often times its good to just get it off your chest and maybe it will envoke small changes. Also if he's not already seeing one, encourage him to get a therapist. Sometimes it can just take a bit of the stress of you. Being in the emotional support role in a relationship can be really taxing and will add up to more and more unhappiness because it can feel so unrewarding seeing your SO fall back into the same patterns as soon as you are not there for him.  Hope that helped a bit and I wish you both the best. You seem like a really good person. Don't lose yourself in all of this if it get's too much.
Thank you for the kind words. I appreciate the advice.

Discarded, or just ignored?  Can anyone remember the last time someone called you just because to see how you were doing? Or the last time someone actually made you feel like you mattered? Or what it feels like to belong somewhere? I can’t remember what any of things feel like.
Yeah. I am sure that you know many people who are feeling the same way. Do call and check on them. Some people who I know have made this a regular thing- even daily, if they live alone.
Can I ask how old you are ?

Hello all,  I'm an immigrant to the US based in the SF Bay Area, CA. I came to my home country last month for a vacation. It had been 2 years since I saw my parents and I guess I've been bottling up a lot of emotional baggage cause depression hit me like a tsunami as soon as I got home.  Just for some background I've not been doing well financially. I was laid off due to the pandemic, a month after I started my first full-time job. As an immigrant I needed a job to stay in the country and I managed to claw my position back by working at minimum wage.  Coming back to the depression, I've never felt this way before. I've got crippling anxiety, and a desire to sleep because I don't want to be awake. I've cried uncontrollably to my mom atleast twice a week since I got home. I used to feel broken inside but now I'm also scared of how my declining mental health will impact me.  I've got an offer a for a new job that's paying well in a small city but I'm not excited about it at all. I'm way over qualified for the post and the nature of work (administrative/clerical) will not satisfy me at all. I feel like joining it would derail my career. Maybe the depression is taking over my thought process. Idk.  I'm still in my home country and I don't know if I'm ready to fly back to the US and be alone again. My parents are super concerned about my wellbeing.   I'd appreciate any suggestions that would help shape my perspective and get me back up on my feet.
The little things, work on those and focus on today not next year or last year. Take it slow and chase purpose not happiness.
I can totally relate to you as far as needing a secure job to maintain your immigration status as I was also in the same boat.   Around the time when the pandemic first hit the US last year, my employer started taking advantage of my whole situation with immigration by piling a shitload of work on me. I tried really hard to bite the bullet and put up with it however it was taking a toll on my mental health, plus the pandemic didn't do me any favors either. I even brought this issue up with them it fell on deaf ears.  After about 6 months, I ended up resigning for the sake of my own health and returned to my home country simply because no employer would ever sponsor a foreign worker during these crazy times. I have been hit really hard by depression ever since because I have assimilated really well with US culture after spending a decade of studying and working there, and now I am living in a country where I barely have any ties in.  I guess the best thing both of us can do is to accept whatever job that is available to us at the moment, and try to ride it out until the world returns to some semblance of normalcy. Spare some time everyday for activities/hobbies that you truly enjoy to take matters off your mind. Also, looking at your situation, you still managed to find employment in the US to secure your status so hold on tight to that in the meantime. With vaccines starting to roll out, hopefully it won't take long before everything returns to normal. Best of luck!
**did getting officer post in the job will make you feel good? If is it, then start preparing for that instead of settling with clerical post (if possible then don't leave your current job, prepare for that, while being in a job). Or you're more depressed about being alone and far away from parents, working in different country? If this is the case, I just suggest you to make friends and try to spend with them. If possible, find a girl, so that you can get into a relationship. This will really help you in the loneliness**

No one will think badly of you for working.
Thanks for sharing your story. I hope you can settle happily in your home country very soon. I'm starting the new role next month and I plan to take it easy, one day at a time.

I’m just sitting here at my little brother’s basketball game panicking over the thought of dying. Can any talk to me or help?
Yeah, I know this feeling - just not quite in the same way.  It tends to hit me at night.  I wish I could offer you advice, but rather than that, I'll tell you that you definitely are not alone feeling this way.  All love
It's okay. Focus on something else, like your breathing. Breathe in 7 seconds, hold 7 seconds and breathe out 7 seconds. If you keep doing this it neutralizes your thoughts.
It’s going to happen to everyone.  Try to think about living.
Same to you. I really appreciate it
Thank you, I’ll do my best. Is there another subreddit for this kind of panic?
I think the anxiety subreddit would be a good place

I feel alone so im reaching out pls be kind  Im 26F . My birthday was yesterday so i feel like that triggered another episode. Jk its been the same epi for weeks. So I had bad depression and anxiety the last 7 years but since aug 2019 to this day it is absolutely consuming. Crying for days like i just watched you murder my pet but nothing actually happened to me. Anxiety attacks where i panic and cant breath. Everything is going to shit as i get deeper into depression and this unknown area of myself. Nothings actually wrong but why do i hate everything and nothings fun anymore. My boyfriend wont leave me but he cant deal w my saddness either making me feel guilty for not knowing why its happening...  sometimes my crying and saddness literally makes me wish i didnt exist, why? Whats wrong in my brain. So many opinions on depression to “ its your own mental state, its hormones, its genetics, its lack of purpose “ ....... Im not religious (sorry not sorry) but what can i do? Doctors have tried me with counselling and anti depressants before but right now im only doing acupuncture once a month for other reasons outside of mental health and counselling again ... why cant i just feel myself beyond the saddness or even get a 50/50 break instead of all day everyday. With covid, and moving i have no friends or anything except on the phone so thats not helping me, and now im this deep i feel no one can see my real self to even want to be my friend.. i feel sad w this. I feel guilty i cant snap my fingers to be fine or fake it to pretend.... Whats your stories, how am i similar to you? What helps you and why? Pls share
Hey, first of all I'm sorry to hear you feel depressed... It really sucks :( I would suggest two things... Find yourself some hobbies you genuinely enjoy and find yourself something that makes you feel like you have a purpose. When you feel especially low, I find that music helps me quite a bit. If your boyfriend isn't making you feel good, it's perhaps time for either a long, serious talk with him or to consider breaking up. I would consider talking first if you haven't already, you may be able to sort things out. I'm here to talk more if you need to :) Take care
Thank you thats really awesome xx i love classic rock i play it alot, we did have a talk! Its not that he doesnt want to be with me its that my saddness is over-bearing so its hard to remember real me is in there trying to come out. Time will tell w that one , i just want to feel better for myself :)
Yes, that's the real goal. You really need to learn self love. And I know that's a really difficult task. Start by reminding yourself everyday of at least one thing you love about yourself and write it down. Every day. And learn to appreciate the little things about yourself. Then, on days you feel especially low, look back at the things you wrote down to remind yourself of your amazing qualities. Because I know you have them, and so does everyone else around you. It's a small start, but it will help pave the path to feeling better about yourself :)
My counsellor suggested this but i have yet to force to try. My next happy day ill write it all down and save it. Its hard to not let the low days take over because im having alot of them now
Good place to start. I know how that feels... Do you have any coping mechanisms currently?
Nothing thats working. Lol sometimes i listen to music, go walking, color, watch a mindless tv series, read. But nothing that sparks joy its just a mask if that makes any sense
That makes perfect sense, I feel totally the same. Perhaps try something completely new? Maybe dedicating your mind to something new might help?
I really want to try crocheting and make earrings and things but something is holding me back ( me )
Why are you holding yourself back?
Im not sure i feel mental blocks alot with battling the depression. Im sure if i bought all the things and got a video i could try and learn properly but i think the not knowing if ill succeed is my stopper but thats what new things are
But it doesn't matter if you succeed or not. And if you don't succeed, that's gives you a chance to try again. Or of you do succeed, you can make more. And then, you have something to take your mind off the depressive thoughts
Your right i need to push past that thought. It comes up alot
Failure isn't anything it be ashamed of. Everyone fails at stuff everyday. But if you keep trying, you will become better. And you spend more time focusing your thoughts on something else
This is true - I really need to get more going, i feel i want to do all these new things then talk myself out of it
Best thing to do is buy the stuff and get started before you talk yourself out of it
Haha you bet! Thank you i found this helpful honestly lol i think i spend so much time alone and i moved countries so im in a 8 hr time change from my home that any chat other then myself is beneficial.. outside options always get me shifting my thoughts!
I'm glad I could help even just a little bit. I'm here if you need to talk again :)

Hey mate.  I don’t feel comfortable talking in person about this so I thought I’d text it. I’m dealing with some mental health issues at the moment.  I have spoken to my doctor and we are meeting again this Friday. As of right now I’m just not in the right mindset to return to work this week. I will speak with my doctor this Friday to discuss myself going further. As of right now you are the only person I’ve discussed this with. So your discretion would be appreciated. I understand this would be classified under sick leave without pay. Thanks mate.
Sounds good, other than maybe the ending. It depends on what terms you are on with your boss, but unless you are on casual and friendly terms I would just stick with a "Thank you" I hope you can recover from your depression soon :)
It sounds good. Best wishes for you!

I just want a break and I know it’s all I need. I want to go in a hotel in the middle of nowhere surrounded by nature and forest. I don’t want to have to worry about school, parents, grades, future, relationships and news. I want to be by myself, no technology, and no one but me. I want to be able to finally get a good night sleep and be able to enjoy life and not having school steal everything away from me. I want to go away and be forgotten. Go shopping in a small grocery store with no one inside and be able to dress like I want. Be able to sing my heart out and draw everything that’s on my mind without feeling scared to be judge. I want to forget everything and start over again.   I just wanna escape reality and find peace   sorry if this is cryptic but I just felt like writing it somewhere
You know what I'm going to do that hope you can do it to. Thank you for the idea
Save up money and work towards your goal. You can already start looking for places.
I don’t know what country you’re from, but there probably are a few initiatives where you can get away from the slurs of the daily life. Try talking to a professional about this and talk about the possibilities.
no problem! hopefully it helps you <3
thank you so much for the encouragement <3
yes, im gonna try :) thanks for reaching out

I have everything I need so far to work on my projects. I did all the research to know how to make it all work. But I'm so exhausted. I dont have the energy to take the step. I'm not in the environment I want to be in and it drained me. Everytime I get the drive to do something, something else gets in the way and kills my mood. The anxiety of being in my own world only to get pulled away to reality terrifies me. I know I still got a long way to go to get out of here, but I dont know how long I can manage this. All I can do is trick myself into moving forward so if I can just accomplish things little at a time for now.

-sorry for the big chunk of text-  Im currently a 21 year old with depression and adhd and Im so lost in my life. I feel stuck in an endless cycle and no matter what I try to do it never seems to workout for me. I was an average student and graduated highschool but after that is when everything started to fall apart. I had no idea what I wanted to do so I studied business administration did that for a semester felt bleh so I took some time away from school and then went back for IT again felt bleh and then went into nursing and I it wasn’t terrible but then the COVID happened and my classes went online I finished my semester and realized that it isnt what I wanted. Im current not enrolled as of winter 2021. I have no idea what I want to do with with my life and Im 30K in debt already. Im so stressed because I feel like I cant handle school right now but Im scared if i stop now I wont go back later. I want to get an education and a career and my parents want me to get an education and they dont know that i switched this many times and that I am currently not in school. I am just working part time 15-20 hours in my part time job as a supervisor making ok money. I know I wouldn’t mind being in this job for now or even a few more years if i worked more hours (which i can depending on how busy it is) but the most I can get is 35 which isn’t exactly full time. I just am scared that I might get stuck in this job and I dont know where to move from here. I did apply for some other full time jobs but its hard to find work right now because it’s January and COVID. I want to have a career but dont know how to go about finding one I would like and how I would get there. Im also debating what to do for school if i even go or i should just work. I feel like Im behind all my peers my age and I don’t know what to do. Im also stressed because I dont know what to tell my parents because they aren’t exactly understanding and don’t believe in adhd and depression etc. Im also scared they might kick me out for not going to college anymore. Im so stressed! I just wanna live in the mountains herding sheep 😭

My stomach feels like static. Nothing. Void. It hurts but it’s nothing at the same time. Nothing has upset me. Playing video games, on my phone. Any help? Any advice?
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l084l7/im_done/
I don't want stupid advice, I don't want to go on. I'm staying up everyday till 3/4 am and wake up at 2 pm. My body is heavy. I don't want to see anybody anymore. I'm in bed all day. I don't want to die, I don't want to live. The only thing I can do is jerk off, listen to music and play videogames. People hate me, because I'm a moron. The future is filled with despair. I'm stuck in my own prison.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzfjno/i_almost_did_it/
I was in the bathroom. Everything was ready. I left a hateful suicide note and grabbed the bag I was going to suffocate myself with. Everything was fine until I faced my reflection in the mirror. For the first time in forever, my hair looked beautiful. I stared into the mirror for a few seconds before I dropped the bag. I couldn't get myself to pick it up, and a tear rolled down my cheek. Soon enough, I wasn't able to see the mirror. I started to wonder if I really wanted to die, if I really was ready to end it all. I could hear my family talking, but had no idea what they were talking about. I started ugly crying as silently as I could, and fell onto my knees. I don't want to die. I don't want to live. I don't want to run away. I don't know what to do. There is no way out. Deep down, I still have hope that things'll get better. Hope is the most cruel feeling of them all.
Thank god for that look in the mirror.  There is hope.  Don’t kill yourself, don’t. There’s hope and there will be happiness one day too. Be patient, take care of yourself. You are, like any other person in the world, worth your life. The struggling, it’s hard, but believe me, if you try a bit, you will find out, it doesn’t last forever. And your mind and your heart say the same as you wrote it. Deep down, you have hope. Take that hope and don’t lose it. Make it grow. 💕
Hope may be cruel but it is also crucial. We need hope to keep going even if it was a small sliver of hope it still saved u. You need to believe can be saved and that u can be happy.
I think I discuss suicide because it’s a way for me to feel in control. When really we have no control of when we die. That’s Actually scarier than suicide. Thank you for posting this. You matter. stay here.
Attack on titan is getting better and better!!!! That’s something to enjoy!
The feeling of not wanting to live but not wanting to die, i  know exactly how that feels, you are not alone.
Because you are beautiful and you do deserve a beautiful life. Keep winning these battles, it will give you strength. Rooting for you 🙏🏻
You are meant to be here! The people in your life are so lucky to have you. Please don’t give up and know that things WILL get better. Sometimes it just takes some time. The hard times that you are going through are going to shape you into a strong person. Not giving up is a huge step forward. I’m so glad that you’re still here with us! :)
It is so much more help with  family nearby  maybe even voices of friends as you consider this final act. When I hear my friends on the internet, I think the endorphins flow. One day they will probably leave. Lacking any improvement with medication, I will head out where its really quiet and decide. But first I am going to get a dog or cat.
I know how you feel. Everything feels like a trap. Life sets up situations for you to either fail or succeed at constantly; every failure feels like that’s the end, there’s nothing more to do. Trust me, I’ve looked in the mirror several times & felt as if there was nothing else I could do, I felt as if I failed at everything and failed everyone. I still fell that way 24-6. I have that 1 day that I feel powerful & successful almost like I have it all, then something happens it all goes down the toilet. The only thing you can do is hold on to that thought of the single hope you have; that’s what I do everyday. Some days it’s not enough, but you have to make it enough in order to live & keep fighting for tout life.  People don’t see it & they don’t understand when you explain it. The end looks like bliss, as if everything will be fixed & cured, but in reality you have to remember your pain doesn’t go away, it only gets passed on to the people you care about. I stay alive for the future, for the thought of being able to create the future I want to live in. Hold on to that every-time you feel like giving up. It never gets better, but you get stronger & filled with more love each time. Stay hopeful & full of love. I understand my love.
I can relate to this. Please stay.
buddy trust me , one day in the future you will think about the one thing that's making you wanna kill yourself rn , and you will smile cause you made it through. everything gets better with time. I've been in your shoes just 2years ago and i was 16 and lucky for me the OD didn't kill me cause 2years later I'm living a really good life. and the tough times i went through were the biggest lessons of my life cause now nothing can put me down. i understand it's hard  rn but everything gets better with time trust me ♡

I have so many issues for no reason and this is the best way i can express my feelings. Which is by writing. I just want to know what is that's wrong with me. When everything feels so right. I feel like I'm in this weird euphoric state nearly everyday. That i can't really understand. And this is when I'm sober. I just smoke weed nothing else. I try my best to be happy and find something in my life if purpose. But i can't feel anything. Yet i feel so much. Can someone please explain what's happening to me.   I just wanna let go of everything. And be free. But there's nothing holding me back. Yet i feel so held back. I have everything i could ask for. Yet why do i feel so empty. Why does every good thing stay for such a short time in my life and mind. Why is it that the bad things are the only things that stay. People say you have a choice of what to think about, yet my does it feel like i dont. Why is the only thing that stays is the bad thing? How hard is it to be happy, when there's nothing there to make you sad in the first place? How is that possible?  How is it possible to suffer from nothing visible? What do i long for? Is it happiness? Is it love? Is it to be accepted? Do i deserve any of this? Why is my mind a complicated mess when everything seems so simple? Why do i despise myself when there's no such reason to do so? How do i fill this void in me? This emptiness darker then the shade of black, is it something I've done to my self or is it an accumulation of everything that's happened so far? The scars of cowardness are visible through everything. Yet I try to hide it through optimisticy. Just sitting and hoping one day my optimisticy becomes something true.

I ( M 14  ), have been depressed and anxious for the past 7-8 months now. My friends know i'm not really feeling good, but they don't usually take it too seriously. Suicidal thoughts have been coming these past weeks and I just don't know how to really tell people what's going on inside my mind right now and I don't know how to tell them the pain that's running through me right now ( mental pain).

I'm a uni student (UK) and have been at my uni accomodation for lockdowns 2  and 3. Before the pandemic began I'd already been suffering with depression for years, but the past year has really taken its toll on me. My depression has not only got worse but I've also developed an eating disorder and despite trying to ask for help my uni has done nothing for me. I don't have anyone to turn to, and with no certain end in sight any time soon I keep finding myself thinking 'What's the point?'. I've been trying to keep busy and I do at least 20 minutes of exercise most days if I can but nothing seems to be helping and I'm so unsure of where to turn. I'm ashamed to admit to anyone that I've started smoking too and putting on the weight from binge eating is only making me feel worse.  Does anyone else who's been going through something similar have any healthy coping mechanisms they could recommend?
Well... there is always fitness products that Can make you “fake” happy... well Can work sometimes... but not an advice
Healthy? No but it’s doing wonders for my agoraphobia 👀

I’ve had anxiety ever since I can remember and recently I’ve been feeling very depressed mostly because of my family. I’ve considered killing myself but just don’t have the guts to do it. I overhear them saying that they should ignore me because I’m putting on an act for attention.  I feel so hopeless, I’m completely isolated and the people who are supposed to be my support system take mental health as a joke.
I’ve found denial is the reason people respond that way more so than malice. Either way it’s terrible that your support system isn’t up to par. However, you could try to make an appointment with a therapist.
[deleted]
"They're just doing it for the attention" doesn't even make sense, honestly. So what if you *do* want attention? Someone to love you, someone who gives a shit if you're happy or unhappy? It's not a crime to want attention.
If you have nothing better to say, consider not saying anything at all.  Your "advice" is bullshit.

hi, i wanted to share my own experience with depression and mental health after spending countless hours reading other people's posts. you are not alone, and so many other people go through it too. if you are reading this, you are special and one of a kind. please acknowledge mental health, and spread love to others, the world, and yourself.   i am diagnosed with depression at 15, but after talking it through with my physiatrists we figured out i developed chronic depression, starting at the age of nine. i was very suicidal and depressed growing up and i was deeply afraid to talk to my family about it because of the idea that they would shame me and say " you're a teenage who just wants attention ", so i kept my mouth shut. my intention was to never gain attention and pity, but instead to get help. it came to a point where last october i stopped going to school, i cried everyday and started cutting for the first time. i had never felt so alone and isolated in my life. covid doesn't help the fact that i can't go out. i barely talk to anyone, and i stay in my room all day so i didn't talk to my family as much.   &#x200B;  my friends have always been there for me. they may be 15, but they emotionally carried me. they're sisters to me. if it wasn't them calling me, texting me, checking up on me, i seriously don't know where I'd be. i originally thought sharing my secret about depression would only cause them to hate me. i didn't want to bring my burdens onto someone else, especially the only real friends I ever made. turns out, my friends shared my stress and the load felt less heavy. every single one of my friends sat with me and spoke to me whenever i needed someone to talk to. i could lean on their shoulder whenever i felt emotionally vulnerable or unstable.   &#x200B;  i cried when i finally told my mom i was depressed. she was shocked because i kept it a secret for so long. then she cried, hugged me, and told me that she loved me. that hug was everything i've been wanting my entire life; an older figure that i could rely on when things felt so impossible and out of place. the following week she took me to the doctors, and i was diagnosed with depression. now i'm taking therapy and we're looking at the idea of meds.   &#x200B;  the people in my life showed nothing but support.   &#x200B;  i wrote this post because i was lacking the will to live today. what are you living for? what is the purpose of your life? who are you living for?   &#x200B;  i'm so grateful and appreciative everyone reacted with open arms and love. nobody rejected me, so instead, they guided me through it. that is the right response to give. right now the entire world is going through a pandemic, and things are already tough as it is. it requires nothing to love and to be kind. if everyone had a little more support, the world would be a little less hurtful.   &#x200B;  it feels like my life is over at fifteen.i haven't even gotten to live long enough to get a career, meet new people, travel, accomplish a meaning with my life. how can it feel over when it hasn't even started?
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l07j53/i_think_i_have_a_huge_lack_of_attention/
I (16M) think I have lack of attention. At first I’d like you not to blame it on my age and better give me an advice   I’m really trying to impress people somehow.  I post me playing crazy guitar solos that I don’t really like in my ig stories , I post some skate tricks. And all I think about is not how “good I am “ , “good job mate” , I’m thinking about how people will see it and think about me. Repost it or whatever. I feel like I’m trying to impress everyone. Show people that I’m “worthy” ?   I don’t know, maybe I should visit a psychologist? I can’t focus on important things ,like studying for example. I’ll I’m thinking about is actually doing all these things to impress people.   I can’t stay concentrated in public. Or when working.  I feel clumsy and abstracted.   Understanding my actions , or let’s say my vision of them makes me feel miserable.    I just feel left behind somehow.
I’m 21 and I’ve loved most of my life for other people. It isn’t worth it- make your own way in life.  Do what you love for you! Get your thrill and kick out of doing things for yourself and no one else. Learn to appreciate and love yourself.   The reality is, no matter how much other people love you or how much attention you get, it will never be enough. You will always feel empty until you learn to love yourself.   You are already enough mate.   You won’t feel left behind if you make yourself a priority

Lately I've been feeling so off. I don't know if something is actually wrong or if it's just my anxiety. I haven't felt like myself. The world has kind of felt like a dream and I've been questioning EVERYTHING. "Is this real?" or "Am I dreaming?" and to think that way is such a sick feeling. I get myself so worked up that I begin to get so lightheaded and almost feel like I'm about to faint. I've been so tired lately I literally feel like I could close my eyes and sleep anywhere at any time. I'm so fatigued and exhausted. I keep telling myself that I'm about to drop dead or have a heart attack or stroke and then I scare myself and again get so lightheaded that I am almost in tears. I just want it to stop. I want to feel normal again. At one point I got so worked up that I ended up throwing up a few times. I got a COVID test just to be safe and it was negative. I'm going to my doctor asap for a physical and blood test. I just keep telling myself that something is wrong and that I'm about to die and it spikes my anxiety and gets me so worked up. I'm a M, 22 by the way. I take Prozac (40mg) and Wellbutrin (450mg) because I have diagnosed anxiety and depression. I've been really bad about taking my wellbutrin lately and honestly I go days without taking it. I think I may be feeling this way from withdrawling from it? I don't know. I'm so lost and so sad. I just want to feel normal again and I want to live my life without questioning anything. If you've got any advice or have experienced this yourself please let me know.. I feel crazy. 😔
Not that long ago I felt that everything wasn't real with my psychosis but that might be a different thing. Before my psychosis I had felt that sleepiness. Idk what to suggest. It just takes time and work. I wonder what is behind all this in your unconscious? Also, focusing on finding your hidden creative energies and thoughts helps find a sense of purpose and motivation.
This could definitely just be withdrawals! A few months ago I switched antidepressants (venlafaxine to welbutrin) and I was feeling exactly as you described, so awful and disconnected from reality. Take your welbutrin, it has definitely helped me! Or talk to your psych about switching meds if you aren't feeling good on them, but withdrawals are truly terrible. I hope you feel better soon!
I've never experienced psychosis. I just have anxiety and depression. I think that I just get these thoughts in my head and they make no sense so I have to do something to validate the feeling. I just miss when I was living day by day and this wasn't an issue. It's driving me crazy. I will literally be like "you're short of breath" and then my heart will start to race and then I'm like "you're having a heart attack" and it just escalates. I'm always so tired too. I'm never happy or comfortable unless I'm laying down. But even everytime Im about to sleep, I question if I will wake up. It haunts me and scares me and makes me feel so so so horrible.
I hope this is the issue. I'm trying to be stricter with it now. But I don't know how long it will take for me to feel back to normal again. :( By far this is the worst/most annoying feeling ever because it makes daily functioning so hard. Thank you for the support!
I know what it's like to be scared by irrational thoughts. I hope you feel better soon. Are you getting CBT or anything?
Thank you. I do have a therapist and psychologist. I'm going to my healthcare physician asap to get a physical and blood test. I just want to be medically reassured that I'm okay. Who knows, maybe I'm always tired because something is too low or too high? I don't know! But thank you for the input.

I’m going to try to keep this as concise and clear as possible but the brain fog makes it hard.   TL;DR I’m almost 39 and have been depressed my entire life. I’ve been diagnosed with major depression, anxiety (GAD and social), and CPTSD. I’ve done so much work on myself and years and years of therapy, including EMDR, so now feel hopeless and like nothing will convince me that I’m not a horrible human being. I’m open to advice but please read the entire post. Otherwise, comments ok.   I’m the youngest of my siblings. Also first generation, parents grew up in Mexico, had a middle school education. So grew up really poor and dealt with what I now recognize as traumatic events growing up.   Shit that happened before I was 10  * Alcoholic dad.  * Abandoned by dad.  * Had to call the cops on my dad when he got too drunk and angry.  * Poverty (the kind where I remember one can of food before food stamps came) * Had to take cold showers or deal with utilities being cut off.  * Dad was in a major accident, mom had to go back to work.  * Dad became primary caregiver suddenly.  * Got fat  * Disciplined by my mom with the belt or fly swatter, whatever was within reach.  School was tough, not popular, and lived in the shadow of my super popular , skinny sister.   When my dad left again when I was 15, I tried to kill myself and had my stomach pumped. It sucked but it’s how I finally got therapy, mandated by the hospital. My family is from Mexico and didn’t really believe in any of that. My mom had taken me to all these faith healers before.   I got assigned a counselor and he changed my life. I got the help I needed. Things haven’t always been easy, I’ve had a couple  major depression relapses since then. I’ve also had some other tough shit happen but always managed my way out of the depression hole with meds and therapy.   I’ve got a super successful 6 figure career now, my own home, a beautiful son, loving boyfriend, but I’ve relapsed into despair again.   It’s harder to tell the voice that tells me I’m a huge piece of shit that it’s wrong. I also stopped my regular therapy during the pandemic , I don’t know why really. I’m still kicking ass at work, getting shit done, and most people would be shocked to know how I feel.   That I hate myself, I’m a horrible person, even worse mother, and don’t deserve anyone’s love. I’m just this selfish, stupid, fat, bitch.   I’m just going through the motions, like a robot.  Sometimes I feel like I’m just watching myself go through the motions because I have to.   I feel like I’ve got no fucking reason to be depressed, logically I know depression doesn’t work that way, but I’m tired of fighting it.   I don’t enjoy anything anymore, I’m sure my friends are tired of me never wanting to do anything.   I did make some steps to get help and I guess that’s all I can do. Told my psychiatrist I wasn’t doing talk therapy and to hold me accountable. Now just need to follow up and call the therapist back to make an appointment. Fucking hold on and make one step towards help.   I’ve also went on an audible self help shopping binge , even paid $750 for fucking MadeFor and did it for one month.   But here’s the thing, I’m terrified it won’t help. I know all about self care, I know all the things that I’ve learned with therapy, done EMDR,  and there’s not anything I feel will help me with not despising myself.   Every other time I’ve felt like this there were some external factors like shitty home situation or addict ex husband. I’m just disgusted with myself. I wish I could care for myself like I do others.   I know how to put my oxygen mask on, but I don’t see the point anymore. I’ve done so much work to get help for depression MY ENTIRE LIFE , so wtf can they do now?   They’re going to suggest new meds for the fucking 20th time in my life, therapy 1-3 times a week, but just have a BTDT feeling. I’m exhausted of that cycle.   I’m not suicidal, but I also can’t say I would be upset if I died.   I’ve got some hippy dippy friends who would probably say I’m being awakened or there’s some shift everyone is going through. I wish it was that , but I know it’s depression.   If anyone else has ever been in a similar place I’d be interested in hearing about it and how you worked your way out.   Thanks for reading this.
I'm sorry you went through that as a child. Ive been through similar experiences & I'm impressed with how well you seem to have coped. I also feel you on feeling alone, even though I'm surrounded by people. I sometimes do but then there are so many moments where I also feel so connected, if that makes sense? It doesn't really to me so how could it lol.. Do you think your early negative experienced caused these feelings or is it something deeper?  I feel like the world is so divided and sadly full of hate & negativity. Necessary, perhaps but certainly not to the extent its at. I don't wanna ramble here so I'll just say know you're not alone & wish you all the best
While I haven’t been in your exact position, I’ve certainly been at the “no one would ever know how much I hate myself and want to die “ point, various times in my life. I just soldiered on. Made appointments, tried new drugs, had bad side effects, stayed on drugs for 6 months, and started again. Over and over and over. It’s hard, but you have to keep doing it. And we both know you can and will keep doing it. Things will get a little better, and maybe they’ll get a lot better. This life isn’t easy at all, but you know you need to stay.   Sorry things are hard right now. I wish I could take some of your burden from you. Remember, we’re in the middle of a worldwide pandemic, so even if things are relatively ok for you, the giant changes in our lives have affected all of us.

Thank you. I think I understand what you mean about feeling so connected. I have those, too sometimes. Sometimes those are the moments I feel the most depressed, if that makes sense.   I do think my early negative experiences contribute if not are the root of those feelings. My mom externalizes her anxiety, so things always felt like my fault growing up. For example, things could never be an accident. It was because I wasn’t paying attention or because I didn’t do some other thing to prevent the accident.   She maybe was afraid I’d get sick without socks so how did she make me wear socks? Tell me if I didn’t wear socks to bed the devil would come pull me by my feet.  Or if I went too far away from her in a lake, la llorona would take me with her.   They just go super deep and I guess I thought I had processed and integrated those.   But I think they’re coming up again though because I am breaking that cycle. My son knows accidents happen and I have never laid a hand on him. But he’s 8 now and pushing boundaries and it does trigger me. He’ll say he hates me because I take his iPad and Xbox away and all I can think is, shit for one, we couldn’t even afford a Nintendo and I’d get slapped or hit instead of a time out or taking a fun toy away.    Thanks again for your thoughtful reply. I appreciate it.
Honestly, it feels good to know others have dealt with the “no one would ever know I hate myself and want to die”. I’ve told my therapists and Reddit basically.   And thank you for reminders that I need to hold onto whatever I can until something starts working as I start getting help.   A therapist once told me depression is like trying to climb a greased ladder and sometimes you’re going to slip. When that happens you just have to hold on until you’re strong enough to start climbing again.
Thank you. Depression isn’t always about struggles, the struggles just make it harder to deal with. There’s different kinds of depression and because you’re young and we’re living in a global pandemic, I hope yours is just situational.
Now is the time to pull the “when I was your age, we had a cup and a ball on a string, and we liked it. And if we didn’t, mom would beat us with it. “ It’s your god-given right as a parent.
Yeah makes sense to me.. I guess I feel like I'm not living up to my potential. Well I know I'm not so there's guilt there because I'm wasting time.  I think a lot of the time 'we' forget that everyone is an individual & has lived a whole life that ultimately we can only ever get a snippet of. A perspective clouded by our bias & lack of experience. That's the conclusion I come to when I look back at what I see now as my parents shortcomings. Ultimately though & most importantly I know they've always tried their best. & experience has shown me that trying your best doesn't always get the best results lol. Especially when you're going through shit at the time. & really when are we not going through shit, yano?   My parents told me that if I stepped on grids I'd be taken by ginny green teeth whoever tf that is xD I laugh now but I was terrified as a child! The fact that many of us tell (lie to!) our children that some strange old man they will never meet is watching their every move to decide what gifts to give them at the end of the year is pretty wild to me now that im older.. Kids have a very simple understanding of good & bad though. They don't take evil into account because their conscious or conscience isn't as aware. My nephews and nieces can be pretty brutal but also in moments the epitome of pure good. You have to experience negativity to really understand it I think but by doing so we can hopefully influence others so they don't go through the same troubles & feel how we felt. You want your son to only ever feel good & be happy I'm sure, just like I do my nieces n nephews (unless they're being little shits! the rage I feel when they're disrespectful is frightening LOL) but how do you find a balance? Do we lie to them & bribe them with gifts from Santa to try & make them be good or do we be real?  Empathy is so important!  The fact you're questioning these things tells me you're trying your best under your circumstances & that's all we can all really do. Our society isn't structured in a way that all can flourish. I'm not exactly wealthy either. Don't get me wrong I know money isn't everything (I think its irrelevant(or should be!)) but the stress of it all & personal experiences make it harder or honestly impossible for some people to adapt. Whether you're one of those people, like me, or raised by them it's a damn shame.
What’s funny is now that money isn’t an issue, there’s still the personal experiences, which I guess I adapted to in each stage of my life.   Perhaps I’m struggling to adapt to this new phase of life.   I know what you mean about forgetting everyone has a story. I understand my parents shortcomings the more I learned about their experiences. But what therapists have told me is something about my adult thinking keeps me from fully integrating my experiences because I’m not allowing my inner child or that little girl who is still hurt, scared, and upset to heal. Something like that.   If you’re feeling you’re not living up to your potential I’m sure you are doing way more than you think you are.

Has anyone else noticed a lack of true depression representation on television and media? Aisde from this reddit forum, it's hard to see a depressed person in media.  Because I suffer from really bad anhedonia (can't feel anything/can't feel pleasure), I often gravitated towards watching Dexter and making that character my favorite. Not because I want to kill people lol, but because he was the only person I knew in media who just couldn't feel anything normally. Of course he couldn't feel anything because he was a psychopath, but it was a warm feeling to know that there was someone else who couldn't feel /had blunted emotions.  In the end, Dexter wasn't completely like me because he got pleasure from killing people. But I get pleasure from nothing.
Sopranos did a good job at showing depression.  Seen it?

cause i want to go to therapy cause there’s something wrong with me and it’s affection my life so drastically that idk if i’m gonna live for a long time and i really need help to stop this pain mentally and physically but i just don’t care about myself enough to do anything about it.. plus i can’t leave my home without a reason to. it feels like i have a physical illness but i don’t think i do, i’m so shit in hospital bills just for them to say there is nothing wrong with me. i can’t even sleep cause all i do is have nightmares every night. I don’t know what to do cause i don’t like speaking to people so i don’t know if a therapist would help much but i’m tired of living like this,,,,I had solace in smoking weed but now if i take one puff then my heart beats super fast and i feel uncomfortable and i don’t know why, it makes me hate life so much. i know it’s my fault but i’m in such a bad place in my life and i don’t know what to do  i feel no happiness in life at all, i’m financially stuck and i dislike myself so much that i don’t care to do anything about it so it’s like a cycle. Thing is i’m very self aware and it just makes me more depressed, i’d kill myself but i have younger siblings and i don’t want them to be upset also i’m afraid of death , i just feel so stuck
Just had my first session and it was amazing. I now have a huge list of new coping mechanisms and new  resources to investigate. I feel much more prepared for the next time I have an episode  . But of course therapy won't fix everyone.  Some people need medication. And some people need lifestyle changes.  Some need all 3
Idk its nice i guess? But I have a hard time talking about anything, I have a lot of shame and feel like I'm making stuff up? It's hard to explain. I've been going for 4 years but my life isn't going any better. I'm still stuck wasting my time like before. I feel better but not by much.
Therapy and medication never work.     Evidence: Personal experience.     You need someone to talk to.
The weed making your heart pound could be because its either a different strain, or that you're not eating enough or drinking enough water. Try maybe eating 3 decent sized meals and drinking lots of water for a day and then smoke weed that night. I had really bad heart racing anxiety attacks when smoking weed, but later found out it was low blood sugar from barely eating because I didn't feel like eating. Also therapy definitely helps, even if it doesn't fix you completely, it will certainly at least help
i’m glad for you. i’m afraid of medication cause i have horrible suicidal thoughts... i don’t know if that would be for me
i get what you mean , i do the same. yeah i just don’t feel like therapy is for everyone in my opinion... and i’m so messed up that i just don’t want to waste my time you know. thanks for commenting
Yeah i thought so. I don’t like talking to people though. I only have bad experiences and the things i think about are very shameful to me and i just don’t feel like sharing i feel like. no i KNOW people are gonna judge me an bully me like they always do . I’m so stuck
yeah that’s probably it. I get so upset that i won’t eat for days but i can still i don’t time to do drugs and drink , i really need to work on that haha . i’ve been thinking of going to therapy but i just work so much i have to get my ducks in a row first i guess, thanks for commenting
well a good therapist can help you decide. i'm also suicidal, and having a list of things to do when i get urges is already making me feel better. she wrote me a big 'action plan' based on our discussion and it's full of good coping mechanisms, and not so good ones, but at least i have things to do other than self harm when i have those urges now
I'm not going to judge you.
is it a local therapist or is it online? i have horrible communication skills and i’m scared to open up, more like is damn near impossible lol i’d rather lie to get out of conversation
even if you don’t, because of my experience with people who’ve said the same thing and my self isolation because of it i don’t even think i can’t talk to people normally about how i really feel anymore. Should i just rot and wait to die ?
it was a local therapist, but a telephone session due to covid. fortunately i'm Canadian and certain types of therapy are pretty cheap and accessible here, although there is a big wait list for the really cheap services.
What would that solve?
oh yeah i don’t even know if my insurance would cover  all of it , i don’t think it will though and i couldn’t afford it even if i wanted to haha i’ll look into it though if it’s an online one
i just don’t want to waste anyone’s time. i’m not one to open up . i feel very ashamed and not worthy of anyone’s attention
You're worthy of my attention and time.
Thanks , i’m very bad at conversation if it’s upfront but i’m down to listen to what you have to say
And I'm down to listening to what you have to share.

I’m currently a sophomore in college and have been struggling with anxiety and depression since my freshman year. I have always been a quiet kid who never said much but I always had friends growing up. I always knew that I would have to get out of my shell once it was time for college but when I actually got there the realization hit me hard. I made some friends but I started to get really depressed because of who I was. I wanted to be outgoing and fun but that’s just not who I was. That combined with school work and adjusting to being away from the comfort of home really made me quite depressed.   I started Wellbutrin and citalopram my second semester my freshman year and it really did help. I joined a fraternity and really started enjoying college. Then of course covid hit and sent us all home for the semester. I came back sophomore year feeling good and I decided to go off my medication. Fast forward to the start of my second semester (which starts tomorrow) and I’m starting to feel depressed and anxious again. I have been feeling kind lifeless the past month and now that’s turned to anxiety and depression. I’m nervous about how this semester and my future will go. I’ve decided to go back on my antidepressants so hopefully that will help. Does anyone else have any other advice or encouragement? Anything helps. I’m probably just overthinking everything but I’m worried I’ll fall back into a dark place.
I was severely depressed in College. It took me 5 years to graduate because I kept dropping classes. Please do whatever it takes to get through. Get assignment extensions, exercise, therapy, medication, confide in friends. It can get better when you're working a job in a desired field, and living with a few close friends, but you have to get through. You need the college degree as a safety net. I am still a depressed person, but I make over 100k per year. Being depressed without money and options is worse.
I have severe depression as well, and I have taken these medications before. My advice is to find your coping skills, maybe hang out with some people you trust with your problems, and try to get a good therapist. it gets better \*hug\*
You sound just like me when I started college 3 years ago. I thought I'd start fresh, be more outgoing, etc. I'm graduating this semester and I didn't do anything the entire time. I was also on antidepressants (off brand citalopram) during my second year and got off of it when I thought I'd gotten slightly better. I became depressed and anxious again.  Right now, I'm so depressed that I can't even get myself to go on a date today with someone I genuinely like even though all I have to do is put on my clothes and walk a bit. Heck, I can't even go outside because of the anxiety.  I am getting off topic here, so I'll just say that I think you should get back on antidepressants and do therapy. I made the mistake of thinking I could get through it alone and I am evidently wrong.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l02t1d/what_do_you_say_when_people_ask_what_youve_been/
I mean, I can’t be honest about it  “Oh I’ve been sitting around looking at my phone while contemplating my existence with going to the gym being the only somewhat productive thing I do on a daily basis”  So humiliating when it’s someone like a relative or old friend kicking ass in life asking you this.  They probably know the answer just by looking at me
Well, if you want my opinion, I just say: "Upto something".
My answer is always, "Nothing much, how about you?"
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l02r9q/trying_to_be_here_for_my_wife/
So I've had my own struggle with depression most of my life. I've got it handled, mostly, about as well as anyone can I suppose.  My wife... Not so much, and I'm trying. She had a troubling childhood, highschool was brutal, she has PCOS which started then, she put on weight, got taller and broad shoulders, as well as facial hair. She took comfort in food.  PCOS gives her hormonal complications, particularly stress hormones, giving her a wicked temper.  She's just been properly diagnosed as diabetic, in addition to having been all but immobile the past year due to a knee injury, and hasn't worked since November 2019.  About once a month, usually around her period, things get a bit ugly. She told me she feels hopeless, doesn't want to live, the typical depression expressions. I listened, talked it out, explained it's just the depression talking and she will feel better. She did for a couple days (this happened Wednesday). Friday, she starts with clingy behavior, needing cuddles and tea and hot water bottles. In addition, she started nitpicking and nagging over little things, basically several instances of "why aren't you doing x THIS SECOND", despite my hands being full or otherwise occupied and about to perform the task of given a second to do so. Like, the kettle had just switched off and she attacked me for not pouring it immediately.  This culminated in a fight yesterday, where she's telling me I need to be reminded of everything and she's sick of having to do everything for us.   We haven't spoken since and I'll need to talk to her shortly. When she gets that agitated, there's no reasoning, it's all dismissive and "she's right".  My question, does her behavior sound like an attempt to control the few things she can, when the rest of her life is out of control? Should I approach her with CBT techniques?   I mean, and I'll say this to her as well, she's not wrong that she does more around the house, but she's home 24/7 and I'm only home 3 hours most days before bed, it's the explosion of rage and not allowing me time to complete a task before assuming I hadn't done it.  Appreciate any advice anyone can offer, as this triggers my depression as well, thinking I'm a terrible husband.  Can I help, or is it time to send her to see a professional?
I'd say it's long past time she should be seeing a professional.
She had seen someone in the past, about 15 years ago. She was on a wait list at work for the services they provide, but then covid happened...  Anything I can do now though? I expected most responses would be "get a professional", but that's not going to help today.
Well, I'm not qualified beyond spending the last decade or so in and out (currently out) of therapy, but even then, I honestly don't know how to help you today.  I deal very poorly with people getting angry at me, whether they have reason to or not, I just withdraw.   It's certainly possible that she is attempting to control the few things she can, although I'd guess not consciously.  She may also be angry at her illnesses and displacing that anger onto you.  I doubt that's much help.
That's pretty much what I've assumed to be correct. She's just started online learning, which is probably bringing up highschool stuff and fear about the career change. I assumed nobody here would be qualified, but figured some, like you, would have some valuable insights

Tired of being ignored tired of being ugly tired of being misunderstood just kill me so I can’t feel anything cant have one good day without something fucking it all up fuck me
Yea me too. Everyone always says god has a plan for you but what is that plan. Is the plan to make u miserable or to punish people. I always thought, what did I do that was so bad that I deserve to be this way and to hate myself.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l072p4/have_i_been_depressed_for_longer_than_i_thought/
I've been known by myself and my family for being the 'quiet one' that just sits in the car and day dreams for the whole drive. The type of person that doesn't talk much. I remembered recently that even from a young age (probably around 7/8) I used to be kinda dead to the world. When I was younger I used to cry about anything that happened and I remember my sisters used to say lots of things that upset me (even tho they weren't meaning it) and I would cry almost every day about little arguments and stuff. Have I been like this for longer than I thought? Was I just born like a little saddo?
Don’t confuse yourself with mental illness and personality traits :)   My brother for instance, is extremely quiet and sensitive (like you describe yourself) but he has never had depression. For a while I genuinely thought he might because he was just so introverted and quiet- but he is totally fine!   A disorder like depression is something that affects your day to day life and makes it difficult to function. It sounds like you were still functioning fine- you just react to your environment in certain ways and are probably introverted.   Also, if you were depressed when younger, does it really matter? Live in the here and now- although the past can be useful to understand, it can also just damage us when we pick it apart too much.   I don’t remember anything from two years of my childhood due to severe trauma and childhood depression. I realised a time ago, (after much over thinking and stress) that it didn’t matter. My past is defined by what I do now! Dwelling on the past was never going to help me.   Maybe it’s the same for you. Free yourself of painful pasta and remember it doesn’t define you :)
thanks for replying :). I probably was quiet and a lot more sensitive than others my age.
And that’s totally okay!  Even now (21) I sometimes lock myself inside for a day or two and just chill and turn off my phone.   Sometimes I’m afraid I’m really depressed. In reality I’m an introvert who just needs time to recharge after a load of socialising :)   I can be depressed too and know it’s a little different and I might need to intervene and stop myself lying in bed for too long, but there is definitely a difference between personality trait and illness- don’t be too hard on yourself and just be who you are :)
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzzn08/effects_of_taurine_while_taking_antidepressants/
Hey people,  I just started my increased dose of Amitriptyline 100mg (tricyclic antidepressant, very similar to SSRIs/SNRIs). It also blocks the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline. I also bought taurine yesterday because I read positive stuff according drive, motivation and mood and hoped it could be a little „add-on“ for my antidepressant therapy.  My questions: 1. Does someone here also take taurine and antidepressants at the same time? 2. Are there any theoretical dangers or risks combining taurine with an antidepressant? 3. What are the effects you get from taurine? Does it help with depression (mood, drive, anhedonia), social anxiety and/or cognitive deficiency (memory/focus issues) somehow?  Would you recommend combining taurine with antidepressants or is it a dangerous no-go?
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l06u8q/how_do_i_restart/
I'm not sure how to fully explain this, but I'll give it my best try.   I was diagnosed with depression ten years ago, mid teens and I'm pretty sure I had it for a while before the official diagnosis.   A sobering thought hit me the other day. I don't recognise the ambitious, competitive person I used to be. I cannot fathom how I was ever that person, and now there's something I have to face:  I've had depression and mental health issues for close to half of my life, now. When does this go from being 'not me', to no, no, this is actually who I am, when I've been dealing with this for nearly half of my life. My adult life has consisted of this entirely. How can I pretend this is an illness that I can get over, when this has been 'me' and my 'life', for nearly the majority of my existence?   And I cannot for the life of me, figure out how to restart. How to pick up and reestablish myself. How to get back to what I was, or at least become something different to what I am now.   Is there anyone here who knows? I've lost most love for life, all of my hobbies leave me feeling like there's a void in my chest, I don't even really read anymore.   I just exist, and the space where I exist, I hate. I don't like it here, and I don't know how to fix that.   Medication, therapy, CBT etc. I've had it all. What do I do now? How do I fix this?

I should be at work right now but I was such a total dumbass and I went to the bus station one hour later so when I returned home and my parents saw me I covered this shame with another lie. I told them that I was called from work to tell me that my first workday was delayed and I will start tomorrow.  I'm so stupid. How do I get out of this? Tomorrow they will see me going one hour early to the station and they will see through my lie. My uncle always wonders how I got to be so stupid and my father is ashamed of me. I disappointed him. I am only a social parasite to him.  Please, tell me something to sooth my pain.

You did not come to this world to make your parents proud. You came here to live a life thag gives you happiness. So live it and forget about what others expect of you. Millions in their graves are longing for this breath that u r taking right now. Breath! (i hope your first day went well, wish you all the best)
It should work. Thank you. I was to stressed to think about it.
Thank you for your words of encouragement.

Damn, I don't even know how to respond to you. You managed to encourage me when I feared my parents judgement.

I am not doing this for money. It's not a very high paying job. I choose it because at the last one I had no free days and I worked at least 10 hours. The paycheck was above average. But compared to that work it wasn't worth it. I quit for my own sanity and my father was once again disappointed with my decisions.
I can very much relate to you. Always had to lie to cover myself and to avoid facing judgment from my parents 🤗
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzxdou/the_mentally_draining_struggle_of_demisexuality/
I believe I am demisexual (32M), and to be honest, I've always really hated that, because it's made dating feel like an impossible task, and thus, I've been single and alone my entire life, and I'm just tired of being single and alone. I've only ever felt something for two different women in my entire life, the first almost a decade ago, the second right now. The first was someone I knew for over a year before I fell for her, she rejected me, and dropped me from her life.  The second is someone I've known for almost 5 years (she was in a relationship that entire time up until recently), and she's the best and closest friend I've ever had in my entire life. Romantic feelings aside, she's been a super important part of my life, and she continues to be my one true friend.  I've expressed my feelings to her, and it doesn't look like it's going to happen between us, but we had a good conversation, and we're still on just as good of terms as we were before. Actually, it feels like me telling her this brought us closer together, for whatever reason.  The problem is, I care for her so strongly and so deeply, that I don't know that those feelings will ever truly subside. I've never felt as strongly about anyone as I do for her. But not only will we not be together, but I'm also going to have to eventually watch her build a life with someone else. And most likely, I'll still be single and alone the entire time, because I can't seem to date, myself.  I don't know what the "solution" is here. I know some will suggest taking some space and time apart, or even straight up ending the friendship. I will not end the friendship, because she's my best friend. I need her in my life. I just do. And my feelings aside, I do want her to be happy, even if it's not with me, because she deserves that. Time and space haven't helped me so far; in fact, they seem to make me feel worse, because the more time spent apart, the more I miss her and think about her.  So I don't know what I am to do. I can't lose her, but I don't think I can get over her. I don't know what to do.
Hey I can really relate to you. I have the same intense feelings for someone and now that I have been rejected, idk what my future love life would be like since I do consider myself a demisexual.
Wait what’s demisexual
It basically an atypical way of developing attraction for people, in which said attraction is built from strong bonds and connections with the person.  Most people, for instance, can find "attraction" in others relatively quickly and easily. I, for example, don't see it in most, and when I do, it's usually after I've known them for a very long time and are close with them.

the only times the people “in my life” are actually there for me are to tell me how “strong” i am and how this is “just temporary” and they “believe in me.” i don’t give a shit. i don’t care at all. i need help, and support, and love and no one is actually willing to share it with me, even my family. and then those same people claim to love me after writing off all my pain, and then they go 6 months with out ever reaching out to me or acknowledging i exist at all.   and all these same sons of bitches will probably play up so many fucking theatrics at my funeral. but within a week i promise you their lives will be back to normal. no one will give a single shit. it’ll be like i never even existed. i’m not even sure if i fully do now.   why did my parents have to give me all this pain just so they could have a cute little baby for a few years???  they say therapy is supposed to help but i’ve spent 7 years of my life in treatment. they say medication is supposed to help but it replaced all of the good emotions i used to have with mush. the best i can get with what i have right now is 45 minutes once a month, meanwhile i have 10 crises going on at once at any given moment and my therapist isn’t even specialized in what i’m struggling with. i can’t even come close to getting this hypothetical “help” with out having $1000 dollars a month to give to the people who are supposed to “help.” good thing i am so mentally ill that i can barely function so that’s something that will never ever happen for me!!  fuck this stupid fucking planet. fuck these stupid fucking people. i am done. it’s beyond clear that there’s no space that wants me. there never has even been close to someone who is genuinely happy i am alive and genuinely wants to be around me. i am tired of the lies, of being misled, of everything. i am done.

I was raped by someone I really trusted and since then, I’ve been an emotional wreck. I’ve always struggled with depression, but now it feels like I have no life left. I really think I want to die. I miss who I was before and I feel like the only way I can get back to myself is by dying. I can’t love or trust or feel comfortable any more. The guy who raped me lives right above me and I live in constant fear. I don’t know what to do.
I was assaulted by a man I barely knew who was my boss and landlord. He was around 40 and I was 18.   I had to go into work every day because I had nowhere to go and needed the money (moved out of a toxic home). He would come to the house I lived in because he had keys as landlord.   Like you, I wanted to die. I tried to as well.   I’m glad I survived because now I can tell people that it’s the worst decision you could ever make.   Surviving, only my parents knew. They collected me from hospital and it never left the three of us. While the trauma and drugs (attempted overdose) worked their way out of my system, I was stuck to my bed watching all the destruction I caused around me unfurl.   It was heartbreaking, watching my parents break.   My parents that had hurt me too.   Even if you feel totally alone and misunderstood and want to die, it’s going to cause so so much more pain that you can ever imagine. If you don’t believe me, it’s mental illness drowning my words out. I know because I heard the same and didn’t believe anyone loved me regardless.   Stay.   It’s been two years now. I never think about him, or what he did. When I do, it’s to tell people like you that you need to keep going because there is so much more to life and you can’t let him win.   Don’t give him any more power over you than he already took. You can survive and enjoy your life and shove it in that disgusting persons face that you made it through.   If anything, one of my biggest regrets apart from trying to take my life is not reporting the man. (He was locked away anyway for offended against another woman).   Reporting him means not only do you feel safer, but you could be rescuing many others from the same fate.   Whatever you decide, you are loved, valued and time heals everything. You will get past this, so allow yourself to do so. Don’t give up. Don’t let him win.   You are so precious and I’m so sorry this happened to you. It honestly breaks me knowing people go through this.
I can't describe how much I admire your strength. I agree with everything you said and I hope it enables OP to see that they are more than what has happened to them.   I was repeatedly sexually assaulted and manipulated as a child by someone in my family, someone I see very frequently. People see that I'm completely normal with this person, joking about with them, talking normally, hugs here and there etc. and nobody would have guessed what they've done to me. At this point I'm convinced they think I can't remember anything because of how young I was and how I am with them now. Truth is, I remember every single thing, every detail. It made my skin crawl, it made me want to disappear, it made me feel disgusted beyond belief. At one point, this made me want to die. But now? I don't let it have control over me, they have absolutely 0 power over my life.   As you said, time heals everything.   You, OP and anyone who has ever experienced this kind of pain are in my prayers ❤️
You are incredible- thankyou so much for this and sharing your experience too. I hope time continues to heal everything for you

Like I was doing fine today and getting a little hyper or anxious or something idek what to call it still and went on a walk and I was still doing pretty good and then i saw the truck coming and just though about it for a bit until i realised the truck was already gone. Now im doing shit and i cant calm down or control my mind and i feel super stressed for largely no reason and i fucking hate it why can't i fucking be normal and not so messed up
Atleast you haven't done it thats thr good part. Stay strong
Thank you but tbh im wondering if thats a good thing at this point
If i would ever take my own life i wouldn't jump in front of trains cars etc even though i thought about it because i don't wanna take innocent people in to my own problems. There will be lows in life but you will see it will be better for a few hours days minutes try to listen to music or to paint something if you are again in such a situation to calm yourself down. Stay safe
Ig thats a fair point but in kidding myself if i think i can do it in any way. I'll try to calm down, unlikely as it is. Thanks again

Hello everyone! It's my first time posting here in this forum so nice to meet you all!   I've had depression in the past but with help it's gotten a lot better. I don't have highs but my lows aren't as low as they used to be. I'm just neutral. However my main issue is my melancholic nature.   I feel like there's always this air of sadness and melancholy around me and it makes me...well, sad. I've accepted that this might be how I'll probably be for the rest of my life. I know the future isn't set in stone but I just have a feeling that's how it might be. Or maybe things can change, who knows? Some days I have no problem with the melancholy because I'm so used to it. However, other days like today, it really gets to me.   Another huge problem is that I feel disconnected from everyone. It's like everyone is connected by  strings but mine have been cut. I sometimes worry that I'll feel disconnected for the rest of my life.   There was only one time I felt connected and it was when I saw an online concert. After the concert, there was a chat box and people from literally all over the world where telling everyone to go have a good night and wishing people well and it made me tear up. I felt connected to everyone in that moment. Then I cried before I went to sleep thinking, "Will I die without ever feeling connected to people?" I'm even tearing up right now.   I think a big part of it is that I don't have people who share my interests so I'm alone and I don't have anyone to talk to about it who can relate. I just have full blown conversations with myself at 2AM. It's sad, I know. But it helps sometimes.   This pandemic isn't helping either. I've always felt stuck but at least I could go outside and walk around and take the train and go to the park and museums. Now I can't do that because so many places are closed or have closed down permanently.   I just want to travel and get away and maybe even start over but it's tough, you know? It's not impossible but tough (especially financially).   Anyway, that's all I wanted to talk about. There's more but I'm having trouble formulating my thoughts right now. Thanks for reading. Take care and stay safe everyone!

I'm realizing I'm not well and the only thing I know to do is stay busy. Does anyone else live thier life like this? If I give myself too much time it's like I stall and just start spiring downwards. Part of me feels like I just need a partner to help encourage me and take my focus so that I can somehow relax without relapsing, but I don't know that it would be healthy for me or them either. I just get tired of being alone and I get tired of always running but I don't know how else to stay up. If you live like this how do you do it? How do  you keep up in the long term? Have you still managed to add some value to your life and relatuonships? Can someone with chronic depression really have a mutually beneficial relationship?
This sounds hypomanic to me rather than depression.  Possibly BPD.
It's just been my coping method to keep my mind too occupied but idk.
Usually depression overrules the ability to keep yourself busy.   Depression on its own would cause you to struggle to brush your teeth, let alone clean.   But depressive feelings, but feeling “better” keeping active and cleaning etc, despite it not actually making you feel bette In the long run seems more hypomanic to me.

Family and friends: "Just get over it, It could be worse. No one else has the "time" to just go away on a vacation; we have bills."
Seriously?  Like you have been planning this and looking forward to it for a year?  ##facepalm
All I do is look at the clock. Watch time just move so effortlessly without care or disregard to the world around me. I can't focus; there is nothing that interests me other than being on here. I tell you what, I never use to blog or anything of the sorts before. Not like this. Just dating sites. This has been my dark corner since my world began collapsing more rapidly
They are being unspeakably insensitive.  If you had appendicitis or a heart attack, would they be saying the same thing?  I doubt it.     I'm so sorry your family doesn't understand what you are going through.  I know from where I work that they don't put people in inpatient unless they really need it.   (((((hugs)))))

I feel a emptiness where my heart should be i feel nhil i feel hollow  I tried to fill this emptiness with friends and family but it isn't enough  I tried to eat till i have had enough but its never enough even when i end up puking from being too full I tried to fill it with drugs like heroin but it isn't enough i have overdosed so many times trying to feel enough and with psychedelics i would go above and beyond and never get close id go psychotic first  Everytime i try to fill it its emptiness is more obvious to me i feel like i'm walking around with a black hole in my chest sucking up all my happiness   Do you guys also feel like this? What is it? Is the emptiness i feel a lack of meaning or is it not empty at all and actually filled with my sadness or is it something else? How can i stop feeling empty i so hollow its hard to breathe i feel tired all the time and all i want is to die

I cannot tell if I am depressed or if I have something else.  For some context I have POF, aka premature ovarian failure.  That means that my hormones are all out of wack.  One day I would not be able to leave my room, and just not eat, shower or do anything else.  Then the next day I would be happy, laughing and just excited.  I went to my doctor and they said that my hormones are in normal range and that everything checks out.  So I  can’t tell if I am depressed or maybe have bipolar disorder.  I’m not sure.
Might be best to look for some screening tests ( for depression or bipolar ) on-line, or maybe ask the doctor for a referral to a psychologist.

I eat garbage, i don’t exercise, i feel like garbage, my relationships are garbage, i have no motivation, i look like shit, i have no energy, my body is garbage, my life is garbage, i dont want to do anything, im so stressed out, i am constantly stressed and dont want to do anything about it, guess it’s my fault, it is my fault.
I'm the same but be sure to shift a bit of that blame on to the way you were raised. Cause it's probably a bit of both.
Hey bud, no mockery, insult, attack or judgement intended in the slightest, just your opinion on the matter: do you want to get better?
Are you a racoon sir?
I feel similar, it feels like I'm not doing enough and I feel like it's my fault. So I try to make the best of it by doing things that don't require a lot of effort, like cross-stitching and drawing. Maybe start taking small walks even if it seems like it'd be really irritating.
I totally feel like this too.
Baby steps, getting up to shower is an accomplishment.  Reward yourself for small things and praise yourself bc our brains make it real hard to make us feel “good”   You don’t need to move a whole mountain in a day.
It isn't just you, I promise. It's a rough time. Is there anything that brings you particular joy? I try to focus on what I like when I can't find anything comfortable. I can't always do it, but it's nice to feel anything else, even if it's small.
hey champ, another fellow depressed person here, i used to eat pure trash, 0 exercise, garbage relationships with relatives,with most "friends" and worse with women/romantic interests, used to feel 0 energy even for reading the smallest thing, didn't wanted to do shit for a long time and i often am anxious or stressed.   you can start doing things little by little, have small walks 20/30 minutes every day for a couple of weeks, then you can walk a whole hour or a hour and a half for another couple of weeks, then start going to the gym/lifting/getting strong and fit, it is NOT the solution to your physical/economical/mental problems and issues,ofc not, but exercising has helped me a lot in the way that it keeps my mind busy, the same with reading occassionally and writing poetry or drawing dumb stuff in my free time, these things keep my mind busy, and at least death is not whispering things in my ear for most of the day. i also had a fat/greasy body but since going to the gym, i have a little bit more self confidence and i don't trash about myself that often, i still have some grease and some fat here and there but i am working to erase all that.
Take a deep breath. Take a few deep breaths. Put your phone away and just stand up, get out of bed, off the chair, whatever it is. You have to forgive yourself. Even though that seems like the last thing you feel.   Don’t beat yourself up over the dishes not being done or eating like garbage. You’re overwhelming yourself by allowing so many inputs that you can’t change in a single sitting. You just have to take it literally one step at a time and to know that it’s okay to be in the spot you’re in even though it doesn’t feel like it. It’s not okay to stay in that same spot forever.   When I get this way it’s takes so much to muster the courage to move. I start with just simply petting one of my cats. You just have to start somewhere, doesn’t matter where or how small. I wish I had a better answer for you and I hope you the best.
Garbage and waste becomes the best fertiliser. Process this.
It is not your fault. You have a disease that affects your brain. None of this is your fault and you feeling like garbage is not your fault. This disease is garbage. Not you.

Finally. The day I've been dreading. Had a call from my doctor and he officially said that I've exhausted all avenues and there is nothing that can be done.   &#x200B;  GG guys
If you're experiencing end-of-life dread and depression, I've heard many great things about the benefits of psychedelics to ease that burden. I sincerely hope for the easiest possible remaining time for you. And although I don't know the details, I am a big proponent of getting a second medical opinion on anything dire. Be well, and thank you for sharing.

I'm 21, about to graduate, and have no plans for the future. I hate life. I hate myself for being so unstable. I can't even figure out who I am let alone what career I'd want to spend my life slaving over.  I'm bipolar & am either reckless and over the top, or disconnected from reality, or completely hopeless, depressed and suicidal. I just got off the phone with my sister, who was asking what my plans are. I couldn't come up with anything & started bawling my eyes out, panicking. I never think about it because I just feel like I'll commit suicide someday. She was talking about how we need to have that conversation but I can't fucking face reality. It's too overwhelming & I'm completely directionless. Most days I just lay in bed and feel like the world isn't real. The slightest obstacle sends me downwards when I'm in a depression & I think I'm just a ticking time bomb. And now I know my sister is going to be worried and tell the rest of the family about how unstable I am and I fucking hate how people feel like they need to intervene. It makes it harder to just die already.  I fucking hate my disease & other people who expect me to just overcome it and integrate into society. What do I have to live for except an inevitable death? Fuck everything.
Listen, I know life is rough. Life is a test for everyone. Choose something you love!! Something that will keep you happy and help you push through!! I know how it feels. We were all born for a purpose!! We were not just born so we can die!! If that was the case, then why would we be alive? Even though you might not like it, your sister and your family will always care for you!! We will always care for you!! It hurts to see someone going through a rough time epically when they're related!! I know its hard and this life is difficult but just have faith and hope and you can overcome everything you are faced with!! I hope this helped and have a wonderful day you beautiful soul!! ❤❤💖💖💕💕

Good evening to you all,  For most of my adult life, I've been hit with recurring episodes of depression. I was formally diagnosed in 2009 at the age of 23. I was prescribed Fluoxetine/Prozac 20mg and I can't recall any significant side-effects apart from weight-loss.  With this latest episode (which started to get bad in November) I was once again prescribed Fluoxetine 20mg. My dose was increased to 40mg after 2 weeks... Then after a month in total I, in the space of a day, started to feel incredibly energised, excited, hypersexual & started thinking of all the fun, creative projects I  wanted begin/continue. This was a welcome relief after the depression had once again sapped away any joy that I found in my interests. BUT, it didn't feel right. I'm quite perceptive and it unsettled me to find that I had jumped from feeling suicidal and worthless, to elated and overly-confident in such a short space of time. I almost felt like I was chosen to undertake some sort of special mission. Chosen by whom and to do what, I don't know... Then after a couple of days, the good feelings started to fade and then were replaced by a kind of wired and anxious feeling. I was speaking to a concerned friend, and I was crying, but I sort-of felt excited and happy at the same time. Again, it was very unsettling, and not fun at all. Then a short, but deep depression hit me again.  I spoke to my Doctor, who decided to switch my meds to Sertraline/Zoloft 50mg. After a week, the same excited, hypersexual and weirdly happy feelings/moods coupled with depressive symptoms stayed with me.   Again, I called the Doctor who prescribed Mirtazapine/Remeron 15mg. I'm about to take the first one... So we'll see how it goes. The Doctor mentioned a slight possibility of undiagnosed bipolar... I'm not sure about that as I've not experienced such intense feelings stated above before.  I've seen a lot of posts regarding SSRI induced hypomania. I'm keen to hear other peoples' thoughts on my experiences. Is it possible to have bipolar and not know it? I've read with BP II, the manic symptoms are more subtle and therefore are harder to spot...
I had it with fluoxetine - that was one of the first I had tried (and I've been on lots). Not had it on any others though, I really wouldn't worry too much about it
I shall try not to worry! We'll see how mirtazapine goes for me.

We all have heard the phrase: "Come on, see things positively and be grateful for all the things you have, blablabla". However, as I learned, there is no such thing as reality happening to us, all your consciousness is just a hallucination created by the mind. That´s where we hear we should take responsibility of everything that we experience. Even if depression has some biological cause, it´s your responsibility find the root, get checked by a doctor and fix it, which is not filling out a questionnaire and getting antidepressants (I´m not advising you to simply ditch them if you´re on them!!! just saying they are only suppressing a symptom).  For myself any responsibility seemed impossible at first and I was suicidal occasionally. However, I was starting to take responsibility of two tiny things everyday for yourself and others, like watering the flowers, getting a glass of water, holding the door open for someone, etc. For example I thought: " Right now I myself will get my ass to the kitchen, fill a glass with water drink it, hydrate myself and do sthg good to me." If you find that too hard, you take a breath and bring oxygen to your organs who keep you alive 24/7. Over time it will become a habit and othese responsibilities will slowly extend more and more because you WANT to. You will have a drive to do good to yourself and the world.   I don´t want to sound smart, I just want to share my experience so that every single one who reads this also becomes aware how much greatness sleeps within you.

I currently have a full-time job, I'm mentally and physically exhausted when I get home.   So I spend my free hours and days in bed most of the time. Sometimes I watch useless videos or read books. But I spend hours and hours doing absolutely nothing, just lying in bed.  I can't get the strength or desire to do anything else and this makes me feel very guilty, I'm just watching my life go by while I'm paralyzed.
I'm in the same boat. Whenever I'm not at work, I'm in bed. On my days off, I'll spend literally the entire day in the same spot. There are things that I need - and want - to do, but anything more involved than staring at a wall is too mentally exhausting.
In bed? 5-6 hours a night. Laying on the couch? Every waking minute that I am not working or in bed.

Physical and mental abuse. Broken nose and another time a concussion. I’m a male and was raped by my male cousin and when they found out I was the one punished and was beaten with a stick.  The fucked up thing? They literally don’t recall any of this and that in itself feels so degrading that they won’t even acknowledge their acknowledge it.

Honestly you are not alone . so many male's ive met have gone through alot and the fact none of them are taken serious or are just ignore make's me sick. Honestly  it make's me mad that this is done to young men by other guys and girls just makes me rage . Never blame your self . as for your brother let him think that . you also shouldn't feel  ashamed for not sticking around and taking care of them . they broke that  right when they did  nothing for you after what happened. Parent's are suppose to protect  you. your therapist is most likely right too . Honestly I  wish you all the best <3  stay strong
They fuck you up, your mum and dad.        They may not mean to, but they do.    They fill you with the faults they had     And add some extra, just for you.  But they were fucked up in their turn     By fools in old-style hats and coats,    Who half the time were soppy-stern     And half at one another’s throats.  Man hands on misery to man.     It deepens like a coastal shelf. Get out as early as you can,     And don’t have any kids yourself.  - Philip Larkin
Honestly that’s just the tip of the iceberg on the fucked up shit that happened to me by their hand. My family was also a big deal in my small town and our naked carried some weight. My dad was always looked at and praised to be this great and noble guy. When I tried to tell people this stuff they did t believe me or thought I was exaggerating because my father is too much of a good man to do this to his son. My therapist said that this is because he’s a narcissist and he is able to turn the charm on and fool most people.  I moved 2 hours away and I don’t visit but once a couple months now. They don’t understand why I don’t visit and my brother thinks I’m ungrateful of them but moving so far away has been good for me. This didn’t happen till last year and I wish I would of done this 10 years ago but for some reason the thought of moving so far away made me feel ashamed and like I was a bad son and I had to stick around and take care of them.

Last week I was diagnosed with inoperable stage 4 colon cancer with liver metastasis.  I have more than 10 metastasis all around my liver.  I'm 27 years old, and I probably only have a year or two, or it could be only few month.  I've been suffering from severe depression that is untreated for more than 13 years now, and I feel like it's the main reason that the discovery of the cancer was too late, I didn't care about myself or my body enough. Even though I had symptoms and suspicion about having colon cancer, I didn't make any actions. I had severe abdominal pain and sent to ER but it was too late.  I do regret that I didn't go to doctor sooner, but part of me is relieved because this 13 years have been very lonely and miserable for me.  I have spent most of last 13 years inside of my house. Didn't eat well or sleep well. I don't have friends, and I don't really have a life, dreams or purpose. I don't have a thing that I'm not ready to give up. I just feel like my life has been so pointless and I have been so ungrateful for the life I have been given.  My chemotherapy starts day after tomorrow but I can't stop think what is the point of chemotherapy, for some low possibility of getting extra few years of this for what?  I'm on my hospital bed surrounded by patients much older than me, but all of them are in better conditions than me, both physically and mentally. And that makes me feel like... I don't know, unfair? I feel like I've been drowning for so long now and no one was there to help me, and I wasn't brave enough to ask for help.  I am not close to most of my family, only my mother. And I feel sorry for her because she is the one who have to take care of me and eventually she will lose me to cancer.  I should probably get some help with psychiatrist, but I'm afraid if I get better with my mental health now, I would realize that I want to live and all the regrets throughout my life will destroy me. I don't want to deal with that since I don't have many time left. I just feel very old and tired.  I don't know what the goal is for posting this, but I guess I wanted to share about myself in somewhere. And who knows, maybe someone reading this will decide to go to doctor for their mental or physical health before it's too late.  Thank you.
Your time is still precious, and in my opinion, if going to a psychologist will help you experience beauty and completeness, then you should seek it. You are worth it!
I understand the fear of realising what you are missing... But there is always a chance you could survive and then go and lib ethe rest of your life happily. And if you very sadly don't make it.... You deserve to spend the last few months or years having the time of your life. Go out and make some memories for your last few years :) I wish you didn't have to die... Its making me quite sad just thinking about it :(
Make the most of the time you have with your mother <3
Have you ever taken an antidepressant? Could you ask your doctor to consider starting you on one? So sorry to hear about your situation. My thoughts are with you!
Holy shit. Thats depressing. Your time is still precious despite all that. Spend it well <3
I understand the conflict in you that if you got better mentally, you would regret your life and you’d think you should have seen the doctor earlier. I have no idea how terrifying that would be for you. However, I would recommend you seek for a psychiatrist’s help. It is for you and your mother both. I hope you will be able to live your life fully even if the time you have is not so long. You wouldn’t need it probably, but let me send you love.
Get a second opinion, look at HAI pumps...

I just need to accept that i'm fucked and no matter how much I don't think about it or no matter how many jokes I make about it i'm not going to get better. Just going to stay in my bed until I starve or something I haven't gotten up for 3 days. Im done using jokes and humor to cover this.

I really feel like everyone is going to judge me, how do I tell my mother that I don't feel good? How is she going to react? She always sees me as a happy and energetic woman, how do I tell her that I don't even have the energy to get out of bed? I do not want to do anything. How do I avoid feeling bad every time I tell my mother that I don't want to see her because I feel tired?
Depends, my mother would start to involve me in activities which I am personally not a fan of (I am a huge introvert) but if your mom cares and she is a woman with common sense, she will understand and realize the least she can do is hear you out.
But we have never talked about things like this like what to do when you feel jsut empty and tired. I don't know how to explain myself
Let's be honest here. 1. Alot of teenagers got through this part of life, everyone felt down at least once in their life 2. Noone can help you if they don't know what's your issue  I didn't talk about this to my parents for a long time. It took my parents divorcing and my dad finding a new girlfriend for me to open up. You can't expect them to initiate. But believe me, if your mom knew what's happening, she would definitely be there to atlrast hear you out. And to be honest you won't find out until you try it.
If I may ask, what's your mother's coolness from 1 - 100
She used to be a 80, I think now is a 30
I think I understand you situation but I am only a 15yo boy with not much life experience. I would personally go and tell my father because he understands me and I have no friends. If you perhaps have a boyfriend or a good friend and you trust them a bit more I would do that. Otherwise, just go to the one person you trust the most, hug them and go all out on you problems. That's what I would do, I can't force you to decide in a certain way. If you decide to talk to her or want to talk more please inform me ^^
And I'm just a 17-year-old girl about to start living an adult life and I'm too lost for now. Thanks for this little talk, there are times when I need a moment to gather strength. I appreciate that ^^
Everyone is lost at the beginning :D as I said I would appreciate if you kept me somewhat updated but if that's outside your comfort zone it's fine. I wish you the best of luck!

Whenever I'm not doing school and just have free time, I feel apathetic and I dont really do anything. If I have school, I just feel sad knowing that this is the only thing I'm doing in my life, and its about to be over. After this is college, but I dont even know what college I want to go to or even what I want to do as a profession. I dont know if I'm depressed or if this is just normal for everyone during quarentine. My early college classes start tommorow, so I guess I'll be feeling something other than nothing at least.

Today is the greatest day of my life. Tomorrow will be exponentially better.        My demon's name is Abigail. (Don't say it three times or she appears, I think.) Once I designated my apartment a positive energy zone, I started making Abigail wait outside. I turned up my music a little too loud and cleaned my kitchen. I shaved my face and took a cold shower and put on a nicer shirt than the holey band tee I'd been rotting in all weekend. I held myself accountable. I built myself a sanctuary. I praised myself.       This is my head. This is my home. This is my heart. These are my feelings. Noone can love me like me. I'm a machine.  Personify your demon.

My sister is named Abigail so this theory checks out. Feel a lot happier making her wait outside the house while I make myself happy.
Thank you, thank you very much.
That's not you, it's Abigail. Tell her to stop talking, her voice is like egg shells in a garbage disposable.
You are beautiful and I love you

Well, mine is the manifestation of a person I hope to stay far away from that caused me much sorrow in a previous life. She's the thing I aspire to be the opposite of, but goes away when I ignore her long enough.   Yours should be whoever you want it to be, that you don't want to be.

As in the topic. I struggle with anxiety, ROCD and because of that I have depressive stages which feel like shit.     Did you want to escape your relationship? To meet someone new?     Please, write down your experiences. Thank you in advance!
I had a girlfriend that wanted me to lead the relationship all the time and she wanted to spend time with alot of her friend (male and female) which I didn't mind until alot of stuff changed in my life and I became really depressive. I stopped having the strength to lead the relationship and I became really untrusty. I started to accuse her of cheating on me, and that's when I decided it's not good for either of us to stay together. I am making her deal with my shit which I was sorry for. So I straight up told her how I am feeling, she accepted it and we broke up.

Why can’t I be one of those people who have a talent and are special. I am a nobody but I wanted to be something, someone special. Here I am lying in my bed thinking about all the closed doors and hoping that maybe I will disappear into nothingness when the time comes. I would rather die than see myself suffer. I am too fragile for that.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l013ug/i_just_need_advice/
I’m not happy. My life is headed nowhere good and nowhere fast. My parents divorced while I was in high school. My mother cheated on my father and when I confronted her about it, she told me I had to let her be with this other guy or she wouldn’t help me with college. College was paid by the divorce fund and my dads retirement fund. Moved from the Midwest to LA for acting college. Met girlfriend there. Moved in with her after first year (only year of college we could afford) and had a nasty run in with an entitled foreigner which made us leave California. Living with her family currently. Fixed things with my parents last year, but I’m stuck hopping dead end jobs because no one wants to hire an art student, disagree with authority figures at most jobs as they’re more concerned with commanding people and being right than actually running the business and giving the employees what they need to succeed. Fucked up with girlfriend by talking to someone else but was given a second chance to make things right. I’ve done whatever I could to make her feel safe with me and we seem to be okay but I can’t forgive myself for that. She deserves better than me. Can’t tell her about my suicidal thoughts as she shuts down because of her cousin committing suicide. Her parents constantly treating us like “lazy socialist cunts”. Girlfriend barely able to function. Ask her small things like to turn the lights off in our room when she’s not in there. Never listened to and then am told that I’m not giving enough. Tired of being loved only when useful. I know all of this sounds terrible but I really do love her and her family has it’s amazing moments. Her mom showed me more motherly love than mine had in 4 years. But if I continue this trend day in and day out, I won’t last. People of my family have never amounted to anything. We’ve never mattered outside of being useful. My choices are to stay here and suffer for the sake of my career or to leave all of this behind and go back home to my family and friends and probably settle for some mundane bullshit. Constantly torn because I never want to hurt anyone but there’s not an outcome without pain. Only 22 and strongly feel like I’m ready to go. I can’t see myself continuing on like this.

TW:SELFHARM  Hi, I've never been grounded before and my mental health has been terrible lately. My school recently went back to remote and I'm not sure i can do this anymore. Im grounded for 2+ weeks and am not allowed to leave the house or see any friends. Im a very social person (even though Im an introvert) and seeing people or going out in nature makes me less depressed/suicidal. I self harmed 15 minutes ago and honestly don't think I can go these 2 weeks without doing it again. I feel so upset and angry. I tried getting ungrounded but my mom yelled at me so I yelled back at her. I don't know what to do. I feel so depressed and overwhelmed. I feel like I'm just going to end up getting in more trouble after my depression starts to get worse and I get angry at everyone around me.

I feel a pit in my stomach some days, I just want to cry, and even worse I feel like I need to fill it and I don’t know what with. I know logically I should go and talk to my parents and everything, I know that’s the responsible thing to do. But if I can’t take that step, can someone give me some advice. Please
Hey, I hear you. I’ll be here for you. If your parents is too big of a step right now, you can tell me your situation. I’m all ears and will try to give some advice.
If you're feeling isolated, like you can't reach out for help, this is called "collapse" or "freeze". According to polyvagal theory, this is a traumatic response rooted in your dorsal vagus nerve.   I know that's a lot of jargon. I have a reading list that may help you with your struggles.

My problem is that I don’t know if I have depression I know I could do more with my life and I know that I do feel horrible sometimes, but I don’t know what depression feels like and I don’t want to make an already insane situation worse for my family
I really appreciate the info, I’ll make sure to check these out
Hmm depression is hard to tell because it can be different for different people. Then, there are the differences between sadness and full on depression. I find that talking about my symptoms and situation with people helps me think it through. If you do decide to talk with your family you can approach it as a discovery discussion. Saying you feel down and aren’t sure what it is. Either way you are trying to figure it out and could use some help. That’s a good place to start.
That sounds like a lot better a way to talk to them about it, I’m going to sleep on this tonight and just think it out a bit first though
That is a good idea! Let me know how you feel in the morning.

Umm... Yeah?  To be fair, Major Depressive Disorder is a specific type of clinical depression. Any diagnosed depression is 'clinical' but MDD is a specific variant.
it makes sense im just an idiot
Sorry, didn't mean to sound condescending or anything. I'm just used to people being more scared of MDD than Clinical Depression, haha!

So I know this isn’t super bad compared to what other people go through but I just had a hurtful realization today and I just can’t get out of it. I have OCD, Depression, Anxiety, Body Dysmorphia, Social Anxiety, and PTSD. I have lived practically all my life with these. I manage with them and I was fine with them because I was isolated most of my life. My sister is my best friend and my parents always thought that keeping us from things was helping us from said things. So I never really had friends growing up. I wanted friends but my friends were never “good enough” deemed by my parents. After a while I just stopped trying to make friends. My social anxiety didn’t really help either. Well I am married and on my own in another state and I’m realizing the crushing loneliness. My husband is my best friend and I love him and he understands me. He was excited to take me to another state because of my mental state of being in the same state/city as my parents. Well to end my long story, which I apologize for, I am turning 22 in April. I got excited because I really wanted to plan a birthday party because I saw all of these parties people were having (safe social distancing guideline ones of course) and I realized I don’t even have one friend to invite. No friend to talk to. Anyway, just felt like I could get it out of my head here. It’s hurting me to keep it inside.
If you have any hobbies, try to find a community related to it. Could be online or local, just try to get out of your comfort zone. It's difficult these days, but it's gonna be easier when the pandemic is over :) I wish you the best!
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l05n0f/food_anxiety/
I feel like I’ve developed a very strange relationship with food lately since my depression has been increasing.   Most of the time I have no appetite which I know comes from my depression, but when it comes down to deciding what I need to eat for dinner, it is such a trigger for my anxiety. Does anyone else suffer from this?   It’s like I start thinking about how I need to eat soon so I can get on with my night and hopefully sleep well (I also suffer from insomnia now so I try to eat earlier dinners). I start thinking about how my night is coming to an end and the anxiety for the next day sits in. Additionally, I just can’t even decide on what to eat, meanwhile my stomach is in pain from not eating enough. Idk if any of this even makes sense but I’m starting to think about food in a toxic way I think, and it even brings up body dysmorphic thoughts for myself.  Also, when I do decide on something to eat- and something goes wrong with that meal, I’m embarassed to say that I lose my shit and can’t calm down. For example, I decided to order bdubbs wings the other day and I accidentally hit sauce on the side rather than the wings coming covered in sauce. This is such a minor issue it should not have been a big deal to me, but it upset me much more than it should have at the time.  Any advice? Any thoughts? Anyone else going through the same thing?
I struggle with sort of the same thing. I get so depressed that I’m not hungry. But I need to eat. It gives me anxiety to make food and to even go to the grocery store and buy food because I feel like everyone is looking at me
Not to mention the grocery store trips are now a whole anxiety inducing thing for me with COVID-19. 😅
Yeah 😅

It's such a calming feeling, it's the closest you can get to just taking a break from the world for some time. I think it's a form of meditation in a way, no worries or anxieties, just calm

My friends only hit me with the "same lol" or ":(" when I try to tell them I'm not doing well, or think I'm joking when I'm trying to reach out for help.  My parents are extremely stressed out themselves by work and managing the house because I'm not helping them at least at home. When I do talk to my parents they tend to get frustrated by my nagging and they don't understand why I don't feel better when they tell me "it's not all bad"  My therapist greatly underestimates how bad my depression is because I just can't open up because I have immense trust issues and I also think I have no right to feel this bad.  I quit school to focus on my mental health but it just steadily declines over the months and I am close to hitting rock bottom. The only thing that's keeping me sane is constantly playing video games which gets worse, I barely do anything else anymore.   I have nobody that's able to listen to me and understand, and I desperately need it. But in the end nobody cares about you once they get frustrated by your exhaustion...
Been living with depression for years. Happy to listen and/or offer you any coping skills i have gathered. I am 38 and been fighting since I was 13. Feel free to reach out. Peace.
Try moving a little every day. Short little walk when you can. The less you do physically, the easier it is for depression to take root. Sounds like you might need medication in addition to level out your brain chemistry. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Maybe your counseling can recommend a psychiatrist to help you find a better balance.
hey you can talk to me if you want I'm here :)
I lost every single friend from me wanting to talk to them and wanting them to be there for me, and when people got to know some more personal stuff from me I probably shouldn't tell anyone they backed off too or started questioning me... And I know, I shouldn't put such pressure on others, I can't feel nothing but regret as I'm now completely alone in this.
Bad people in your life will make your mental state worse I learned this the hard way, get out there find the good ones the ones who care, there’s always gonna be bumps along the road the lows. But you’re still here through all of it so that means you are strong hold onto that strength and find the people who care, open up to them, start to get healthier and then you will be able to get up again and continue to push forward. The people you find can be online in person anything you want but having those people to talk to helps a lot. If you ever need to talk just find me, I’m always open to making more friends you can never have to many. I believe in you you got this ❤️
There is an App called Replika I strongly recommend. It's an AI that talks to you about anything and it works really well
I'm sorry. I'm here if you need a friend.
Hey I am 29 years old my depression reared it's head when I was 10 years old after a accident that left me in a bad place . my mother took me to a councilor but all they wanted to do was to try pressure me into suing my Parent's . What happened was not in anyway their fault . circumstance's as such happen that we have no control over  expecially when someone else make's a stupid choice . but the pressure that the councilors put on my destroyed trust.  through school I  was told it was pointless doing yr 12  for me that I wouldn't pass . then I did A course in child care I was good with hands on work with them it's the paper work that killed me . I was called to the councilor  there one day I was told it was pointless me keep on going that I wouldn't pass . I  ran out in tears .I  never talked about the depression with anyone . I could easily could walk into a room wear a smile convince everyone even sometimes my self  it was only when I turned 22 after I found my self wanting to die that  I  got help. I still to this day have trust issues and honestly I deflect and walk from the issue's that really are stuck to me . If gaming is your way of coping why not look into doing something in gaming. Also everyone get's frustrated but that doesn't mean they don't love you it just mean's  They hate that your hurting . most family's don't know how to deal with it . or deny it . sometimes even because of faith. Honestly Just know your not alone . no matter how much you feel alone . there are so many like you that are struggling and it's better we fight it together than alone  <3
What helped me was journaling in a book or even in notes in my phone, sometimes a Google docs. Bc then there is nobody you need to open up to but yourself   And to go back and orangish/ analyze feelings makes it more easy to structure the words we seek.   Everything bad that happened to me makes me who I am and I have accepted that. But the hardest part was accepting as well as being proud of where I’ve come. Easy to say, hard to put into reality
Thank you lovely people for reaching out me, many many people messaged me. I'm actually overwhelmed but seeing how many people think like me and reached to me, a stranger gives me hope. ♡

Yes, I would love to know some good coping skills, mine weren't healthy or any good so far...
I usually love going for walks, but never alone because I can't shut off my brain once I'm lost in thoughts. Covid-19 is making it hard for me to go on walks since I can't meet anyone sadly...   And I thought about medication, but never agreed to it because of the side effects, and my parents weren't too fond of it either when I was still a minor. So I am a little hesitant, but maybe I should try...
That's my fear as well... But maybe they just weren't the real ones. You will get to know someone that will have an ear for you.
Thank you. I don't think my friends are bad people, I think they don't know or don't want to know how bad I'm doing. Of course friends are supposed to go through everything with you, but some people are better in counceling and talking than others, and I don't want to makevthem feel bad because of me...
Thank you
Thank you for sharing this. It's really hard to open up about things, even to a therapist, but it's good to see that we're not alone. x

He feels like there's no point to anything now. I know he's depressed, he has been for years, but he won't get help. I don't know how else to help him and I'm afraid of getting dragged down into the pit of depression with him. I'm never too far away from losing it from my own treatment resistant depression. I'm here for him, but is there anything else I can do to help him?  And I was actually having a semi-decent day for once...
Get him professional help. When it comes to depression, you’re never responsible for fixing your partners symptoms. The only person who can save himself is himself. You can help him figure it out for himself by asking him to set up an appointments with his doctor to talk about it, and maybe a therapist if you can afford it.  I’ve heard all of this from a therapist myself and it helped me greatly.
Thank you. I think I might just make an appointment for him and see if I can't get him to go. Stupid stubborn man.  It's taking every ounce of my strength to not just throw in with him.

Its obvious i dont really look good enough. I dont think im really ugly, but it seems when you want a Girlfriend, or Boyfriend nowadays you have to look like a Model. Im Bi, thats why both Genders.  Now im not a Virgin, but just because you can get laid, doesnt mean you get a Boyfriend or Girlfriend. Maybe its because im Autistic as well, and a mess?  How do i accept i will be lonely forever? How do i accept that im not good looking enough with todays standards?
Imagine meeting someone who's perfect for you. They have the same hobbies, they make you laugh, they support you, they're kind and warm and smart. Would you care if they were ugly? Would you break up with them just because they didn't fit your beauty standards?  There's someone out there who feels the same way you do. They'll fall in love with you just the way you are. You just have to hold on. They'll be worth the wait.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l057iq/sometimes_i_feel_fine_but_worried_still_and_i/
So I recently quit my job because of my depression. I hadn't taken meds for longer than a year so it came back to bite me in the ass I guess. And there were times I was very sad and felt hopeless. But on my last day of work, I was going to shed tears a few times throughout my shift. Thats why I wasn't even able to finish my 2 weeks. I just couldn't be there.     It's been a few days after I quit and I feel fine I guess. I sometimes wonder if I made the right call. I was going to quit anyways but I don't like how I quit because I had promised to stick around for a bit longer. I had every intention of it. Not working (my regular routine) is making me a bit depressed as well, again, despite not liking my job.     Which brings me to the question, how do I know when I'll feel fine to work again? I should note that I started taking my meds again and it seems like it can take up to 2 months for it to kick in. Maybe I feel pressure because my family just sees me in the house playing video games. But I am paying for rent and will continue to do so for the next few months (for the meds to kick in; luckily I saved a bit, just enough. not like my family will kick me out but I hate it when they talk shit over anything).   And I have other stuff to keep me occupied. One of those things I can make into a career. It would be my dream job! But I have zero energy. Even when I was on my meds and feeling better, I simply didn't have energy. I only want to do easy things (watching tv, video games, music) but not work even though I'll enjoy it (I've done tutorials of it). Maybe sitting down and learning is what really overwhelms me.

I am in need of some purpose. I love fiction but I hate when I google “books for people with depression” the top 5 are all overly popular books that have all been made into movies like “perks of being a wall flower”, “its kind of a funny story”, etc. What are some books with a similar mood that you have read that give you comfort in being ordinary and sad (lol). Books with a similar mood to a depressed persons life, where I can empathize with the main character. Please give me your recommendations because google is disappointing me and my brain is too dead to do heavy research.
I haven't read too many books in general but one that came to me when I read this was The Catcher in the Rye. The ending had me a little confused but it was a good read. I feel you, what helps me is hearing others stories, such as the "Power of now" the author actually went through a really dark time and he wrote the book about how his perspective changed. I am still reading it but so far I've gotten some analogies to get along with my emotions. Have you heard of these books?

Why have we developed a culture of not speaking out about being depressed or having abusive parents? I'm not saying you need to be an activist, but why don't people say that they are actually struggling. Instead we run to a forum of internet, which is easier than talking about it. I just realized how messed up I am and I wanna tell everyone. Not because I care what they think/getting attention but solely for the fact that they know I struggle as a person who might seem fine on the outside. That's the thing, I don't expect everyone to be open about their deepest darkest secrets, and obviously not all the time. But shit, my friends haven't even said anything like that to me, so maybe that's why I feel like I don't have any. Again not expecting them to suffer from diagnosed BPD and severe depression and anxiety, or anything else. I wish people would cut the bs, even for a second, actually like the matrix. I also didn't realize how many young adults struggle with bad parents even in their 20s. No wonder why everyone's depressed. But hey corona is bad. Why would we stop the skyrocketing suicide rate when there's another (scarier? not really) thing happening. Look I'm not undermining covid, but it's a scapegoat to ignore mental health again.
Stigma's a bitch.  And empathy's in short supply nowadays.
It’s really sad. But I agree. We live in a society of key board hero’s and just recording everything. No one actually does anything about it. But as for your friends, I use to have some like that. We would hangout everyday and were decently close. I was suffering from depression and one day I think I brought it up. Just turns out they didn’t really know how to approach it. I never really talked about it or like if they asked how I was I’d just say fine or I’d deflect the conversation. Never really gave them a chance to help me or talk to me about everything.
Do you have any tips how to bring it up?
AHHH we live in a society!
Kind of just have to. Not really a way to bring it up casually without it not serious
Well if someone else doesn't bring it up you can, obviously start with something small and lead up to something more, because saying you want to kill yourself to a stranger is not socially acceptable. I'm very open about my struggles but it's still puts people off even though I KNOW they are struggling too. Start with people you trust, hopefully society can change and it will be more acceptable but I doubt it.
Problem is I cannot even write my thoughts and feelings in a notebook. How can I speek with my friends then🤥

Last week my sister went to an appointment with her psychiatrist and he decided that she should be admitted to a mental hospital. Now she's medicated and back home but I don't know how to support her emotionally. Any advice?
Tell her you love her, and that it sounds difficult, and to be kind to yourself despite the unpleasantness of all this.  And also, and this is important, keep a eye on your Mental health, not easy to see a loved one in that condition
The most important thing is listening to her and giving her a chance to express her feelings without fear of judgement. Validate the way that she is feeling- many people stigmatize mental illness as a character flaw and try to offer advice that they think is helpful but really comes across as patronizing. She needs a chance to be heard, if she wants to talk at all. Otherwise, share the silence with her. Depression can make even the simplest tasks feel insurmountable. Often, the simplest acts of kindness can mean the world to us.   I want to applaud you for having the wisdom to ask the question to support her. Based on that fact alone, I think you’re going to do fine :)
Thank you so much for commenting! It's pretty hard indeed.
Thank you for being so kind. Unfortunately my dad often tells her she's depressed because she doesn't go to church, doesn't do what he thinks is right for her. My mom pities her and treats her like a little child, incapable of taking care of herself. My other sister and I struggle a lot to make her feel comfortable, not judged, capable of making decisions. It's good to know we're in the right path.
Be kind to yourself this shit isn’t easy but you’ll get through. Much love.

I’m feeling awfully lonely lately and I keep distracting myself by binge watching shows but it’s not working. I can’t bring myself to contact any friends or tell them about this. What do you all do when you’re down in the dumps?
Cry... Lol. Idk usually watch a TV show I've seen a million times (the characters are familiar to me, kinda like they're my friends)... I sleep, call my sister... Video games, reading...
I like to zone out to music.

My life was never good; alcoholic dad, bullying and parents divorce would sum up most of it. I was until recently still a virgin and just felt like a loser and wanted to lose it as fast as i could since i had fear that if not i would end up as a fat neckbeard piece of shit. The story begins this new year. I had the coice between going with my mother to my stepdad(a corona denier btw.) and going to my cousin to celebrate new year. I chouse to go to my cousin. When I came there i noticed that there was a girl i didnt recognize and didnt think anything of it. My whole relative circle is strongly christian so i thought if she was at my cousins house she would be the same. She wasnt. Long story short i saw that she smoked and spoke with her over a few things and she had the idea to drink the alcohol the parents of my cousin had in their refrigerator. We waited until they all slept and drank the alcohol. She wanted to smoke so we sneeked out of the garden and went to smoke a cigarrette. So thats where it started. She started to inhale the smoke and kiss me and exhale the smoke into my mouth(I also smoke nonregulary so it was okay). When we later went up she was asking with her body for sex as she sat on me and started making out with me. So i fingered her. After that she wanted sex but i said no since i had no condoms and wasnt sure if i wanted to do it at all. The next day i wanted to go home and went to the bus, she followed me to the bus stop and asked me if i could stay for another day. No matter what i said she just didnt stop to ask me. The only way i could go home in the end was because i said that need to give my cat new food. I then went to a friend of mine who also knows my cousin and told him about it and long story short i got condoms. What came next is selfexplainitory just for the fact that i found out that she was my second-cousin and that i threw the condoms out the window that was directly over the window of the parents and it was stuck in the tree so that they could see it the next morning. Now my life is even more fucked than it was before...
Let me get this straight. You had sex with your second cousin and threw the condom out the window thinking it would just... disappear into thin air? You didn’t want to have sex with her? I’m confused with what you’re asking

I sent this to him after days of begging for him to contact me then I just deleted it because I’m honestly not really done..I just don’t know anymore. Back on day 1 of no contact again..  All I have to say anymore to you is I’m just done. Whenever you decide to pop back up and try to reconnect or whatever don’t even attempt. You’ve literally caused me enough pain in the time I’ve known you. If you actually truly gave two shits about me or our baby you wouldn’t of put me through half the shit you have. Next time I won’t be sitting around waiting for you to come back. You’ve left me no other choice but to actually move on. I’m not going to continue to be the only one that seems to care about the other. If anything you doing this to me and ignoring me for days on end knowing I want to try and talk to you just makes me care so much less about you.    It’s truly funny how you think I can just move past so many things after all the damaged you’ve caused me without even attempt to fix what you broke. Sure I’ll take all the blame for what I’ve done wrong and I’ll deal with the consequences of my actions but I sure as hell know this isn’t what I deserve whatsoever. At this point I don’t even wish anything bad on you. If anything I honestly wish maybe one day you will wake up and realize what you have but I don’t think you can even comprehend that type of love. You’ve left me on my own to take care of our kid and it’s probably one thing I will never be able to forgive you for. I may have kicked you out of my house but you decided to leave for good even after I begged for you back to the point where I was puking my guts out.   I stayed loyal to you even after you left me when I didn’t even have to. I wanted a lot of things with you and I tried my hardest to fix what we both had broken. Can you actually sit there and say you’ve tried your hardest to make up for all your wrong doings? Because to me honest to God you really haven’t. If anything you just expect me to get over it and move on from the past. So many times I just looked stupid trying to win back you after you were the one who did me wrong. Maybe you enjoyed me chasing you..maybe you enjoyed knowing that no matter what you did I would always come back running to you..most people would call me weak or a fool for wanting to be with someone who didn’t appreciate my love..but you know what I truly don’t give a shit because at the end of the day I know that I did everything I could to try and make things okay.    I don’t enjoy constantly wondering why I’m not enough..I don’t enjoy trying to find reasons as to why you aren’t here right now. I don’t enjoy thinking of all the ways you’ve hurt me. I don’t enjoy the anger or pain in my body. If anything I try to mask all the awful times with you by the good times..but I’m done trying to avoid reality by living in fantasy world. You were never really truly happy with me. I was never really truly  happy with you. We both want really different things in life and I obviously can’t give you what you want or need. All I ever wanted was to be loved by you but you never really knew how and it’s okay.   I never deserved to be cheated on so many times. I never deserved to be left on my own while carrying our child. I never deserved to be betrayed by your mother. I never deserved to be treated like shit by Ms.CC and your dad. I never deserved to be ganged up on, talked down, and kicked out when I didn’t even do what you said I did. I never deserved to have to constantly question why I wasn’t pretty enough or good enough for you. I never deserved to be constantly lied to. I never deserved to not be told I love you after months of being together. I never deserved so many things.   All I wanted from you throughout all this time was just an apology after you hurt me but I never really got one from you for any of it. I don’t even really want one at this point because you won’t even really truly mean it. You just want to leave all the wrong you’ve done in the past..but that’s fine I’m done carrying all the pain with me. I never got the apology I wanted but I’m going to choose to forgive you anyways. As for everything I’ve done wrong to you. For things I may not even be aware of that hurt you. I’m sorry. For the things I am aware of like breaking your glasses and you not being able to see for a whole day. For getting you kicked out. For hitting you a few times and everything else I’m sorry.   I just need to move past this chapter in my life. Even if I don’t really want to. I know it’s probably best for myself, the baby, and honestly for you as well. Even though you’ve literally caused me more pain then any other asshole I’ve met in my life. I don’t regret ever meeting you or all the time we did have together. I felt something for your dumbass the first night I started messaging you on Tinder. You made me happy when I didn’t think that kind of happiness existed. I enjoyed the little life we made together in our apartment even though it was full of chaos I will miss it. As for our baby I can’t really say anything other than I hope you decide to be in his life somehow. If you want to be here for him I won’t stop you. I won’t let my anger or feelings towards you let him miss out on having a father. I honestly hope you get your life on track not only for yourself but for him as well. I’ve always hoped the best for you and  will continue to do so...take care.

Every single day I fall deeper into depression, and the advice I'm given just makes me even more upset. I'm depressed because I don't have any meaningful relationships and I never have. I was bullied all throughout school starting at 9, and the only think I was told was that, "it will get better."..... I was bullied all the way up to the last day of school and it never stopped. When everyone was starting to experiment with dating I was alone and told, "just be confident." I've had 2 girlfriends that both cheated on me, and I currently get rejected, ghosted, and treated like Jason with a chainsaw while all my, "friends" jump from relationship to relationship.   Now as am adult no one can figure out whats wrong with me and everyone thinks I'm fine. I'm told to just focus on my education and questioned about why my degree or my savings don't make me happy. I'm a film student so follow along with me for a second: lets just say hypothetically I make a blockbuster hollywood movie that everyone loves and I get rich......I still wouldn't be happy.  I wouldn't be happy because I just want a meaningful connection with someone. I'm tired of playing games with, "friends" and having to listen to them talk about how much they love their SO. I'm tired of being called names and told I only want sex when I ask for advice or look for help. I'm tired of someone acting interested only to hide when they see me walking towards them.  Would you be happy if every day you felt like a monster trying to fit in with normal people?

Haha  I’m a stupid fucking idiot and I can’t do anything right. I love alienating myself and burning bridges of the the people that actually care for me the most. Don’t have any friends, work a shitty job, barely make rent every month and I can’t even afford school. I’m a fucking waste of space and I haven’t lived up to any of the expectations that people (my parents) had for me. Just kept fucking up time and time again. God I swear I think I’m a masochist sometimes because I keep doing things I objectively know are bad for me but what the fuck do I care. I am an adult and should know better but here I am. Haven’t had a successful relationship in almost 4 years and every relationship I have I blow up because I know in my heart I’m not good enough for these people I trick into caring about me — that I’m just going to drag them down to my shitty level. I’m a fucking piece of shit that has somehow convinced itself that I’m not a piece of shit and that people fucking like me. Haven’t left my room in two weeks because why bother other people with the burden that is me? When I can just stay in my room and not bother anyone. I’m bad at everything and I can’t 𝘥𝘰 anything the way I think I can. I’m glad I don’t have the confidence I had when I was 18 bc it’s easier to live life knowing you’re a fuck up rather than fooling yourself that you’re the shit. The one relationship that I had that I thought was going to last I fucking ENDED because I kept telling myself that I wasn’t good enough for her and then I tried to bring her down for thanksgiving and when I told my friends they all told me I was rushing into things and I had a panic attack like I always do and ended the relationship not two days after telling my loved ones I was bringing a significant other home for the holidays. Even my dad was skeptical about it and he has always supported my relationship endeavors. Everyone around me has successful lives and I am just a thorn in everyone’s sides. I realized that 𝘐 was the fuckup friend in high school that everyone had to coddle along to make sure they didn’t kill themselves. And I somehow managed to convince myself it was the other way around. I have cheated in every single goddamn relationship I’ve been in and for what?? To undeserving women that only had their heart to give to me?? I was so scared I did cowardly things to affirm it? I’m such a piece of shit. Life keeps affirming to me that I am nothing and will always be nothing. And the worst part is is that I don’t even deserve to have these feelings. There are people out there with actual hard lives and I’m so privileged that I get to whine about how I don’t meet anyone’s expectations. It’s almost selfish for me to have these feelings, which makes me feel even shittier. Horrible negative feedback loop. I’ll stick my Dick into anything that has a heartbeat because I can’t stand to be alone with my own thoughts. Don’t even remember half of the people I’ve slept with. Just so that I can feel better about myself. I pretend to be the person I wish I was so that they think that’s who I am and then I fuck them and leave. I’m a piece of goddamn trash yet I try so hard to keep this veneer of an upstanding person because heaven forbid the world finds out that sadboiultra is literal human garbage. I just want to not be here.  I just want the constant pain to go away. I don’t even know why I am hurting which makes me even angrier, more confused. Fuck me, right?
\*hug\* Life is rough, but if you want to talk to me, go ahead and rant all you want. it seems to me that some of the worst luck can make the best people, and you're one of them. DOn't give up :)
I hear you. I know everybody's story is different and you can't compare people, but I think you can get inspiration from stories that resonate with you. With that being said, it can be hard to step away from the spiral of dwelling in what has gone wrong and what you've done in the past. I've had those days and honestly, my conclusion thus far has been that we are humans, and we are always going to have emotions, but you and your emotions are separate.   At least that's what I've learned from reading the book "The Power of Now". It helped me put into perspective all the negative thoughts I've had similar. Like you said you keep telling yourself these like you weren't good enough before things could even roll out on their own.   I can relate, I sometimes have caught myself sabotaging myself, but I've noticed that if you can tell your "mind"/emotion it's okay and get through the tough moments of maybe being vulnerable and going through talks with girls or friends depending on the situations, things may turn out better than you expect. Most of the time we just assume the worst.   We are all humans, and we make mistakes, i don't mean to sound cliche but it's true. I would say don't worry about what you've done, or what perceptions people have about you from the past, simply go forward with positive affirmations, "i got this", I am worthy, I will be happy, and enjoy walks on sunny days, sit in the park, enjoy the birds flying around and find your happy place. That is what has helped me, and negative thoughts won't go right away, you need to catch yourself thinking/feeling it and just let it pass without affecting you.  Also don't feel bad for feeling this, your emotions are valid. Observe them and what helps me is journaling or drawing. Any way to channel my energy, when im mad or annoyed and I journal the feelings don't seem so big. Have you tried journaling? Join some online groups, or a community where you can explore your hobbies and people are quite friendly, even on reddit, or Instagram. What hobbies do you like that maybe you left behind?  Sorry This ended up being longer than i thought it would be.

I been depressed since I was young kid and haven’t told anyone. My coping mechanism includes smoking tree, watching porn & jacking off everyday, staying isolated, and constantly having thoughts of suicide. The pandemic has made it worse and I don’t know to live with myself anymore. My dating and social life has been on a large decline which has gave me more of a reason to hate myself. I came on this forum for privacy and to remain anonymous. But I just needed to vent and let somebody know before I off myself.
I used to be in a similar place. You need to discover your hidden feelings and thoughts in your unconscious and find a sense of having a place in this world. It's a slow and painful process but everyone can get there.

As funny as they are, it's always me at the end of every joke. Mugs being sent in the group chat? All mine from a few years ago. An account being made on IG to take the piss out of someone? You bet that's about me. It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't tell me I couldn't take a joke every time I complained about it - I don't even if I can take a joke or not at this point.  I've done so much cringy shit in my life that I can't help but feel as if I deserve all of the jokes and everything that I'm getting, even if I hate it. They take the piss out of everything of mine, from my accent to my gullibility and my all round personality, but I don't even really blame them. Even if it feels like I'm being pushed around by them, it could be worse.  Being the least funny, the least charismatic and the most anxious out of all of them doesn't really help me either. I just want to be a completely different person entirely, and I probably would be if I wasn't an impulsive dumbfuck who can't get their words out properly.   I definitely can't go to them and talk about it, it would just be adding more fuel to the fire. At the same time though, I don't want to feel like I'm just using people as emotional sponges either and give them more to worry about than what they need. I don't even know what I need at the moment. I just want someone I can open up to.

When I was 18, I had my first panic attack because I took a few moments to envision my life plans. I’m 22 now and can still vividly recall exactly what I saw for myself. I saw myself at age 40, in a small apartment by myself (with fluorescent lights, definitely the worst part) and I was deeply, deeply unhappy. What sent me into a full panic attack was the fear that I would feel so helpless and alone that eventually I wouldn’t be able to handle it.  Since then, I have refused to let myself think about the future, even when I am mentally well. It never ends well for me. But as I am approaching adulthood, it is starting to have some consequences. Like I am refusing to actively search for jobs in my field because it is a reminder that the future potentially exists. Does anyone relate or have advice?

Let me give you some back story. When I was young I was placed in home school and had been in it until I ended up in middle school. From there I found my self being alot less social then I was before.  Fast forward to present day I feel a strange disconnect from my peers. I look around at people my age or older and I see how they act. I feel as if I'm alien towards them. Whenever I'm in a conversation I can't seem to connect to the topics of modern age. It's like im in my own confusing world trapped in a endless collection of thoughts and idea. With this I also feel like this life is just a worthless transition of existence. I don't even find myself feeling any type of inner emotion towards major changes within my life. Is something wrong with me?

So I am pretty sure I have an eating disorder. I was talking to other people on a Facebook group and apparently I’m not the only one who gets a sort of high after going without food for a certain period of time and that it’s also (apparently) addictive.  I went without food for three days last week and the euphoria was amazing. I felt so calm and at peace, even if things were a little hazy and blurred until I caved and had food. I really want to experience that again and I’m a little scared. I don’t know what I should do. I want to be cute/handsome and valid by losing weight but I’m afraid at some point it’s going to cause problems.
Same ... We need therapy (if it works ) , my bmi is like 14, I'm 175 cm and only 100 lbs . My advice to you is get therapy. I've never gotten (cuz it's too expensive) but I think it's the best option
I don't get a high from not eating, but depression does cause me not to eat. From experience, I can tell you that not eating for long stretches of time can cause problems. I ended up in the hospital about a decade ago with gall stones and had to have my gall bladder removed. Doctor told me it was likely due to the long stretches I was going without eating.
Yeah no I can’t afford therapy especially when I’m trying to save money

Days are passing so long. I hardly falls asleep and once I'm wake up time is passing like a slow motion, I'm hoping that finałowy someone will accept my application for that boring job, that finally covid scam will be coming to an end. Every hour I think about howm much of a loser I am, how much I want to die. There's no hope for me.
There is always hope. I know that a day can feel like eternity but I realized if I stay busy days can go by so fast. Maybe a job would be good for u cause it would make time move faster.
Not sure what you're thinking by saying covid is a scam
That lockdowns are not doing anything good, they are only making things way worse. That media brainwashed people.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzys56/i_just_dont_function_anymore/
Hey, everyone, this is my first post and I'm writing this down because I hope to find people who can relate to what I'm going through right now. So for a while, 6 months I think, my condition has become worse and worse. What I mean by this is, that I've begun to lose my motivation for doing stuff for school, for cooking myself healthy meals, and even practicing personal hygiene. I stopped coaxing myself to do sports. 6 months ago I was overweight, now I'm on my way to become obese. I feel like I could eat all day only crap food (I'm too lazy to cook). At the same time, my sleeping habits have become unusual (like my eating habits). 6 months ago I went to bed around 9 PM-now I fall asleep at midnight. I think about doing stuff for school but most of the time my thoughts don't lead to actions. I've become indifferent to meeting deadlines that our teachers set up. Every morning when I wake up, I turn the TV on. Not for watching but only for hearing something-to feel like there's something going on. The worst thing about this whole thing is that this condition is not permanent, sometimes I get a little bit of motivation(most of the time after I had human interactions), but that motivation doesn't last for long. These ups and downs make it even harder to bear because I feel more guilty about not being able to function the way I used to. I sometimes also cry but I usually don't know why. Of course, I hide in my room when I let my emotions out so that my mom won't be able to notice it because I'm afraid, she might ask why I was crying and I wouldn't be able to give her an answer. So if she doesn't notice, she can't tell me that I have no reason to cry.  If you have similar problems, I'd be very thankful, If you'd tell me how you cope with them!
You need to find a sense of purpose. Look inside yourself - everyone has unique traits and stuff in their unconscious - you just have to find them.
yeah i have the same issue, just a little worse. i don't have any motivation at all. how do i cope? i don't, just pretend it isn't an issue and continue to watch things spiral weeeeee

Sorry if this is kind of a long read and I feel bad saying this cause this sounds really selfish. I mean I understand that everyone has their own things they gotta manage, and the pandemic certainly isn’t helping things. It’s just that it’s becoming so hard to maintain personal connections with those who aren’t anywhere near me. Even if it’s not true, it feels like they want nothing to do with me.  I’m a first year college student, and in my area it’s definitely not a safe decision to be on campus, so I’ve pretty much been stuck at home with my parents for this & last semester. So being in essentially one room all day, every day, for almost I can’t even remember how many months, that stuff really affects your mental state. For the record though I’m completely thankful for what my parents have done for me so far.  But anyway I only really have one or two close friends at this point. If I try to text someone else just to see what’s up & how they’re holding up, I either get no response, get left on read with no response, or they just constantly say they can’t talk right now. I get it, people are busy, but there becomes a point where it  seems they don’t want anything to do with me. Cause as far as I know, they’re certainly active with their other friends on Instagram or whatever.   And not being in-person for college is  just not good because of how difficult it is to meet people. Even if we have a groupchat for a class or something, it’s not exactly the most active thing in the world. I don’t know, I guess the loneliness and isolation is really catching up to me. I thought I could handle this, but it’s just getting to be too much. In any case though I’m sure other people feel this way, so I’m sorry for making you read four paragraphs of me rambling.

It's been a week now since I started my unpaid internship (i'm 21yo) The first few days I suffered from anxiety and I had my first panic attack, but then with the days the situation improved little by little. I thought I finally got used to it but instead here I am again here, again asking myself why I still go on in this meaningless life, without a future in a society without true values. I am just a small and useless gear in an even more useless and stupid machine, right?   What keeps you going on?  I wouldn't even be able to kill myself, I don't want to hurt the few people around me... I hate this shit
I used to feel the same way. I sometimes get anxiety from work too. Everyone deals with their issues differently. What I will advice you to do is tell your employer about your struggles. I'm sure they'll agree, that what you do helps the company a lot and that you are valued. Because you are. I'm sure your family and friends will agree if you let them no. But it's also important to take breaks. Breathe and do whatever you feel like. I assure you it will get better but you don't have to fight on your own.
Thanks, i know it in a way but my brain says different at night and i don't know why.

Hi, I'm from Argentina and on my 1st year of career, 'cause I lived A LOT of bad situations in my life, and now at my middle 22's I can return to college for my 5 years of duration career. I'm really depressed, thinking about suicide myself with a .22LR gun I have from my grandpa, and anxious (I waste all my days in my mind thinking about my problems, doing nothing, complaining to my friends and my friends are enough with my shit). I'm really really frustrated for my actual situation with no girlfriend, no job, no good situation in my career, a lot of fucked up familiar problems and so... I get really mad with myself by an experience with an ex member of my class in high school, I've tried to flirth with her on IG, but she's on her's 3rd year of career and working harder in a full time job, so I was in my mind thinking than I was doing well but... try that.. puts me soooo down... she was not interested on my obviously 'cause I'm... I'm nothing... I'm a dump, dumb, blind, I didn't deserve a girlfriend and less a girlfriend like her, she didn't let me meet her now. So... I'm devastated, in ruins, my heart is broke and I'm poor, I want to became a professional in the future but I'm really fucked up in every shape and form.      I was so frustrated in this days than I'm in my mind thinking about develop my appearance the most I can with the not much money I have, to get some new stuffs to dress and have a haircut (I'm with my long hair like Kurt Cobain, but getting bald and obviously not rough, I'm more like an indigenous dude, I'm ugly). The few friends I have are trying to do their best with me because they can notice I'm a hidden suicidal guy and.. I'm so lonely.. 'cause today I've found my friends.. they're in my head.. I'm so ugly... but that's okay, 'cause so are not you, broken mirrors. Tbh I'm a 80% sure I'm going to kill myself soon, 'cause I'm an autistic adult and I waste too much time, really much time, inside my home in my depression and now I'm really frustrated with myself and all. I hurt ppl in the past and now in social medias by my non self confidence and antisocial disorder. I delete FB, IG, and also I created accounts again with 1 or 2 followers for now. What should I do? I'm doing right? I'm in time to create a new life for myself? I'm a bad person?

TW: s*ic*de   I (24) have been drowning. I had been planning on revoking my subscription to life when I woke up but someone had texted me so I put that on hold so I wouldn’t be rude. Is that normal? Does that mean I’m not actually depressed? I feel like I’m faking when I do things like that which makes the dip even worse. So I’m drowning   *u, i
Your suffering is entirely real. You deserve a happier life.
dude dont do there is always someone who loves you get help ok
It's totally normal man. Depression and suicidal thoughts can be just as unique as the people who have them. For example, you can be totally, legitimately happy for weeks at a time and then just have depression punch you in the face out of nowhere ... it doesn't mean your depression isn't real, it just means it's manifesting in a different way. Have you ever heard of "referred pain"? It's when your brain mixes up pain signals, so it could make your hand hurt even if it's your foot that's wounded. Depression can be like that too. The brain is a weird place.
Thank you. It’s so hard to feel like I deserve better especially when I get into the loop of am I ill or am I faking
Yes. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist soon and I’m going to talk to him about putting me back on my anti depressant. I still don’t understand why he took me off of it considering that when I have bad downward swings into my depressive episodes it almost puts my life on pause
I’ve really never thought of it like that before. That actually helps me put the struggle more into perspective for me. And it’s nice to have words to describe it and things to compare it to now. Thank you! It helps to know others understand and that I’m not crazy

Hi, how is everyone doing? Little bit about my situation... I'm not the person with depression it's more of my little sister. I really want to help her but I have no idea what to do or where to turn. Ive tried researching online to see what my options are but ultimately none of the things they say has really helped her. So I'm turning to reddit in hopes that someone can give me some advice.  She's about to turn 14. I've noticed that her behaviour has changed alot when she was around 12. This is when our dad left and we had to move houses ( from a large house in a nice area to a significantly smaller place in a bad area). At first I thought it was just a transitional period and that she would get over it. But as time went on I could see the joy in her slowly fading away. I took her to the doctors and she was diagnosed with depression and is on some medication for it. Which has helped a little but I really just miss my happy little sister and would do anything to get her back.  So the main reason for me writing this is to ask people who have had/have depression or even just know about it, what can I do to support her and ultimately help her get back on her feet.  Thank you for reading this in advance and I'm looking forward to any help that I can get 😊
It's really awesome that you want to help your little sister. Seriously, there are so many people on this sub who have no one at all, so it's heartwarming to see someone who actually cares.  My advice would be to talk to your sister directly. What does she want/need from you? She might not have the greatest insight into her emotions (not only because of her age but also because depression can really fuck with your perception of things) but I bet she can tell you what does/doesn't make her happy, what makes her feel worse, and so on. For example, she might like spending time with you to feel less alone... *or* she might actually like time alone, and trying to force "bonding time" on her will only make her feel worse. You won't know unless you ask her directly. Everyone's different.  Another thing I'd suggest is to not say things like "I just miss my happy little sister." I know you mean well, but that can put pressure/expectation on her to get better, which can lead to even gloomier feelings of failure and depression if she can't live up to that ideal.  Basically, just ... love her. Listen to her. Offer help in whatever ways she's willing to accept. Also, accept *her*, depression and all. Don't make her feel like she has to be a happy little girl to deserve your love.  Good luck man. I think you're a good hearted person. Your sister's lucky to have you.

Tell me your thoughts on this
I used to take DXM years ago as well and I smoke weed everyday usually. I also tried a bunch of other drugs for "avoiding depression". But for me it is just that: Not curing depression, just avoiding it. I needed to realise that drugs are just making it better in the short term and worse in the long term.  Rn I try to stay sober somehow, which is easier done than said. But I feel that especially weed keeps me in a state of lethargy. My thoughts get number and less depressive for a while, but in the end of the day it just makes me more depressive, cause again nothing was done and I again just smoked weed.   Also drugs in general have an impact on how you think and feel of course and allthough it might make you feel good for now, that might change after months of using them. Than you are in a stuck state. You can't really go on without the drugs, but you will probably realise also it would help most to quit them.  That beeing said: I totally get why you try to "help" yourself with drugs, but be careful. It might just get a lot worse.

Hi guys,  I've finally showered today and i'm wondering is there a special app that I can use to track things like this (showering, eating, socializing etc). I think it would be helpful to me to see my progress. Can you recommend something?  I like MindDoc (former MoodPath) for tracking my general mood, but now I'm searching for something different.  Thanks!
I must admit i would also like to know if anyone has found this. Maybe somesort of daily journal tracker or something
I think there was something like that as an app for android at least. You typed in what you wanted to be done on what point of the day and the app would remind you and also "reward" you, if you haven't forogot. It wasn't specialised on depression, but bascially the same functionality you wish for.  Sadly I can't remember the name anymore. If i find it, I will add the name here.

I work at a small business and in September everything went to shit and my two favorite coworkers who happened to be my managers were fired. I’m only 17 so keep that in mind. I wanted to text them immediately and say thank you for making work amazing and being patient with me. Sadly, I didn’t think I had their numbers.  In November one of them texted me (they’re married).   Now. I really really want to thank her husband. Two weeks before he was fired, he unknowingly saved my life. He had no clue what was going on but he knew I wasn’t ok and he made me feel better as I was losing my shit outside. He gave me this stupid rock that his wife drew on that said “be happy” and hid outside. When he had a bad day she’d send him to go look for this rock and he’d be looking for happiness. Not knowing what was happening or why, but knowing I was not ok, he was there for me. He talked and made me feel better and insisted I take it home. He was always there to encourage me and he was so patient. He’s a father figure to me when my dad lives hours away. He encouraged me to chase my dreams and cried when I got into my dream school. But he doesn’t know how important all of that was to me or that the day he gave me that damn rock he saved my life. If he hadn’t had given me that I would not be alive today.   I want to thank him for everything. I could ask his wife for his number or their address? But also is it even appropriate for me to send him anything?   I also need to thank his wife. She did a lot too, but nothing like that. I’ve been thinking about this since they got fired too. I just really want to thank him for saving me and giving me a chance, y’know? But how do I say thank you in the best way possible??
just be straight forawrd tell the wife what he did and ask what he likes and if you can get him something or like send him a letter ect
I think you could write them a letter, mentioning some of the things you've said here. Genuine words of thanks go very far. Maybe you could make and send them some more rocks with positive messages to help them feel good in these difficult times? Or a "thank you" rock? I'm sure they would be appreciative of any small gesture or token you gave them.
Honestly maybe write them a letter. I  over the years have got  letters from a few people i've save and Honestly It's alway's impacted me . bringing me to tears. changing one life can ignite a chain reaction to continue supporting others . I know all to well  that for some people time is of the essence. also one of the best gifts you can give them is being kind and if you see someone doing it tough many reflect what he gave you
Omg that’s an amazing idea! Do you think I should just explain to the wife that I want to send them a letter? I think they love the rocks. Thank you so much
Yeah, you should ask her if she could give you their mailing address. Tell her  you want to send them something as thanks for being good managers and role models to you.
I think I can do that! Thank you for your help! :)
Sure thing, I hope it works well!

This is what’s going on in my (22F) life (I’m sorry it’s long):  I have a job as a carer of an old lady and it doesn’t make me feel like I’m doing something with my life or for the world. It’s only four hours a day and it’s so easy I can’t keep my mind from thinking.  I didn’t go to uni, but I want to do a project management apprenticeship as soon as I get a laptop but it won’t be possible until at least March when I can afford it.  I have a long distance relationship but he has a happy, busy life so we only talk late at night. I live alone and have no friends because I’m new in the city (South West of England) and with all these lockdowns it’s impossible.  My family lives in another country.  I have no one here, and I feel like I have no purpose in life.  But the curious thing is that I know my life is not really bad, but I’ve got too much free time, no one around and I feel so lonely that I can’t bring myself to stop feeling so miserable. I’m so tired of this, I can’t even eat because anxiety is eating me from inside. I’ve been throwing up lately but I can’t make myself have proper meals and more than once a day.  Any advice? I don’t know what to do and I’m so frustrated with myself because I feel like I could be all right if my city just wasn’t on lockdown and I could try to socialise, or if I felt my life had some meaning. I’m tired of feeling like this, I can’t live like this, I’m just crying all the time.
Everyone has unique creative energies. What do you create in your mind that you can communicate to others? Even if that's just by talking.
Firstly, thank you for sharing. The first hurdle is always to admit you need help.     You said you're family live in another country, I don't know if you get on with them but if you do, try and talk to them as much as possible. It's great you have a relationship, try and talk to him and see if you can speak more than just at night. Also, remember you have something to look forward to because you speak to him at the end of your day.     Because you in a new city and being in lockdown isn't helping, I would try and find some groups online with people who live in your city. Find something that you enjoy online or at least speak about online like a book group for example. Then hopefully you can meet some like-minded people and when the lockdown is over you can meet them in person and start making friends.     Find something you love to do, that you can do inside of course and focus all your energy into that. A lot of problems stem from people being bored and overthinking so the best thing to do is a distraction. Also, try and find someone you can speak to and just unload on when you're feeling down.     I would suggest as well to listening to some uplifting podcasts or youtube channels because these can help you.     I hope this helps :)
This might sound random, but have you considered volunteer work? A lot of opportunities are virtual these days. If you feel like you don't have a purpose or aren't making any real impact on the world, helping others might give you some meaning and satisfaction in your life. (As a bonus, it can also help you feel connected to other human beings even during lockdowns lol.)
Thank you very much for taking your time to read my port and reply. I feel so silly because I don’t really understand the question :’) You mean, how can I communicate to others how I feel?
Yeah and anything creative you can think.

First time poster.....  So on Friday night my world collapsed. I was arrested for something that I’m not going to go into on here. I’ve never been in trouble before, so this was a very difficult evening. I was questioned, and all electronic devices ( apart from what I am typing this on as this is brand new) were taken from my home. Including my boys devices and my work stuff.  When I got back at 2am on Saturday, my wife wanted to know everything.... I told her everything. She has since moved her and our son to her parents. When she told me “I have lost my best friend” that cut into me so hard.  I have never been emotional....preferring to bottle stuff up.  There is a chance I will go to prison (although this is a first offence, and if it goes to court I will plead guilty).   I’m not eating much, neither if my wife. Our son knows the police took me away, and that they have his devices, but we haven’t told him anything else yet.  My wife acknowledges I am a good dad, and that she will never take him away from me, but I feel I have lost EVERYTHING.... my home, my family, any respect. Up until this stupid mistake we were a happy family. I still don’t know why I did it.  This is likely to drag on for months till I get any indication of an outcome.  My wife has confirmed I am worth more dead than alive.... and I have to agree with her. The house would be paid off, and she would end up with a lump sum of around £100k.  I have explored my options, and looked at how I would do it. But the thought of leaving my son is so far stopping me..... but part of me acknowledges I have already lost him.  My wife has also said that if I go to prison she will claim full custody of him.  My father was a dick, and I guess history is repeating itself.  When I spoke to my wife yesterday, she basically said we are over either way.... which has crushed me. So much for “for better or for worse” in our vows. I also told her that it’s not the first time I have thought of ending it.... before her I had seriously thought of it.  The last 10 years of marriage and 14 years of knowing her all over in a moment.  I have spoke to my boss this morning, and I have a couple of days off sick.
Like you said, you fucked up. You gotta look at what you can do from here because a piss poor mindset won’t help. If you have to start from ground zero then do it, the best advice I have to give is self responsibility. Think of your son, do you want to see him when he gets older, if so deal with your shit and start from here, even if you go to prison it’s not the end.
thing is some people who do certain crime's have an issues. Addiction, greed , etc . can be a huge issue  in it's self . Everyone does something in their life that's dumb.  some worse than other's .  Also don't think your worth more dead . the mental scar losing a parent to suicide is a ever lasting cycle that I have seen destroy so many people . even if you go to prison . I hope you get help . Take responsibility And try work out what brought you to that place
But will he want to see me? I didn’t see my dad from when I was about 10.... and I never went to his funeral 3years ago.
I know.... which is why I haven’t done anything yet.... but I can’t help thinking that they would still have a home if I was gone. With me around we will have nothing.
Absolutely, everyone wants a father no matter what. If you’re dad was a bad person, it doesn’t mean you have to be. Even if you do miss some time of your son’s life, showing up when you can shows how much you care.
it may seem tough but whatever issue brought u to this point get help  <3

Today was a good day, I laughed and made my friends laugh, we went out downtown and ate donuts, we walked around the city and looked at the monuments, pretending to know everything about them. I was the most annoying ahole ever. They're not my friends, they don't care about me, I'm just a waste of their time, I need to stay away from them and leave them alone. Everything was just painful, everything I say, just tell me to shut up and I will. And that's the only thing I've done since new year. No work, no studying, I have no more future, everyone is so nice and I fuck up everything. I shouted at my dumbass dad and insulted him for the second time in my life, I broke stuff and shouted as loud as I could, my parents finally realized that I'm a failure.  I'm not asking for nice little words of support, I've failed my life that's all, just accept it, just listen to me I'm tired of people saying I have a future and that I'm intelligent and blabla  I don't have depression, I'm sorry if this is not the right place for my garbage.
Listen, you're not what you think you are!! You are a beautiful person with a bright future!! You have friends. You have us!! You're not a waste of time and I definitely will not tell you to shut up!! Life is a test and we will only succeed if we have faith and hope!! This is not garbage. You just needed to get this off your chest, and I'm glad you did!! You're a beautiful person and I hope you have a lovely day!! If you ever need anything, I'm always here for you!! 💕💕💖💖❤❤

I'm a male and every time i go out and try to get past my social anxiety i just get thrown out of a conversation and if I'm stay i get harassed to hell and back. My family just doesn't say anything nice about me and i just want a compliment. Also i really want someone to love me. I try to go into a relationship that i don't force myself into. I want her to hug me, cuddle, kiss, or anything that signifies love and i wanna do the same. But it seems like I'm a burden to my family and everyone. I should just hide away.
I'd give u a hug if I could. Does that help?
Hi friend I am sure you are very lovely and I am sorry that your family can not say that to you. Sometimes the people closest to us don’t even know how to love us the way we want to be loved
Have a brofist, or a high five, or a hug, or anything and everything you want. From one dude with social anxiety to another. It seems like you describe me, so I feel you. I couldn't put it into words myself. I am bad with conversations too. I'm fine with individuals but not fine with groups of those individuals. Weird. It's like if I had that special someone, I could talk easily with her and she would understand. That day will come though, we will find love, we will find happiness; we will realize our families loved us all along. One day, we won't need to hide away, because we will be with people that will want to see us. I'm hanging onto that hope, and there is a lot of space here for you or anyone to hang onto it the same.
Hi friend it's okay I know what you're going through and I can't promise anything but stay strong for both our sakes
Hello! You seem like an honest person going through a hard time. I wish the very best for you. Life is wierd and often difficult. Keep going on! Fist bump
Have a virtual high five✋. Hang in there buddy. Whatever you are going through, at least you recognise it and you made a brave step by speaking about it. Be open to it and goodness will find you. Peace.
Are you a Ravens fan?
Also take ma hug buddy!

It gets better dude, a true family isn’t the one by blood but the one by choice.
You aren't a burden and you are a much, much more valuable person than you realise. You are important, your mental health is important and you deserve to be happy :) I really hope you have an amazing life because you deserve it... You are an awesome and amazing human :))
I read through your post and all the comments and I just have one compliment to give and it’s the most important, you’ve been holding on for 7 years you said but that’s it right there all of these things and 7 years later you are still here, so you’re a whole lot stronger then you are giving yourself credit for, you will find those people who care I promise whether it’s irl or online it doesn’t matter just finding people who cares is what matters. But I believe in you you are strong ❤️
Yeah it would help a lot.
Yeah and they just say that i need to just die in a mental facility.
Thank you. I just wish there where more people like y'all.
I've been staying strong for 7 years now i don't know how long i can hold on.
Thank you.
Yea
sorry if that didn’t make much sense, it’s hard to put what i want to say into words. just know you are loved and the people who treat you badly don’t determine your worth. you are worth so much more than what they tell you.
*Virtual hug*
Oh gosh that is so terrible. I’m sorry. It’s hard for people to understand depression and poor mental health if they have not gone it themselves... but we here on this subreddit get how you feel
That's awful :( I'm so sorry.
Thank you! That means a lot more people like you, too!
And that's when you know you're almost done with the suffering because once you can't hold in anymore your brain switchs to a new way to think it's a natural process broken down then brought up
Thanks
Thanks

It seems like no matter how hard I try it just never is good enough

Just venting, maybe hoping for someone who's been through something similar to help me out of this rut.   In January 2020, I moved across the country for what I thought would be a relatively short amount of time (6 months) to work temporarily for a non-profit. I ended up meeting my current partner, and about a month and a half in, we became very serious. I'm not the type of person to bond so quickly with someone, but it just felt right and we get along so well together. About a month later COVID hit, my job went online, and we decided it would be best to move in together. Almost a year later, we are still sharing an apartment on a split lease and for the most part, our relationship is great.  However, I have not been feeling like myself for a very long time and am worried I am losing track of my life. I have been only working temporary or freelance jobs since my non-profit job ended, and am not moving forward with any long term goals except for the relationship.   Maybe because of this, I have stopped responded to text messages or any kind of communication from friends I knew across the country, maybe because I feel like I have nothing to share with them that is positive about my life or future. No matter how hard I try, I just cannot keep up a long-term communication with anyone, and I don't really know why. I'm not interested in what I used to be interested in, heck, I can't even listen to music anymore (something I used to do 24/7) without breaking into tears.  I am so depressed most days that I just stay at home, which I guess makes sense since COVID cases in my county are skyrocketing. I just don't feel like doing anything anymore. I have no desire or even hope for a career, and every day just feels like it drags on. I don't want to leave my partner, but I fear I may be holding myself back by staying here where I know no one but him.

Everyday I wake up I hate myself for waking up and not just dying in my sleep. Each day seems harder and harder to survive and make it through. And I don't even have a solid reason for feeling this way. I have the "perfect" life. I have an amazing family, a good friend group, I am conventionally attractive, I am successful in academia - but I hate myself more than anything else. I almost feel guilty for even being alive. I often find myself thinking how other people would deserve my life a lot more than me. I feel like all the other people who have it much harder than me should be given my life instead because I simply don't deserve this life. I don't feel worthy of anything. And I just want to stop existing. I wish I could delete my entire existence because I don't want my family to suffer if I were to just kill myself.  It upsets me so much that I don't even have a reason to be depressed and so many people have it way worse than me and they still enjoy life. But I simply can not keep going like this. I don't see my mental health getting better any time soon..it keeps getting worse and I am afraid of the future. And I am only 20 years old. I don't know how to keep going I feel as if there would be stones placed on my back that make standing up and being happy impossible. I don't know how to explain it. I don't even feel anything anymore. I can not enjoy things, I am too tired to cry, I just feel as if my body is an empty case.

At least I know how much I’m actually valued now.
If he can't communicate his problem clearly and is name calling. He is a piece of shit.
I'm sorry you are going through this. No man should ever speak to his wife that way...
Honestly it does not seem like a healthy relationship . have you talked about couple's counselling? I also get that guy's want to game alot . I  have had to tell so many gaming guys in my crew to go spend time with their other half . Also I wouldn't advise  destroying his stuff  or like some other guy said "kill him"  you don't need to end up in court  and your child need's it's mother. I honestly hope you invest time to value your self . your a parent and it's a tough time expecially when your kids are young <3 stay strong
Would like to hear his side. Just because you put what he said on here doesn't mean it isn't or is justified.   You could have called him worse or done worse. One sided story you're giving.
Stop talking to him for some time to express ur anger and make him understand that calling you names is not okay
I don’t know you, but I just wanted to wish you a good day, month, and year. I’m not in a good place myself, so I don’t know what to say, but I can at least wish you the best. Take care ❤️
Im a man and just wanted to give you a piece of advice:just kill him.
Never speak out of emotion. In turn you'd have to consider that with your SO as well. I'm sure you do it too. Nevertheless, speaking out your ass due to anger is one thing, CONSTANTLY being talked down to, berated, verbally abused or threatened is another. That one is called domestic violence. A relationship worth planning and systematically GTFO of.  Make sure you give plenty of time to distinguish which one you're dealing with. Preferably when both of you have cooled down and with a sense of clarity and judgement.
I’m not going to stoop to his level. He’s had a shitty week and is taking it out on me and it’s just ripping me a new one how poorly he thinks of me. Then wonders why I am not in “the mood@
Yeah he’s done it before, but it was when I wrecked his car. Idk why he thinks it’s okay to do that. I love how he can’t talk about his feelings or emotions but can call me a “subtle Bitch” because I asked him to help me when I was cleaning and to get off his video games so I could pee without a cranky sleepy baby.
I’m not going to kill him 🤦🏼‍♀️ or harm him in any way, or call him names in return. I’m waiting for the emotional maturity to kick in.
Totally get where you’re coming from, I put this in depression not r/justnoso if you want to know more about us and our relationship feel free to see my page. His parents are definitely where his emotional immaturity stems from. I’m actually a very patient and understanding person. I just wanted somewhere safe to get stuff off my chest that hurts. I’m sorry if you think me providing my side of things is in any way offensive. I didn’t record the conversation. All I said was “can you please take a pause off the PC for a sec so I can get some stuff done around the house and our son is taken care of” and he lost it. To be fair he’s been having a shitty start to the year, his parents told him to divorce me or leave them alone basically, which isn’t how anyone should be made to feel by parents. He was present and knows why they dislike me. I had a baby before they wanted to be grandparents, and then I had boundaries in our home and with our child (we live 8 hours (driving) apart and his mother came in 2 weeks after labor for a child she told us we weren’t ready for, telling us how things would be and took my 2 week old son from me. Lets just say. I’ve been patiently sitting in a personal shit show.) but I’m not selfishly putting how it makes me feel on his back and I don’t want to make him feel any worse about that. He is also free to see them anytime so let’s not pull that card, we have agreed me and our son ARENT having anything to do with them until further notice or they actually take accountability for their actions. But anyways about the emotional bits. His dad is very ego bound if he shows emotions he’s “weak” and that’s how he was raised. Anytime his controlling ass mom lost her crap or wasn’t happy with how they preformed in their sports they were grounded and had to “make things right with their mother” she’s very conditional with her feelings, and plays victim and if she’s not driving the boat she’s trying to sink it. Simple as that. All of it is stressful. All of it is overwhelming on top of being parents and trying to hold a marriage afloat. So I don’t care that he was fed up and took it on me. But the words still burn.
Shut the hell up pompous smart ass!  See that? Even if I don't agree with you, respond like that would make me an asshole, no excuses.  If he doesn't like her, he could leave her. Verbal abuse is not something you do to anyone, especially people you"love". Again, no excuses.
The silence is my tool this week.
You take care as well! This year has had some unfortunate bumps, but we are powering through the best we can 💖 I hope the same fore you and your journey!
I don’t think that’s a productive way to get to a resolution. If he keeps acting like this he’s gonna have one less subtle bitch around I guess.
Yes officer. This one right here.
I do not belittle my husband tho, I just ask him to help me out sometimes which his response to most of the time is he’s doing something and that something is PC games. All I said was we weren’t in high school anymore and have responsibilities that he can’t just shove all of them onto me
*sigh* I'm sorry...i really am... I actually thought it was something he suddenly said out of anger but that he's done it before isn't good at all...when was the last time you guys actually talked to each other about your relationship? I used to do that with my wife. Helps alot.
sadly most guys don't realize what they have till it's gone
Sorry the truth offends you white knight  She gave a one sided story. She could cheated, stolen all his money, drove his car off into a lake and so on.  You know nothing as neither do I about this bias story.
I get that you think it’s verbal abuse but he was really just fed up. He has a lot going on. Which isn’t an excuse, he needs to handle his emotions in a more productive matter but it’s only the 2nd time he’s called me a bitch it’s not a daily thing. It just stung and I vented here. Thank you for caring!
yeh then in 10 years he will wonder why he's alone
Removing men from earth is productive way.
We talked about it this morning, we agreed we on the things we both fail at and to work on them and apologize for when we make mistakes. It’s all you can do when healing wounds.
Totally get where you’re coming from I hope a gander at my page and my comment to your first one helps you understand what I meant by the post, and a better understanding of the problems, and why I posted this tiny little vent here. Thank you.
And why his house is a mess, how the wall behind the trash can isn’t clean anymore, find out the toilets arent self cleaning, that the stove tops gets disgusting after cooking & that the dishwasher doesn’t put the dishes up for him daily
My friend, that's a bit extreme.
Too extreme. It’s not a mature way to handle big emotions. I posted here rather than returning the fire and being angry with my husband.

So we were having a family lunch and my parents remembered I haven’t taken my antidepressant yet, and that’s how a interesting conversation begun: Parents: “You haven’t taken your pill yet.” My little cousin: “What pill?”  Parents: “For better health, you know.”  Me, shouting across the whole fucking room because I was by the door by then: “FOR DEPRESSION.”

About a day ago now, I started writing in a diary/journal about the things in my life. Be it good or bad, I just write what’s on my mind and it’s really been helping with my depression so far. I just felt like sharing this since it’s really helped me and maybe some of you guys on here could try it out and hopefully it’ll help you as well :)

I had terrible anxiety during my high school years and it prevented me from getting a girlfriend. So after graduating, I wanted to loose my virginity badly so I saw an escort.. then another 2 times after that. I don’t feel terrible about it but I would prefer it would’ve been someone who actually liked me. Now I’m 22 and still haven’t had a serious relationship. Which makes me depressed everyday. I think I am going to go to a doctor this week to try out either anxiety or depression meds. I do not want to be alone anymore.. but then when I am with someone, I sometimes want to be alone.
One thing I wish I knew when I was younger is to not rush into a relationship. When you’re in a relationship, you’ll want to be single, and when you’re single, you’ll want a relationship. It’s about quality over quantity. I mean yes, experience helps us learn, but don’t rush into a bad relationship with a toxic person just to have a relationship. As for the escort part, I gotta say I don’t blame you. I’ve never gone through with it, but I’ve been so depressed that I have turned in that direction. It’s a form of attention seeking for me. I want to feel loved and cared for and desired, but it’s a shortcut and makes me feel worse after the fact.
Were your experiences with escorts good at least?
I won’t tell you explicitly to not take prescriptions, but it can lead down a rabbit hole, speaking from experience of myself and family members. Try to be comfortable and happy with yourself before you you get into a relationship, that requires working on yourself.
You're very young dude you've plenty of time to work on yourself. Do you exercise?
2/3 were decent. But once you are done it’s feels so meaningless.
All I pretty much do is work day/night. Which caused me to gain a few pounds. I weight 230 unfortunately and have no motivation to work out. Tried it so much times.

Very quick rant.  This is the reason why I don't share my problems to my mother. All she says is that her problem is bigger than mine, that's why I shouldn't worry about mine.  What, is she going to think that if she says that to me my problem would go away?  This may sound overrated but I don't even have a father to begin with. I don't have anyone else to talk to. I do have friends but it seems like everyone doesn't even listen to me.  This made me come to a conclusion where it's okay for me to bottle up my feelings. I know that doing that isn't going to be healthy for my mental health in the long run, but it's the only thing that I could do.
Do you think speaking to a professional would do better? I got little else besides trolling, abandonment or platitudes from friends and family for depression, but they weren't trained professionals so I don't really blame them.
>**"My problems are worse than yours”**  Yup. I've hated that line my whole life. Where people see only themselves as worthy of compassion and understanding. It's extremely selfish.  It's almost as bad as being told how I feel. Or being told that how I feel is wrong.  It's like "Umm.... how I feel is how I feel and if you don't like it that's your problem."  I won't even let people like that drag me into conversations about my feelings. I don't want to throw my pearls to swine. I'd rather talk to people that are capable of understanding they are not the center of the universe. I am just as valuable as anyone else!!
She sounds like a narcissist. I had a roommate like this. They maximize their own problems while minimizing yours. I think it counts as actively gaslighting you. It’s probably a good thing she doesn’t want to listen because she would probably use it against you later.   Whatever your problems are, you deserve to get them off your chest and have someone to lend a compassionate ear. You’re right, bottling them up is not usually good long term.   If you don’t have any people to actively listen, write down what’s going through your mind. You could also consider getting a counselor, you could probably do a telehealth meeting.   My dad is a forester and said he used to talk the trees when he had nobody to listen. As long as they don’t talk back...
OP, your challenges and problems are real. Your mom may have super big challenges that in her eyes are bigger than yours. That’s ok. Problems are different for everyone. If you get the, don’t worry those aren’t as big as mine, then seek help from someone else. Call a hotline, see a school counselor, ask the college or school for a referral (mostly free in my experience). Your challenges are real. Your mom may just have her own and not be in the right place to help with yours. Talk to her first and if it’s not the outcome you want then talk to your school.
I am sorry she is not giving you the room you need to feel what you do. Of course you have your own problems and feelings, and it's so hurtful not to be given a place to express them. It makes them no less valid or important. It just means this may not be the person you're safe to share with. Is there someone else you can talk to?
You are going to go through life thinking your problems don't matter and will fail to address them. You'd be 'serving' her or other people and totally neglect yourself. You are responsible for yourself FIRST. I would recommend seeking professional help. Or that you use this sub to share your problems if it is not uncomfortable.
Sounds like your Mum is a Narcissist, classic behaviour.  If you have any trusted family members that are not her, then i would talk to them about helping to see a professional or a GP.  I know here we have mental health plans that dont cost but not sure where you are located.
I have thought of that but seeing a professional would still make me come to my mother to, of course, pay the therapist (I'm still a student who can't fund what I need) She'd probably say that I don't need it and I'd go back on the loop again. Thanks, though.
Labels are easy, we’ve not walked in her shoes or the OPs. Problems are typically* not better or worse than other just different. Problems are largely defined by the response of the person not the actual problem.
I understand, I had the same problem in both time and money in college. Would you be up to putting yourself through the therapy process by studying the skills and techniques online or in a workbook? It's either super cheap or completely free, and you can do it anytime you need instead of once a week (this is what I did for my 7 year suicidal depression).
tell her you'll pay her later in life. convince her. going to therapy doesn't only improve your life by 10,000 millions, but is also a literal life saver  when i first told my parents i wanted to see a therapist they said no, and said lots of hurtful things, including what you already mentioned. it took a lot of convincing, but it is not impossible. i hope you succeed

I watched the new movie "Soul" on disney+ and to be honest, I feel so depressed since then. I was already depressed before watching that movie but it got a new low now! I don't feel ready to live, without the feeling of fitting anywhere, without goals, and only with dreams that might be just dreaming at the end of the day.   I feel like doing nothing anymore, I know I need to do something, but I just can't!  I WANNA CHANGE MY LIFE and I feel so close to achieving it. Just. One. Single. step. But then I just freeze, slip on a banana, and lay on the ground...   I just want to fit somewhere, have the same old day, with the same old job, rest in the same old house, and feeling how my life is beautiful.   What should I do guys?
It's interesting that a film has made you feel like this - it's crazy what can trigger feelings right?  For me I watched the fresh Prince reunion  recently - and I don't know why but I cried for ages - especially at the scene of uncle Phil dying!  How have you tris to change your life? What's been the banana that you skip that stops you if you don't mind me asking of course?
I am scared, I am so scared to fuck it up, that I trip over myself... I try to be calm but I just can't. It is okay to fuck up sometimes as long as you learn from it, but there are times when you want/have do it right the first time. And that makes me so friggin' anxious and nervous.
Honestly - think of this times thst you have messed up - we all do it multiple times in our lives.. Annndd.. Well you're OK right now right? It's not that bad!

I used to just wake up and be happy everyday. I went through something kinda traumatic 2 years ago and ever since it feels like a switch went off in my head and my brain is permanently broken. I try to so hard to put myself in the best situation to be happy but I still can’t even reach what my normal used to be no matter how hard i try. I stopped drinking/smoking, I eat healthy and exercise and I try to be as grateful as I can possibly be for everything I have in my life. I don’t complain about anything to anyone as I’ve been trying to fix this myself and i know no one wants to hear my problems. I’ve been doing all this for the past year but at the end of the day i just feel so alone even tho i have great family and friends around me. I think I’m just forever stuck with these demons now.   Idk what the point of this post is. I just hate how I have to try my hardest every day to just not be miserable. It’s so exhausting I don’t how much longer I can keep pushing myself. Wonder if anyone else can relate. I’ve been thinking about seeing a therapist but that’s been my only hope for so long I feel like if that doesn’t work I’ll then be completely hopeless and then have no reason to not just end my life.
Been in the same boat for about a year. Had an opportunity and fucked it off on my own accord. We just got to keep going and realize we’re going to have days, weeks, maybe months like this. We have to keep going because no one else is going to do it for us. Things can certainly get worse and drugs don’t help, a bit hypocritical since I’m drunk right now.

I feel like a loser saying this but honestly it was just a bad breakup. I’ve had a good life other than that but if I’m putting the bad things that have ever happened to me on a scale that would be a 10 and I don’t think anything else would reach a 2. I was 20 when It happened and had honestly never really been sad or anything up to that point. Ever since then my brain has just stopped working like it used to. My whole thought process and everything has been completely different since then. I know I’m young and everything but I still don’t know anyone who is like this 2 years later and honestly think that something is seriously wrong with me.

Anyone else feel like they fail at everything they do or they’ll never be successful. I’m In my early 20s and when I look at the people around me there’s all these success stories, they’ve finished school , got their own place , car etc.. and here I am just being nothing, worthless with nothing to show. I’ll never amount to anything
I don’t just feel it  Yeah I HAVE failed at everything  I expect failure in everything I do now. Causing me brain fog days on end  Early 20s also, and I ask myself everyday when I wake up- why am I alive?

Hi, everybody. It’s great to post here. Firstly I’m sorry to hear that so many of you are struggling. It’s not fair, and it seems like this hits a ton of sweet people. I hope the best for all of you, and to many, I can relate. It can get a little easier, a little less severe even though the struggle is a long one.  I got ghosted by a guy I fell for recently, and while I’m pushing through that, I found that it’s resurfaced a lot of awful emotions I haven’t dealt with in years.  I was already full swing back into my eating disorder, but now I feel that even it isn’t enough to help me cope with the reasons why I might have been rejected.  I’m overweight—-not to the point where someone will be openly rude to me about it and others would disagree or say it’s not too bad,  but definitely enough to look really gross in a bikini. I’ve never liked my breasts, my face is a little weird and on top of being from an ethnicity that isn’t well-liked, I feel that most of these men are out of my league. It really, really hurts.  I’m also 34 with an incomplete degree and a lot of trauma surrounding school and my continued failure in completing and going to grad school. I feel that because of having a rough life,  my race and my age, it means that I’m not an attractive partner to anyone. I’ve been trying to think of how to cope with that; to neither settle and yet be okay if the person who works for me never comes along. I don’t want to move backwards with my depression and be where I was in the past. I guess I just want to be okay with having limited worth.  I do exercise, to the point I’m bordering on orthorexia. I am a little obsessive about my skincare and hygiene, so that’s fine. I just can’t really compete against girls with lighter skin, good degrees and smiles without gaps in them. It gets harder as our world becomes more and more appearance based. Those little unique things I liked about myself years ago are not stumbling blocks, and it’s frustrating when I have this duality of being told I’m talented, gorgeous and all of these other compliments. I just can’t trust them. If that were the case, why hasn’t anyone non-abusive really wanted me?  Anyone else go through that? Where on one hand you’re complimented so much or told how great you are, but in practice, you KNOW you aren’t even hitting 50%? How do you navigate that sort of duality? Where is the truth?  tl;dr: I’m a pudgy, aging black woman without the educational degrees to make up for these shortcomings

I am so lost and I don't know what to do. I am 24 years old and still living under my parent's roof. I am not a freeloader or anything like that, but I recently graduated from college and I am working two jobs full-time trying to make a living while changing my career so that I can be me stable.  I am so lost. Last night was the tipping point. Let me clear: I don't have the guts to kill myself. Death, actually, scares me -- but last night I felt "who the fuck cares" for the first time in my life.  \--  My brother (23) and I live in a partitioned room and he was playing video games very loud at 12:25am. I texted him multiple times to lower it, and he wouldn't. When I approached him, he laughed at me. I had work early in the morning so this set me off. I slammed a door and my parents come out of their room freaking out at me. I tried to explain the situation, but they only cared about me slamming the door.  My brother then physically attacked me. He through a broom at me, and he punched me in the face. My father had to hold him down and my parents still blamed me for the incident. Maybe my response wasn't perfect, but attacking me...?  This morning my mom told me to move out and called me a psychopath while not saying anything to my brother.  I try and do everything for my parents, while my brother sleeps at his girlfriends house, randomly throws parties, and goes on vacation. He is a college dropout and is literally working as a cashier (which is not a problem at all).  I am a 24 year old gay man -- I have no friends -- I can't hold a relationship -- and I don't feel safe at home. I have nowhere to go, I am broke, I don't know that to do.  I am on Adderal for ADHD and Zoloft for depression. I am happy when I am not home.  I am sitting here crying because I don't know if I am a bad person. I have been described by my friends and coworkers as "one of the nicest people they know". I literally just got a humanitarian award at my job.  I am so confused. It's like two different worlds.  \--  EDIT: It's not always bad, and that's why I am so freaking confused. My parents love me, no doubt. We laugh and we get along most of the time, but they easily are triggered and throw everything they have done for me in my face.

Hi, I'm from Argentina and on my 1st year of career, 'cause I lived A LOT of bad situations in my life, and now at my middle 22's I can return to college for my 5 years of duration career. I'm really depressed, thinking about suicide myself with a .22LR gun I have from my grandpa, and anxious (I waste all my days in my mind thinking about my problems, doing nothing, complaining to my friends and my friends are enough with my shit). I'm really really frustrated for my actual situation with no girlfriend, no job, no good situation in my career, a lot of fucked up familiar problems and so... I get really mad with myself by an experience with an ex member of my class in high school, I've tried to flirth with her on IG, but she's on her's 3rd year of career and working harder in a full time job, so I was in my mind thinking than I was doing well but... try that.. puts me soooo down... she was not interested on my obviously 'cause I'm... I'm nothing... I'm a dump, dumb, blind, I didn't deserve a girlfriend and less a girlfriend like her, she didn't let me meet her now. So... I'm devastated, in ruins, my heart is broke and I'm poor, I want to became a professional in the future but I'm really fucked up in every shape and form.      I was so frustrated in this days than I'm in my mind thinking about develop my appearance the most I can with the not much money I have, to get some new stuffs to dress and have a haircut (I'm with my long hair like Kurt Cobain, but getting bald and obviously not rough, I'm more like an indigenous dude, I'm ugly). The few friends I have are trying to do their best with me because they can notice I'm a hidden suicidal guy and.. I'm so lonely.. 'cause today I've found my friends.. they're in my head.. I'm so ugly... but that's okay, 'cause so are not you, broken mirrors. Tbh I'm a 80% sure I'm going to kill myself soon, 'cause I'm an autistic adult and I waste too much time, really much time, inside my home in my depression and now I'm really frustrated with myself and all. I hurt ppl in the past and now in social medias by my non self confidence and antisocial disorder. I delete FB, IG, and also I created accounts again with 1 or 2 followers for now. What should I do? I'm doing right? I'm in time to create a new life for myself? I'm a bad person?

Imagine if everything gets better/feels better after a good night's rest.   I can't believe this actually happens for people. I really want to experience it someday.
That would be crazy, have a bad day? Just sleep it off. Wish it was like that for everyone, I just sleep until the next one.
It won’t, change only comes after long periods of time but it’s the culmination of little changes that add up to it. I know what you mean and I think that sometimes too. But tomorrow never comes, there is only today.

She has been emotionally cheating on me with at least three other guys and idk how to feel. I’m just broken.
Yeah. I’ve been there. Just leave her or there will be more pain.
I'd walk  Honestly It seem's she's checked out . you don't deserve that . move on with your life and do something constructive

Depressed, anxious, obsessive, bpd, suicidal etc. etc.  All blood tests are normal.  A lot pf physical activity. Excellent diet of good fats/carbs, protein, no alcohol etc.  Normal sleep.  Utterly dejected and incomprehensibly depressed/anxious/obsessive/intense feelings. I can't share this with my family as it makes them upset and they don't understand me.  I've seen 15 therapists (including an anxiety and dbt group) and 4 psychiatrists. Been to hospital a few times too. I've tried ssri, snri, tca, maoi, stabilizer, anti-psychs, benzos (for anxiety). Also have tried a wide range of supplements/other agents (turmeric, magnesium, lithium, nac, vitamin d, vitamin b12 etc.). Ketamine is not offered and there is a TMS clinic though it's too far away.  The last contact I had with a general practitioner didn't go well as they (two of them) didn't understand me and didn't seem to believe I had issues. I also sensed that they were fed up with me. Told me to see another psychiatrist. Thus I saw a psych and they tried another maoi (moclobemide) and it didn't work.  I need help, I am really bad. Yet I can't face going into the surgery again and telling them my problems because in the past it has gone badly 9 times out 10 and made me feel worse.  Don't know what to do. Even typing this feels pointless. The anhedonia is often intense. Self harmed again last night though it doesn't help. Almost too depressed to even do that. Can't cry - no tears.  Thanks if you read this.

It’s hard for me to want to eat many things because of the medicine I take. I have to remind myself that it is better to eat something rather than nothing.  I find myself wanting to not eat because I can’t stomach nutritious foods, but I have to eat.  I eat what I can and I want you to know that it’s better than not eating. Food equals calories equals brain emotional functions.

I’m so depressed and I don’t know what to do. I wish I was good enough for my standards but I’m not and I never will be and I don’t want to settle for less. I’ll never be enough for anyone I like, even myself. I feel like suicide may be my only option.
please don't. i know it seems impossible right now but i really want you to know that whatever it is your going through, it will pass over. you are enough for so many people and if you haven't found them yet you will eventually trust me. i don't know how old you are or where you are in life but things do change over time, it's really tough sometimes to bear this life but it is worth it.   i also struggle with feeling discontent with myself and i understand what you mean by you're not good enough for your own standards even. i guess it's just something we have to work on.   from my experience feeling productive helps a lot. when you wake up wbu morning write down on a piece of paper a list of tasks or goals you wan to accomplish during the day. if you don't have any, make some up. they could be as simple as "take a shower" or "go for a walk". just the idea of accomplishing a set of tasks that you set forth will make you feel better a doty cross them off the paper. this way you can also be productive while feeling down in life.  im sorry if this didn't help much but know that there are many people in the world right now in solidarity with you, whether you know it or not and whether they know it or not, we are all together. peace and love, i hope you feel better one day
Hey it's ok to set high standard's for your self  but just know . it's better to set high standards than lower. you also don't have to end your life . I know those thought's your having it's one's I  have alot. even in high school  I had them . you may think your not enough for someone to  like you but truth is that's a lie . sometime's it's the hard times in our lives can direct us to the right path <3 stay strong <3 Never give up <3 were all here for you

I've had a bad past growing up, more than what a kid should go through.  When I was in year 5 I developed a coping mechanism in which I would force myself to be sad in    happy situations, that way when the next bad thing happened it wouldn't affect me.   At the time it helped, but fast forward to now and i find it an unhealthy coping mechanism.  For the first time I have taken steps and now currently on a dose of anti-depressants.    I find it extremely difficult talking about my thoughts to my friends and family.     I can talk about some lighthearted feelings, i'm feeling groggy, just a bit sad ect ect.    However I would hate to let them know how much i'd quite like to go away.   Not that I'm unable to find joy, its just that I can't seem to enjoy, joy.   &#x200B;  I'm an adult now, get yourself together.   You have responsibilities.   Self-deprecating cycle.      In my head i'm still that kid.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Thank you for reading,    Kind regards.

I feel isolated from all people even though I am not, I feel isolated even when I talk to people, or among them, it's like there are walls or kind of barriers between me and people, which make impossible to be close or even be interested. I almost don't talk to people it is neither possible nor appealing for me. I feel like I don't love anyone I should so in the end of the day my family, my friends are just strangers to me. I don't even get if I feel lonely or isolated
If it’s a more recent occurrence, you may just be emotionally fatigued from 2020
Surrounded by people yet always so alone. At least you have yourself.
Clearly, you think and feel very deeply. Relationships and communication are certainly difficult. But we need them.  The more we isolate ourselves, the more depressed and removed we feel.   Meaningful relationships with family and friends take effort - every day. The people around us all have their own complex thoughts and emotions going on, just as we do. Their needs and feelings change. They feel lonely and isolated at times too.  Keep putting in the effort.  In the long run, all that we give comes back to us.  And if we give nothing, we get nothing back.  Hang in there...  : )
Unfortunately, it have been for several years  Thank you for your response
Thank you for your support
My friend said me it was because I was introverted, but I think it is not that way
I'm an extrovert, but sometimes I get so lost in my own thoughts, I feel that everyone else around me is a million miles away.  I just have to pull myself out of that rabbit hole and continue to reach out to the people around me. Everything worthwhile takes time and effort, including our relationships.
Thank you

Two days.   I've been permitted two days of happiness, and then from night to day it was like a switch was flicked inside my head.   All the thoughts came back in full force, I'm in the worst mental state of grief I've ever been. I don't want to continue like this, this crushing feeling of loneliness neverending.   Today I woke up from dream I can't stop thinking about. I was with my "sister" and asked her if her birthday wasn't coming up soon, and she said it was today. I replied "So that's why I've been feeling awful, I forgot" and hugged her. That hug left me heartbroken.   I don't have a sister in real life, but this fake hug that happened in my head is killing me inside, because all the feelings are real. I can't even tell at which receiving end I wanted to be at, but now I'm agonizing and crying over it.   I'm broken. Deep inside I'm broken, filled with thoughts that tell me to hurt myself and "good" dreams that only hurt me more.   Just a hug, that's all.

I had a good week this week. The first time in a long time. I'm off sick from work and I've been having a great time walking my dogs and playing World of Warcraft for the first time in 4 years. All my worries disappeared.  &#x200B;  I'm going back to work this week and last night I had very severe panic attacks about it and couldn't breathe or sleep. My partner got annoyed at me because I kept choking and hyperventilating in the middle of the night. Today is also the 5th anniversary of my uncle's death. He was my biggest role model and favourite person. His death destroyed my family, and we are still struggling with the fallout.   &#x200B;  I'm really bad today. I miss him and my family so much. I am in a different country now with just my partner, who works long hours every day as an essential worker. I'm so isolated and just want to cry. I don't want to get up in the morning.  I'm terrified to start work because I know I will completely break down and lose my job.

Im writing this just in case I finally give in the pain and kill myself. Its been so hard to keep up this charade of being happy around people im constantly thinking about killing myself. I just dont know what to do anymore i had to move in with my parents thabks to the divorce I cant work a job that will pay me enough to move away from my parents unless I get a job 2+ hours away I hate being alone but I hate living with my parents its just a reminder of how shitty marriage is and just makes it worse on me. I don't think ill ever commit suicide im to much of a coward but im to the point I barely eat or care what happens to me. I sleep all day I have dreams of her every night but they make it feel worse once I realize she left me. But really not only that she left me she cheated on me then found another guy so quickly I've lost my trust in everyone including myself im broken im hurt its been 5 months but the pain just gets worse. I've tried to find someone else as well but im to ugly to fat and to broken for anyone to be interested. I'm losing a battle with depression and idk what to do. All I want is for someone to love me to appreciate me I want someone who will spoil me just as much as I spoil her I want her to tell me she loves me to give me cheesy one liners. I guess it's too much to ask for though. Sorry for complaining and the horrible gramer I Judy needed a place to vent. Men aren't allowed to show emotions in today's world plus not like anyone really cares around me.

It feels like I remember every sad thing that’s ever happened to me. My parents split up when I was 11 and I had to move across the country from the place I grew up in for 12 years. Sadness and hopelessness have overwhelmed me ever since. I’m 24 now and as life goes on, it just gets sadder and sadder. I don’t have any motivation, no passion, no friends, and I’m not good at anything. Every night I can’t sleep because I just lay awake thinking about every mistake i’ve made. I’m so tired of existing. I wish I wasn’t me, I wish I could’ve been born someone else. I wish I could just be a kid again and not know what’s coming.
you are not your mistake's no one is perfect.  I don't know what you went through growing up but  don't let  all of the circumstances  in your life hinder you. <3 were here for you <3

I am a guy that has always had a poor social life...i met a girl on omegle and we decided to hang around again on snap...i was never on there to find love...i was lonely and i was happy she had decided to make friends with me...we went almost a year supporting each other back and forth...i admit that i did fall in love in her although she was 2000 miles away from me...i expressed my feelings for her a couple of weeks ago and i respected her opinion...she wasn't ready for anything...i didnt ask for a relationship because i know that stuff end up in heartbreaks and i never wanted to harm her...however she had saved me and to me she deserves the world for that. As the days went by we talked less and less...at last i had to find out that she was now in a relationship with one of her real life friends...i could live with that but she started ignoring my messages...i grew more worried every time she didn't reply and i kept pushing...i know that's annoying when she says she doesn't wanna talk to people...i didn't feel like i was people to her though...i wanted to help her like every other time...then she blocked me and i used other accounts to reach out to her...i know its creepy but i did what i did only because i cared and i don't deserve to be blamed for trying...i am being as patient as possible but i am broken...she was the first person to stand by me and make me happy and now she has kicked me out of her life... I don't know how much longer i can wait while i am in pieces
> she was the first person to stand by me and make me happy  Try to stop searching for happiness in other people. Find your happiness within first and foremost. That way when other people aren't there you can still be happy. Stop waiting, start finding out what makes you happy that doesn't depend on another person. I should really take my own advice.
[removed]
I know it's wrong to depend on others for happiness...however i have been feeling lonely most of my life and she changed that... that's all...i never had someone to share feelings with...thanks for the advice and i wish you the best
Appreciated, mate...i am trying...thanks for the kind words
There being more girls doesn’t really change the connection that was felt between the one
He is partly right and i appreciate that...i can't ruin my life because of one girl i never even got to see in person...my feelings are true but i have neglected myself for those feelings...i am thankful for everyone's opinion here

I need help, I was at the bottom pit of depression due to a bad childhood, everything was tasteless. Then I helped myself and gradually recovered, very slowly I improved. But recently I was accused for something I didn't do, I was betrayed by a close friend. The shit was unprecedented and has pushed me back. I fell down with double velocity, I have hit the bottom again. Worst thing is that my brain is foggy and I am clueless about what to do. The only hope I see at the opening of the pit is that I have once helped myself out of the darkness. But right now, its pitch dark. Life is offering me opportunities but I am dysfunctional. What do I do now? Where do I start?

It has been almost a year since my mom found my limp body inside my apartment. It’s been almost a year since I cut last. I have a million thoughts running thru my head and I just want to press this exacto knife into my fucking skin and just watch the blood flood from my body.
It's serious dude We can't do anything without knowing the back story.  get a therapist man,it will really help just try it.
What’s been making you feel that way?
Hey, I don't know what brought you to this point but just know your never alone . <3
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kztbzl/i_want_to_kill_myself_and_i_need_reasons_not_to/
I have a vague method how but I don’t have a date yet. I don’t want to get to that point. I’m a tired, shitty person who is at war with myself, hurting myself and others every day and I’ve failed at fixing this so many times that killing myself is becoming easier than becoming a better person. And I can’t find a way to say otherwise.
You say you are at war with yourself. Sounds to me you do not have a good opinion of yourself, maybe? Can you tell in which  ways you hurt others and/or yourself?
Maybe, maybe I’m not worth fixing though. I take up so much energy to simply exist it’s not worth it lmao
I don't know how old you are but I am certainly sure that you are not that old. If this is the chase you just have lived a tiny pice of a long live. It's like you just give up on a tutorial of a videogame. But maybe the video game is extremely fun.
I always think that suicide is a temporary solution for a temporary problem .Please don't give up buddy! You are a human being and your life has VALUE!
I think I outlined it well in another post, so I’ll copy it here:  “I’m shitty at maintaining most relationships because I get tired halfway through. I have a shit sleep schedule. I have a hard time empathizing with people. I often want to help others but my motivation means jack shit since I only am actually able to help others when it’s easy. I suck at personal hygiene. I love to drink and I’m also addicted to caffeine. I have the worst eating habits: I both starve and stuff myself. I vent to others even if it doesn’t help me because sometimes I like the attention. I just want to OD on meds and alcohol because I’m too self destructive and selfish of a person that it’s easier to kill myself than to learn how to actually be helpful to society.”  So then you might ask “why not just change?” And I want to. I have the problem of having ideas but being too weak or selfish to turn them to action. It’s like I’m locked behind the back of my head and watching myself behave from a distance, and I hate what I’m seeing and who I am every step of the way. It’s pathetic, really.
You’re right, I’m 21. I’m recently out of the tutorial. But my player is buggy and the debuffs are draining my stamina, fogging my senses, and making it more difficult for me to care for others and myself. The game has stopped feeling rewarding to play and I don’t have the energy points to fix it. I’ve seen how fun the game can get, but I don’t think I can achieve that outcome with the nerfs I have.
I appreciate the encouragement. I appreciate you coming and making the effort to say hello, and I do agree with that statement about suicide. I just can’t seem to find another solution, but I want to. But the longer I look, the more I hurt, and the less I think I’m worth saving. My life has value, but not enough to make fighting every single day worth it.

Society always looks down on you and in some cases even hate you. There’s so much expected from you and when you can’t perform because you’re struggling they say you’re better off dead. Why are young adults treated like trash? I feel like shit everyday because there is so much pressure. It makes me angry and bitter to be at the bottom of the social tier list. You might as well be a doormat or a punching bag at this age.
They hate you because you have potential. They can't judge you yet that's why they hate.
For real that’s exactly how I felt they keep setting these weird expectations for teenagers or kids or young adults like seriously they’d normalize every weird thing. How about normalizing doing what you enjoy doing and live your life. Even if you did do what they except from you still they’d say it’s not enough living on what society sees normal now days will make any adult or teenager feel down. Ignore the pressure live by your rules no matter what they except from you achieve it whenever you feel like it and if you feel like it. We should stop living by what they call normal life style nowadays ( study -> work -> repeat ) like what if I want to do nothing for example and do what I love that would make me feel better
People will always be persecuting you, for a million different stupid, vague reasons. It's hard but we have to live outside their perspective, it does nothing positive for us. Some people just don't have the full emotional capacity to understand, they put their regret on you.. It doesn't make it your problem for being young, or whoever you are.

Hey man, you want to talk? I understand if you don't and that's okay, but what's wrong? I checked through your post history, it's just mostly stuff about financing and books you want to read (and one nsfw pic lol).  You okay? What happened?
Oh... Yeah. Sorry for the NSFW pic. My bad. I need a throwaway.
No problem my guy. You seem pretty smart, with all the financing and books stuff. I also noticed some stuff about dieting and fastfood.  What's up? Why are you feeling this way?
Just some problems with women. I have a lot of issues surrounding dating, sex, etc. Insecurity, haven't always been treated the best, haven't always treated the best myself (even though I've always tried). Just seems like no one wants me, and that's hard.
I'm really sorry you had to see that picture. I don't imagine many people go through my post history, so it's not something I even thought might happen.  I deleted it.
Ouch man, you've probably written one of the most relatable things I've ever seen here on Reddit. Heaps and loads of guys (and girls!) probably know how you feel.  It's sucks too, that we're expected to put all this work into self-improvement because that will bring you happiness, and by the end of all the struggles we're left with neither interest from others, nor pride in ourselves.  &#x200B;  I feel like once you reach a low point, like you're at right now, it's always good to distract yourself a little bit.  Troubles with women? You can instead put that same focus into something else.  Some people focus on self-love. You mentioned that you're in a pretty bad situation with your own esteem, so maybe instead of focussing on how to improve stuff about you that you consider negative, appreciate the positives and work on enhancing those!  Some people throw themselves into their work (I'm not sure if that's healthy or not, it works for some people though. Might depend on your job). If that helps you, go for it! Experiment a little, and see what best fits you.  Some people, myself included, learn new hobbies. Music is something I enjoyed a lot, so if you have some spare time and/or money, hobbies are great to throw yourself into. It's a nice alternative to the work thing.  &#x200B;  I'm having trouble thinking of more, can you help me? Tell me, what kinds of things would you want to do or learn if you had free time?
Don't worry about it at all, it always puts an nsfw warning so I didn't pry. I didn't see anything but the title, it's fine.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz9zl9/its_hitting_me_that_i_wasted_my_youth/
I’m 27 now, and it’s suddenly dawned on me that my youth is over. By youth I mean that naïveté, energy, spontaneity, openness to new experiences, experiencing new things for the first time, not receiving society’s vitriol for your antics because well you’re young and hot and it’s expected. My past was marred by anxieties, dysfunctional family dynamics, and extreme self-doubt and fear which caused me to drop out of school, cut friendships, avoid most social situations, make reckless and self-destructive choices when I was social. I missed out on the most basic positive experiences I should have had in high school and in college, and I’ll never be able to get those back. I’m left solitary with only a small handful of good memories and no skills for the future. I see the people I know moving up in their careers or personal lives and I lag behind. I can tell people view me differently, take my voice less seriously because I’m less educated, less developed (I have no skills, social life, or hobbies), I notice myself not being able to relate to those who are still in my life since we are in such different places. There’s no undoing the fact that I can’t go back or that I have built so few social ties. I can see myself becoming weaker, like I just don’t care if I sleep my life away, learn anything new, create new friendships or a family. When I try to study anything, I feel like I just don’t have the brain or the willpower. I have no patience, no focus, no tolerance for emotional setbacks anymore. I have no way to explain what it’s like to other people and those around me think I’m intentionally being difficult, lazy, or rude (avoidant) and don’t understand what there is to be anxious about or have some simple solution - exercise (no shit), “just do the stuff you’re supposed to”, focus on the present. I’ve heard, read up on, and tried everything. My limitations overpower me and my better judgment. I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin sometimes from the literal panic this causes me. I’m afraid I’ll be alone forever, and it’s becoming harder with age to find that opening for change. People I know (and professionals too) don’t reach out or have the same hope for my improvement the way they used to, or people have given up on me. My avoidant personality is somewhat relieved by that, but it also hurts my heart to know that I’ve been left behind sort of. All of my time is spent remembering painful times, or good times, which is also painful. I’m always in the past because I don’t have the means to build up my present. And even when things improve they don’t get better overall, it’s only a temporary relief until the emptiness of my life confronts me again. I don’t know if there’s a way to ever achieve the life I would have sneered at as a youth but dream of now - I don’t even know if I can meet the basics for stability, steady job, a few friends, a family? My family is 3 people, when they’re gone, I’m literally going to be alone in the world and that terrifies me. If I’m relevant to no one, it’s like I don’t exist. Or, what is the point of existence then? Everyone needs to be cared for. If I will never be able to recoup from the bad choices I made I really don’t know what I’ll do because nobody is meant to be this alone, but the older I get the more difficult new friendships are. It’s painful enough to live with my memories, but their real-word effects are becoming more obvious. I don’t think I’ll make it past 30 if I’m not able to change my circumstances. I can’t talk about any of this to the couple people I have contact with or a therapist, it makes me angry because there’s no way for another person to understand my full story or respond “perfectly”. My bitter self gets upset when people aren’t able to relate to my pain, and I hate that about me. Plus no one can rewrite my life for me, so what’s the point, and a metaphorical pat on the back feels almost insulting, even if well intended. But then I’m left to have al of this brew with no where for it to go and I don’t know how much longer I can do it. I feel so trapped   😘✌🏻😞
I never had that youth. So I don't know what you mean. I turn 23 next month and never have made the youth experiences yet. Idk if I even want to have them. I wake up, work with anxiety, sadness and being empty, go home, eat and watch tv or listen music or playing games, sleep and repeat. I planned to live until 25, idk if I will be able to sleep forever yet, even I have no goals or things to really enjoy.
i burned out in my mid 30s, but am now in my early 40s and feel like I'm in my early 20s again, just more wisdom, and slightly creakier joints.  &#x200B;  there is a big world out there nobody has seen all of
Bro I am almost 31 and I relate to 99% of what you say.  I wasted much of my teens and 20s being too anxious and awkward to do anything and now I see it all as a big wasted opportunity that I will never get back.  The years where it would have been easy to form new friendships and date are behind me.  Everyone roughly my age has settled down, gotten married and had kids and here I am still acting like I'm 17.  I hang out with people much younger than me and they often ridicule me for having no life or living such a boring life.    The really depressing thing when you get into your 30s is you are almost to that age where hanging out with people in their late teens early 20s would be seen as creepy and this too limits the pool of dating an social friend making opportunities.  I don't want to be that creepy older peter pan syndrome guy in the group of college kids.
You wrote what I was feeling better than I ever could. I'm about to turn 25 myself. I often just shut down whenever people start talking about the fun crazy things they did in college and high school cause I just can't relate.
Same situation  Ir really hits damn fucking hard realizing you've wasted your youth, worst psrt is hearing about your friends' younger brothers in their early twenties enjoying the crap out of it... Fuck man... Fuck
This is one of my greatest fears.. Waking up and confronting the reality my life has been a waste. My entire childhood was garbage, and school was the worst. Everyone abused me and left me broken so I spent years between hate, fear, sadness and regret. I did meet a few good people but life snatched them away or circumstances did.  Life finally gave me a break and I met someone so kind and caring.. But I took them for granted and they ended up killing themself shortly after. It's been about 5 or so years since then and it hasn't left me. Not only am I in therapy for years of childhood trauma, but their death as well. It's funny to see my abusers living their lives with new partners and children while I'm stuck in the past. I promised myself if I'm still a "loser" or have found no purpose by 30 I would end it - and that time is quickly approaching.  The most ironic and possibly tragic part of it all.. I have the want and means to go live my dreams right now. But me and my big mouth made unrealistic promises to financially support my mother and that's draining all of my money, energy and hope. I've spent the past 3 years supporting her while all of my older (wealthier) siblings get to ignore her situation and let me shoulder the burden alone. I often ask myself am I doing it out of love or is this my warped idea of "atonement". She ignored me all my life while all of her other children were raised properly with affection and love. How stupid is it that the black sheep is now her only grasp on life. Soon I fear I'll have to make a choice - take one last shot at life or continue supporting someone who neglected me.
Im glad you didnt do it
For myself it was a youth I dreamed of having, saw other people living out, but was too afraid to go for it even when opportunities presented themselves to me. Now there aren’t even opportunities like there used to be. I’m similar to you with my day in day out stuff. When I turned 23, I remember feeling really old and like my life was over. Now, it seems a lifetime away from my creaky old 27 years lol. Had I focused on getting things in order then, maybe my life would be more fulfilling now. Hindsight 20/20 🙄
It gives me some hope to hear that, thank you

Yeah that sucks.   I also feel like every one of my friends has such a good life. They have a partner, they study, they have a own home, they laugh and enjoy life fully while I just work, and be exhausted of all the stuff that means living.
Career collapsed, broke, friend took me in to avoid homelessness.  There is a social safety net where I live, so hitting rock bottom allowed some state resources to help keep me fed.  Exercise - Jogging, crunches, and pushups are free. I'm the fittest I've ever been, thanks to some additional weights. From my own energy I have power, and that brings confidence and self-worth. Friends - Don't be afraid to reach out to them and ask to go for a walk and talk. Just letting it all out helps. Some friends won't be able to handle it. Others will thrive on comforting you. Time- Everything can be temporary  What stopped me from removing myself from myself was making sure that my kid and friends wouldn't have to only have pictures and memories of me. That sticking around could mean new ones could be made. Time gave me the ability to make new friends, too.  I'm still pretty broke and in debt, but that will be changing this year.  If you leave now, you won't know what happens next and the best episode might be yet to come.

I had a friend who decided that on his 24th badly, there wasn't going to be a 25. He left behind a child too young to make a memory of him. I didn't want my kid to remember me only from pictures.  There are no sequels in life, but consider that gremlins 2 was way more fun than the original

It’s like I loose my breath for a second, my heart skips a beat and I get butterflies in my stomach. It’s like seeing the love of my life for the first time in months.   Then it’s regret.   My heart is broken, the weight of the world lands on my shoulders and I can’t stand under the pressure. Deeper and deeper I go into the abyss. Blank stares at the celing at 2AM in the morning as all I can do is think about every single bad decision I’ve ever made.   I am left grasping for air and all the people around me don’t see me as anything but fine. They don’t see my pain, my torment that I inflict upon myself. The tears that sit just under the surface, waiting to be alone and let all those emotions that I have been bottling up pour out of me.   I sit now and I look at my scars. The loves of my life, the only things in my little world that truly know what I feel. They see me for who I am. I just want our little family to grow again, so I let my heart skip a beat again.

Thank you, it's a pain we all feel so deeply.

its like.. 2 bucks.. and it's super generous with the filings, you could easily use 3 eggs instead of 1. I plan to make my own little scramble mix thing knock off, and just use a cup of just crack an egg when I'm feeling especially low since you just microwave it (I usually like to make avocado toast in the morning w/eggs since it's a good balance of like.. whole wheat and protein and healthy fats and oils. all that good stuff.)     yeah idk, i don't have like a schedule or anything which I know helps but uhh.. a huge part of whether my depression is aggravated or not is dependant on how shitty I eat lol so. idk I try to focus on low sodium and fats and proteins since it helps alot with my ability to like.. think properly.. and have an even amount of energy thru the day.. yeah   also orowheat has this double fiber bread now which has??? so much goddamn fiber per slice??? very cool. I just bought like 4 loaves for 13 bucks and froze 3 of them for later

I’ve finally got the courage to seek help. I’m going to the doctors soon, but I am very nervous. How do I tell them that I hear voices without sounding crazy? And that I feel horrible mentally even though I’m high-functioning. I know I will begin to cry as soon as I’m there.
You’re doing the hardest part already which is seeking help, cheers to you and it won’t be as bad as you think it will be.
My recommendation for doctors/therapy is to write out what you want to say ahead of time in the comfort of your own home. Might sound strange, but as you expressed yourself you are worried about getting emotional and explaining everything correctly. I have asked people to read what I've written before, no big deal.  Don't be nervous about it, these are the people who deal with these issues, it's nothing new or embarrassing to them.
Thanks for the reply. I might do that, I have an easier time writing my thoughts down.

I can’t catch a break. I quit a toxic job, told how dare I quit a toxic job, am broke as fuq will bills and loans this weekend and I just found out that the second check was “already mailed out”. I’m serious when I say I wanna die. The past 3 years have been the worst but honestly since dec 9nth, when I turned 25, I’ve just have not been here. I’ve clocked out cuz I feels so powerless in my life. 3 years with this diagnosis even though I’ve known since I was a kid I had this and I’m just tired, but apparently being tired is an excuse. Nothing I do changes anything and I want out so bad. I often think the Christian god is messing me up because I left christianity (I don’t agree with it let’s say that) but now he wants to just ruin it. I also took up witchcraft but my “craft” has been hurt. (And I don’t need to here how that’s what I get for leaving, I’m reminded every day). I’m just extremely exhausted and I’m ready to go. I’ve said stuff but nobody gives a fuq, but watch me fail and then get mad at me and call me selfish. I have no win-wins, just a whole bunch of loosing. And then I’m told that I’m just being a baby. I hate living and I’m so tired of being so stressed that small things make crying spells. I hate living so much. I want an out so bad. Nobody cares if I’m suffering. They just want me to shut up but then wonder why I smoke shit tones of weed and not talk to them at all.

I realized what a horrible person I turned out. I tried to kill my parents, became a bitter person, shut myself in FOR NOTHING. I didn't complete my novel, traveling the world, helping the homeless. All these things I thought I knew to be a certainty about myself when I was young. If my teenage self had met me today, I would have punched myself in the face. Those dreams were crushed. I'm beyond horrified. My life is already over. Depressed and lonely. I don't know what to do or what I'll ever do to get myself out of this mess. I'm uneducated, stupid and a total failure. I just want to give up already.
If tomorrow exists then you can still do these things
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzejls/depression_covid_really_got_us_bad/
It’s bad enough not being able to leave your house, unless it’s essential because of covid.   Then depression got us doing nothing productive with our day, other than laying in bed.   We are not living, we are just existing.
It really would be wildly inappropriate *not* to be depressed by this. People who aren't depressed by it must have something very wrong with them.
I’ll probably be existing like this after covid too
2020 was honestly the nail in the coffin for me.
can’t see anyone (except my bf with whom i live) groceries are the only reason i leave my apartment, my sleep deprivation worsened a lot, i never see the light of the day since I go to bad at 6am and then wake up at 3pm (so i see the natural light for like 2 hours) since i don’t have any strict schedule, i procrastinate more than ever. and above all of that it’s my exam period. Fuck this january covid
I did nothing all day today. Laid in my bed and watched youtube videos. Felt bad about life and just in this spiral of being depressed. I should do something but I just don't care anymore and want to be left alone. I like being in bed, I like my space, I dont like people and want to be left alone.
Seriously, is ANYONE happy right now????
Literally, but I was feeling like this already, just making everything x10 worse!
Hope it gets better for you, once this all over!

Constantly. It is the only thing I feel anymore. Even with people all I feel is loneliness. I don't want to cry anymore. I don't want to be alone. I don't want to hurt myself..
It’s going to be ok. I feel the sam way too quite often. So what I try to is tell myself to be in the moment and actively do something. Changing your focus can help sometimes.
What’s your age

As I sit here feeling alone again I have to wonder if I really have anything in this world.    I want to feel loved and wanted, but when I lay here at night, I wonder if I truly am.  People tell me they love me, but do they really mean it, or are they just saying it.  Am I anything more than just the blade of grass they walk on?  Probably not.  I'm just here for their enjoyment.  To make their lives better.  My life, it will never get better.  I'll always be here, an afterthought.  Or maybe not even a thought.  Maybe just an inconvenience.
Who says that they love you? Friends, parents ...?
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzss1l/after_many_research_on_happiness_ive_basically/
And that's fucking depressing, I used to think it's all about your mindset, which was kinda motivating to better myself, but nah, it's about how gifted you are, it's about things that were decided very early in life.
Definitely not. Genes do play a part but not the whole part. You got to work on the yourself everyday. Chase purpose not happiness. Potential is nothing compared to hard work.
I don't think that's true. Hard work often beats talent. It's true that the talented people tend to be the richest and flashiest, but right below them there are the normal, hardworking people still pulling six figures and living great lives because they're willing to grind for it.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzhjqy/im_not_ok_and_i_dont_feel_like_doing_anything/
Let's preface by saying that I'm probably feeling the emptiest I've felt all my life.  I haven't struggled with depression before. Nothing *really* deep, at least. I have a tendency from times to times (every few years or so) to have deeper moments of emptiness, of feeling I don't know why I'm doing anything, of not knowing what I'm worth. Usually I get through it within a few weeks, maybe a month or two.  My life hasn't been dramatic so far either. I have a very small family. I'm only close to my mother and my sister. I talk to and see my father sometimes, but we're not *close.* I have a great job and friends I can talk to. Honestly, I often feel like I shouldn't complain.  But, now, my life has taken a turn for the worse recently. I'm in my early 30s. I was in a 8 years relationship, for 5 of which we were married. It hasn't always been easy, but we had something. But when shit hit the fan with COVID around March, my wife slowly drifted away from me, started talking to a guy online, became emotionally invested in him. I found out early August, after about three months. She ended our relationship soon after. Things didn't pan out with the guy when she finally met him, but the damage was done.  I've been living alone with my cat since October. I haven't seen any of my friends since, barely have seen my family. I had a semi-date that didn't work out. Neither of us were ready for something. Covid has made my social life a real nightmare.  My ex has recently started dating someone though, and I'm glad for her. She hates herself for what she did to me, but I don't want her to be as miserable as me. She also has the right to move on. We're still in contact, although gradually less and less, as it was fine while we were both alone doing nothing, but now I want to leave her some space, she doesn't need me around anymore. Not in that way.  It sucks that I can't really see my dog and my other cats anymore, but I don't see myself just asking to come by anymore. Someone has partially taken my place now, I gotta live with that.  I'm a fucking mess, though. I more often than not don't feel like doing shit besides watching football. I don't have motivation. Things that usually interested me just... leave me indifferent.  I'm supposed to start seeing a therapist in February. I did see one last Fall, it helped for a while, but since things didn't get better *at all* either in my personal or social life, I just... can't tell myself I'll be fine. I know I'm not, and I'm at a point where I don't even really care anymore. I guess I'm mostly following what people are recommending me to do. I know I have existential self-worth problems. I often don't see the point of it all, or why would anyone ever be interested by me instead of someone else. I don't want to let people down, so I often just think I shouldn't even try to invest myself at all. I'm not suicidal or anything though, and never have been. I just easily feel a void inside, and I'd rather not burden anyone else with that.  Hell, I'm also even getting tired of talking to my friends. All I can do is talk about how much my life sucks, and how I lack motivation for 95% of everything, 95% of the time. And some of them are also starting to date people, so I don't want to burden them either with my shitty breakup stuff. I don't want them to be stuck with my constant complaining and bring them down along the way.  I don't really know what to do to get out of this. I'm not even sure I wish to. Of *course* being happy would be better, but I don't have the strength to do it. Getting back to being single after 8 years and a marriage in the middle of a pandemic while living in a place with *very* strict Covid related social rules, I just... I've never felt that empty, lonely and useless all my life.  Sorry, that was probably all very rambly. I guess I just needed to let it out.
Hey! So firstly, I think you are certainly overblaming yourself right now.  What happened with your ex wife was completely on her. You're not feeling the aftereffects. Make no mistake about it - she cheated on you.  You've hit lows because the person  who was mean to be the person who you could rely on brok your trust.  This isn't your fault. Quite frankly, the fact that you still talk to her is a testiment of what kind of person you are. I tlwoukd completely cut contact with her as soon as you can - she isn't good for your emtbak health I don't think.  What's ahppeend is thst you've taken the actions of your ex, and applied them to yourself. You keep on saying "why would anyone invest in me / love me" etc. Well - they will dom and people have done. And it's been shattered by her.  I keep saying this a lot, but I think you need to look at this in a new angle. Pretend that your situation was your best friends.. Or someone else that you care for - what kind of advice would yoh give then?  Normally if suggest talk about your situation to your friend - hut it seems like you have already done that. I instead will say to you - talk to your friends about anything but your depression right niw. Listen to them talk about themselves. Talk about a good movie you watched - anything but the depression. I'm not at all suggesting you ignore - you will come back to this. But right now - I think you need something clean.
It’s eerie how similar our relationships with our ex wives played out and literally in the same time frame last year.  If you ever want to talk, commiserate, or try to get our minds of shit taking football, I’m here.  I’m a 36 year old guy struggling to get out of bed in the morning. I work every day and you’d never guess I’m down by interacting with me there, but as soon as the laptop shuts down... you know what I mean.  So yeah, wanna talk playoffs? Want to remind ourselves we tried to make those marriages work? Anything I can do.
Having also gone through a pandemic break up with a long term partner, I relate to everything you've stated. I too am a sensitive, empathetic person and I strongly believe that so many of the traumatic experiences we as a society have collectively experienced have amplified whatever personal trauma we have gone through. I think it's important to tell yourself that just because someone may have it worse, doesn't mean you're unjust in feeling bad. That's like telling someone they shouldn't be happy because someone else has it better.   By posting here you are reaching out and I appreciate you sharing your story here. Since COVID distancing rules were implemented, I've found myself more frequently on Reddit and have found such support in a variety of subs that have gotten me through my absolute lowest of days. If you are looking for a neutral party to just talk to about whatever, I'm welcome to it. Take care, OP
Thanks for the tips, I'll keep them in mind. It's hard not to go back to complaining when I talk to friends, because it's what is mostly on my mind. I've struggled with self-worth all my life, though. My previous relationship, that lasted 4 years, also ended when she \*literally\* cheated on me. At least my wife had the decency of struggling with what was going on inside of herself and never acted while we were together, and actually didn't even "cheat" on me after we broke up and she met the guy.    But yeah, being 2 in 2 with relationships where my partner just... drifts away from me and invests herself into another relationship just... fucks me up. I can't deal with that anymore. It makes me feel like I just end up being not enough eventually.  And yeah, in a weird way, it has helped to keep contact with my ex. She has opened herself to me more than ever before, and at least I know she feels a *lot* of remorse for what she has done, and she keeps telling me I shouldn't blame myself.    I need to learn and accept myself for what I am, too. I feel like I often have too high standards for what I should be like in relationships (with friends, lovers and family) as I've always aimed for the top when it comes to job and studies. Hence why I always feel like I should just not bother anymore.  But I just can't help it. I feel like shit. The whole situation, and the inability to do anything about it right now, has awaken old injuries inside, and I can't get over it.
Thanks man, it really is appreciated. Even just knowing I'm not alone helps in a way. If you ever need to talk, I'm usually quite good at that, too.  And yeah, go Bills!
Thank you, that's really appreciated. I will keep your offer in mind. And all the best of luck to you throughout that shitty... thing we're currently going through.
It is hard - I always find that complaining had this weird curve... Where like complaining at first makes me feel better.. But then complaining too much really fucks me up you know? And I think it happens with a lot of people...  I'm sorry, but your wife is not much better than your first ex. Communication is key. I'm angry on your behalf - you seem like a decent person - why didn't she just talk to you about it? And she's right. You're no in the wrong here - she is.   She must have known about your ex - and she goes and does that during a fucking pandemic? Please. Cut her out of your life.   While youre in this weird space - get rid of the people that cause you anguish. I hate to say it - but she doesn't deserve your time right now. Your friends and family that have never hurt you like this? They deserve that time.  You should have a high standard. The issue is -. You haven't really keoy to it yourself? Like you should be aiming for the best epooel to be with, and the ebast jobs.. And best studies etc. It drives you. Whats happened here is you got unluxky. I'm being really critical of your ex wife here I know - but I'm trying to get some emotion out of you, like anger or something. You don't dewsrverto be treated like this. This is bullshit.  Once you start to feel again. Once yous tart to realise - hang on, this is fucked up? Then I think you'll be ready to move on.
Definitely not alone. Like I said, so freaking similar.  Yes! As a Giants fan I’m all for change in the AFC East. Get those Pats down a notch.  I was on the Browns bandwagon though. Can’t believe they blew that opportunity!
You're right, trust me, I often *did* tell her how what she did fucked me up, but I can't stay angry at people, I don't see the point. She recently told me she doesn't even understand *how* or *why* she did any of this. She knows she should have communicated with me, but we all have our flaws. She's had her fair share of *heavy* life obstacles (friends and family dying young, mother having a stroke and a cancer, father who commited suicide when she was still a child, etc) and we both know she heavily lacks when it comes to communication. And I hope what happened will help her to communicate better.  I mean, I don't blame myself for what happened, I know I couldn't have done much, but I wonder *why* this has happened to me in different but similar way in my two long relationships, you know?  And hell, I know I've hurt friends and family over time, to different degrees. I know I'm probably harder on myself than what they feel, but I really don't deal well with letting people down.  I generally have a lot of empathy for others and not that much for myself (see: how I talk about my ex). I don't see the point, as I previously said. I just... I don't know, I can't fully love myself yet. I hope I can someday, but I'm afraid my brain isn't wired that way. It never has been.
Haha, well, I don't think anyone expected Reid to call that on 4th and inches either!    But hey, now I just hope we won't see Brady in the SB *again.* C'mon.
Your last paragraph says it perfectly.  Why do you have more empathy for your ex who has literally done something horrible - and not for yourself? You're more important. A hell of a lot more important than her.  I think it's time that you "re-wired" your brain into loving yourself. Like honestly it'll make the world of difference to you. When it comes to your urrent situation - who are you letting down? Genuinely. Are you letting your ex down? Because quite frankly - she deserves it. Are you letting friends nsd family down? Well you're jot communicating with them.. But they'll get over it....  But yourself. How badly are you letting yourself down right now? I think quite highly. Take some time. As I said - completely cut off your ex - she really doesn't deserve your time. And  give yourself some space and start hat journey.  How do you love yourself the first thing I find thst helps is to face fact about yourself.. Whk are you? Look in a. Irror and rewlwlt see every part of you. Then maybe take up a hobby or two - aoemthing that only you could do - and soemthign that you've ever wanted to do... But do this for yourself only!
Seriously. I was admiring his brass set all night haha I wouldn’t mind seeing Rodgers get one more and you’re right if it also means Brady gets snubbed I’m cool with that.
Yeah, I have a problem with having empathy for myself. I'm looking forward to digging deeper into that when I start seeing a therapist next month.    Thanks man, I know it's a long path ahead to find some self-love buried inside of me, but let's hope it's gonna work out eventually.

No matter how what happens, it gets shitty everytime. I try my best to put the effort to someone I want to be with, but it back fires and I feel like an entire circus. They flirt, treat me like they want to be around me and do all these things for a little bit. God, I hate people and I hate myself for falling for the same garbage.
Sadly, I relate to this post :(

I don't even consider her my real grandma because of this now I feel like cutting her off and not even talking to her forever we've been thinking about being homeless on the street im tired of this

I have had thoughts of suicide, but I would imagine that everyone does at some point in their life. Depression for me really appears in episodes, usually only lasting 2-3 days. I have no frame of reference. I don’t know if this is normal, if it’s just because of puberty (I’m still very young), or if it’s really depression. I wish I could swap mental states with someone just to see...  I don’t have much motivation, but I don’t know If I’m just lazy. I feel tired often, but I don’t know is if it’s just because of my bad sleep schedule. I don’t like social interactions but I don’t know if it’s just because I’m so introverted. I’m very self conscious about my weight, but I don’t know if it’s because of puberty/school... I just don’t know.  is anyone else going through something like this?
It could be depression, yeah. Or it could just be puberty, stress, living in a pandemic... it's hard to say. If you're feeling unhappy, there's no shame in reaching out to a parent or teacher, or even starting therapy. You don't have to have an official "depression" stamp to benefit from just talking to people and getting worries off your chest, you know?
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzsg2p/how_do_i_help_a_friend_with_their_depression/
I really want to help a friend through their depression, but how can I do it when they themselves don't know why they are depressed in the first place?
Be available but not to the point that it’s holding you back. Check in on them occasionally and let them know you care. Spend time with them if possible. The biggest thing is to realize you can’t fix them but you can certainly help them along.
Be there for them when they need you, sometimes they won't even know when they need help. Your friend needs to do a lot of soul searching/deep thinking to find out what it is. Tell them to write down their thoughts and feelings and this can help narrow what it is that's bothering them. As someone who overcame this as well, it can take a long time. Your friend is fortunate to have you, and I hope that they get better.
Thank you so much for this!

The most important thing that I would like to hear right now is what I should do, I know that I can continue with my school but I also know that I need time to assimilate what is happening in my life and how I can be better with my mental health, I really want to continue living and the drxgs is one of the few things that have given me a greater sense of calm
[removed]
I would do it if I could, I live with my mother's cousin and I can't take a full year but probably a few months, I'll start from today, I just hope that taking this time doesn't affect my future for the worse

Sorry, this is going to be rather long. I’m new to this subreddit.    If we’re all going to die anyway, will it matter that Person A was a popular, attractive, and intelligent lawyer who lived in a nice house in the suburbs, who had a spouse, two children, and three dogs, and lived contentedly? Will it matter that Person B, (myself) accomplished nothing and spent all day in bed, phone in hand, staring mindlessly at a screen, reading toxic and hurtful blogs just to digitally hurt themselves? Will it matter in the end? Why even try if we are all going to die anyway? At least when I was religious I had some afterlife to hold on to. But what if that afterlife is worse? What if someone commits suicide thinking the grass is greener on the other side, only to find themselves in a pit of eternal damnation far worse than their previous pain, which pales now in comparison? Being atheistic has helped me in one way, by telling myself there’s nothing after death means no eternal pain, right? But then comes eternal emptiness and I believe that may be worse. I’m feeling so unmotivated.   For me, my main problems that:  I hate my disgusting body and face so much that no matter how hard I try, I will never compare. So why even try? Why go through that much effort and difficulty when giving up is so easy? But what then? What after the acceptance of nothingness?   My grades aren’t as high as they used to be after I skipped a grade and because of that I have so much regret. I’m very anxious for my future, because I need to get a neuroscience PhD, because it’s hopeless in this wretched economy to try to become an artist. But in the end, it won’t matter because we’ll all be six feet under. I’m just another sheep.  I feel selfish for making this post about myself. I really hope anyone still reading doesn’t mind. Although I highly doubt anyone is reading. I just need to type this to get it out of my system.  Why can’t I be feminine and ladylike? I try so hard to be a certain way, but I’m just so boring and empty and vapid. My very existence is meaningless. I have few friends who care about me. I doubt my parents would miss me, because their love is most certainly forced. I despise myself. But at the end of my life I’ll be the same as you or any other person. We are all meaningless and unimportant. The moment one of us dies, someone is having another baby to replace them. The world goes on, unchanged.
I can't say I have any answeres to your questions because i ask many of the same question myself but I can say that I know how you feel.   I wonder if its worth suffering everyday when eventually even if I don't kill myself it will all be gone after I am dead. Anything I have ever accomplished and any relationship ever made has no more meaning as I will not exist or have the capacity to even look back on my life. I think I am a waste of space and I know nothing will change with my death, I don't think my death would go noticed by anyone on this planet. If no one knows or cares about me when I am alive then living is essentially the same as being deal as there would be no difference if I am alive or dead. Honestly I have no idea what I am doing on about or if anything I rambled about made sense. I Hope you have a good night, I may not have any answers but maybe at least knowing I feel the same as you means something.
The end is always the same its the journey that matters.  i feel you. yeah, thats an eternal struggle of humankind, especially in the post religious world.   to answer your question bluntly and scientifically - (imo) no, there is no general point to life (except biological reproduction). Buuuuuut, that also means that we have the ultimate freedom. If there is nothing we MUST do here on earth, then we are free to do anything.   Thats like the whole idea of existential philosophy - that we need to find our sense of life ourselves and that we are free to do so.  What kind of art did you want to make?   Please, just remember that you dont have to do something just because you feel like thats expected of you. thats the freedom i was mentioning. just because a Person A thinks goals in life should be a PhD, a marriage, kids, business and luxury house does not mean that it applies to anyone else except himself and his own conclusions. The same another person can be a street artist with piercing, tatoos all over their body, be asexual and aromantic , childfree, and dont care about the money or admiration from others and still be content with themselves and happy. In the end it all does not matter.   The end is always the same its the journey that matters.   A person should preferably do what he feels good about doing. Riding s bike through the park, feeling the sunset on your skin walking, swimming, making music or doing art, walking dogs, watching amazing anime? whatever makes you feel something thats what you should do.  Regarding looks , thats something that i struggle as well. I can not accept my body and face. But i still believe that there is someone for everyone. I just try to become a better person.   I hope you have a great life
Someone in r/nihilism recently said 'I believe nihilism is an obvious truth that most humans are psychologically unequipped to deal with." Not all, but some forms of depression are dealing or not dealing with absurdity.   You hate your body. As an emotional reaction, you can temper this disgust through training. If you repeat a word you dislike enough times, eventually it loses its meaning. The same goes here. As something that is 'justified' outside of your sensory response, for example 'I'm *worthless* because I hate my face,' well, nihilism will destroy that. 'Worthiness' and 'deservedness' cease to be valid concepts.    After your resignation to nihilism, only pleasure and pain remain. Your selfishness ceases to matter, your worthlessness ceases to matter, your adherence to social concepts such as femininity ceases to matter. This will be a great reduction (not completely though) in suffering over these issues.    Meaninglessness is not a problem. It is a fact. We only think it is a problem because our human brains have a sort of inbuilt drive to teleology and because everyone around us baselessly asserts that it exists. The empty void inside nihilists doesn't go away, but is seen as a natural fact of existence, like a body part.

They went away for a little while.  Probably about three weeks.  But now they are coming back strong.  And to be honest. I'm scared.

so what to do when you hit rock, rock bottom, i literally have no one to talk to, no one loves me, no more feelings at all, no more things you wanna do and enjoy (it's for years like that, just recently lost the last enjoyment), you just live day by day for years with 0 enjoyment with one thought, death, and only things that are keeping me alive are my dog and cat, but i don't think for long, they deserve better owner
Sending a huge virtual hug! 💜 I’m so sorry you are feeling so low.  I have had thoughts like this before. But I promise you your cat and dog would not want anyone else, they want you!   Can you possibly take the pup out for a tiny stroll to try gaining some enjoyment from him/her.  Or if not feeling up to going out, play games with them?   It’s the smallest of things sometimes that can help 💜
thanks for the hug and i'm pretty sure they'd be happier with anyone else than me, i play with her everyday, but i really don't get any enjoyment nor happiness from it anymore, so i feel bad for both my pets, they really do deserve better
Perhaps you are putting your feelings to them?  I know (now) even on my ‘darkest days’ my boy wants to be with me to make sure I am ok.   Well done for managing to play with her 💜 There were times when I couldn’t do this. So you really are doing better than you feel 💜 It’s so hard to exit that spiral of negative thoughts/feelings.  I have only just recently managed to enjoy walking again. It’s felt such a chore for months now and felt awful when missing a day or two 🤦‍♀️ But remember they love us unconditionally 💜 (unsure on cats though 😜)
yea, she tries to make me feel happy too, but it's really just not working anymore, i am totally emotionless. And thanks I guess, i do it for her cuz no one else will, and yea, they really do love unconditionally, my cat too, maybe little less when she doesn't see me for few days, but she still do xD Walking is a pain to me, i don't do normal stuff for me neither, i don't know is it laziness or just not caring, i am in this state for 6 years now
When I was in this ‘frame of mind’ I called it Zombie mode. As I just didn’t feel anything or have any value for myself.  Eating, washing, dressing ect was a chore or didn’t happen.  It took a long time but I am slowly recovering 💜 I believe you will too 💜

Hey I’m depressed and it’s fucking lame.   Currently I’m going through a depressive episode and I’m on the mega sad part mixed with anger out of the blue.   I’m not at the debilitating point yet but I’m at the point where I need to hype myself up for 30 min to just get out of bed. Well I’m working on the hyping part. Mainly I just bully myself into getting up.   About 20 min ago I worked the courage to tell my s/o that I was sad but he didn’t hear me and I was too scared to bring it up again. I just froze like and deer in the headlights when he asked “wait what did you say?” it was hard to say it the first time and I’m working up the courage to reach out again. We don’t really touch on these topics much cause both of us are emotionally lacking  I’m not sure how tomorrow will go since I’m feeling like garbage right now. Fingers crossed that I get to work and I don’t have to interact with coworkers or they will probably know something is up.   With the world continuing to turn at a rapid pace while I’m at a stagnant is something I reflect about a lot. Knowing that everything is carrying on while I’m stuck in my thoughts is humbling.   You aren’t alone with how you feel though. The world maybe moving on but many of us are stuck together in the same place. We may feel alone but removing the tunnel vision can give us new perspectives.

I’m looking for recommendations or first hand accounts of online therapy applications. I’ve had issues with depression, BPD, and anxiety for most of my life. I have a long family history of people with severe mental health disorders. I’ve recently been unable to manage my mental health properly and am ready to seek out medicated assistance. I have insurance but don’t feel comfortable speaking face to face with someone so I’ve been looking into the online platforms such as Cerebal and ForHer which state they can prescribe medication. Has anyone used platforms like this for treatment? Would you recommend it?

A month ago, one of my friends, for whatever reason wanted to see me dick, which I said no. When they asked my size I told them 7. She then said "well every guy says that so you might have to prove it." I just kinda brushed it off at the time. Until recently. I've never sent a dick photo to anyone ever, and a few nights ago her and her friend started pressuring me to do it again.  She said "you know throwaway, I've seen other friends private parts but I've never seen yours." and I just responded with "no you haven't" and saying that I didn't really want to but that didn't stop them. We changed topics but later on she said something along the lines of "I need to see some dick" and her friend butted in agreeing with her saying "throwaway" and I just said "umm why do I have to be involved in this" and eventually I just told them I'd consider it, to which she said "you better." and her friend challenged me saying "well he says he's long soo"  I was left with two options. I would either keep being teased and challenged by them, or show her so they'd shut up about it. So I gave up, and sent her a picture with a tape measure to prove it yesterday. One of my biggest regrets ever. I've never taken a photo of my dick ever.. Let alone send it to someone. This is almost the most depressed I've been in a while since then. I don't want to leave the house. I feel like the whole world is judging me, laughing at me.. I'm going to fall back to cutting again..
Probably wants to slurp you up my guy but if not she’s just teasing you, my g if you got a 7 inch glizzy be proud of that shit.
The internet is filled with stories about people receiving unsolicited dick picks, and not only you've never done that, you had to be manipulated to send one. I am just saying that what they've done is wrong, but also that maybe you should feel better about your morals. The way you feel says that you were right all along, and now you've learned your lesson enough. You have my respect after all that happened.
i don‘t want to be offensive but this sounds more like a fake story than like a real story.   but i can understand that i never shot a single dick pics myself either and hell for sure i wouldn’t want it to send it to anybody.  i‘ve felt embarrassed cause i send pics of me without shirt trying to show off to some girls back in school and decided to never to that again.  sometimes i still send pics likethat to people too but only if its topic in conversation about something like a tattoo or a scar i recently got on my hipbone due to an accident.  i would be to scared of being blackmailed but if you really have 7 inches i think you should be blackmail save.  that friend of yours might be interested in you also at least in my experience i never had a woman ask for a dick pic just to have a proof.  why didn‘t you shut them up with if you want to see my dick and habe a proof you have to work for it to get hard and earn your proof. shoulda have stopped their mocking, at least thats what i would have answered.
Can you elaborate on what you mean by feeling better about my morals?
I don't think she's interested in me tbh I'm not sure what it was about. This is a real story and I could show screenshots, atleast of the aftermath.
Heavily simplified. We've all learned that those part are our privates and they are ours. If we decide to share it with someone, it should be both consensual and natural. However, many bother others, particularly women, with their unwanted advances using the pictures of their dicks. You said you haven't send a picture to someone before, not even took one. You are not like minded with those individuals that do, that is all.  More heavily simplified, I am glad you are not just sending your dick pic to every girl you see, with both respect to yourself and to the others.

I think my college debt just got sent to collections. I had gone to the college in person and they said they wouldn't do it and we could figure something out later as I had submitted an appeal and they said they'd wait for the appeal decision to come in first. So yeah. They lied to me. I just know I'm fucked. I feel some peace in knowing that if I die the debt goes with me.

I dont know how to feel. Ive never been this low before.
please help me
Noooo! :( Please never self harm again... Its a horrible thing to do :( some tips I have to avoid it are to be around people as much as possible, listen to some loud music or punch something soft as a substitute for emotions causing you to self harm. I hope you never have to do it again
please i know it's hard and that you are feeling terribly right now, but you have to promise yourself this will be the first and the last time. you can't do it again, it's really addictive. i wish you the best and i hope you get better really soon.
Pls! I ask you stop! This is dangerous and aint gonna help in nothing, so sit a little and relax even if for a little
yk i did this like 2 days ago, just one little cut on my leg, hardly any blood at all. and once tonight on my thigh just kinda cutting into the skin watching it tear but not deep enough to draw blood.  it's kinda comforting in a messed up way? idk maybe i'm just fucked.
I dont want to feel this way anymore, Ive been doing it all night like its nothing. It doesnt feel like anything like the cutting is just a motion you know?
please talk to me
Please stop. Do you want to talk?
yeah i understand but please don't harm yourself, is not worth it i promise
Look ive been through cutting myself before and today when  i look to those scars through out my body i only fell ashamed of myself to think that i thought this would be a solution for something.
na i'm good, not doing it to commit suicide or anything so it's alright.
I dont know why I did this. I did it once and then I kept on going and going
Either way it's still bad :( it's last point is not always suicide
It is addictive, you have to be strong to resist it, and i know that you are strong! your power of will is enough is enough to stop! To go for help! For something better!

**For obvious reasons, I'm using a throwaway account. I expect to be told It'll be ok but deep down I'm not ok and haven't been for years. This is my story:**  I’m 25 years old, I live in the UK and have an amazing wife and a beautiful 2 year old. I’ve had a life long fear which I feel if I don’t overcome, I won’t want to live past 30.. something I’m truly adamant about unless I find a way around this and live the life I dream of every night.  I’ve had a tough childhood like most though had no support in terms of oral health from my mum or anyone. At such a young age I had extra teeth which started to crook the rest pushing them forward, my mum and the school never encouraged this being removed or even considered braces. To this day I am in shock that the school didn’t flag this as neglect. Then came my first ever dental appointment due excruciating toothache. I had to have a very common dental procedure, root canal which truly changed my life as I had one of the worst painful experiences and resulted in temporary filling due to how painful it was. Long story short, I was told to raise my hand if I was in pain, my hands were touching the ceiling and the numbing agent clearly wasn’t working. As you can expect the temporary filling didn’t last long, without any choice I went back on my own however I didn’t make it past the door as I collapsed in fear. Years went by, the hole got bigger and finally resulted into gum. I wrote my heart out to the NHS asking to have further procedures whilst put to sleep and explained this was a genuine fear and that I’m in physical and emotional agony. They wrote back saying this was not a fear and as such I would not be entitled to being put to sleep for any dental procedures. The outcome of this letter could have changed my life, I applied privately and was told they can do the treatment but I would only be dazed and not put to sleep and left with gaps in my mouth. Since my oral health has been neglected though reduced sugar and routinely brushed my most recent assessment resulted in needing, I believe 9 teeth removed whereas back then it was only one. All this could have been avoided if it wasn’t for the negligence of the school, dentist and my own mum.  2014 was the day the world stood still for me, the day I developed anxiety and horrific depression and suicidal thoughts. Making it almost difficult to live my life and do the simplest of things like attending events, going to an interview or even pursuing my dream job becoming a police officer. This was the time when everyone partook in filming for the ice bucket challenge, I filmed my grandad, me and my mum and on review I saw how truly crooked my teeth were and at 19 wouldn’t be eligible for free braces. I developed a strong hatred towards my mum and locked myself away lied that the footage was corrupted and lived in my room with blacked out curtains, and eventually lost my job. I was prescribed anti-depressants and found day to day incredibly difficult knowing everyone is looking at my teeth. I had a rule when leaving the house, straight there and back, no in-betweens. I then found out about Invisalign thanks to a youtuber named Zoella, I did so much research and this encouraged me to get back on my feet, to get a job to pay for this treatment, I started a go fund me to get to that goal faster without success so I tweeted out asking about this, eventually was given a free Invisalign assessment. I had x-rays and the hardest part of my life was asked to open my mouth wide so she could take a picture with a DSLR, it took an hour to convince me reminding me of the before and after photos and eventually when she took the picture, infinite tears rolled down my face. On my way home I was so depressed I contemplated jumping in front of a train and the only thought that stopped me was getting that perfect smile and being able to start my life fresh. The assessment results came back, saying I was not eligible as I had damaged molars and would need 5 removed and would have gaps for the rest of my life. I also looked into braces and another invisible braces treatment but with removal of my molars I would not be eligible anyway as they are required for any type of teeth straightening treatment.  Early 20’s I built up the courage to go to the dentist as I was still even to this day relying on pain killers to get me through the week. I cried walking all the way to the dentist, I cried laying in the chair, the woman who assessed me judged me, kept telling me how I failed and had the worst teeth she’s ever seen, whilst telling her colleague whilst laughing the numbers of my teeth and saying they were either gone or beyond repair. When I got up, she said you will need to have 9 teeth removed and I shouldn’t have eaten so much sugar and that I was a stupid boy for getting it this far. She even laughed in my face saying she was surprised how healthy my wisdom teeth were. My fiancé was outside so proud of me eager to hear good news as I walked out and I cried lifelessly in her arms telling her they made me feel like the worst person in the world. My now wife stormed in and made a serious complaint, the owner took me in tried to reassure me and laid me down, apologised and said he would look after me and gave me free box of toothpaste. I still broke down in front of my wife this time while in the chair and clearly as I am having to write this wasn’t enough to encourage me to go back as it was clear it was all about money and not how I felt.  My wife doesn’t know this but everyday I eat chewing gum, swish mouth wash or brush my teeth so many times a day to cover the decay and horrendous bad breath. It’s had a knock-on effect with my relationship I can’t even bring myself to kiss my wife in the morning without fearing I have bad  breath. I almost cancelled our wedding thinking my teeth would be on show in the pictures. I developed a lottery addiction in hope I could pay for the Jimmy Carr treatment, have all my teeth smashed in and starting fresh like you see on embarrassing bodies. The smallest of hope I have left. I don’t want the fake celebrity look. I just want to know what it’s like to naturally smile, not be in constant agony and not have to hide bits of broken teeth/blood that fall out nearly every time I brush. All I want is no noticeable gaps, reassurance and straight teeth whilst being put to sleep. But it’s clear that this is an unrealistic dream and fear I will have to end my life to end this lifetime of torture. I don’t know how much longer I can live with this.  You know it’s funny, we’re in a pandemic and conveniently I can wear a mask in public and be myself without feeling judged. I dread the day this is no longer necessary, and don’t look forward to having to open my mouth for a covid swab!  So yeah, that’s the story of how my life ended, I question as I type this if I should delete this and stop being a coward as there are so many people worse off but I guess this is my last cry for help. I’m not asking for sympathy I just want to smile.
You have endured a lot. I am in the US so our dental system is different but we have people here who do not see a dentist until they absolutely have to and to be treated the way you have been would have been intolerable. Your wife sounds amazing! It seems like she really cares for you and wants to support you. If this has been bothering you for a long time maybe you are exhausted and the emotional weight is too much for one person to bear alone. It makes sense to want help, and you deserve to be supported. Too often we disregard the impact physical issues have on our mental wellbeing. This does not make you a coward, its another way of expressing pain.

OK so I feel like I should talk this out, but to be honest, I don't trust nobody in my family enough to talk about this or to seek professional help through them.  Ok so some necesary facts about me, I'm 18, I have asperger syndrome and ADHD, and I've had slight suicidal thoughts for as far as I can remember. I've been to psychologists before, but it was mostly to "treat" my ADHD.  OK so most of the time I feel "normal" as I try to keep myself occupied in some way or another during the day, but it is when I'm not doing something that all my self-deprecating thoughts arise. I start to think stuff like I'm worthless, useless. I feel likeI can't satisfy anybody emotionally-wise. I feel like I haven't accomplished anything in my life.  The problem I have is that, when I calm down, I can see that it is all lies told by myself, to myself. Like, I  in college full time with good grades and a scholarship that covers most of my tuition, that should prove that I'm worth something, right? Yet I cannot Avoid feeling like trash sometimes.   I have said to myself that I'm happy most of my life, without really thinking about it, what does it really mean? What does it feel like? But at the end I always end up proving me wrong, I am not happy, and I'm not sure I have ever been.   I have thought about killing myself before yes, but at the end I think it's just better to keep on living because of the amount of resources that have been expended on me, but if it wasn't because of this, the world would be better without me.   I'm tired of pleasing other people, of trying to make them happy, or not angry at least, but of I commit the most microscopic error, I start to spiral into depressive thoughts. Its not like I have to be nice to people or anything, but I think I'm more useless If I am not like this, the thing is, I do it at the cost of my own happiness.   I just want to be happy...
So there's a few techniques that can be used here. I want to try and tackle the sprilaling affrr making a mistake.  I want you to delibratly make a "mistake". Do something - and make a mistake. And I want you to let it unfold. What happens with that mistake? Does it change the world? Does it hcnahe you? Honestly - the chances are that that mistake has done nothing. In a school setting, your grade might be slightly loser - but quite frankly that doesn't mean anything at all.   When you make a mditake in Future I want you to try this - before you spiral, take a deep breath and count to five in your head. When you come back - consider what the consequences are of the mistake. But not from your point of view. Pretend like your best friend made that mistake. Now give them advice. Let's see if that helps you?   If that helps - I want you to try it with the self depreciating thoughts. I understand what adhd can do - an overactive kind is going to make you be really hard on yourself in a lot of situations. Hence why I think if you saw yourself as a "friends / loved one" instead of.. Yourself - it might help to control these feelings?

But I try real hard, I'm not great at social interactions but I'm trying my best, I don't eat like trash, I'm applying for a lot of job (programmer) and taking medecine for depression. Two days ago I had a mental breakdown, I needed my best friend but we mostly argued, it hurts me and I feel like shit. I'm so lost, the lockdown in France don't help of course, I don't know what to do anymore to get better. I'm tired of trying.

im a university student stuck in one room every single day. I spend thousands on an education that doesn't teach me anything and doesn't interest me. I used to love learning and now what little money I've saved up from working through highschool has been spent on zoom calls and emails. even the things that used to bring some joy during the beginning of quarantine are now unavailable or still leave me feeling nothing. what even is the point of it all? maybe giving money to people who already have far too much.

You know you’ve hit rock bottom and how fucked up you are when you contemplate suicide but what stops you isn’t some inner realization it’ll get better, or that your life has value but that your brain goes.., can’t do that think of the inconvenience you will cause.   That’s right I’ve gotten so used to giving and doing for others that I feel like I can’t be selfish and leave someone else to clean up my death. If I could still laugh...
Another way to look at this.. Is that you know deep down that you have friends and family that really do care for you - and you're death isn't an income - but it would absolutely devestate them.  Have you reached out to those friends and told them about these thoughts? / have you reached out to anyone?
One, you aren't a throwaway person you are an amazing person deserving of love and care. I really understand how you feel... I don't want to be here anymore but I feel too selfish if I killed myself. I'm here if you need to talk... But I hope you feel better soon
Actually I don’t I have reached out but it’s like I’m screaming at the top of my lungs but no one hears me. I am expected to be the strong one, the problem solver, the one who doesn’t cry...if I reach out to friends and family it becomes let me talk about problems can you do XYZ to help. If it’s interpersonal conflict it’s let me tell you how you doing XYZ hurt me and that’s why I did XYZ for years. I can tell them exactly what I need and it’s the same. I mean the one time I did try to kill myself...I took pills, chased it with more wine than I could ever handle...one of my fiends literally left me there to die. So meh I saved myself...when the tables have been reversed and they have been I show up, I rescue, I find resources, I solve problems....but honestly I don’t get the same. I’ve faced the facts that I’m surrounded by those who either on in a capacity mentally to see beyond themselves, are too broken or just don’t give shit. I mean I get it, I do my problems, feelings..whatever are mine and just mine. I’ll limp along as long as I can, keep doing until I can’t and hopefully I’ll die sooner rather than later. But thank you sincerely for taking the time to respond. I appreciate it
I hope u get better OP, i know it’s hard, I feel the same way. But I hope you can find some purpose or a nice hobby u can do just for you where you can be happy and finally focus on just you! We are all rooting for you!!
OK so the feist thing that jumps at me k is thst sometimes other people do not truly understand what you are going through.  We as humans tend to expect other to understand our position - but that's orectjcalky impossible! Why? They are not in your shoes - they really do not know who you are, and why you are feeling like this. I really do think you should just say to the ones you really trust - heys guys.. I'm drowning, please help me.  I'm terms of the "friend" that left you - they are not friends. If youh feel like all of your friends are like them - then I suggest it's time that you considered changing the groups around you.  You feel used, I get it. Try joining a new class or aoemthing - hut getting a friend that cares as much for you as you will for them seems to be something I think that will help you a lot.  And yes. You deserve to be cared about. You absolutely do.

I have an ever waking feeling of guilt and sadness of every waking moment knowing I hurt the one true person I love because my depression got in the way and made it feel right that when we broke up i decided she better off having me be the bad guy, so our whole friend group turned agenst me when I yelled at her for ironicly trying to help. But in the end my heart acks and to know I yelled and may never see that smile again is soul crushing. It hurts I don't know why I decided to do this but u regret every word, any time I even slightly raised my voice and now that she's gone I can't be happy my heart hurts

I took an edible for the first time in my life recently. I've never felt more alive. I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder and taking 100mg of Sertraline daily (I skipped it the day I took the edibles). But while I was high on the edibles, I felt so alive! So fun, free...as if I didn't have this mental illness. There's got to be a cure, rather than a temporary fix like weed edibles or antidepressants.
The medications and therapy is a cure. Only difference is that they won't harm your body and will take a bit longer. Edibles do and you'll get addictions which will be much worse and they might show side affects because you are taking medications.

Im in a horrible situation and i can't change anything because i have no possibilities and money, everything i always wished for my life will never be true. I have nothing and i cant do anything for that, im stuck with a pathetic life and i just want to end all this pain once for all.
**I don't feel anything, and don't give a shit about anyone. Just don't want to talk to them. There positivity can't change my mind and feels uncomfortable around these people**
Everyone has creative and destructive energies. You need to explore your creative potential and try and leave destructive energies behind. Everyone has hidden potential but you need to focus on positive energies and what you can personally create for people. The emotion you have will not go to waste if you push yourself to create things that you can communicate to others.
I have money but i dont have posibilaties because i'm in the positions that my life is completly messed up
wow, this is so accurate with my life too. I could have written this myself. especially the part about "everything i always wished for my life will never be true" so just know that you are definitely not alone!
I nearly failed a board exam because I couldn't pull myself together. I'm still thankful for that one guy who let me copy his math solutions. Wouldn't be here today without you pal.
Isn't it wonderful to not have to be a slave to a shit system filled with shit people? It's a dream, to not be rotting in this fucking society of morons, spending all your days worrying about stupid bullshit. Freedom, or the living perception of it, takes money and personality...
Not to be that guy, but 5 years ago I was in a similar situation with similar thoughts. I still am very depressed and often think of suicide, but I was able to change my external circumstances and life is a bit better.   It was extremely hard but I was able to use staying busy to make a better life (pursuing education, job) that it helped a bit with distracting me from the pain and gave a glimmer of hope. I felt like giving up everyday and don’t know how I did it, but here I am.   If you feel suicidal now, what do you have to lose by throwing everything you have into getting into a better situation. If you still want out several years from now, the option is still on the table.   I know depression is an organic illness, but external factors and a support system can mitigate it. You’re not pathetic, you’re in a lot of pain. Just writing this post shows that you can advocate for yourself and are self-aware.   Can you find a work from home job so you work on your schedule and save a bit of money?  Setting even the smallest goal can help. Have you tried medication? Meditation? Other distractions?   It’s an awful paradox with depression that everything sucks and our mind works against us making it hard to accomplish tasks, while also knowing that we have to push past those things to push forward with life. Be forgiving of yourself, you don’t have to be defined by your circumstances or other people’s definition of success.
Some people's lives are just doomed to be constant suffering. We drew the short straw
My mother controls my savings and it gives depression for me. :/
And i'm ugly as shit :( i hate my self
I don't have anyfriends 0 my social network empty

Glad you saw something in it :)
You right , but i have money im not happy , i even dont have social network
Money doesn't bring happiness mate. There is a mysterious force that always adds the worst in everything. I'm privileged, my family has money but we are so fragmented and they are on the border of divorce cause of this, family became so materialistic that they ignored their own children only to gaslight them whenever they would feel anything negative. We feel too, we have feelings and most of the "rich" kids I know are all fucked in the head.

Covid i cant do that :(
Get off this sub. You are doing exactly what others had done which led me to the miserable state I am. Do you not realise how you are gaslighting me?  And the divorce isn't for money. Its because they have an extremely unhappy marriage. Money, just like power, in excessive quantities will corrupt. I'm not saying money can't fix things, but I'm saying that you can 100% be depressed and have money, and at that point not a lot of money can save you.

Yes actually. This is my personal experience, it's kinda the reason I ended up in this subreddit. And seeing these kind of messages here is hurtful man.
Then you depresed money dosent help you:( for losers either
Oh no, I know that. I was just going against your disgusting point of "people dont fuck you up"
[removed]

"People don't fuck you up, they just reflect back what's in you already."   "Your rapist is done with you, you're just fucking your self up now. Use your money and get a great therapist and go see the world you rich fuck."  It's not that easy to fix yourself up even if you have money to see the world or go to therapy. Rape is something seriously traumatic and messed up.
Well its not if it was how you say it , i will now sit here around in the reddit
You are such a vile being. You have nothing in your heart but hatred, I was angry but now I just feel sad. I'm sorry you turned out like this.

I can feel the anti depressants kick in. I can feel them wear off. Whether it is completely psychological or not. There is a time of day, everyday, usually around 2 hours before I take them again that I think about killing myself consistently. Then I take them and I am numb. The urge to die is still there, but I am too apathetic to do anything. I feel like I am just in this cycle of pushing down this urge, until one day I slip and give in.  How I want to give in. Why does it have to be so complicated. I know what I want to do. I’ve always known. Those who know me best know. It’s unenviable. Unless something manages to take me out first, I will die by my own hand. I have been waiting so long. It’s the only thing that excites me when I think about the future. Soon. It will all be okay, so soon.

The world is so grey and unsatisfying compared to how I used to see it. I used to be a straight A student and I used to genuinely enjoy every day. I started to view school as something that I could get through with ease and I could push everything off to the last minute. Now I can barely pass any of my classes and rarely even attend online school. It started to get really bad when covid hit last year and I completely let go of any sort of schedule I had. I started sleeping all day and staying awake all night without a care in the world because school was indefinitely cancelled. It was a relatively worry free summer until school started back up again. It was online school and we basically had to manage ourselves to get everything done with little to no outside help. This is when everything started falling apart. My self discipline skills were exercised and it had turned out I had no self discipline at all. I miss school almost every single day because I have no motivation to get out of bed. I constantly wonder what I’m doing with my life and if the path I’m on now is gonna get any better. Often times late at night I’ll tell myself that I need to get better and pull myself together but by the time I wake up in the morning I have no energy to act on it. I spend every waking hour of my day questioning my choices. There are times when I’m genuinely happy but they don’t happen very often. Whenever I’m invited to go out and do something I really want to, but I always end up wanting to be at home shut in my room doing nothing. I have constant anxiety about school and how I’m a failure and how I’m disappointing everyone that I know. I want to get that motivation that I once had back but it’s so damn hard. I never want to move anymore and the very few things that I’m passionate about are starting to seem unfulfilling and boring. It just feels like I’m crawling through life blind. I don’t want to die, I just want this all to stop and I don’t know what to do. I just need advice for how I can get motivated. I feel like if I don’t start now then I’m going no where.
Motivation doesn’t last, discipline does. It sucks but you have to start at the little things. Take care of yourself better, clean your room, work out. It’s not going to get better after one “good” day but rather a few weeks or months even.
I’m in the exact same position as you. Although, I have been forcing myself to exercise once a day and I gotta say it definitely helps with motivation.

This is the first serious thing, and personal experience of torment I'll be presenting in an online setting, or even any setting period. I've always mainly just been pedantic or light hearted about my struggles or the down falls of the world, but honestly at this point I just need to express a serious thought for once at least.  I've been in a bad place for a while. A long while. I've always had these cycles of happiness > anger > sadness > hopelessness > repeat, and I could deal with it because I knew eventually the negatives would end and I could enjoy my life again. The last year or more, the happiness portion has been shorter and shorter, and increasingingly less significant. While it used to be I could learn an instrument, talk to family, spend time with friends, and generally enjoy any possibility of life, these days the happiness is just a brief relief of perpetual self torment and animosity for my own existence. The worst part about it is that even that brief relief has been less and less long. Now it has come to be stages of anger and sadness and relentless hopelessness last weeks, months, maybe even a year, and the relieving period can be just a moment, a single moment of "huh, that's alright," before the continued dread.   I recently returned to work from a procedure for a physical ailment and that week or 2 weeks off was the only time I had to fully process myself and enjoy whatever nothing there was I had to do. Now I'm back at work and finding it impossible to do even a single task a single call anything without hating every second of it. Days are going by so slowly because of this constant repulsion with every single second of doing anything, to only end the day with not doing anything but doing bullshit waiting to sleep, only to wake up and do it again. My life feels like I am in a perpetual loop of waiting for something, but I have realized what I am waiting for is just a reason to live, a reason to do anything at all, to just keep thinking even; I now know that what I am waiting for is nothing, and it simply cannot come to save me.   I have tried to get a day, just one extra day off work a week, rather than this draining 5 day 8 and a half hour a day work week, I can have a little wednesday break between. I requested this in Hope's I could maybe use that for my dread break and finally enjoy my actual weekend, but ultimately the request was rejected, so I can't even determine if that would help. Sure I could see a professional, get a stress leave for some time to think, but I am just coming back from a leave. I can't afford to go on a leave every time I hate everything, and after I just requested days off, they wouldn't take that well when I return.   I always hear people who have been or are depressed, people who look to help others with advise on dealing with it. The common response anyone will say, is the common trope: "it gets better," I very much hope no one else in a bad place is reading this, because I need to say that... it doesn't, not for everyone, it may very well get worse. Maybe you'll have some high points, but it's a blinking light in the void, and if you try and find it you'll just be disappointed to find it's just as dim when you do.   I've given up on hoping for the next brief period of happiness to enjoy anything, I give in to this tormented existence. There's no worry of my life, I'm far from suicidal, suicide requires motivation in action, I have lost any of that I may have had left. I simply accept that I'll just never be happy again, I accept that I am just an empty shell and am done looking forward to anything other than that.    This isn't me asking for any help, god forbid anyone actual read this whole essay of my life. I just needed to express some thoughts as a form of therapeutic relief and to really see where I am as it's hard for me to figure out who I even am sometimes.
Hope is an interesting feeling.  Hole does nor guarantee anything - but it provides expectations right? When I say I hope that I'll get better.. I'm expecting to get better.  Don't lose hope. Don't lose expectation. Your second to last paragraph states that you don't think it is possible - but honestly it is :)  Don't forget the surrounding world right? We are in the midst of a massive pandemic. From the sounds of you as a person, you like to be social - you like to talk to people, and quite frankly that's hard to do right now.  So I'm going to say something here which some people will dkavree wtoh, but I agree. With you in not going on sick leave again - not for your reasons, which I'll get into in a second, but because when you're going through a depressive episode - you shit everyone off from you. Force yourself to keep on going into work - and seeing people. Maybe - even just try to focus on work, don't think about anything else.. And see it as a bubble of sort?  However, if work is aoet of the reason why you'd eel like this - maybe its time to just quite and find a new job? Or search for a new job while at this one?  I've noticed that you seem to have some sentiment against yourself. Like you can afford to take time off for your own mental welbeing. You seem to fmbe quite hard on yourself - which there's no need to be?   The cycles of happy Ness that you mention is exactly what depression is. Once you "recover" the hope is that the bad days are few and far between - which they will be eventually. Right now you are having a lot of bad days together.  Coupling in the self hardness, with the pandemic and the loss of socialising - yes its hard. Don't be so hard. On yourself. It is h hard right now - you are doing well.

Hi all,   I totally understand what y'all go through. A large majority of people on this group are teenagers.   To give my two cents to the world, I started this podcast where I have a guest coming over (another student), and we talk about issues the youth of today faces, and their possible solutions.  Please do check it out.   You can find it's link on Instagram @ SoulTalk.byWasif  Life is not worthless. The reason y'all are here today in this world is for a reason. Find that reason.   A common quote that resonates with me is 'He who has a why, can get through any how.' Find that why.  I kind of find mine by starting this podcast, and trying to help people in any way I can. I feel peace whenever I can help someone; you will too, that's how nature fashioned us as.   Love you brothers and sisters, and hold onto life. You guys are all amazing in one way or another. stop comparing yourself to others.  Thanks
i am not sure that majority here are teenagers. plenty of adults crushed by "adult life". i am 25, but i guess mentally i am still a teenager lol. good on you for trying to help tho. keep itvup

I never bothered to make any New Year’s resolution, but my lifestyle has changed since the start of 2021. I did everything to make me feel like myself, and happy. Those positivity tips posts, pastel motivational quotes and printing out things I specifically enjoy looking at to put on my wall worked for a moment. The carefree feeling of having a dance party inside my bedroom at night was just temporary.  Turns out, once I have become like this, I can’t be ‘normal’ again. There’s always this dark cloud inside my mind telling me you can never be the same again. Things will only turn out to be worse. I got my life together but I still feel like there is something seriously wrong. I can’t find words to describe my it anymore. It’s been years. All of my teenage years, since I was 12, I have been battling with depression and anxiety.   Almost got hit by a car today. 100% that driver’s fault. But for a split second I was wondering what can I do to end this pain. There’s plenty of things ahead of me, like entering my dream university. But they are starting to become less exciting, one by one.
For me, depression has always been there, just to what degree. It’s not about getting rid of it but rather, living with it. We just got to keep pushing, I got know that’s not what you wanna hear and it’s not what I wanna hear either but it’s the truth.

I want to talk and share some experiences that i have.  So, hi!  Something that i realise is... rely on outside opnions can make more harder to get out of this hole that u are.  My experience. Force routine, exercise... etc  This things FOR sure can be good for you, but at least me, i cant keep it up. And makes me feel more miserable after some time.  After some much time spend on, how I get out this hole steps. Im trying to figured out my own way. You can say im fool, but, believe or not, its working for me.  I don't have the perfect routine set, but i slready can get up early if I want, and sometimes i do.   I don't feel so much miserable like before. Im learning how to enjoy the things i do, even if doesnt mean I can get something of it. Makes me feel good, its already great. (Life it's not just about having job and earn money btw)  I still have some issues with myself, sometimes I get a little down, but nothing as effective as before.   As far the most great that im feeling for while.   Some advice. U can listen what ppl have to say, can be great for you. But, listen what u really want, and just go for it.

I want everyone to be proud of themselves that they are taking up the fight against this disease. Often it is and it is so with everything that we want everything right now, immediately, as soon as possible. We forget that the healing process is a long process, marked by a lot of effort. We take small steps that bring us closer to our goal, although we do not see it now and they seem silly and meaningless to us like everything else, but they bring us closer to recovery, did you get out of bed today, brush your teeth or eat something today, or maybe you just didn't have the strength for anything and you just lay in bed OK! next time you will definitely succeed. Please be nice to yourself and don't punish yourself if you don't do everything, it's normal when you're depressed. Unhealthy perfectionism really isn't good. Be proud of small steps, hold on !! <3

Tldr: i was ghosted by my employer twice.  So i'm a filipino, i had this client from north carolina for 2 years, I used to make her photo booth templates. We became close friends to the point that she became comfortable asking what techniques she should do to get more booking. And I did. I even made her facebook page which gained her lots of new clients. She was so kind, gives me tip for making her orders on time etc etc. There were times where i just make her orders and send all the files to her, and she just sends me the payment even without reminding her. But one time after sending her my work which she approved she just ghosted me.   I told myself It's okay, it's just 20 bucks anyway.   Then after 10 months she contacted me again. she said she have a new business, a home decoration business. I was happy for her because it seems like her business was taking off. She asked me again to make a page, logo, banner, etc. After finishing it, she then paid me. We talked again like nothing happened before, we asked each other how we were and how my business was going (mine was not operating anymore btw) and hers was just very successful for a start up business. She asked me again how to make her page successful so I gave her my knowledge. She then offered me a job of being her social media content creator and manage her fb page as well. I gladly accepted it but she ghosted me again.   What made me so sad is that she's now applying all the knowledge that I taught her. How did I know? Because all of her pages that i made for her are still connected to my fb profile because she told me that she doesn't want me to "leave" the page so that if she has questions, I can just answer it right away.   I should've known that it will happen again but my stupid self still belive that there's still kindness in human.

This ain’t as serious as some of the other people on this site but I though I should put it here if anyone has advice  So I’ve been working out recently with family but all they do is compare me to people and criticise how I work. I reflect that criticism can help you grow but my confidence is fading aswell as that I ain’t the smartest person in school and test and that are getting to me. I feel ugly lack confidence and have no real skills.   With few exceptions like listed above my parents are good people but they argue a lot and their the type of people that don’t like to admit their wrong. I’m not worried there gonna divorce or anything but it’s always in my mind and sometimes it’s hard to block out.   I’m bored shitless of this get up, do some shit  life style and I know that’s life but if that’s all there is to it (not to sound suicidal cause I’m not) but what’s the point then.  Sorry for this block of text and advice or support  would be greatly appreciated thanks. -H

Not really sure that this is the right sub, if not feel free to direct me elsewhere. So last year I got pretty bad and wasn't able to motivate myself to do anything, I could barely find a reason to get out of bed. I'm quite a bit better now and I have been getting some work done but it's mostly admin and busy work that I am stretching out to take up time. I just can't seem to start on the actually important big stuff. It's like in my head it's this mountain that I'll never be able to move so I don't even try. I know people say to break it up into smaller things but even the smaller things seem insurmountable. Does anyone have any tips or methods to motivate yourself to get up and do the hard things? Again if I'm in the wrong sub I'm sorry.
No tips, tbh just doing them everyday and making them a habit. But then again you probably shouldn’t take advice from me.

So my ED clinician told me to “give it another week” and I honestly don’t feel anything not sadness or happiness this week just neutral but last week I had spoken to her about my SH for the first time and even suggested it may be depression   It just feels like I have to be sad all the time but when I have my moments it either lasts a week or I delve into SH
Can you just confirm what SH means?   Why did your clinician say ‘give it another week’? Another week until what?
SH = Self harm   She stated that I may just be having a down period like everyone, so she said to give it another week before she can make any decisions
Ah ok. Thanks for that.    I don’t have any experience with SH, I’m afraid I can’t be too much help. I’m not sure if it can be a one time deal but in terms of what’s going on in your life, do you know what’s triggered this down period? Are there any changes you feel you can make to potentially bring you back to a sense of balance?
My low self esteem is what brings me down mostly but I genuinely feel like I can’t prove areas of my life, like I’m losing control all over again (explains the eating disorder) so I just sit with this emotional suffering waiting for it to pass or indulge in SH motives because I know going back into my eating disorder isn’t an option   I can feel when an emotional breakdown is arising too, I will feel practically shit all week then one day it’ll just be like as if all the emotional baggage has been dropped on me   Thank you for your help!

I don't know what to do this last week I've been trying to kill myself but for some reason I can't. I'm starting to think about telling my parents but I don't know how they would react or how I would even begin telling them. What should I do?
Yes. Tell anyone you love and trust. You are not alone. Don’t try to solve it alone.
Definitely should tell them. Of course you will be struggling to tell them about it. I was kinda in similar situation. You might be asking yourself questions like "What if they be mad about it?", "What if they don't take this seriously and say about me to everybody?" etc. I would recommend starting conversation slowly. Tell them how are you feeling, what's the reason of it. Now you should see if they have taken this seriously or not. And now the most important which was the most helpful in my case. Plan a visit with depression therapist. If you're over 18yo you can do it yourself without any struggle. If not try to convince your parents, to take you to therapist. He can give you some nice advices and prescribe antidepressants. You may be thinking that you don't need therapist as I was thinking, but trust me you won't regret it later.

I’m not tired, I’m depressed.  I’m not rude or stuck up, I have social anxiety.  I’m quiet because I never know what to say.  When I’m spaced out it’s because I’m imagining myself in world where I’m happy with myself and people are happy to be around me.  I know you’ve probably talked about me when I’m not there. Saying things like I’m so weird and awkward. I know I am.  It’s not that I don’t like you or don’t want to be around you, I just find comfort in isolation because I know I’m safe.  I don’t tag along or initiate conversation because I feel like a bother. I feel like my presence is annoying so I’d rather save everyone the trouble.  I’m really nice to people because I’m a people pleaser that’s afraid to stand up for themselves and even more afraid of confrontation. I just let people walk all over me.  I’m always out by myself not just because I’m independent, but because I’m alone.  My thoughts consume me to the point where I deeply hate myself.   I can’t tell you any of these things because I don’t feel comfortable talking about my true feelings. I’m also afraid of judgement and don’t want to hear “toughen up” or “you just gotta try.” It’s never been that easy.  So instead I keep these things to myself, damaging myself more and more day by day.
I feel the same way. I tend to imagine myself somewhere happy too. I never talk to anyone at my job and i’m so anxious it hurts sometimes.

just dumping my woes here. i haven’t talked to anyone about what im going through because i can’t.  i dealt with pretty severe alcohol dependence from age 18 until shortly after my 23rd birthday. i was hospitalized at 18 and diagnosed BPD, but haven’t had any mental healthcare treatment since then. the borderline diagnosis started to seem ill-fitting as i got older and now im pretty sure i have MDD with psychotic features. it’s like a psychological manifestation of a dubstep remix of a Scandinavian death metal band covering all of Hospice by the Antlers. that’s what it feels like inside my head 30% of the time, the other 70% is just radio static. the vibes are absolutely disgusting in here. anyway, i drank heavily almost every day for about 5 years. i almost never drank alone, and i realize now that the drinking was mostly due to social anxiety mixed with loneliness. i turned 24 in december and i have no friends. i don’t mean that in like a quirky “haha i have no friends 🤪” kind of way, i mean i don’t have any friends at all. in 2017 my best friend died. i don’t think i ever really processed it, or frankly anything else traumatizing ive ever gone through in my entire life. when i was drinking i had friends at the bars but since i quit i haven’t spoken to any of them, for obvious reasons. i haven’t been able to make real friendships easily because im very uncomfortable around anyone i don’t know, and now it feels like im too old to make any.  in december 2019 i started dating my (now) fiancé, and did acid for the first time. the promise LSD has shown for addiction treatment is no joke, because after 5 years of alcoholism, a handful of insufferable AA meetings and several failed attempts at sobriety, i stopped drinking. the desire for it went away completely, and i didn’t have another drink until this past New Years when i drank one glass of red wine. still no cravings. the social anxiety went away, the immobilizing depression and thoughts of suicide went away. it was a miracle. i was making art again, after not doing anything besides work and give myself alcohol poisoning since i was 18. i was in a wonderful, healthy relationship with someone i love very much.  then the pandemic hit. we both lost our jobs in march, and since my lease was up i moved into his 1 bedroom apartment so he could afford rent and so we could quarantine together. it was fast, but even now i know it wasn’t a mistake. our feelings haven’t changed, but both of our mental illnesses and the state of the world have made things harder. until the middle of July i was still doing great, despite the chaos of the world. but then i started having really bad panic attacks every day. i thought they were seizures at first, or maybe migraine auras because i was having full out of body experiences— Alice in Wonderland syndrome among other visual distortions.  it sounds like HPPD but i had those experiences as a kid all the time, long before id ever done psychedelics. i would wake up in the middle of the night frequently and have this overwhelming sense of terror, like nothing around me was real, and like i wasn’t real either. i didn’t want to wake my mom up because she had my little sister to take care of and my dad was abusive, so i would just lay in my bed at night watching the fabrics of my reality fray at the seams and wait for the sun to come up. sometimes i would sing to myself. i think ive been depressed and anxious since i was 9-10 years old.  back to present day. once the panic attacks subsided, the depersonalization/derealization lingered, and i plummeted into (now) the worst depression episode i have ever experienced. im useless. miserable, empty, helpless. back and forth between delusions about how the reason why im so depressed is because im being punished by some higher beings for attempting to experience happiness and health. delusions that my fiancé is poisoning me as part of a complex human experiment by the CIA. delusions that when i sleep, a government agent astral travels into my brain to take away the parts of me that make me human, or that ive been replaced by a computer, or that none of my life is real and im just a robot who’s been programmed with human memories. falling asleep every night with bizarre flashing images of my loved ones being killed projected in my eyelids. is that normal? i could go on and on.  i have no relationship with my dad. he moved out when i was 13 and hasn’t made an attempt to be in my life, even when he did live with me. i just found out he has stage IV colon cancer and he wants me to come visit. i don’t harbor any resentment. the past is the past and staying angry about it does nothing for anyone. ive felt that way for years, but now i feel like I have a fucking gun to my head to try to rebuild some sort of relationship with him. like i don’t have enough time and the more pressure there is the more insurmountable it seems. i get to this level of overwhelming stress about everything, even the fucking dishes when they pile up in the sink so you can imagine the type of stress im under now.  on top of that, we have to pack all of our stuff to move 2 hours away in 8 days. ill be 2 hours away from my family and i don’t even know how to drive. the only real discernible reassurance that i am a real person will now be even further from my reach.  none of our unemployment payments have been sent since the end of december, and it’s our last week in the city. i was hoping to see my little sister before we left, take her shopping and make sure she’s okay, but we have no money so i have no way of getting to her now. if the payments don’t come in the next couple of days, i won’t be able to say goodbye. there’s so much that’s weighing on me and i can’t even force myself to get in the shower most days. the little things that help me get through the day are all out of reach and basic day to day self care is now unattainable not just because im depressed, but because i don’t have any money for quarters to do my laundry or to buy face wash or vitamins or paper towels or pay my phone bill. i was so suicidal through the fall because i just hated myself so much and was so tired of feeling empty. now i want to kill myself because i can’t afford to live, and the life im living doesn’t feel worth sticking around for. i haven’t talked to anyone about anything in so long. it’s so much suffering to hold inside each day. i can’t talk to my fiancé about it because i know it only makes him worry more, but i just don’t think im going to make it. there’s too much. it’s crushing me. im so lonely. i need someone to take care of me. no ones ever taken care of me before. I can’t do it anymore. i can’t do it. i don’t want to. i don’t care to. im not equipped to help myself, im not capable of getting better again. statistics exist for a reason. maybe im just supposed to be part of one.

My issues probably aren't as bad some others. I have no illusions about how it would affect my parents, and I still know they would be hurt by this. I can't kill myself, because I dont want to hurt them.  I feel like I'm gonna jump in the air and rip myself apart. I hate myself
Cherish the life given to you by finding joy in little things. Crunching a dry leaf, playing soccer with a stone or drinking perfectly chilled water. Go buy a flower and give it to your parents or rather say thank you to someone who cleans your area or the people who take out trash. Try it and reply I will wait, till the the whole some award. :)
Why do you hate yourself?
I don't mean to be rude. I'm really sorry if I come as off-putting, but I don't care about those things at all. I'm sorry, I tried things that seemed equally as rewarding before regardless when I'm sober or in a drinking phase it always ends with me feeling empty.  >Go buy a flower and give it to your parents  Like what you said here. I did that before and I was glad my mom was feeling happy.
I admit I just say that outright, but I am not even sure I can articulate it outright. I think best would be a list:  Physically:  -My face is grossly (and noticeably) asymmetric  -overly large head  -no facial expressions at all, always come off as if I'm stupid or "slow"  -I have a visible limb  -I'm very short  -Extremely skinnyfat, hate myself both for when I'm skinny and when I'm drinking  -extremely hairy  I don't know, I just don't like my body at all.  Psychologically:  -try to act "maturely" outside, but always end up acting extremely meek  -alcohol addiction  -severely changing senses of self worth, either love or hate myself completely  -don't have any emotions, mostly it's just anger  -extremely petty, will internally blow up over minor things  -too pathetic too stand up for myself  -have attempted to off myself before, felt guilty afterwards
Don't feel down, I understand where you're coming from. It's understandable.
I'm so sorry you feel that way about yourself. I can relate I hate how I look, how I look in pictures, I can't feel confident in my skin I'm always insecure about everything, how I look when I'm laughing I could never get up and dance I'm so uncomfortable in my body yet I've made my mind a prison of past and future so there's no comfort there either. I wish I could give you the cure, I don't know who you are or what you're like or what you look like but you're on this page and so am I so all I can say to you is I'm here you're not alone in this feeling AT ALL it sucks so much but I hope you and me and everyone on this page can overcome this, but for now just know you're not alone I'm sorry you feel this way, I'm sorry I feel this way and anyone reading this that feels this way too. I know this is dumb and not even going to help in the slightest but I'm sending you good energy and thoughts right now, I don't know you but I feel you and I get you and I hope you can reach happiness, obviously I'm here on this page because I need help too but one thing that did help me was Alan Watts, he seems to make life seem more carefree and that's all I really want is to feel happy and carefree.

I just realized now that everyone I considered close to me, and perhaps even cared for caused my Anorexia, especially my girlfriend. But last time it happened was 6 months ago though my mentality is still really fucked up.    I don't trust anyone anymore yet I feel frustrated because I feel alone. But if I'm not alone I'll just get Anorexia again? But I don't want to cut them out of my life because I don't want to be alone and I'll just be eaten alive by my thoughts.   I don't fucking know anymore dude. Tried turning to religion but I feel a tiny bit worse. Escapes are dying off and I'm losing my motivation to do anything.

I don’t even know where I’m supposed to start with this so here it goes I guess.   Most of the time I like to think that I’m happy and outgoing and then all of a sudden something hits me where it stops me from doing schoolwork, trying to hangout with friends and talking to my family. Usually it won’t last this long but just recently it’s lasted 2-3 weeks. I’ve been feeling like my own childhood friends don’t want me there so I don’t really try to text them or nothing. There is one that I recently became good friends with and she is very nice and offers help whenever needed, but I don’t ever know how to ask for help.    School has been a real downing thing as it just stresses me so far out that I try to work and I just get frustrated and quit. As a result my assignments have been piling up and as it’s nearing the end of the semester I’m worried I’m not going to graduate.   I’m sure my family would love to help, but I don’t want to put that worry on them so I’ve been hiding how I’ve always sat and thought by myself about what I can do to help pull me out of these bottomless pits I keep falling into. Really the only thing that I’ve come up with was working and since I’m still in school I can only do a couple hours a day to get my mind off things. This would be why weekends are the hardest for me since I barely work on the weekend and when it’s offered to me, I take it no questions asked.   As always I’m sure there’s plenty more to be typed but for anyone who actually read this through thank you so much!
i feel the same alot of the time.

I just don't know if anything that I considered 'me' is real. I don't know if I'm just acting or really this is how I feel. My therapist wants to cancel me if she supposedly catches me lying, which implies that she thought I may have lied before, which may be partially true. That one lie was a broken promise, that I would not attempt suicide, but afterward meeting my father in person she 'understood' how I felt. But I don't even know if that attempt for taking my life was really that much of a threat. I made shallow cuts even if I 'tried', pressing the blade as hard as I can, taking all my meds before then, but realizing afterward that one pack is 1/20 of the minimal deadly dose, trying hanging only to stand up after almost fading away.  I took a semester off from uni, currently doing absolutely nothing, reading fantasy books and watching philosophy videos, so probably I can convince myself even more..  I tried to fess up my barely active suicidal attempts to my father and his girlfriend, but as usual everyone understood it as more of a threat to continue my passive life, rather than a threat against my life.   I have no goal, nothing. Reading the fictions help me feel, I'm happy when the protagonist is happy, and angry when he is angry, disgusted as he is disgusted, sad when he is sad. It feels like being someone who actually has something, and it helps ignore the absurdity of existence. Like I can ignore my own thoughts, giving room for theirs and just staying a quiet observer  But otherwise, no feelings that would help me stand and continue. These just help me feel myself bearable, but also anchors me to passivity  And while I'm anchored I get the wise thoughts from others, to decide if I actually want to heal or want to remain like this forever, giving me no room to say that my wish would be to jump off a bride, because the guilt would just rebound and start killing me again.  Even if I told them, would I really jump off a bridge? I mean sure, every second thoughts is about jumping out of my window, head first, or just take the damn bus and get it over with, theres the chance of surviving but you can try again later  But would I do it? Isn't it just whining, to let me continue sheltered in my room, reading books?  Even when I'm crying, I feel a moment of pause in the turmoil of emotions and my trust to my own feelings start to waver. Am I just decieving myself among the others? Am I really feeling like I've been crippled, or I just ignore anything else  Even while crying and thinking about maybe finally posting something here would get me some closure I thought about upvotes, and became disgusted. I can no longer trust myself, but then who the fucking hell can I trust? The fucking foundations of my life may be a lie  I'm torn  I don't know  I don't fucking know anymore

I'm not even sure why I think that, except that I guess that's something that happens when you're depressed. But it makes it very difficult to care about anything or plan anything long term.
I live with the understanding that I can die at any moment, it’s the reality of life, you just plan anyway and work towards what you want.
I work towards what I want in the short term. But if anything is going to take more than a year or two it seems pointless.   Like if you had a terminal illness and only had a year to live, you probably wouldn't start college or have a kid.
I understand. But you can’t think of things in such a big way, you have to take it day by day and I know it’s not easy. I looked back at the last year and realized not much has changed for me and it’s my own fault I tend to look at the grand scale and fail, when I need to start small.

Hi, I'm from Argentina and on my 1st year of career, 'cause I lived A LOT of bad situations in my life, and now at my middle 22's I can return to college for my 5 years of duration career. I'm really depressed, thinking about suicide myself with a .22LR gun I have from my grandpa, and anxious (I waste all my days in my mind thinking about my problems, doing nothing, complaining to my friends and my friends are enough with my shit). I'm really really frustrated for my actual situation with no girlfriend, no job, no good situation in my career, a lot of fucked up familiar problems and so... I get really mad with myself by an experience with an ex member of my class in high school, I've tried to flirth with her on IG, but she's on her's 3rd year of career and working harder in a full time job, so I was in my mind thinking than I was doing well but... try that.. puts me soooo down... she was not interested on my obviously 'cause I'm... I'm nothing... I'm a dump, dumb, blind, I didn't deserve a girlfriend and less a girlfriend like her, she didn't let me meet her now. So... I'm devastated, in ruins, my heart is broke and I'm poor, I want to became a professional in the future but I'm really fucked up in every shape and form.  I was so frustrated in this days than I'm in my mind thinking about develop my appearance the most I can with the not much money I have, to get some new stuffs to dress and have a haircut (I'm with my long hair like Kurt Cobain, but getting bald and obviously not rough, I'm more like an indigenous dude, I'm ugly). The few friends I have are trying to do their best with me because they can notice I'm a hidden suicidal guy and.. I'm so lonely.. 'cause today I've found my friends.. they're in my head.. I'm so ugly... but that's okay, 'cause so are not you, broken mirrors. Tbh I'm a 80% sure I'm going to kill myself soon, 'cause I'm an autistic adult and I waste too much time, really much time, inside my home in my depression and now I'm really frustrated with myself and all. I hurt ppl in the past and now in social medias by my non self confidence and antisocial disorder. I delete FB, IG, and also I created accounts again with 1 or 2 followers for now. What should I do? I'm doing right? I'm in time to create a new life for myself? I'm a bad person? Can I improve my appearance and search girlfriend?

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzinz9/im_a_22_year_old_loser_with_no_degree_no_drivers/
I’m a 22 year old loser with no degree, no drivers license, and I’m living with my parents. I really felt so developmentally behind my peers. They have jobs, relationships, go on trips, etc while I am stuck in the basement. I truly feel like a child. When I was 21, they wouldn’t even allow me to go to bars. They would literally tell me no. If I wanted to meet new friends, they would demand to meet them. It’s as if they were treating them like some child who was going to be exploited by a pedophile. I’m tired of doing chores for them. I’m tired of not living life. I haven’t had a relationship or sex. Their social mores prevent me from seeking out any romantic relationship. They want an arranged marriage for some girl I don’t love in a country far away. I plan to move out at 25 (sadly) unfortunately because I need to save up enough money for moving expenses, security deposit, and some new appliances. It feels like I will have wasted my first half of 20s and my true adult life will begin at 25. I truly feel behind.
Everyone experiences life in various ways. I've seen a 70 year-old woman on television who just got her college degree. There are people who got what they really wanted to have, in their elderly years. This doesn't mean people should procrastinate and wait for their thing to come by— you could start a youtube channel, make the next best fried chicken all over your country, it's up to you. I know that it's hard not to compare ourselves with our friends but it only lets us down in the long run.   My brother is 21 who also doesn't have a job because of corona and I could tell you that a lot of people are experiencing the same way that you're feeling. You are not alone and I really wish you the best. You got this!
Do non-asian parents do that too? I know the feeling of being controlled in social activities when I was in school. Btw I got my driving license few days ago after 3 years of trying, passed in the 7th attempt of test, at least that's one thing you can work towards now.
I didn't get started until 24 myself. Are you making good progress towards a license, job, stable mental headspace, strong body and everything else you need, even if it's just a bit each day, bud?
You have an opportunity that so many people don’t. You can work and save the majority of your income by living at home rent free.   If you have no ambition to get your license or a job or have a relationship, and your parents are okay with that, then fine.   But if you have ambitions, get out there and pursue them! Tell your parents you’re getting a part time job and gain more responsibility and life experience from there with the drivers license and such.   Unless you think they’ll genuinely kick you out for growing up, responsibly pursue your goals.  Forget about whether you’re starting ‘late.’ Better late than never. In the grand scheme of things it doesn’t matter because life is not about comparing yourself to others.    Go live your life man!
Yes they do!
I’m trying.
I have ambition to get out there, but I’m worried about missing out.

I am in need of more sad songs. Something low key. Something with vibes similar to “Achilles Come Down” and “Another Love” maybe. Or just whatever.
You know it will make the Feeling worse ?   But still here are some of my artists (Genre Post Punk)   - Lebanon Hanover  - This Cold Night  - Molchat Doma  - Twin Tribes  - Joy Division  ...
i’m a sucker for depressing songs. my faves are so far by ólafur arnalds & looking too closely by fink.
JoeJas - Sally's Heartbreak Picnic
I don’t know if this might be a good fit but you should see https://open.spotify.com/track/1hIg9tQau5GpeziwY5HoGw?si=tGL1VBqfR_uyDl4eo5Tcdw
I don’t actually feel all that bad right now, I just want something I can relate to. It feels nice listening to songs that sound like me if that makes any sense. Thanks for the recommendations!
I understand that to 100% :D

since some of you know what happened to me yesterday and today... i'll just share the summarized version of what happened to me..  &#x200B;  last night my sister told me that i don't have depression and i'm just going crazy. she got annoyed when i told her i have been feeling so anxious lately and depressed.. she even gave me a box of disposable scalpel for me to "overcome" my depression and me doing self harm. this afternoon, my dad told us that my mom feels like she'll die soon and i can't even feel any emotions or anything and it's making me feel worse.   this evening, my mom cooked us a meal and asked everyone to come and eat with her (i don't really eat that much cause i have ed but i'm taking up medications for me to cure myself. i can eat a little but not that much.) So anyways, my mom asked us to come and eat with her but when i was about to come down and eat dinner my sister told my parents that i won't eat and so she ate everything with my other sister. i went downstairs a few mins ago and saw my dad looking at me and thinking if i'm okay but i just did not mind anyone at home because i'm tired with all the shit in here.

How to get used to the idea that people always leave you in the end? And that you have no intrinsic value or anything at all that makes you special in a way you're indispensable? I'm so tired. I feel quite lonely. I try my very best to fight these thoughts but they keep coming back. Is it time to look for a psychiatrist once again?
a) yes, look for a psychiatrist. it might help, it may not, but it's better than not trying at all and staying stagnant.   b) i don't think there is a way to get used to it. even if you get jaded, it still hurts. we're only human. i thought i could get used to it, but it just happened again to me about a week ago, and i'm in one of the worst depressive bouts ive been in for awhile. i feel used and thrown away.   im sorry you're feeling this way. it's such a shitty feeling.
I'm sorry that someone treat you poorly. I've dedicated an entire year of my life to my ex girlfriend. She promised me she would never leave me. Quite honestly, she was the center of my universe. Then she left me, about a month ago. I've cried copiously every day since then.  I've had had depressive bouts before but this one might actually make me give up on it all Thank you for your answers. I'll look for a psychiatrist once I'm back home, i truly need help. And yeah, maybe there's just no way. Other than to stop caring at all. It's such a destructive desire. I wish I never felt like this, i wish I didn't have to exist experiencing the world like this.
i know your exact pain... i was with him for 4 years despite all of the shitty things he had done to me. my love was unconditional, but i learned his wasn't... despite him promising the same thing your ex did. every day has felt like a nightmare.   even though you may feel like giving up, it's good you still have enough fire in you to seek help. i wish people would stop toying with others like this. making promises they don't intend to keep. you don't deserve this despair, and i hope your search for a psychologist goes will.   best of luck, stranger.
I know it's a big hurt right now, but putting aside your ex for now, are you happy with yourself? I'm concerned you may be putting your sense of self-worth in the hands of others and leaving yourself open to devastating identity shakeups when people let you down.
Hello. Thank you for your input. I hate myself. Actually, I'll be honest, i don't feel like I exist. I don't enjoy anything, everything but the very casual walk on the forest walk that i get just feels like a subpar experience. I hate my major, hate my job, i hate myself and the way that i look. I don't have any dreams or big aspirations and I'm the plainest person ever. I just feel like a shell.
That's what I was afraid of. Do you have an idea of who the ideal self that you could be is, like a list of traits, relationships or a job that would make you think you've reached success, or is even that ideal not in place yet?
No. I don't have any idea. I'm so lost. The only thing I feel would give me some strength to fight the urge to end it all is someone that cares. I know it's pathetic. I feel like I'm a burden and an attention-whore. But i just can't shake this feeling. I don't see any point in my effort. I'm sorry. I know these words were heavy. Either way, thank you for your attention and for the questions, they are important for introspection and understanding the issue better
That's ok, I recognize your position from years of struggle in the same place myself. Relationships are absolutely excellent and you deserve a good one.  When you're up to it, I hope you can make that plan for your based and strengthened identity to provide yourself the best stability possible, even if you have to crib personality traits from people you admire in your planning. My personality is part Hank Hill and Al Bundy, no joke. XD  No rush though, you go at your pace and take care.

My dream is that I just walk out the door one day and just vanish completely like I never existed. I want to go somewhere remote and just get swallowed up by brush or wander into a cave and never come out. I wish I could burn everything I own, every paper with my name on it, every picture my worthless face is in, and then die and rot and leave nothing behind but some bones under some weeds where I’ll never be found. Like I had never existed at all and any memory of me is fleeting.

Hi, I'm from Argentina and on my 1st year of career, 'cause I lived A LOT of bad situations in my life, and now at my middle 22's I can return to college for my 5 years of duration career. I'm really depressed, thinking about suicide myself with a .22LR gun I have from my grandpa, and anxious (I waste all my days in my mind thinking about my problems, doing nothing, complaining to my friends and my friends are enough with my shit). I'm really really frustrated for my actual situation with no girlfriend, no job, no good situation in my career, a lot of fucked up familiar problems and so... I get really mad with myself by an experience with an ex member of my class in high school, I've tried to flirth with her on IG, but she's on her's 3rd year of career and working harder in a full time job, so I was in my mind thinking than I was doing well but... try that.. puts me soooo down... she was not interested on my obviously 'cause I'm... I'm nothing... I'm a dump, dumb, blind, I didn't deserve a girlfriend and less a girlfriend like her, she didn't let me meet her now. So... I'm devastated, in ruins, my heart is broke and I'm poor, I want to became a professional in the future but I'm really fucked up in every shape and form. I was so frustrated in this days than I'm in my mind thinking about develop my appearance the most I can with the not much money I have, to get some new stuffs to dress and have a haircut (I'm with my long hair like Kurt Cobain, but getting bald and obviously not rough, I'm more like an indigenous dude, I'm ugly). The few friends I have are trying to do their best with me because they can notice I'm a hidden suicidal guy and.. I'm so lonely.. 'cause today I've found my friends.. they're in my head.. I'm so ugly... but that's okay, 'cause so are not you, broken mirrors. Tbh I'm a 80% sure I'm going to kill myself soon, 'cause I'm an autistic adult and I waste too much time, really much time, inside my home in my depression and now I'm really frustrated with myself and all. I hurt ppl in the past and now in social medias by my non self confidence and antisocial disorder. I delete FB, IG, and also I created accounts again with 1 or 2 followers for now. What should I do? I'm doing right? I'm in time to create a new life for myself? I'm a bad person?

I hate my self. That is something I’ve known for a long, and I’ve been extra hard on myself lately, and a thought came into my head “Am I faking being depressed just to get more attention”, and the more I think about it the more worse I feel, causing me to think that I’m just faking it again, and the cycle repeats, making me feel worse and worse. Is this normal?
Been through the same mate. It takes time but it'll get better lad.
Have you tried a therapist?
i think that i wanted to believe that i have depression because i felt like shit and never felt like that before. So i thought that it HAD to be depression. I dont really know the exact difference
It’s good to know I’m not the only one who’s had something similar to this happen
No, should I?
But i gotta tell you and im not trying to correct you or make you less imortant, but depression and being sad/nit being happy for a long time are different things. Although you both is pretty serious. The differents might be that depression wont go away on its own. Being sad for a long time could go away if certain things happen. But in both cases you should take with someone about it and reach out for some help.
The first step should be talking to your parents or people that you trust
I would talk to a professional if it's been going on for a long period of time.  Their job is to help people and offer advice and ways to work through your issues..  You.can talk to family but they're probably not going to have the advice you need.
How can I tell the difference between the two?
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzn0rc/ive_tried_almost_everything/
I’ve tried over 30 medications and been in therapy off and on since I was 11 (I’m 28 now). I have awful side effects to most. Wellbutrin knocked me out. With a tiny, baby liquid dose of lithium I had toxicity. Zoloft, buspqr, and Prozac gave me awful insomnia and akathasia that almost led me to suicide. Other medications have either done nothing or made things worse. Sometimes I almost fool myself into thinking a medication is working until reality hits and everything comes crashing down. I’ve had a full physical. My thyroid is a little low but fine, but I tried medication for a little while anyway and it didn’t help anything. I’ve tried hormone therapy multiple times. I underwent ECT, which prevented alcohol and self harm (my only two coping skills at the time) from making me feel even slightly better which made me attempt. I’ve surrounded myself with mentally healthy people like I thought I was supposed to, but it sucks because they don’t understand my struggle. I’m successful, talented in my profession and hobbies, have my own business, have a decent family, a good relationship, and I’m still fucking sad all the time. The next things to try are Ketamine and DBS which will be expensive and not covered by insurance. The financial burden of that will be another trigger for my depression so I don’t really know what to do here. Is it worth it to keep trying new things? Will anything ever help? Or should I just accept that this is my life and how I was born and how I’m going to be no matter what and I just need to suck it up? I’ve come such a long way. I used to SH almost daily. I’m about 3 years clean, but I’ve been 3 years clean before and fucked it up. I still get urges at least once a week but I remind myself how disappointed people are in me when they find out and that’s what keeps me safe. I’m just completely fucking exhausted with the “keep trying!” “don’t give up hope”-ass attitude. How many things must I try before it’s acceptable to give up?
Damn it sounds like you've had it rough. I'm really sorry. I don't know if this will help, but sometimes on my own bad days, it can help to move the goalposts ... like instead of trying to be actively happy, I just aim for ok or even neutral. Anything better than "bad." Maybe try that? Hope you feel better.
Thank you, friend. That’s definitely what I do. Just take it day by day. It really is remarkable how much that can help.

My therapist wants me to stop going to therapy. I’m extremely suicidal and I’m an active self harmer. So, I told her (my therapist) I would most likely kill myself if I stopped seeing her because I don’t have anyone else I can talk to about my feelings. She just told me to find someone else to talk to. I told her I don’t have anyone I can safely talk to and she just told me to pay attention to the people I see over the week.     I don’t know if my parents ever cared about me, but, my mom told me she doesn’t think anything will help me after I was allergic to the antidepressants I was prescribed. My parents don’t really like me, they’d kick me out if I was an adult.   I don’t really find comfort in anything, and thinking about how I don’t have anything that comforts me is very emotionally distressing. I’m trying really hard to improve. It seems like I’m not, though. I feel like writing this might help even though it probably won’t.
[removed]
i know this sounds corny but if everyone's has given up on you, at least don't give up on yourself.   improvement happens incrementally, oftentimes it feels like you're not getting anywhere but if you persist long enough you will improve trust me.  i really recommend finding another therapist, there are so many available and im sure you can find one that will be a better match.   im sorry if this didn't help much but i do feel with you and i am praying you feel better one day. peace
when your therapist told you this do you think it was out of malice or spite or she was coming from a professional point of view and also we wont give up on you :) i hope what ever your trying to find you do :)
Thank you for your support, I appreciate it a lot.
Thank you. I feel better today.
Thank you

In the past several months at least two or three times a day I’ve thought about the bliss of nothing. The end of deadlines, false smiles, fear, anxiety,... just a sweet kiss of oblivion. Heaven for me is the absence of myself. To not think or feel or experience. To live on only as a memory.   I am unable to do it. I have a family. Sometimes I think about when my child is 30 and situated. Explaining that my love is endless but that I need to rest. That they and my wife are safe, financially sound. That all I want is to experience the absence. I’ve overcome many things in life (childhood through adulthood) but at this point it’s a race to the end. I married someone who I knew wouldn’t need me to survive. It was intentional. No codependency. I offer her and my child a bit of luxury but without me they would be fine financially and with a large family. I offer value in understanding, empathy, money, and education.  I’m going for a vasectomy, I love my child but I want no more. It increases the timeline until I rest. I will be the person I need to be. I will smile, and be proud of every accomplishment my child has, and when they can prosper I will rest.   I’ll endure until I don’t need to.

What do you think are the triggers and reasons? It feels like actually most people nowadays suffer from some kind of depression. Why is that? Sure, isolation due to lockdown has an immense influence and effect right now, but I also mean in general nowadays, regardless of the pandemic.  Is it because the whole world has just become screens and internet?  Is it because of the economy and its effects on people having to struggle more than before to make a living?  Why is it? And what are ways to stop it/help yourself?  &#x200B;  Thank you  Sincerely, a lost soul.
All of the above.

This is gonna sound weird but here we go: A few nights ago, I was leaving my friends place, and I chose to take the long way "home", because that means I have to spend less time there. The weird part is that I felt truly happier in that drive than I have in a long time.   I've tried to find excuses to go for a drive the last few days, but none of them have had the same effect. I think it could be because of the scenarios (the initial drive was at night on a practically empty highway, opposed to busy streets during the day). The problem is that I can't just say "I'm going for a drive" any random night without my parents questioning where I am going or what I'm doing or why do I need to go for a drive.  Has anyone else had similar experiences? Or any ideas on how I could use this as stress reliver?  Thank you in advance!
It is literally at the moment the only thing i can reguarly do that keeps me sane. Its freaking awesome. Ive been doing it for the past 5 or more years. Its to the point where i ran out of places to drive, interesting places atleast, but its the drive that gets me going. Hit the road, listen to Lana Del Rey or Taylor Swift, see the city lights, the ocean, stop at a store and get a shit ton of snacks. When i started doing it, my parents didnt understand, but i straight up told them "im bored, i wanna drive around and get fresh air." It became ritual that they dont ask, they still dont believe me, but hey, idc, im happy.
I agree , I find myself driving for long periods and just feeling calm and relaxed or I’ll have some music playing that calms me while I drive , it’s weird but it takes your focus and puts it on the driving to the point where I forget what problems I have going on in life for a short period of time

I just turned 30M and I’ve had anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I was diagnosed and put on medication when I was 16. The meds helped me a lot and worked for me, until I was 21. Ever since then I’ve been a guinea pig, trying different medications and none have had lasting relief. Most didn’t even work for me, or just made my condition worse. It’s been a roller coaster ride of ups and downs with each change in medication and nothing helps. I can’t keep a damn job, can’t have a healthy relationship and I have no interest in anything at all. Being my age and living with my parents is fucking embarrassing, but with how I feel, I have no choice. I keep telling myself, something has to give, something will help me, but I’ve been saying that for 9 years. What kind of life is this to live? Suffering in your own mind every minute of everyday and people who don’t have these issues don’t understand. “Why do you always seem so sad and miserable? Just be happy!”, g-whiz, why the fuck didn’t I think of that!? Oh yeah because it doesn’t work that way, I can’t just flip a switch in my brain, to sunshine and rainbows. People just don’t get it. Depression sucks.
I've tried antidepressants since I was a kid, I'm 23 now and don't bother, none of them have done anything for me other than make me worse. Smoking weed helps but even now it doesn't alleviate the depression, it just masks it.  Life sucks. I'm just convinced depression is our brain's way of telling us exactly that.

TL/DR: Watch that's never worked for over 4 years suddenly starts working, never give up on yourself!  &#x200B;  So this isn't the best of stories but its helped me since happening.  &#x200B;  I received a watch by accident about 5 years ago, one of those fancy ones you don't wear out of fear of being robbed with it on or damaging it. I didn't order it and spent about the better part of a year trying to return it, with the sending company eventually stating that if the original recipient does not claim within a few weeks I should take it as my own.  &#x200B;  Awesome news yes, I never get "lucky" with stuff like this, this watch however came with this nice lil notice stating that it is an influencer model and lacks the mechanisms to function function, it's eye candy only. So it was pretty much throwaway junk, my inner-hoarder decided to store it in a box and forget about it.  Come this weekend, I'm in my usual sombre hole, until I find the box the watch came in. I open the box, try the watch on one last time before throwing it out, and this is when it happens... I try to see if i can get the time set for the 10000000th time when the pin shoots outwards, "Fvxk, now it really is a paperweight." is all I can think... until I see the seconds hand start to move!   This is what I'm taking as my sign that this year will be the year shxt starts to work, for me, for you, for everybody.
Fucking A right, cheers!

This might sound cheesy, but I have a stockpile of motivational quotes. I'll scroll through them until I find one that speaks to me that day, when I'm in that particular mood, and I'll use it as a mantra until it stops being helpful and then I'll move on to another one.

I don’t know why I’m up at 3 in the morning crying over some shit that I guess I didn’t get over in my past.   You can totally stop reading now because I feel like from here on out is me just venting and rambling while sleep deprived and sad.   TW for sexual assault, death of pets, and terrorism... I don’t know how to do trigger warnings!   Back in 2017, I had a complete rollercoaster of a year.   Staring in February, I met the most amazing adorable boy with a birthday 2 days after mine. We talked on a dating app before officially meeting for a real date on Valentine’s Day. He was open minded, he was kind to people who had nothing to offer him, and our sexual chemistry was the best I have ever had to this day.   March of the same year, I started going to a trade school for a job I really wasn’t interested in and only wanted to use to pay for my true passion job. I was nervous to start because I was the only there that didn’t want to do this as a career. I felt guilty for being there, but it was only a 6 month course, so I just forced myself through those feelings.  In April, I got to see and have a meet and greet with my favorite singer. She remembered me from the last tour I saw her on. I was so fucking happy and met some wonderful lovely people that I am still friends with while I was there. Unfortunately April was also the month where I watched a TV show with a rape scene that was strikingly similar to mine. That was when I finally admitted to myself. I. Was. Raped. I had never told anyone this. Just my little dog. I whispered into her ear and cried and fell asleep with her in my arms the night it happened. I tried reaching out to my boyfriend about it and he said he wasn’t in the mood for that kind of talk and went to bed instead.   May of 2017, the previously mentioned singer I had just hugged and enjoyed watching live had her concert attacked by a suicide bomber. If you’re familiar with this, you know who I’m talking about. This resulted in the loss of lives and I knew a lot of people who were in attendance (and thankfully were safe). I was heartbroken for the loss of life, the injuries, and also the mental scars people would have sustained from this. I don’t think people really knew how much I cared about this, but it really took an emotional toll on me. The day after this attack, my boyfriend decided my sadness from this combined with my sexual assault trauma resurfacing was too much for him to handle. He ended our short relationship by blocking me on all platforms and didn’t give me an explanation until a few days after he moved to another city a few days later.   In June, I finally got the strength to drag my ass to therapy and talk to a specialist for sexual assault and abuse. Here I learned that my best support was my dog. Therapy was the best choice I had ever made.   July of 2017 was the final straw for me. My dog had been my one and only steady support for me through each and every one of these hardships. She suddenly passed from a heart failure while I was sleeping. I took part of the day off of school, but I couldn’t take the whole day off. That day it rained, and I just remember loving the fact that no one could hear me crying over the sound of the rain hitting the metal roof of the school building.  The rest of 2017 was filled with ups and downs that were much smaller and I really didn’t care much for the life events most people look forward to forever. Turning 21, graduating school, finishing a therapy program... none of it made me feel anything because I just began to detach myself from feeling.  Fast forward to today. I’m in a relationship of 3 years, making great money at the job I went to school for, and have two amazing and adorable fur babies. But why am I still stuck in 2017? I’m constantly wondering what if about my ex, sometimes wishing my current boyfriend was him. I shouldn’t be emotionally dreaming of my ex while I’m laying in bed next to the guy I’ve been with 10 times longer than him. And why am I so worried about my dogs dying as if they’re going to drop dead any second instead of cherishing every moment I have with them?   It felt so good to get some of this off my chest and then I got to the WHY part of all this and it just makes me so fucking upset. I feel sick to my stomach, I’m crying, I’m losing sleep, I’m thinking of suicide, and it’s all because I don’t have a fucking time machine to go back and change all the little things to make me happier now. I know I’m supposed to accept my past and move on, but I accepted it and now what? I feel like I’m on edge just trying not to fuck up again and I just want to live in the moment and enjoy things again. I hate myself for what I’ve done in the past, how these things that have happened to me made me act and react. I hate myself for posting this but I’m still gonna do it anyway. Fuck!   Thank you and sorry to whoever actually read any or all of this shit.  I hope no one I know ever sees this.
My mother has ptsd from being raped and other traumatic experiences. I’m not saying you have it but look into it and seek help from loved ones and a dr.
I was officially diagnosed in 2017 and it’s definitely something I had help with, but I just feel stuck with the non rape stuff since my therapist didn’t specifically work on that

Ever since Covid happened my(22) life has been in a slow downward spiral. Physical success in some small areas but mentally I've been declining day by day to the point where I've stagnated completely in my life.   I'm lucky though. A year ago I met the most wonderful woman and with her i feel like I could actually escape this hellhole. I could go back to therapy, exercise and all that shit they put on a laundry list for fixing my fucked up head. We lived together for a bit because of covid which helped me survive the first 5 months after March but she had to move because of grad school. The mental decline has since become harder to fight. We're not codependent but just supportive in a way both our families aren't able or willing to be.   I want to move in with her but it would break my mom and dads heart. My dad just got a new house too. But I don't think I'm gonna get out this rut in this house with him. I'm starting to have ideation again and I'm getting more worried I'll have another severe episode.   Should I just say fuck it. Leave it all behind? How do I do it. I can't just tell my parents "this is the only person who gets it and actually helps". They'll feel like failures and they aren't. Idk how to do this.
If it really does help your mental health then you should move. Every bird leaves the nest when the time comes and tell them that. Still keep contact with calls and stuff but move with your love mate

Keep going. I can’t relate and not many people can but you’re never alone. Work on the things you can change and don’t give too much mind to things you can’t. We have to accept the way things are and it is shitty most of the time and especially for your situation but, keep fucking going if not for yourself then for those who didn’t make it.

I have been depressed for months. Have hardly moved from my chair. Just scrolled mindlessly over the Internet. And barely drunk any water. And now since the past 4 days have been having splitting headaches all day. And I keep thinking I must have some sort of brain tumor. And, while I'm scared I also feel it would be a relief. That's it.
Drink water, get up move around, get good sleep. It’s the small things that add up. I used to get crazy migraines and when I started taking better care of myself, poof, they disappeared.
I would if I could.

I’m on fluoxetine/prozac for anxiety and depression. Started them a year ago and really helped me, I felt a few months ago I was feeling really low again due to stress in my life so the doctor doubled the dose so I’m on 40mg per day, for the past week I’ve felt absolutely exhausted and keep falling asleep, I’m sleeping at night so that’s not the issue, I’ve zero energy and no motivation and haven’t showered for a week which wasn’t me a couple of months ago. Could it possibly be the medication that is causing the tiredness?
Possibly. I’d definitely talk to your doctor regardless.

Yes, it sounds ridiculous, but I am ready to leave this world. However, I am a coward to end my journey here in the world. I do not have friends. I do not feel any affection from my family; I hate them for taking my dreams away from me. I feel like a burden for every person I have met in my life, and the lovers I had just used me to have fun or because they felt bad for me. I have tried many times to jump off the bridge, cut myself, find someone to do the work I cannot do. My trust is given so easily to strangers because I do not have the privilege to have someone else to talk to. I have been depressed for 10 years, and I still hope I can finally overcome this state. Nonetheless, I am always getting here over and over again. I wish I had a friend, I wish I were loved. Last time I hugged someone was 2 years ago; everyone I loved is going to die or is already dead. I hope I die tonight, I am too tired for trying again.

I thought I had been freed from these horrible chains - I thought a spiritual awakening, a loving partner, a slightly better family dynamic, and a best friend would help me with this problem. I thought everything was alright but everything suddenly feels very bleak and cumbersome. I just want to push my friends and family away now; I wish they would hate me so this would be easier. If I had nothing to live for this would be easier.  Recently, my best friend and I had a conversation. I've done inconsiderate things but we've spoken; she says she needs space but made the distinction that I'm a good person - that she learns things from me and really enjoys my company. It's just small things that I'm working very diligently to fix. She's dealing with a lot of stress with family and other friends - said it wasn't just me but we haven't really spoken much in the past two weeks and I can't help but feel like if I hadn't come into her life she wouldn't be so frustrated despite how she's told me it isn't the case - that I am a positive part of her life and her only friend that doesn't wear her down.I don't believe her though. I've convinced myself that people's lives would be better and despite how irrational and silly I KNOW that is, I can't get it out of my head. It consumes my daily life. I'm processing the world around me better than I was prior but at the current moment, I feel like I'm floating. I just feel numb and I don't care what happens anymore.  I love my friends - my family - my significant other to pieces but I feel like the more I'm around them the more I wear them. I'm just considering telling everyone I know that I want to be left alone - that I can't do this anymore. Another part of me wants to scream for help but there's no point. I don't have the money for treatment and I would hate myself even more than I already do if I dare ask for help.  To my loved ones, I'm sorry I'm like this. I wish I wasn't so weak. All of the lessons I've learned throughout my 19 years have been more nothing. I know eventually, I'll die by my own hands. I'll never have a family - I'll never experience the joys of life that I hear about constantly. I feel stupid writing this. I'm scared someone will find it but I recall... no one in my life aside from one person has ever cared to know how I'm doing. They dealing with their own things though and it's unrealistic for me to set this standard on them. They don't need to care about me. I would prefer they didn't.  Music ordinarily causes me to feel happy or it helps relieve some sort of tension in myself but it doesn't seem to help much of anything anymore.   Anyone reading this, I beg you please please tell your family and friends that you care about them. To have those around you who care never bat an eye at your troubles is one of the loneliest feelings on the planet.

I have insurance through Kaiser (in northern California) and I was lucky enough to start seeing a therapist regularly right before the pandemic started. Unfortunately, he quit his job a month or two ago and I haven't seen another therapist since.  Those of you who've tried to get a therapist in the US in the past few months, were you able to get one immediately or did you get put on a long waiting list? I've heard it's harder now because so many people are having mental health issues during covid
I have heard terrible stories about Kasier mental health services, from frist and my therapist that says people come and pay outta network to see her cause kasier is nothing but waiting lists.
My therapist referred me to an outside provider because he didn't like the way Kaiser did mental health services, but I haven't heard back about the referral and I have too much anxiety about phone calls to call Kaiser and ask about it

In July of 2020, my boyfriend was fatally stabbed in front of me. He shortly passed away, that was the last time I saw him and talked to him. I never would think that would have been the last day, I live with so much trauma and guilt. I want to die because he is not here with me, I loved this man so much. I loved him. I wanted my babies with him. I wanted to grow old with him. Now I could never and I know time heals but witnessing a murder and losing someone I love has put me through so much trauma. I can't take it anymore. Almost every night I think about turning to suicide because I'm tired of being miserable.
What you’ve faced is an impossible situation because no one could understand unless they experienced it. I’m so sorry for everything you been through, and you will never truly be okay with what happened but you loved him dearly so you should honor the memory of him by living the best life you can for you and him, honor him and improve on your mental health no matter what it takes and then continue to push through life and make the most of it for both of you. If you ever need to talk I’m always happy to make new friends just come find me. You’re strong I believe in you❤️

Today I finally decided to go outside after reading some articles that going outside can improve your mental health, turns out I was wrong. I felt even more sad, anxious, and so insecure about myself. Apparently I didn't enjoy it at all I preferred my life inside of my house rather than being outside. Everything seems pointless nowadays.
Small steps add up. Work on little things like taking better care of yourself, cleaning your room or just something that you like to do that’s productive, and it will take awhile but you will get better.
Alright thanks man

Ok, maybe it is just because I was happier as a teenager, but I honestly think I would have been way happier if I was born in an earlier generation.  I honestly hate new technology and am having a really hard time adapting to everything  being automated.  I love old technology and it makes me so happy when I am actually working with my hands.  I would have loved a job working with computers in the 70s, 80s and 90s, because the tech world was more open to women then.  I also hate being fearful of climate change and fearing society collapse.  Part of my depression is I am extremely lonely....i feel like most people are more interested in their phones then one one one interaction.
Relatable. People used to be more social and more authentic. I know depression is organic but it’s definitely made worse by external factors. Being isolated, the consumer culture we live in, the rat race and pretentious social norms are enough to make any sane person depressed.   That’s cool that you’re into old technology. I know a lady in her 60’s from Ukraine who studied programming back when you had to use the punched out index cards and the computers were massive. She said it was so neat to watch computers evolve into a touch screen you keep in your pocket. Soviet Union back then was big on gender equality.   Btw, the world has always had big problems that feel dire and world-ending. The things going on now are nothing new, they just are more visible due to technology and some are hitting closer to home if you live in the USA.
Yeah, me too. I feel like getting a decent job back then was way easier than now. Along with college too.
Yeah same. Same with the computers carrier too. Like I could probably find a somewhat decent computer carrier today, but it would of been WAY better if I grew up in the 90's and got a job in the early 2000s.
I would love to actually see those old computers work and I would also love to be in a culture that is big on gender equality!   My  grandmother was a welder during WWII and she always amazed me!  Speaking of WWII, I would much prefer to live now then then, so I guess  shouldn't be whining too much....I need to stop obsessing about automation and climate change.
Even in the early 2000s college was pretty damn reasonable.  It is absurd how much college costs now and they shortened the courses from 18 weeks to 16.  I think automation is ruining jobs.
There were actual computer stores back then and you could hire someone to build you a computer for reasonable price. *sigh* I miss my parents computer store.   I don't know, computers today just aren't the same.  I kind of hate shit like algorithms too....I am no were near as excited about computers as I used to be.   VR is pretty cool though!

I never thought this would be me...definitely not for a second time (first time was in July 2020)  I’m struggling bad. Every single day I think about ending it. Multiple times a day. When I’m not in the mind frame I’m enjoying life and know realistically I don’t want to die...but when it gets bad, it gets loud.  I’ve reached out to 2 friends and my mom. They know and are supporting me but I feel so guilty about it. This isn’t something they should have to worry about. Who wants to deal with a friend or child who’s always thinking about hurting themselves. I feel like a burden and a failure. I’m super scared one day I won’t be able to talk myself out of it like I can right now. I want it to go away, but instead it’s getting louder.
[removed]
Yeah. I know it’s not true but it feels like it. I wish you couldn’t relate..I wouldn’t wish it on anybody. I am doing my best. It’s exhausting but I always remind myself of the beautiful things I don’t want to miss. Its enough for now. I hope it always will be.
[removed]
Not sure about voices..but it’s not me either. I think I of it as the depression ‘voice’. Like a bully inside my brain that is at war with the real me. The harder I try to quiet it the louder it shouts. So far I’ve won though.
[removed]
Hope it leaves you alone someday. It’s a relatively new thing for me..until last year I never thought I’d be like this. Something somehow changed in me from 2020 and I’ve never been the same since. One day I hope.
[removed]
It’s okay, I’m 22. These thoughts first started around my birthday last year actually. Went away for awhile and came back around Christmas (of all times..) and has been getting louder since, this is probably the worst it’s been. I do hope you can find relief someday. I wish nobody dealt with this
[removed]
Yeah, we cope the best we can right? I always try to find beauty in something. Today I found a smile watching a squirrel. Simple things.

Yeah. Let’s just keep going. Just chatting back and forth here made me feel a bit better so thanks. Hope your night goes okay.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzpbum/manipulative_parents/
My gf has been so depressed and suicidal her entire life, and feel free to read the whole story from my past posts but  her parents are so fucking manipulative.. I don't know how to help her. It's not like I can just swoop her away or take her to therapy myself, I don't have the assets or means to do so. Her parents are only guilting her further, her mom even missed bringing her to her session today and now she has to resched (but she says she probably doesn't want to anymore because she feels so guilty and wasting money). She was already diagnosed with major depression last week by her therapist and wants her to take meds that won't be permanent, and was genuinely making small progress.. but her boomer parents are just so fucking unsupportive..  her dad even told her that "if you want the family to work, you have to help yourself" "i'm human and i'm' trying my best, and you need to help yourself" to the point that her dad even said "you don't need therapy, you're just paying someone to talk to you". I'm at a loss for words. I've spoken with her dad before and I know he genuinely wants to help and protect her, but I really think he's so blind and full of himself, ironic because he said to his daughter that she's "full of herself".  The last thing was they even told her "you'll regret everything whenwe're gone. and it'll be soon cause we're so old." she can't even open up to them because of them being them. her mental health is only getting worse and worse..  She feels like such a burden now. I don't know how to help her, I'm so heartbroken for her. Even just being there for her probably won't help her heal, she needs help but I don't know what help I can give when she's at the edge of giving it all up again.   How? what do i do for her? I fucking love her and she doesn't deserve all of this. She's such a good person with a good heart, but it just keeps getting shattered over and over I don't know what to do.. For the record she's not a child, she's an adult but she has to live with her parents too. She wanted to leave that place as soon as she can. What can she do? What must I do?  &#x200B;  TLDR; her parents guilt tripping her further into depression  ps: sorry if I got too carried away with my emotions and calling out her parents for being boomers.
Idk man, I'm her but without a you. I think what I would need if you can't get me out of a situation like that, is support. I'm sure you are doing everything you can but especially because she can't go to therapy always you need to reassure her. I'm talking about be annoying as all hell. Im saying like keep telling her things she already knows. If she needs someone to vent to, let her vent to you. Only assure her that she's right, or at least has validity. If she needs space, DON'T GIVE IT TO HER. ESPECIALLY IS SHE IS SUICIDAL DON'T LEAVE HER ALONE. I'm sorry because you're gonna have to walk on sharp ass eggshells, but she obviously needs you. There also might not be a solution until she can get out of that situation. You might just have to wade through the shit with her. It's going to feel impossible, because it almost will be. I'm not a professional, I'm also not even mentally stable either, but just giving you things to think about. You need to affirm that her parents are wrong and keep doing that. She can't let her parents get to her, and you can support her by helping her realize that they are crazy and not good parents. Good luck with that, my only other advice is if you have the money hire a therapist for you to help her.

so, i finally got diagnosed and i’m finally getting help, which is great of course, but after talking about this with a couple family members i learned a lot about my family and i’m not entirely sure how to process it. every single person in my immediate family has some awful repressed trauma that they never got the help for. and to an extent, i knew. i knew they were all screwed up and couldn’t admit to themselves that they were screwing their kids and their grandkids up. but it’s just so weird having a lifelong perception of your family be completely shattered in 2 days. i learned some things about myself too, things i don’t even remember but my sister does. the thing that impacted me the most though was finding out that my grandfather had walked in on his father after he’d taken his life at an extremely young age. i’m sorry if this is oversharing, but god i have no idea how to react to this. i don’t know what to feel or think right now, it’s just way too much all at once.

Sometimes I Wish That All My Closest Friends Hated Me  So That I Could Just Leave  And They Could Live Happily
What about your family then.
They’ll never be the same once you leave, I left a dear family member once to seek a new life though that would make me happier. Came back years later to meet him but I was to late I build so much distance between me and the one person that loved me and cared for me to seek my happiness and when I came back I was informed about what I made that person live through and go through, when we leave someone that loves us and enjoys our presence suddenly they fall into a loop of blaming themselves and they started hating themselves because they would believe it’s their fault for not being there for us I grew now it’s years ever since that incident but the only thing changed is I live everyday to be there for those who love me and to enjoy my moments with those who love me and I love. I can’t talk about my experience in detail but what can I say don’t do my mistake count your blessings and cherish it. Because living your life for those you love is worth it and worth every moment you’ll live with them
Obsession is the same as depression they say let go it's ok to be sad and need help you don't gotta go thro it alone 🕊️

I used to have moderate to mild depression that worsened and seems to only get worse very slowly. The past 2 years it’s only seemed to have gotten worse gradually to the point where I finally, unfortunately, understand when people say they can’t even get out of bed or brush their teeth/shower. I used to think that was just bullshit and “yeah life sucks but not that badly geez.” I didn’t understand severe depression and I do now. I slowly slipped into this. I spend at least an hour in bed every morning lying around thinking about how i can’t get up. I never wash my face before bed anymore. Taking my earrings out seems like the biggest chore. I never used to be this bad. I need help so bad
I get it. I almost started crying because I have laundry to do and i'm just so tired and I have no energy to want to do it.
please understand that your depression worsening is not your fault. it's more likely than not for this mental illness to progress into higher severity. i hope you get the help you rightly deserve.

I was planning on attempting tonight. I ended up backing out. So I’m still alive for now. Which means I have to undo all the damage I did when I thought nothing mattered because I’d be dead soon. Now I have to explain to my professors why I haven’t shown up to a single class since the semester started. Why I haven’t done any of the assignments. Have to contact my friends and come up with excuses for why I ghosted them. Have to clean my house. Have to start eating healthy again. I don’t care about this shit I don’t even want to be here. Why can’t I just press a button and stop existing
I’m sorry you’re going through this. Be honest with your friends. Tell your professor you’ve been having mental health issues or lie and say someone close in the family passed and that you’re taking it hard. But whatever you do, don’t give up on yourself. Take it dat by day to pick yourself back up. Create or follow self care checklists. Take it easy. Find a hobby or something exciting that makes your day by day easier when you have down time. You won’t be happier immediately but it’s worth the process to get there. even if you don’t see it happening. You’ll get to a point where you’ll be okay with being here. And it’s fine to be just okay.

⚠️ TW ⚠️  s/h read at your own risk!! ⚠️ TW ⚠️   Hi guys how r u? I'll just get straight to it; i've been self harming for about two or three years now i don't really remember and for a while i used to cut my arms. i've stopped now i just do it on my legs. and at first and shit, it was not that hard to cover up. Sure it could get a bit hot at times especially living in Australia,  washing the dishes was  frustrating, and making sure my arms were covered up before someone entered my room was quite annoying BUT over all, it was doable. With all the red and inflamed marks on my arm from past cuts, i can't just leave them exposed. especially Not in front of family, teachers or friends(school). but now it's getting super frustrating to cover up my arms and i was thinking of not really covering them up anymore when i go out with my best friend (she knows/unjudgemental) but i'm kinda worried ppl around me might get triggered by it but it gets kind of :/ to constantly cover them up. Keep in mind the scars on my arms are all fully healed they're just red and puffy but i stopped cutting on my arms a while ago. what do you guys think?   another problem i have is my senior ball ( prom) is coming up pretty soon and my mom wants to take me dress shopping. i'm rlly worried bc idk how to cover up my scars :((( i told her i wana wear long sleeve dress and she said "u should still try on ones with ur arms out just to see" and i've explained to her how i don't like my arms bc they're fat ( as an excuse i don't actually think that) and i suggested maybe i could wear like gloves? like rlly cool 20's type right but the thing is when i go shopping she is still gonna have to see the dress on before i buy the gloves. and they don't sell realy nice long sleeve dresses :(( i asked if i could go shopping with my best friend (so i don't have to worry about it) but she insisted on coming :(((( wtf do i do!!! i'm rlly sad i just wish this wasn't a problem i wish i never cut on my arms it's so frustrating to fucking hide :(((   please don't suggest i talk to my mother about it because she talks shit about people who self harm / doesn't believe in mental illness issues. also YES, i do see a psychologist and i am on antidepressants so please don't suggest that either. i'm aware of my problem and so is my doctor <333  if you struggle with the same thing, PLEASE get help. i understand how hard it is and when people ask us to just "stop" cutting it doesn't work, it's an addiction and it's hard to deal with on ur own!!!   thanks guys i hope ur all okay <33
That’s you, you have to be comfortable with the things you can’t change. I’m a guy so I can’t relate with you on a lot of things but loving who you are can change your life.

Hey everybody... This is my first ever reddit post so probably no one will read it or think much of it. But I'm used to that, so it's fine...   I've been feeling like shit since the end of 2018 and went into therapy August 2019. My Psychologist was one of those, 'Oh that must've been so hard for you' and 'how does that make you feel' type of people, so I switched to a different one and after our first conversation she told me that I probably have a social phobia and it would probably be good to start on antidepressants since I was also getting gloomy because of my anxiety.  I wanted it to get better so I started taking Sertraline. (An SSRI) after talking to a psychiatrist. It didn't work. I spiraled down into a depression and my psychiatrist wanted to start me on Efexor (venlafaxine). Up until that point, my fear of becoming worse had kept me from drinking. Before I started taking AD I was a problemdrinker and even confessed to my boyfriend I drank waaay too much. Well not now. I was on AD so I'd get better.  Fast forward a few months.  It's 9 in the morning and I'm drunk. I Feel like total shit all the time and am so depressed that I keep thinking about ending it all. Somehow I still manage to work, but I really hate my job, my bf doesn't understand and keeps saying I make his life hell with my nasty moods and he doesn't like coming home to me... I know I shouldn't take alcohol with AD, but I feel so low, and the only thing that temporarily makes me feel better, is alcohol.  Does anyone else feel like that? Do you have any advice? Does anyone care? Probably not... sorry to waste your time.
I’m drinking right now. For the reason of wanting to feel better but deeper down wanting to escape reality. It’s not going to happen, we have to start at the little things and go from there.
Hey man. I used to struggle with drinking too. It’s still something I crave on my darkest days but I try my hardest not to go down that rabbit hole of darkness. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose. I’ve realised now it’s a life long battle; depression and anxiety isn’t necessarily something you “beat”, it’s something you fight against every day.  Alcohol is a bad thing dude, I’m a fine one to talk because it tends to be my “go-to” on my worst days as well but seriously, if you can please try to stop. You’re a strong person, even through this hard time you’ve still not given up and that’s commendable. Now be kind to yourself, put down the bottle of whatever it is you’ve got and try to get some rest. Drink some water, stay hydrated. I wish I could give some proper advice but I’m no doctor, but life is it’s own battle and we all have to find our way of dealing with it’s shit. Some battles we win and some we lose but the main thing is to keep going, even when it doesn’t really make sense to.  Social phobia is difficult too, I struggle daily with that and still haven’t done anything about it.  Things will get easier eventually my friend, life happens like tides, one minute you're low and feeling shallow, then all of a sudden you rise. Just ride that wave.
Yeah same here... to escape. If only that would be possible...
Thanks man. This means a lot!
We both know that’s not going to happen. But it is what it is. I try to do better and it does help, but fuck. I still have shitty moments like this

Everyday I tell myself I will do something to progress and everyday I let myself down. Life has never be harder than this.
Same struggles here, but I can give u an advice for you to try on yourself. Stop giving yourself a hard time for not doing something, be patient with yourself, instead start little by little and get proud of doing something for yourself, you will get motivation and increase it with time but keep it easy for yourself bro no pressure. The simple fact that I wake up take a shower dress and do my bed + some workout when I feel like doing it gives me motivation. One thing you have to fix is sleeping schedule if u have a fked up one like me. Hope u can find some happiness in this.
100% same I just can’t
Same here.  Life fucking sucks for us.  Keep telling myself it will get better but at this point it’s useless cause I know that ain’t true
What sort of things do you say you'll do to progress?
Same! I honestly just feel like a useless piece of shit!
I feel you
Lower your expectations. I've been taking a lot of drugs this week, pretty bad state. My only expectation was I wake up, make a smoothie, walk around the block. I did it. I also did the washing and groceries.  Remember the first steps are ALWAYS the hardest but they do get easier.
I understand that feeling. And it sucks :( Is there anything you can do to break up the cycle a bit? Make things a bit more fun and interesting? Is there any hobbies you have? I hope you feel better soon :((
Yep. Struggling with this.  Maybe instead of "things you didn't do" or "things you need to do", keep a list of "things you'd like to do" or "things you did"  Starting is always the hardest part. And that's ok. I usually have to wait until things pile up, and then go hard one day when the mood hits me.   Then I forget about all the time I spent procrastinating when it's finally done, as a little bit of self forgiveness.  Medications help too. As do little rituals. If you're trying to go for a walk everyday, get your shoes out of the closet and put them on. If you don't run, you don't run. But you did the ritual and got a little closer. Take them off at the end of the day and count it as a victory.
someone else said it here—do you think expectations are having an impact on how you judge your day to have been?
Yet everyone and everything around me (the root of my depression in the first place) is pressuring me to sleep less and wake up early. Life is an irony.
I feel this   Set the bar as low as possible to achieve a success..like..go for a 5 min walk..build on that success..small steps...keep going.

I don't even have classes to do. I'm a partially unemployeed 32 y/o server and I have the means to take computer science classes for virtually nothing and all the time in the world to do that, but I'm terrified of applying myself and just let myself do nothing all day
Be gentle to yourself ❤️ sometimes lying in bed is all we can do and that’s okay. We don’t need to be productive everyday to have worth ❤️
I try to do this, but then I'm always plagued with my own judgmental thoughts. Like "should I feel good about doing what's normal for most people?" kind of things. It's not constructive at all but it's always there at the back of my mind :(   It's really funny that no one would actually judge me (I don't think) especially not those close to me, and if anyone told me about this I'd encourage them and cheer them on, but when it comes to my own case I can't do the same. I feel like I'm just a lazy pos...
this is actually really good advice, I will try to implement that into my life, see how that works out
I have assignments which have stacked up and I haven't started any of them. I know I can do it, because I passed the first two. There's so much more I wanna do, but this is the priority, right now.
I was getting into Jiu Jitsu before the lockdown. I just have no motivation to do anything, anyway.
100%, but I will fall behind in life if I don't do what I'm asking of myself cause I'm literally not doing anything.
why would you say that
Nah depression is fked up so don't go comparing yourself with others bro, just do your own thing fk them. You have to be happy not because you did something that others do normally you have to feel happy cause you are fighting depression and those baby steps you take now will lead you to recover, and you will probably help others with it cause you are more open as a person. Remember you are not doing what everyone else is doing you are getting out of depression. That shit ain't easy to do. A lot of people unfortunately give up on life because of it. But you are fighting.
Try it, it can't hurt to be good to yourself bro!!
I have this going on too... What I did was take the one that bothers me the most (in my case I'm a translator so I took the biggest chunks of paragraphs) and just started working on it, so at least I'd know when I'm done with that, it'll be all downhill from there. It's still difficult, trying to focus on work... Hope you find the willpower to get them started.
I think it's smart that you stacked them up. Making things organized and ready to do is sometimes really helpful in doing them.  I'm in a kind of similar position. I am moving but have so little desire to pack things up.  Each night I get 3 boxes ready, and put one in each of 3 rooms, say kitchen, bedroom, living room. I tell myself "start with the easy stuff, the stuff that doesn't require a whole lot of wrapping, stuff you know you won't need."   Honestly, I still don't WANT to do it, but by making myself do 3 a day, I'm slowly getting it done. A couple days I actually decided to fill 1 or 2 more, just so an area was all emptied.   Starting early and doing things slowly like this is for me far less overwhelming than waiting and then having to do hours of work at a time.  Maybe something like that could help you, too. Good luck. It's really huge when people with depression get thru these challenges. Be proud of even small steps.
Once lock down ends, definitely get back into it. A hobby will hopefully improve how you feel :)
do you have a diagnosis? might disability be an option? not necessarily permanently, perhaps even just so you can stop everything and regroup. motivating yourself using fear is a horrible thing to do to yourself. there are ways...
Thanks for support :) Yeah I should know better after dealing with this for 15 years but it's been especially hard lately (not because it was 2020, not because COVID)... But I'll try to stay strong

My mum passed nearly a year ago, i moved to start a new life and start a new job. Ive been working with my dad, i pump out septic tanks only been doing it for about a week and i really wanna quit. My dads a very angery person and i dont like working with him, i really dont work well with angery people. But anyway it was one of my best friends birthday and i realised i was the only single person and i said something dumb and he said shut up matt your just lonely, and it took me a bit but i realised hes, right i live alone, i just work or stay home. I really struggle with opening up to people. I dont know whats wrong with me. I just miss my mum so much. I dont know what to do i just feel so alone all the time. Im just drunk rn so ill probs just delete this later.
You got this! It’s ok you’re going through a tough time
Drinking rn too my guy. You gotta be comfortable with yourself and set goals for yourself. You’ve heard that before and so have I but when you start getting little “wins” they add up and distracts you from the pain.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzmljh/suspect_livein_partner_has_depression_possible/
I suspect my partner has depression. The symptoms started 3 years ago with slacking on chores, other responsibilities and lying about debt. I brought it up and it was ignored. I left it. A year later violent bounce of anger began which included wall punching. A couple's therapist mentioned it might be depression. They ignored it. I left it. Slowly months by months it kept getting worse. I brought it up every now and then. Eventually they contacted their GP and did a CBT course. I noticed the homework did not get done, there was a short talk about it when asked and they spent their time playing games instead. Fast forward to now, all they do is work, cook and play video games. The house got as bad as cat urine/feces/sick being left on the carpet for 2 weeks (I had a neck injury and could not move/do anything - I've cleaned it all now though!). The house is so cluttered from unfinished de-cluttering/moving jobs from months back. They are still maintaining personal hygiene and feeding themselves, however all personal responsibility have vanished. They are on a warning with work due to playing games during it. Despite this warning I see them playing games or watching games each time I walk past the office (it is next to the bathroom and the monitor is at door view).  This stresses me out as I am worried they will lose their job and it was agreed that I would be supported during my degree (because I cannot work/study like others) and after that I can be the "bread winner" so they can do whatever they want.   &#x200B;  **What I am dealing with external to the relationship:**   * I am deaf, autistic (ASD), dyslexic and in eating disorder and OCD recovery. * I was diagnosed with some scary health issues which are related to a phobia.  * I have been successfully doing intensive therapy for coming up to 3 years (super grateful after fighting years to have access). * Been without my therapist for a month. * Been in lockdown since last March. (No other social contact IRL outside of partner).  * My close friend was diagnosed with breast cancer a month back. * We lost five of my pets last year, all suddenly and unexpectedly to freak illnesses.  * I have been experiencing bulling and discrimination from tutors and peers. * My best friend has been putting less effort into our friendship (they moved to another country). * I have not been given much support from tutors or dissertation supervisor. * My course is under threat of being shut down and investigated, making the tutors more unhelpful.  * I have a dissertation due on Wed which is part of an extension for reasonable adjustments.  * I never learned the basics of essay writing in school due to being mainstream deaf.  * I need the communal spaces and my space to be clean and neat (ASD/OCD related).  * There is a pile of charity things in my space. * All communal spaces are cluttered and dirty. (I have been chipping away at then with whatever energy I can muster. They sadly make them messy again quickly).  * Not had sex in a year. Kissing has stopped. Hugs are rare.  * Finding it hard to function as I get bouts of depression related to ASD. Regular depression treatment does not work the same way.   &#x200B;  For a while I was handling it okay, it was stressful but my WRAP and coping techniques no longer seem to be working. I suspect I might be in survival mode. It has reached the point in which I am experiencing daily triggers for multiple of my conditions. I  had a return of suicidal thoughts (was nearly free of this for a year), I have not self-harmed again but those urges are back too (super tempted), finding myself crying daily, struggling to sleep and just really having a very lonely and rubbish time. Craving love, care and affection. Finding it super hard to give myself that love, care and affection. For now I am trying my hardest to focus on getting my dissertation completed as best as I can. But the stress of the environment I am in is making that extra challenging. It takes me much longer to do task due to conditions. This is not a big issue with the correct support but I sadly have been failed by the institution. **Anyone got any advice on how to make the best of the last few days before due date?**      **Does anyone have any advice on navigating a depressed partner beyond "focus on you" which might help?** **But is also not a list of things to make them feel better?** **How does one get through this awful, awful phase?** Obviously nipping my relapse symptoms in the bud ASAP is a good step. But outside of that, I am feeling so lost on how to handle the intense loneliness and focus.         Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I was feeling extremely depressed and all of a sudden I had this thought that I'm nothing in this world, you might think this is even more depressing but for me, it isn't. Being nothing makes me feel better because it doesn't matter what I do, I won't change the world, with me or without me the world is still the same. So I can literally do whatever I want. I'm only a little ant among 7.7 billion ants.   What happens if I stay depressed lying in a bed? The world doesn't give a fuck, It stays the same, what happens if I get my shit together and I actually achieve my goals? The world doesn't give a fuck, just the same thing. That idea made me feel better, it gave me a little sense of reality, it created a spark inside me.  I'm not sure if this is going to be helpful for other people, I'm sorry if this sounds like bullshit for you, maybe it is bullshit, but I think that some people out there must have similar ways of looking at life and that thought could be helpful somehow, thanks for your time!

I'm drowning literally in my own mind. I just can't really take it anymore. I just wanna don't exist, I just want to sleep in peace forever.  My childhood trauma worsening my condition. I am just a burden to this world, I have no future, I am just a waste. I really wish to pass away in my sleep.
I feel you . Everything get worse day by day . I have friends but still I feel alone . I ask myself everyday that "Why do I exist ?" because I have no goal to do or live because of it . You've wrote things I say every day . My life is bullshit and the fucking school and my parent make it worse ever minute . I just want to die as fast as possible , I don't care how . I have no reason to live . I can't take this suffer anymore . I can't enjoy my life anymore .
If you feel like your mind is too full of thoughts try writing in a journal or something, and everyone has a future and it’s also ok to not know your future.
Hang in there friend. You matter to this world. I’m here for you, and I completely understand your pain.
I am so miserable I’d give anything to just fucking die
Yup. Everyday gets worse. I have zero friends, and the person I loved left me for someone else. Threw me out like the trash I am and put all of his effort into her. I don’t even matter. I don’t know why I have to keep existing
This is life ... you make others feel better , you make others happy , you make others laugh but ... at last life gives you the worst feelings and throws you into a world of sadness because you was a good person ...

I'm turning 25 this month and I don't know what to do with my life. Never had job in my life even though I applied for everything. Even McDonald's and warehouse they don't take me. All friends starting to leave me so I basically just stay in my room all day, waking up feel like shit. Basically everyone just fucking ignore me i tried to make friends they just don't want to. I deleted all my social media because seeing people in relationships and happy makes me jealous. I wish I had friends to hang out with, I wish I had the relationship. I can't take it no more no one knows how you go through I just hate everything. FUCK THIS LIFE!!! Sorry for my English it's not my first language.
Hey you're not alone. It's a tough time to find a job right now and for starting relationships. For social media, just know that all the happy stuff you see are just highlights of people's lives and that there's no reason to feel down from it. Don't compare yourself to others and just focus on yourself. 25 isn't too old to start changing yourself if you wanted to.
Don’t do this some people might not like you but everyone on r/depressed and every other subreddit is here for you don’t give up stay strong you can get trough it together
Thank you, I'm trying to change but when I wake up I feel doing nothing I just want to fucking disappear.
No one gives shit about me, even though I try my best
Unfortunately, changes seem to take time is what I've found. Hell, it took me ages after I decided to clean up my room to actually do it. I heard it's better if you do it in small increments and giving yourself little rewards everytime you do it, so maybe you could try that.
I care ok so Let’s make a deal ok make something like a YouTube channel and do something you love on it and see how much people love to watch you play or do something you love ok I will be your first follower/subscriber you name it I’ll be the first deal?
Yes you are right i just feel shit seeing all friends living their life and getting laid and me here wasting my life in my room, just can't help it. I'll start working out again.

I've been in my own place for a little over a month now and things have been good. I feel a sense of pride in my own space, have been working on creative projects, and work has been going well.   All that said, I still dont see a future worth living for. I'll never have a wife or kids, and in 24 years of life I havent found anything worth living a whole life for. I'm kind of just biding my time until my parents pass and my best friend is out of my life at which point I can off myself without hurting anyone.

I've been feeling super low recently. I started cutting again. I don't know who to turn to. I feel like a burden to my friends. I know everyone is dealing with their own struggles. I don't want to add to their stress. I'm seeing a therapist every two weeks and it helps to talk things through, but it doesn't seem like enough. Everyone I tell about my depression ends up leaving. It's hard to keep going sometimes. I feel so alone and trapped.
I can understand what you are feeling, but remember that not everyone can handle what you are going through. You are stronger than you believe, even if you go back to cutting. You made it this far.  If I can make a suggestion, I would point you to some IFS sessions to see if you can get to that side of you that is cutting and explore why it is doing it. What it is doing to help keep you safe, even if you are damaging yourself in the process. Sometimes we forget the reasons why and they manifest in these habits.  You can find others who can listen, but they also have to understand what you are going through. People who are still hiding or never address this in the first place will always struggle with this idea.
We're all here for each other my dude. If people leave when you open up to them, then they're probably not the kind of people you need around you anyway.

I'm 25. I had to move back home with my parents when the pandemic started. It's destroyed my mental state. I don't have a job, my parents still control my life. How do I escape? I don't have enough money to live on my own. I can't be myself here. I don't have any passions. Nothing interests me. Things I enjoyed when I was younger have no effect on me now. I sit around on my phone all day. I can't see anyone other than my family for fear of COVID. People my age are going about their lives as if nothing is wrong. How is anyone a productive human? How does anyone deal with the genuine shittiness that is life? Home is a prison.
u  said many people ur age are going about their lives also many people ur age are living back at home. student loan is stupid. inflation isnt' keeping up with the job market, and it basically takes two working full time adults to afford one bedroom. It's insane and everyone knows the roommates can suck. I feel u 100% when i had to move back in SHORTLY with my parents they undermined me, stalked me, told me what to do like i was 2,  they are tox, but the only thing u CAN DO is save up and MOVE OUT as soon as you can. I suggest buying instead of renting its makes mores sense. and move to a less urban area for cheaper prices if possible to ur work.
You just stated why your thinking is shifting like that. YOUR PHONE. Make a list of 10 things you watch and click on whether it’s people or things. When they pop up don’t look at it or give it atttention. Corona virus has everyone at home now which means they use their phones more social media more. You see how others are living a good life making their passion or fun shit a living and then you see yourself and think why you couldn’t do the same. That shit is gonna kill you trust me. The real life is that everyone that posts on social media fakes shit so they want validation, real happy people don’t use social media. I know you might be confused why I’m talking about this but it’s the true reality, everyone is more depressed now because they use social media more often than before, and it’s a human thing to compare your life to other people’s and then you look at your own and think damn I’m not doing shit. I’m tell you your house is not the problem, it’s what you see and expect of yourself because of social media. There’s millions of 25 years still living with parents every where they just don’t talk about it because no one is gonna post it on social media. Don’t be in a rush because you think society will judge you because of where you’re at in life. Stop comparing your life to the 5% that actually have it good and aren’t faking it like the rest of 30%.
Same 27 years old , male , never trusted by parents because they tought im problemetic and now completle destroyed my life , as 27 year i cant enjoy the life as adult
Same, I'm 21 and its as fucking mind numbingly painful as I would have imagined. Idk what to do either man. But look, good luck to you and hope you get outskis as soon as fucking possible
I'm in the same exact situation except for the being afraid of covid part. It sucks, it's easier once you get a job but it is difficult. I have a couple grand saved up to move out but my cars transmission is about to go. One thing after another...
Same as you, I am about to move back with my parents after working hard to be able to afford living on my own (They weren't controlling my life since I am a stubborn motherfucker but they were toxic enough). But since this shit show started I lost my job along many of my coworkers and haven't been able to find anything in months, lived off my saving but sadly I don't have much left... moving back probably next month.  My plan is sending my resume around until I find something and drowning in video games, music until I get bored and maybe learn some useful skills on my own, I refuse to let myself slip down the abyss again.
you're not alone! Im 24 and live with my parents and i hate it.
I've had depression for years but it isn't on the "everything in life is meaningless" level anymore. One thing that helped me was taking personality tests to assess my strengths and weaknesses. Before I did this, I didn't quite know what I was good at and my life reflected that because so many of the things I did were random and not a reflection of my authentic self. I also was living vicariously through others and letting who I was created to be go to waste. These personality tests gave me the opportunity to double down on and refine my strengths as well as learning how to minimize my weaknesses. Another thing that helped was making a list of my values and trying to do more actions that reflect those. If your circumstance sucks, at least these things can provide you an opportunity to like yourself better while you're going through this tough time.
26 and live with parents. Shit sucks. Cant do anything productive in this suburb either. Hoping to move out next week if this apartment approves my application. Currently on unemployment and got rejected from the last apartment I tried to move in to. Needed 3x my rent for monthly income wtf
Stop using your phone, spend time focusing on one skill that would be beneficial to your income. I feel like for everyone the best and foremost passion is not living in hell. Money helps, so learning trade is a good option, coding is probably the best. Web development is fairly beginner friendly and you could land a good paying position in a year of persistent self-study. Best of luck, first step is to become aware of the position your in.
Wow, posted this as a late night downer. Didn't expect to hear so many people feeling the same. I'm hopeful that somehow we can all get through this, but man does it really suck in this moment.
It feels like the cost of living just keeps getting higher and higher, life sucks.
It doesn't feel like it, it's a fact. There are housing problems everywhere and inflation and shortage has ruined the market.
It absolutely is. Idk what part of the country you're in but we in the SOUTH and I can't even afford to live in the city i grew up in cause houses dont start under $500,000 i couldn't live near my parents if i wanted to I had to move 30 miles north to the country to find anything... houses go up and pay stays the same.. ITs vicious. best best is to get a roommate u can trust
The cost of living in the south is insane compared to when I was growing up. I wouldn’t even look at prices in my hometown, I know I couldn’t comfortably afford it. Currently about 15 minutes outside of Atlanta paying nearly $1000/month for my apartment, that’s the discounted rate and prices have increased since I signed my lease in September.
Hahaha then we are from the same place. My parents live in East Cobb I grew up in East Cobb. Can't afford to live in East Cobb my Husband who is from Woodstock we got forced to Cartersville because we couldn't find anything in our budget under $500,000 for sale. and i'm not paying $1,3000 for an apartment. my first apartment was off bells ferry by town center and it was 630 for a 2b2b in 2008 that same apart is like $1.8k so stupid
Lol, yes! My parents live in Milton. Love the area maybe my salary will match up to those prices eventually. My boyfriend is moving back to Atlanta in May, we’d like to find a house in the Chamblee/Tucker area but my brother had zero luck and ended up moving out to Loganville.   I’m at my absolute max now paying for an apartment. I couldn’t bring myself to pay anything higher.
Its so dumb.

Edit: WARNING. This horror has become so apart of my life now that I’m use to it. And I forget that it really fucks people up just hearing about it it’s so traumatic. So just to prepare it’s about aggravated sexual assault with young children  Ok so I found out this summer that my daughter who is 12 now was raped when she was 7 multiple times by my best friends husband. She told me that it finally stopped when she went to her best friend, (my best friends daughter) and asked her to tell her dad to stop. And then it didn’t happen again after that. I called my best friend and told her what I just found out. She was shocked and had doubts but said she would ask her daughter if she remembers that. She called me back an hour later crying cuz her daughter admitted and admitted he’s been raping her too starting when she was 5. His own daughter. she kicked her husband out and we called the police and I’m very happy to say after a week of working with the fbi. my friend got him to confess to it all while the fbi was listening. He’s now in jail waiting trial. Finding this all out has devastated our whole family. My husband had to come home early from his deployment we were so devastated. Months have gone by. I signed My daughter up for trauma counseling and they said after two sessions she doesn’t need trauma counseling. That she has moved on from this and is not traumatized by it. I asked my daughter if that was true and she said yes she just wants to move on and be a normal family again. I tell her ok and say help is there for you if you need it. I know this is what she wants and she doesn’t want this to be our life. but I’m having a hard time moving on and I don’t want to upset her. I can’t stop thinking about it. It doesn’t make sense. How the fuck did I not see this.. how did my friend. not see this. Our family have been so close for the last ten years. We get together 3 times a week for ten years. He was so fucking normal. How did I not see this monster who raped his 3 biological daughters now we know, and my daughter was next to me this whole time. We are both stay at home moms. Our kids are our everything. And these kids were always happy. We never once saw them in pain or saw bloody underwear or saw her crying around him. And they had to have been and I can’t move on from my confusion. How was this massive absolute horror happening for years and no one had a clue. And the guilt. My job is to protect her and I failed. No matter what I do for the rest of her life I have failed as her mother. I don’t know how to not have this be my life. I’m never gonna not be devastated or confused or fulled with so much guilt. Everyone says I need therapy but I don’t see the point. On the outside I’m normal. I’m ok I’m not crying on the couch for days. I’m playing with my kids and my husband and I are great. We really leaned on each other. He agrees with my daughter and wants to move on. I feel like my family is moving forward and I can’t stop thinking about it. Lucky I have my best friend still. And she is the only one who understand what I’m going through. But it’s not the same. She understands that for about two years of my life all my photos are ruined. Every photo from the time she was 6-8 all I think about is was this when she was raped? Is she in pain in this photo and she pretending? My friend understands this because all the photos for the last 18 years are ruined for her. And she feels all this guilt and more. I can’t imagine what she is going though. She lost her husband who she thought they “we’re happy” but realizes it was all a lie. She lost her dream house(that she closed on three days before we found out)She lost 2/3 of her income. And she has the guilt of this happening to her three daughters. She knows what I’m going through more then anyone. But what I’m going through doesn’t even compare to what she’s going though. I don’t want to complain to her about my family going back to normal and happy and I’m just frozen with my thoughts.   Ok so not I explained what I’m going though I was wondering if anyone has gone through something similar. And I’m wondering if me frozen with my horror in my head is just my normal and I need to except it.
You didn’t fail your daughter as a mother. Your best friend’s husband failed you all, as an adult you should have been able to trust. He took advantage of that trust and used it to hurt his daughters and yours. That isn’t a failure on your part. He’s the failure. You need therapy so you can have a safe place to talk through all of this. Is the frozen horror in your head normal? A therapist will help you figure that out. How do you support your best friend while also trying to get your family back to normal? A therapist will help. What do you do about the hard time you’re still having even though your daughter just wants to move on? Therapy. Even though you’re “normal on the outside,” a therapist will help you work through every single issue you’ve written about. At the very least, a therapist will be someone looking out for you at a time when you could really use an additional player on your personal support team.
My wife was sexually abused when she was 10 by some colleagues in the school.  Although she told her parents about it, they were too lazy to do anything. So she fought on her own.  The shock is still in her mind and the absence of her parents - doing something about it - did not help at all.  Being there for her is the best think you can do, but also give her space to work it out her own way, but letting she come to you when she needs it.  I was the one who started “curing” my wife... every time she would open up more and more.   Just make sure to be there and try to give her the best life she can.  And please - get this guys behind bars as soon as possible. I don’t care if your bestie will never talk to you again - give him what he deserves
Therapy isn't about how you act "on the outside". It's about your thoughts and feelings and trauma. It can't change what happened, but you can learn how to cope. I *strongly* suggest trying it out.
My best friend wore a wire and got her husband to confess and got him to confess in details and the fbi arrested him. He’s in jail now waiting trial. I am really confident he’s going away for a while

I just had to tell someone.
But you didnt. Well done :)
Be sure to stay on that side of that "almost"
Very glad it was almost. Is anything specific harming you right now, or was it more a slow slide to where you are now, bud?
I just hope I can keep doing it
It’s so hard
I’ve been crippled by depression for over 6 months. Everyday has been a struggle to stay alive. My wife is kicking me out and I have no where to go. I’m loosing my therapy animals just to make things worse.
Most importantly, do you have a place to stay? Physical comes first.  Did something happen 6 months ago that you can pinpoint starting this? Was it lockdown, or just come out of nowhere...?
She’s letting me stay with her while I try and find a place to go, but I don’t have anyone to stay with and I can’t get a place on my own because my credit got screwed when I became depressed. 6 months ago me and my wife moved back in together after a few months apart after she left me last Christmas. I don’t know if our relationship is the cause of my depression.
If it isn't the root cause, it absolutely was an exacerbator. I hope you can find the origin point as soon as possible. When you find another place to go, keep a *strong* eye on your emotions to see if things rise across the board over the next few weeks. If they do, it was probably the relationship.  If things stagnate or get worse, this may go deeper. :(
I fear it does go deeper, I’ve had episodes of major depression my whole life. It seems to just be part of who I am. But I’ve never felt as depressed as this for  so long. I’ve tried so many antidepressants and even did ketamine infusions this year and nothing has helped.
I understand the frustration. Perhaps it could be something cognitive, so the meds aren't really targeting the source? Do you have a history with parental divorce, neglect/abuse, identity issues (not knowing who you are, codependency, etc...), years of agreeing with thoughts of self-hatred or hopelessness instead of actively combatting them, or other problems of the mind?  No need to answer me here, just some ideas on where to look. If you still can't locate roots, a visit to a professional (especially guided therapy like CBT or psychoanalysis) is tailor made to deep dive the mind and check for potential origin points, if you're up for it. That was my eventual ticket out of suicidal hell.

So apparently I was depressed for a while and no one blinked a tear.  I told a guy I was doing therapy and he proceeded to exclude me and talk behind my back to make me feel less secure. The other guy didn't call him out, and said that I wasn't really stepping up enough. Which may have been true. I don't understand how so many people could have sided with him. How they couldn't tell, because no one really knew me, I always hid when things got out of control, when the thoughts got bad, or the anxiety got bad, I avoid being really seen. So even these people couldn't tell, because I am more detached from emotions I could still 'do' things. And to add to that, I was in search of therapy and in therapy and they didn't convince me to stay. I had to go out of my way to talk to someone who was the first to recommend that I go back to therapy. So I found a guy, and he was kind of cold and he wanted to blame me for cancelling the session rather than understand why I did that. And he didn't tell me either, only after I forced another session he said that I seem to have lot of anxiety/personal insecurity. He didn't care whether I went or didn't go. I worked in a group at that time too and did almost nothing and people just told me to do more, no one ever called me out  since of course with my blank face no one could tell. No one was close to me to tell. My mother closer but she needs help and is in denial, told me I was lazy didn't need help, whatever, I didn't listen to that. So nobody told me I needed help, it's crazy, instead they just wanted to tell me to do more. So, once again, on my own will, I started online therapy. And we went down for anxiety, but I told her I thought I was depressed and she didn't buy it lol. Holy fuck. So I forced that down as long as I could until she started really not getting me, holy fuck. So then I ended that, and I was in a house with other people and one guy just messed with me instead of realizing that something was going on. So then I met with more online and they just messed with me, not taking it seriously, I mean it doesn't have to be. Saying that it happens to a lot, saying that my expectations were too high. Then I went home and had another, who we talked about the family dynamic, didn't seem to buy the seriousness of it, obviously I know probably she's not allowed to. She should have emphasized how important it was for me to leave. Holy fuck. So then I said I would stop and she said that decision makes sense. So I got through school again, passing but failing exams. And then I wasn't going to touch therapy again since I spent more than a couple hundred on that shit. Nobody cared, I could have just died. I flew out on a whim, came back couple days later. Made plans to leave in a couple days, cancelled last min. Nobody cared, since the only ppl at that time were parents and they didn't care. I did not have anyone stay with me throughout my college. A girl stayed to mess with me the whole time. A guy just judged me for it. No one tried to understand because maybe it was too hard to understand, maybe I was really really special. So then I kept fucking going. I went for another position where I had to be a leader and support for others, and I cannot do that. Since I did therapy for so long and no one said a single word, I wasn't going to do it again. But all that time I was so empty I had nothing. No one would have reached out, they just assumed I was being difficult on purpose since I'm intelligent and I have that ability to just hold those emotions away and still do shit, albeit very poorly. I did everything to help myself and they still didn't want to help. That is the cruelty of what happened. Since there was no one in my life when I need something there is no one to help and that's why not everyone is going to make it. You can literally do everything, and still not be seen. Maybe I wasn't being clear in the past so they couldn't see me for who I was. But I don't know how I could have put so much in, intellectually, but not have felt anything. To still not feel seen.

Thanks so much I feel for you. Never thought they were losers, they were pretty respectable, people tend to think they were good people, good people until you get too close. I never thought of them as bad people, but yeah they're usually people who think they're higher up on the food chain (big family, wealthy, all that shit) and get offended probs if we do the same shit as they do, or even better. Did more shit than them, they got it handed to them with a cherry on top. Fucking losers. I can't even drink, I'm Asian, body don't process alcohol. Holy fuck don't get me started on the therapy cuz I'm asian thing if it's cuz of that.......  Yeah nobody cared lol, it never would have mattered, it would only matter in the future. I thought of it as weak actually. I thought of it as I was too scared to own up so I just hid behind the excuse I was seeing a professional. Stupid girl, fucking privileged little buddy who never went through anything. I don't blame them, I'm just saying like I understand.

I seriously couldnt care less if i was still alive.   But my dogs would.    And so, I stay.
This is like my post but shorter. Mind you I’m not equating my family to dogs but I feel you. Two cents on something that would help. Find something to compete at, even if it’s yourself. Like try to smile for 10 seconds longer than the previous day. Time yourself.
[Failure is part of my problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzlkld/i_feel_defective_everysingleday/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 )  although i do have small self challenges already, ( i consider daily habits/hygiene challenging at times) they just dont make me any happier once i complete them lol
Oh don’t pick stuff you could fail at for early competition.   Example Given: I will pet my dog more than I did yesterday. This is something you can clearly win at based on the post.   It’s not about failing it’s about leaning into what matters. If it’s your dogs. It’s your dogs. For me, it’s my kid. I lean into making their day better than yesterday.
i understand you mindset and the concept as a whole, and I believe that I've done things for "the better" for a while now, but doing them doesnt make me any happier, doesnt take away the way i feel about living. I still get things done when they need to be ( or i try to anyway), but i just hate living.

I feel so alone, all the time. I don't feel as if I have friends, though I know there's plenty people there. When they don't talk to me or respond I feel like a boring failure that no one wants to talk to, and when they do talk I have no energy to keep up conversations, I just got into the habit of being alone that it's like I forget how to associate with other people.  My boyfriend is the only person I really talk to, and I find myself getting upset at things. He doesn't deserve it and I feel horrible. He's so understanding and supportive, but part of me is terrified he will wake up one day and not love me no more. That he will leave me.   I want to do good things in the world, I want to help others, help myself, I want to organize my life and turn everything into good things, but I feel myself constantly getting kicked in the face by life. I sit around wondering what's going to happen next? I just keep expecting bad things to happen.
I feel the same way, I have no energy to do anything anymore

Has anyone else ever experienced sudden onset depression that can come for seemingly no reason and disappear just as fast? I'm desperate to figure out what is causing this and how to mitigate it. I can be having a great week, and I'm normally a light-hearted cheery and silly person, but it can hit me like a train where I feel total despair, my entire thought process changes, inner monologue becomes dark, and I have a hard time remembering how being happy feels. It can pass in a day or two, or last a few days. The way it feels makes me think there's something going on with a nutrient or chemical, because I've confirmed that stress/sleep/outside factors aren't causing it.  I can't move on until I figure this out; it's consumed my life at this point
Please research Cyclothymia and see if it fits you. It took me awhile to discover what was wrong with me.
Yeah a lot of it applies to me but at the same time some of the core of it doesn't. It's also quite rare, and mostly affects females, so naturally I'd think its a low chance that would be it.  One of the conflicts is that I will get hit with the lows when I should be super happy. No outside stimuli are causing it. Which is what makes it feel so chemical
It probably is that actually. Its basically bipolar but less extreme. Its also a bit more random and episodes vary more in length compared to bipolar.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kyydke/all_i_wanna_do_is_sleep/
I just wanna sleep. When i'm sleeping I don't feel like a burden, i'm not anxious, I don't worry about everything and I don't think about how i've wasted my life and i'm a piece of shit who lets fear control my life.  I just wanna sleep. I don't wanna die. I just want to sleep and then hopefully wake up and feel better.
Then sleep man. I just slept for a month. Got through the holidays. No regrets.
I just want to go into a coma and then I can rest peacefully forever.
Me too. I was like that for years, broke out of it but happiness lasted a few months before everything went to shit again and now I regret ever breaking out of it because I'm now just even sadder.
Read my year of rest and relaxation by Ottessa Moshfegh. I slept my worries off for a while also. And right now I can’t sleep at all.
Same here. But when I slept it made the situation I am in really worst. I hope it works for you.
I used to feel like this but they put me on welbutrin. I’m never in bed anymore but there are days where my anxiety is off the charts. (Still transitioning)
I know how you feel. I don’t want to die, I want to sleep and wake up and feel better tomorrow. I’ve always thought I was alone but I’m glad someone else feels like this.
Man I feel the way. Anxiety and depression have been a one two punch combo striking with uppercuts and jabs right when I get up till the time I fall asleep.  The only difference is I just wish I would never wake up.  Blackness and emptiness is way better than having to get in the ring with anxiety and depression everyday.  Well that’s just my opinion
I use to just want to sleep and stay in bed, im not as depressed atm as i used to be then.  As someone else said, trying to work out whats making you depressed is a good idea , could be a range of things.
I feel you. I spend HOURS horizontally.
Same, I get up, take care of my animals and whatever chores I \*have\* to do, and go right back to bed because it's less anxiety.
I feel like sleeping all the time, too. I feel like if I’m left to sleep, I’d be out for a month! You have to find something to look forward to. Depression is an illness and it’s not something you can smile away. Talk to people. Try new things. Get obsessed about something like a dumb game, show, etc. Our brains are complex computers and if something is out of balance, you have to try with a little effort to get things right. It’s hard but good luck! Here’s a gold medal. See if r/lounge is interesting lol
Same bro, I relate hard. I love sleeping, or being curled up in my bed under the blankets with pillows in the dark on the phone. Only place I feel safe.   With regards to anxiety and fear, I saw a good video from the 60’s about a guy. Basically, he was having anxiety attacks because he was raised by narcissists and was afraid to express himself because people might get mad, not like him, call him disagreeable. He was really angry but held it in.   Have people in the past made you feel like you couldn’t express yourself or your thoughts? Since you seem to know that fear of the unknown causes a lot of anxiety, can you talk to a counselor about how to manage that?   Btw you’re not a burden and you haven’t wasted your life. You sound self aware and intelligent, which is more than most people can say.    Hope you can get some restful sleep.
Sounds like a poem, love it
Cut off your social media’s. Start off by making a list of 5 things you look at whether it’s people or things. Stop clicking on it when it pops up on your feed. That way you start rewiring your brain to only think about you. At the same time start thinking badass about yourself (positive) no matter hard shit gets. Get off social media it’s not healthy. Everyone in this world is struggling and their masking it with highlights that aren’t true. We then look at it and compare our lives to it, we think we aren’t doing shit when we could. Trust me you might not think it’s that but just take what I’m saying and consider it. Remember to make a quick list of the people or things you look at (up to 10 at least 5) start by not clicking on it/them when it pops up. Trust the process there will be ups and downs but it will be worth it.  All the stuff you see on the internet compared to your life is making you anxious without you knowing , then you can’t sleep.
Unfortunately, my little friend anxiety makes that impossible.  How did you sleep for a whole month?
Man When I was 18-19 I slept 6 months like that.. I was waking up to go outside for 1-2hours with friends ate maybe two times a day but the rest time I was sleeping. My friends called this “Time skip”
Yes. My mother. Now I think everyone will react to me like her. I'm suffering. I can't tell anyone how i feel. I'm just pretending i'm fine now. I'm hiding everything. I don't know what to do. I put on a happy face say i'm fine, sleep all day and then at night when everyone is asleep, I cry, I panic, I let it all out. I can't let anybody see that i'm not okay. I don't want my words twisted, my feelings invalidated or brushed off. I'm really suffering.
I lost my job. It was at a hospital. I worked my ass off all year. Only to get fired for some bullshit reason. It was right before thanksgiving. I was just done with trying for awhile.
As much as that all sucks, it’s great that you can articulate the problems you’re going through so well. Can you talk to a counselor? Not everyone will react the way your mother used to treat you when you share your thoughts.
That sounds tough. So you just didn't eat or anything? Just slept? Must have been a good break.
I mean yeah you eat. You got to figure out why you’re anxious. Some philosophers and physiologist say you’re anxious for a reason find the reason and it’ll go away.  Or at least understanding it will help make it bearable. And you can sleep however long you want but make sure you eat of course. 🛏
Yeah that's just the problem. Most of the time I have no damn idea what triggers my anxiety, therefore makes me more anxious, and then I spiral and then I end up depressed. I wish I knew the reason. If I did, then I could stop suffering.
I know it sounds a lot simpler than it is.

Hold up partner, you aren’t that dumb. You’re using a computer or phone to access the Internet, you can type and express your thoughts. Even if you do have a learning disability or brain damage as you say, it’s not your fault. You’re not genetically inferior.   It’s a sick society that tells you that you aren’t good enough. Also, failure is part of learning. If you aren’t failing constantly, you aren’t even trying. Be a bit nicer to yourself. What would advice would you give to a friend or family member who told you they felt similarly?

6 years relation fiancee left me a 7 months ago, I'm drowning myself in work, I have a day job, studies and two freelance works, I'm awake 5:30am - 11:30pm working 90% of the time with a very few off time. It feels like I won the lottery 6 years ago and I'm never gonna have that chance again, killing myself voluntarily thinking it will help. It's been 7 month, she told me she didn't have feelings anymore, I cannot get over her yet everyone thinks I'm doing amazing with how productive I am. Truth is sometimes I'm one inch away from doing bad things.     Did any of you people relate and how did you manage the situation ?
While my work schedule has never been that extreme, I have used work as my escape before. It’s a good release, but please don’t so overboard. You say you can’t get over her yet? I understand, but try this. Ask yourself what you get out of holding on. What’s your pay off from it? Then ask yourself if that’s worth the obvious pain your in.   But please dude get some rest.

I’ve been on Zoloft and Wellbutrin for about 2.5/3 years now. Just recently I tapered off and I was wondering if anyone else has had experience with higher levels of emotions after discontinuing meds. I was on antidepressants not because I was sad and suicidal, but because I felt down and low energy all the time. I struggled with motivation and always feeling sluggish. I had no interest im doing anything. Meds did help for a little bit after a while it seemed like they weren’t doing anything at all except decrease what little sex drive I did have. Now that i have a full time job and I’m a routine I’m feeling a lot better. I have a reason to get up and showered in the am. Now that Ive stopped my meds I find I’m having issues dealing with anger, little arguments with my husband turns into a big deal that before normally wouldn’t. I also find myself laughing more and at random stuff that I normally wouldn’t laugh at. I just thought I would ask here if anyone else has experienced anything similar, and if you have how did you deal with it? Eventually i plan on doing therapy but I’m just working on getting my insurance straightened out.
Something to remember is these meds WILL dull emotions even if that’s not really what you’re taking them for. Where you’ve been on them for awhile you probably just got use to it and now it will take time to readjust back. Completely normal to be a little more sensitive and nothing to worry about as long as it’s not intense rage or laughing uncontrollably and not able to stop.   Congratulations on the job and routine, it can be tough getting those in a order :)

Hello! I’m writing because I’m so frustrated and could really use some recommendations. I’ve tried two SSRIs, Lexapro and Zoloft, and they both helped immensely but gave me extreme fatigue. While on Lexapro, I added Wellbutrin. Again, this helped me so much and gave me the needed energy, but it also gave me extreme insomnia. I tried everything, including taking the Wellbutrin early in the morning and the Lexapro at night and trying both the extended release version and sustained release of the Wellbutrin. I took these medications for long time and my sleep problems never improved, so I know it’s not just my body acclimating to them, and that I have to try something different. Any advice on new medications I could try?
i am on a lexapro + wellbutrin combo as well and i don't have insomnia. unfortunately i can't help you beyond my only suggestion being to try new medications (a psychiatrist is best suited to make specific suggestions) and ditch the old ones but i wish you the best luck.

Hi,  Not feeling too well been depressed and not doing so well at all. I just feel like I'm too old going to university I currently have a diploma in computer programming which I spent 2 years in community college graduated with a 3.75 cGPA graduated when I was 21. Then I worked at an aerospace company for a year as an electrical assembler and decided to go back to university at 24 for a computer science degree. I just feel like I am too old in school and life just passed by and I never accomplished anything at all. I don't know what to do?  &#x200B;  Thanks
Hey man, I'm in my 30s going to college. I'm usually the oldest student in the room. Sometimes it's awkward, I won't lie, but most of the time no one cares or even notices. And when I graduate, it's going to be the same degree as everyone else's ... it's not going to say "look at this loser who went to college late." It's just going to be a degree. It'll be worth it. Good luck.

The demolition will never end and I'll never see the "happiness" that lies behind the wall. When will it stop? When will the torment stop, when will the realization of nothingness fade away? I'm alone oh so alone just kill me please. I'm begging you there is nothing worth it in this world. Its just rinse and repeat there is nothing good to work for. It's all just pain and misery, I will never achieve what my friends have. I will never achieve what my parents have accomplished and I'll never touch the idea that I can be just like my icons. I'm just dead to the world, no one missed me and no one will miss me. I'm as good as dead and this virus didn't do shit to me sadly. I'll always be living in the past cause at least the past isn't as bad as now. Looking down into the barrel, I know its painful and I'll join you soon enough just wait a little longer. I'll kill myself soon. I'm just en echo of my former self, I'm just living in a nightmare that I'll never wake up from. Dead end job, no education, no self value, and no one to look after me. I was always meant to be alone forever and I don't care anymore. I get too attached when someone gives me a form of human decency. Probably cause not many people care enough to talk to me. I am the last of myself cause making a family is damn near impossible where I am mentally. Suicide is the right choice like I said before. My stance will never change on that, because once life will turn around I'll probably be dead by then. Just a little longer and I can be set free. I've been abandoned by everyone including God! No one was ever by my side and that is for the better. Become when I'm dead there will be no mourning,  only celebrating because I'll be eradicated from this world once and for all. Just a little longer and I'll be set free...
Hey so - firstly I'm glad you are reaching out for help.  Have you ever just told your parents / friends  how you feel right now? You said that you feel abandoned - but why?  When it comes to family and friends - it's almost impossible for them to understand what you are going through - unless you tell them yourself. I think it might be time to open up and tell them.  You are being so harsh on yourself - when you truly do not need to be. You said that you'll never achieve what your friend and parents have - what's causing you to compare your life with there's? What you have achieved so far - they might look at and be jealous of too?

Lack of better title.  So apparently I have depression, but when I felt similarly over the summer and told a therapist, she said it's cuz I didn't have that many obligations that's why I wasn't feeling motivated as compared to other times. So this really fishy, if these people are really just messing with me, then I start to see that a lot of people are really 'not' there for me and I wasn't just thinking negatively. So if I see it correct, almost everyone not there for me (include mom,dad,sister) and that guy I met, and my supervisor, basically everyone. If I don't think it negatively, and base it on specifically what 'bad' have they done to me.. then.. idk they didn't do anything 'bad', they were just I guess.. ***disrespectful***. A girl always saying my name, greeting me enthusiastically just for fun-- it's called leading me on, not being friendly. A guy kind of criticizing me but then being nice too, that's called disrespectful. A therapist telling me I can get over it in couple months when it's something I had for a while-- disrespectful too? I don't know, but it seems like there is no one left otherwise I keep feeling like I'm being slighted, all the time.
Hey! So I think it's worth you taking a step back - especially on the feeling disrespectful part?  The girl who says your name - she sounds like she is being friendly?  Whe. You're in a depressed state - you can certainly latch onto certain feelings in. We rid ways. I think - rather than focusing on these other people right now - I'd focus more on yourself - your therapist has kind of hinted towards it?  The thing that I'm afraid with you is that your going to become bitter and push everyone away even more right? Instead I want you to focus on yourself - on who you are a lot more then these people...
No, it's more like I needed attention, and would take it from anyone who showed it.   I'm not focused on other people, in fact I can't focus on myself. I feel like my therapist was using me or something, even several so that makes me worried.   I don't have a therapist right now since I do have to pay for it right.  I'm already bitter lol. If you told me focus on myself I'd quit everything then. It didn't matter when I tried, so then nobody is going to come and help me and of course woe is me but what more could you ask.
You know it's a little beyond my control, I did everything I could. I needed to leave a toxic environment so I made plans to do that so I did. I took a job when I was mentally just dead. I knew I needed help so I got a professional, who didn't help much so I got another who also didn't. So now I need to get another. But you know if I can't see myself doing a job how will I pay before things run out.
Why would you quit eveything jsut out of curiosity?
That's brilliant right? So you have made some genuine pwotive steps to move forward.. Maybe you just need a bit more time ebcauwe you wee the effects of these changes?
I guess not really. That's what happens when there's no support, people who see me for who I am and what I'm doing, so it feels like there's no encouragement then what am I doing it for. I feel like I didn't see the meaning other than to get by in a society that I felt rejected me.

I am the lowest I have ever been today. Something snapped inside me today. I'm so devastated and full of despair. But also numb at the same time. I'm angry and tired. I want to cry but can't. I've lost hope. My depression has won.
hey hope your holding on well 💜

I have a concern, slight suspicion that I bother people sometimes. That I react to their social media stories too frequently and overwhelm them,or that just being around me in person can be too much. I feel socially crippled sometimes. I can't tell if I'm picking up on something accurate or if my mind is playing tricks on me. My mind keeps telling me to leave people alone. How do I resist the urge to interact with people and just leave them alone?

When it comes to suicide who can be regarded as the selfish one? Is it the person who commits suicide and leaves the people behind to deal with the pain of their death? Or are the people who want someone to live with the pain they have the selfish ones?
No one. That's where the thought should end. Seriously, who benefits from these stupid self-righteous thoughts of good or bad. Selfish or not the person wants to kill themselves you really think blaming it on someone would even make a difference.

Recently I’ve been through a lot. I’m not going to get into specifics as I don’t want any of you to feel bad for me. I know there’s plenty of people that have lives harder than mine. But it still affects me in a way I’m sure all of you can relate to. Anyways, I’m trying a new form of expression (for me) and I wrote a poem. I’m not sure what else to say as I’m not sure if anyone will even read this post, but the poem is included below. At the very least I hope this shows someone they’re not the only person going through this situation.    Failed attempts at love, happen more often than not. Sometimes it isn’t meant to be, no matter what you got.  Like flicking an empty lighter, or getting in a taxi with no driver, nothing seems to work out, but you hope the future is brighter.  Failed attempts at love,  happen more often than not.  When they don’t want your heart, even though you saved them a spot. You think, “Better luck next time”, and you give it another shot.    If you read this thank you

I feel like it’s my fault that I’m not doing well. Actually I know it’s my fault. I harmed myself again today. I haven’t had an appointment with my psychiatrist since november because I have no motivation to set one up after he cancelled the last one. I finally called and set an appointment for next Monday but I don’t even know what to tell him. I haven’t been taking my meds because I have no motivation to call in a refill at the pharmacy and obviously I haven’t been doing well. A couple months ago I stopped eating and lost around 10 pounds. I started eating little by little but I haven’t gained the weight back and I’m starting to see myself go back to the same habits. It’s at the point where I have to be wearing sweaters all the time because I can’t keep my own body heat. I know this is all my fault all of it is. I have the resources to be okay but I’m not. I don’t even know what to tell him. It’s my fault I haven’t been taking my medication and it’s my fault I’ve been sleeping all day or staring at the ceiling doing nothing. I know he’ll tell me that but I already know it. I don’t even know if this medication is working for me because I haven’t been taking it long enough but I gotta take it again. Why am I hurting myself like this I’m trying so hard to be okay but I’m not. And now I feel like I’m overwhelming my boyfriend because I’m crying every night and when I’m not crying I feel nothing. He deserves better than this. He deserves someone who can listen to his problems and help him. I wish I could be that person I really really wish I could but I’m weak. I’m so weak physically and mentally and I’m sorry. I’m wasting good resources that someone who has the resilience to get better could be using. There’s no point I’m sorry I’m like this I really wish I wasn’t I’m so so sorry. I’m so sorry I wish I wasn’t like this I really do

Its strange, isnt it? Something so nasty, yet it taught me to write my honest thoughts and be myself, since no one would understand me, I did. I am 80% sure that most of us can write a heartbreaking novel in our heads in just mere minutes. Putting it into words is nothing at all.
True, although having the confidence to keep going is hard. Sometimes I love what I write but as soon as I stop writing for a second I feel that everything I write is totally worthless and then I can't keep going.

Disappear completely. As if you never existed in the first place. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? Save inflicting the pain on others.  Life is too short to devote to any amount of learning, ambition or meaning. Might as well get it over with

im so tired. i feel so weak. ive only been dealing with this for like 6 months and there are people out there who have been depressed for years and stuff and they are still alive and i dont know i feel so weak compared to them. i have classmates who have almost killed themselves and they are still coping with school and i dont even know why im still alive and i feel like im failing everything in school. its so hard especially with online school. f covid. f everything and everyone.   i hate school so much.   i want to hurt myself so bad.   idk anymore idk i didnt get enough sleep last night and its a monday morning  all my friends dont care anymore they all ghost me or just think everything i say is a joke. im just so annoying.
You shouldn't compare yourself in that particular case to others. You are yourself first and foremost. You are not weak. Dealing with a situation as you describe for six months is hard for everyone in a way. In the state of yours it is kinda "normal" not to function in school and be in a state of f everything. Just dont blame yourself for that attitude.  Please stay safe and strong.
thanks :)
You are much welcome :)

As much as I hated going to school in person, I miss it because I could socialize and see friends. Now I'm stuck at home, logging into my classes; wondering if I really even learned anything this semester. Online school basically made my depression 10x times worst. Has it been the same for you, if so, do you have any tips?
Yeah definitely feel this. Sometimes it helps to turn my camera on... sometimes that just makes it worse lol, but sometimes it can help to actually see and respond to people like a real human being, and hold real conversations with them. Maybe try it?

I wish my depression was as beautiful as the song lyrics I relate to. As poetic as the words typed out on YouTube comments. The lines and curves building haunting pictures instead of scars on my arms.  I wish my depression was poetic enough that it would live longer than me. At least then a part of me would survive when the darkness consumes more than just my soul. I’m not a beautiful tragedy; I wish it was a tantalizing fad I could strip off.  I’m tears that wreck my body while my scarred arms cling onto the counter as another panic attack takes me back to a time I yearn to forget. I’m fat tears that meld into a line of snot which drips into my clothes that I haven’t changed in days. My hair isn’t a fun emo cut but an entangled mess a brush couldn’t fix. There’s no edgy makeup, there’s no energy to even open the kit.  I wish my depression was a beautiful mess. I wish it was something I used to seem mysterious and edgy to lure others in some like some Venus flytrap. “Oh no you don’t want me, I have depression and you don’t want to try and save me.” You say with such meticulously done dark makeup that tells others you spent at least an hour in front of the mirror with a practiced hand.   No, really, you don’t want to come near me because my mind has taught me that I’m too toxic to be near anyone except for the monsters that reside in my head. I tell you with bloodshot eyes filled with fear that yet another person is going to kill the last piece of strength in me.  And as I lay here in bed wishing for sleep I realize how bad my depression really is. When you yearn for the monsters that your paranoia creates to kill you, you know your depression has won.
they mean seem cool and all  but the truth is the people who write on the YouTube comments often aren't actually depressed and are seeking attention and they glorify  a lie.  they are all part of the problem treating suicide like its so cute and quirky and not the shit it actually  is
This was beautiful to read... The way you create an image so vividly many of us can relate to in different and/or similar ways.  It's all so exhausting, this fight or tug of war with the monsters in our heads... I hope you can make it through.  Thanks for sharing this, and please feel free to share more like it if you feel the need/want to.

Okay so I'm 15F and trying to decide if I should try and get some therapy. I've been struggling for as long as I can remember (I think I have some sort of chronic depression).  My mom doesn't believe someone my age and especially in my situation could have mental health issues. She constantly belittles me for having any other feeling other than positivity. I've tried directly asking for help and was turned down. Whatever is wrong is getting worse with time, I can't do much of anything anymore. Should I keep trying to get help?
Keep going with looking for help. You’re certainly not gonna get it from your mom, who sounds like she has no sympathy and is a complete asshole. So definitely continue to look for help, I’m rooting for you!
I'm a 23 year old woman but I understand what you're going through. I, too, have struggled with depression since childhood. Probably since I was 12 or even younger. I struggled with depression during high school and didn't seek any help. It got even worse during university and I feel like I'm more depressed every year. Whenever I talked about feeling sad, my mom would get angry and me and call me selfish. She thinks that because I have all the material comforts in life I'm not allowed to complain or be sad. She thinks I just choose to be sad and it's a switch I can just turn on and off.   Please reach out to any other adults in your life who can help you. Like an older sibling or even a school counsellor if you're comfortable.
I'll try!
Good luck! You got this🙌

I've been hit with the words "You're too young to worry about this" and "You're still a child, when I was your age I wouldn't be able to handle it" so many times, it both pisses me off and saddens me at the same time. Does everyone view me as a child? Maybe i'm younger than most, but mentally i'm just as strong as any adult would be. You don't have to refrain from venting to me because your shit might be "too heavy" for me. Telling me that you think i'm too weak to handle something hurts worse than if you had told be what was going on. I'm not young and stupid. I want to fucking help you, so you keeping things to yourself because i'm a "child" hurts like shit. I know you have good intentions when you say this, but can you just stop to think for a moment? If you took a moment to be inside my head, swirling with thoughts of ending myself or leaving everybody, would you still view me as a child? I've been alive for that many years, but i'm a lot more mature than I should be. Cant you see that i'm not that dumb? I can handle whatever you're going through, maybe I've even been through it myself. I just hate it when you refer to me as a child when you know damn well that's basically discrimination. It hurts.
not my proudest fap.

so im in an communications class in my college.... and im reading a little bit, and this really hurts me....   The people on here, they tell me i deserve to be alone forever.... they say "were alone all the time!" but im reading this research and its disheartening, ive been alone... for my whole life... i have no freinds, no family, and people LAUGH about it.   heres some quotes from my book for class, " We all know intuitively that communication—the company of others—is one of the most basic human needs, and that lack of contact is among the cruelest punishments a person can suffer. In fact, workplace studies show that employees would rather get negative attention from bosses and coworkers than receive no attention at all. It hurts to be picked on, but it’s worse to be ostracized. "  they wonder why id pay girls to just talk to me, because im fucking alone.... fuckers.   They dont know what lonely fucking is man...   " Besides being emotionally painful, being deprived of companionship is so serious that it can affect life itself. Frederick II, emperor of Germany in the 13th century, may have been the first person to prove the point systematically. A medieval historian described one of his significant, if inhumane, experiments:  *He bade foster mothers and nurses to suckle the children, to bathe and wash them, but in no way to prattle with them, for he wanted to learn whether they would speak the Hebrew language, which was the oldest, or Greek, or Latin, or Arabic, or perhaps the language of their parents, of whom they had been born. But he labored in vain because all the children died. For they could not live without the petting and joyful faces and loving words of their foster mothers."*   WOW..... loneliness kills, it fucking kills.... and these people cheer and laugh and encourage... me to be alone forever, say i deserve it, for being a virgin, for being awkward... as they giggle and laugh with their friends and have hook up sex with chads!    "Fortunately, contemporary researchers have found less barbaric ways to illustrate the importance of communication. In one study of isolation, subjects were paid to remain alone in a locked room. Of the five subjects, one lasted for eight days. Three held out for two days, one commenting, “Never again.” The fifth subject lasted only two hours.  The need for contact and companionship is just as strong outside the laboratory, as individuals who have led solitary lives by choice or necessity have discovered. W. Carl Jackson, an adventurer who sailed across the Atlantic Ocean alone in fifty-one days, summarized the feelings common to most loners:  *I found the loneliness of the second month almost excruciating. I always thought of myself as self-sufficient, but I found life without people had no meaning. I had a definite need for somebody to talk to, someone real, alive, and breathing."*   haha, 8 days? thats rookie numbers... TRY YOUR WHOLE FUCKING LIFE. AND YOU FUCKING CLAIM, "its cause your bitter!" YEAh YOU MADE ME BITTER.   YOU MADE ME ALONE.  "ew why is he so weird????" maybe because i never have human fucking contact???? "well thats your fault tee hee, CHAD!!!! over hereeee handsome!!!!!!! Get this subhuman out of my sight, be as painful to him as possible please! thank you!"   I swear its just funny, most people really dont know what loneliness actually is.

I don’t know if anyone else has experienced this but I feel like when I approach talk therapy/ counseling for my depression I have no clue what to say anymore other than “I’m depressed and it’s not getting better”. I feel like I’m saying it over and over and over again. I feel like they’re trying to pry for a situational factor in my life to explain it or to talk it out and there’s just nothing to talk about that I don’t already understand is situational and temporary. Once the issue has blown over, I’m still depressed, it hasn’t changed anything. Recently, I’ve been told to go back to counseling again after consistently going for about a year and then covid hit so I stopped and I just feel like “I’m depressed” is all I have to say and I just don’t feel like it’s productive anymore to talk a point out that’s been beaten like a dead horse.  (I am also on medications as I have been for a few years now and I would say I’m in that grey area of not a risk of harm to myself but not necessarily “happy” but stable enough)  (I also understand the redundancy of this post in general, if talk therapy doesn’t do the job, why am I making a post and reaching out to other people. I was just wondering if anyone else is stuck in this weird rut or has been in the past and what might have worked for them)
i find talk therapy uncomfortable cuz you HAVE to figure something out or sort some shit that made you depressed and stuff bla bla and well posting on reddit is just like talking to a virtual friend, no obligation in having progress or figuring out why etc  or even making sense, just random talk about experience or anything

No matter how many people are around me I feel lonely. I spent entire days talking to people online, the moment I go off I notice how unfullfilling that time was playing meaningless games and having meaningless talks with each other. Whenever I go to bed I notice how incredibly lonely I am, just wishing for someone I can cuddle with, where I can just cry my eyes out and just mindlessly complain about everything that is going wrong. Not worrying about being missinterpreted or judged. And without any regret afterward. But no, every day just passes by where I spend mindless time with people "enjoying myself" but still feeling incredibly empty inside.  Its been like this since my girlfriend left me last year and for more then 400 days now its not getting better. I already have a Psychologist, but aside from having 45min a week were I have at least one place I can actually take my problems to, he cant help much, even though he does his best. Im trying to get to know as much new people as I can to maybe find that one person where it finally clicks. Its not a solution, but I dont want to just sit here and complain about everything but not doing anything about it.  Its 4am for me now. I cant sleep because of intrusive thoughts. Thats why im writing this. Venting can help me to at least find a bit of sleep.
I kinda know how you feel. I would give anything to be able to just have someone with who I could just cry my eyes out to, a single friend would be fine. Its sad but I have gotten use to going days with barley speaking a single word and just crying by myself at night. I hope you are able to find someone who clicks with you soon, I can't imagine how nice that would feel :)

My relationship has seemingly vanished, it doesn't feel like anything is there anymore and he has more fun without me around, nor talks to me anymore..  I have no work, which means I have no money. And that issue speaks for itself..  I still can't get into therapy..  My meds don't seem to be working still and I've been on them 3 months now..  I'm sat here on my own 24/7 and I'm barely managing to talk to my friends..  I uploaded my first video onto YouTube, but that's just 3 minutes of me kicking around a ball in Destiny 2 so I might just take it down..  I have no interest in things I once loved; drawing, playing games, playing piano, keeping fit (although that went downhill years ago), going for long walks, cleaning, keeping my mind occupied in general, even music..  I sit in silence more often than not, and I go stir crazy staring at the same 4 walls, and I can't go for a walk because it's too cold out. I can't see my friends either because of Covid..  I'm really starting to see no point at all in living and the pill cabinet is looking very inviting..
I'm with you, I also don't have a job because I'm too jittery and afraid to take it - depression doesn't help either. Have you told someone how you feel? You see, I would like to go to therapy too, but I have the same problem as you, lack of money and fear too. Good that you have friends, sometimes it's really worth talking to them, I only have one friend, but I like to talk to her sometimes. I know it's damn hard, but it's important that you take small steps, force yourself to do something every day, but it's important not to do everything at once - then you'll easily get discouraged. You write that you have things that interest you, remember why you started drawing or playing and keep doing it. I believe in you!
Get in touch with those friends. Call them online anything really

Can someone with stable mental health or anyone who has an idea actually tell me what it's like?? Because i can't even imagine it. Lol do u just wake up roam around and just not feel a little off? Just feel heavier? Do you cross the street without thinking what if? Do you just get up and productively do things? Can you imagine the future? What fills your head besides casual thoughts of suicide?
Routine.  Routine is how I work.  My day starts at the same time everyday.  I eat my breakfast cereal at almost the same time every day.  I listen to the same radio station.  I go to the same job I have done every day for the last 15+ years.  For some, routine is boring.  For me, routine is my life, and keeps my head level.  It gives me focus.  When I wake up, I try to think of at least one thing to look forward to during that day.  It only needs to be something small.  Today, it was one of my work colleagues offering to bring me a McCafe latte on their way into work.  My mental health is as good as I could ever expect it to be.  I have good days and I have bad days.  Some nights I cannot sleep a wink, other nights I crash and burn by 7pm.

Long story short, I'm a mess of anxiety and depression. I'll have periods where I do good but they never last long. I've lost so many jobs because I can't work. I've tried. Around people, my anxiety gets so bad I start violently shaking and looking for ways out. My depression is so bad I've been inches away from ending it all so many times. And I'm in an Oxford house with 10 other guys now. I'd love to leave but I have nowhere to go and no money. All I have is a car and basic necessities. I have therapy Tuesday and I'm going to see if they can help me. I just don't know what to do and I feel so miserable.
I hope you get help at therapy and feel better soon.

I started getting in trouble with the law at a very young age, in fact I was 14 the first time I was arrested for an armed robbery that me and a friend did.  I spent the later of my teenage years in a state home for boys because of it and really the only thing that taught me was that I’m not scared of being locked up as long as I know I’m going home eventually... now that exact thought has ruined my life.  After I was released from the boys home just a few months before I turned 18, I had every intention of changing my life for the better, the only problem was that I didn’t know how, and it wasn’t long before I was selling weed/dope and even though I was against doing meth, I still sold it like it was going out of style and I was everyone’s drug dealer...I mean everyone loved me, I had money, I had my own place, I had a truck and a motorcycle, I felt like I was on top of the world.... but what goes up, must come down. Before I knew it, I was 18 and in prison. Doing time sucked, but I got through it with the help of my mom and dad, they’ve always been there for me, always came to visit me as much as they could, always sent me money whenever they could and they always picked up the phone when I called. My mom and dad mean everything to me. So I did a 2 years and got out on parole,  I came home to my parents house and i started over again, with every intention of doing the right thing, which I actually managed to do for a few years, i was in school, I had 2 kids with a girl I loved and I could tell that my parents were finally proud of me and finally again, I felt on top of the world.  Then everything changed November 8th 2016 I came home around 11pm after a night of gaming with a friend, I walked past my parents room and out of the corner of my eye I saw him. My dad was laying on his side with his head on his arm and the moment I looked at him, I knew he was dead. I’ll never forget what he looked like, or the panic that overwhelmed me as I tried to give him cpr even though I knew it was far to late, he was ice cold, his face was slumped to the side and he was stiff.  One thing I wouldn’t wish upon my worst enemy is for them to have to find their father in that way. Gone are the good memories I had with him, gone is me seeing him in any way other then the last way I saw him. Everyday I see his face when I close my eyes and it never gets easier, only slightly more bearable.  But that day I didn’t just lose my dad, I lost my mom too. My mom fell into a huge depression, she quit her job, she started to drink and eventually that’s all she was doing, waking up and drinking herself back to sleep. I didn’t know what to do, I just wanted to help her but I didn’t know how. She didn’t want help she just wanted to die too.  I was so fucked up about finding my dad like that, I knew I should talk to someone about it, see a therapist or something but I was so depressed all I wanted to do was bury the feelings with drugs. So I did.  Fast forward 2 years later, I’m addicted to meth, I’m homeless, I don’t see my kids and none of my family talks to me anymore. All I did was sell dope, get high and hit licks..and it wasn’t long before I ruined every relationship and was back in prison. Did another 2 years... Now I’m 29 years old, With 4 felonies and I have never felt more lost in my life.  I’ve only been out of prison for 3 weeks and I’m already using again, I know if I go back down this road that it’s only going to lead one way, but I don’t know any other way but this one. I want to do right but I feel like I just don’t know how. I keep getting told no for every job I apply for Because I have no work history and my criminal record is terrible. I’m so tired of being a disappointment and a loser, but I don’t know how to not be this way. I know what everyone says sounds easy to someone who’s looking at my situation from the outside. “Well why don’t you get a job” or “ask someone for help”  That’s the thing, I have applied for jobs, but I’ve ran my name into the dirt around this small city I live in and everyone knows me as a drug dealer or a thief so no one will give me a chance and with each no I get from a job application is just another reminder of how I’m just a failure.  I just don’t know what to do anymore and I’m tired of being alone, I’m tired of feeling this way, I just want to be happy....  I wish that I could catch a break, but sadly I won’t.  Thanks for listening to me, I have a lot on my mind and I just needed to tell someone without the embarrassment of sitting in front of someone crying my eyes out while I try to explain to them how I’m feeling.
It's so fucking difficult dude, I have a pretty lengthy record as well including attempted robbery (felony). Finding work is almost impossible right now and I even have some work history. I think right now the best bet might be trades, starting off as an apprentice or a helper for a small company, because I know big corporations dont like to hire people like us.
Try get education , read , be active
Not your fault. I take it you live in America, home to 20% of the entire world’s prison population (and only 2% of the global population). The war on drugs is a license for the FED to destroy people’s lives for money: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States  There is no justice, only profit. I’m so sorry to hear you got caught up in this as well, please know your not alone, this happens to MILLIONS every year.  If I were you, I’d move someplace new, fresh start. Get away from the bad influences, you know? Sorry if there’s nowhere to go :( i would hope that’s still better than prison, lol? This is a list of employers who take felons: https://www.dioceseofjoliet.org/siteimages/peace/documents/Jail_and_Prison_Ministry/List_of_Felon_Friendly_Employers.pdf If they gave you anything for prescriptions, housing, whatever, cash that shit in.  I wish I had better advice, man, sorry. The justice system is fucked, but people have beaten it. Hell I think Tupac was in jail when he wrote picture me rollin’. Best of luck man.
It’s never to late to turn your life around. You’ve fucked up alot but take it not as failing but as a life lesson. Sorry , tbh i probably don’t understand stand your pain/suffering. I don’t know what kind of person you are from your message but from what i can tell your a “good guy”. Life sucks, it really does. BUT , there are beautiful moments in life i can assure u they are worth every moment it can be a pretty sunset or your kids, being able to tell them you love them is a fucking beautiful moment. You can either wait for these moments or you can go and get them urself. My advice for getting a job is show them ur worth, i don’t know if your a man of pride but what i mean by showing ur worth is begging getting on ur knees n shit. You might be asking , why? Well , like you said you’ve made a name for urself. You got labeled a thief, but what you can do is prove them wrong show them you as a “thief” is capable of chancing show them you aren’t such a bad guy.( try community service) You gotta step-out of ur comfort zone, it’s not easy but when you do you won’t regret it.  Don’t go down the wrong road, you know already I don’t need to tell you. You prove urself already that you were capable of changing i bet you can do it again. Might not be easy as last-time but I’m pretty sure u didn’t regret changing. Show your dad/mom that you’ve grown-up u don’t need them to push through these tuff times. I’m sure deep-down they are proud of you.  Stay safe my guy.  I hope my words can reach you, i’m sorry if they didn’t.

I have no idea how to move on or forgive myself because I hurt the one person in this world I cared about so badly that she doesn’t even want to talk to me anymore. It’s been over a month since she ended things and I can still hear her cries and see her tears and it’s killing me.  The story is, I was engaged to the love of my life but she was very conservative and religious and was saving herself for marriage. I’ve had sex with a number of woman in my 20’s and it wasn’t until after a year of dating that I told her I had sex before and it floored her. We were road tripping to meet her friends and she was completely withdrawn the whole day after I told her. When we drove back, she started asking questions about details and I panicked and thought she would leave me if I told the truth so lied about how long ago all this happened (5 years compared to 1 year before dating). I know this was wrong and selfish but I just panicked. Fast forward to early December, we were engaged for 2 months and the lie always weighed on me so I told her the truth that I wasn’t honest about the timeline and she ended things. I tried to ask her for a second chance or to try couples counseling but she said she just couldn’t do it. Now I just feel like crap because everything outside of this perfect and I just can’t believe I was capable of making this mistake and causing her the most pain of her life. I’m not sure how to move on because I still hear her crying in my mind and I then feel selfish because I just want her so desperately to have tried to save things when she is in her own rights to do what is best for her.
You were just panicked. Your lie wasn’t evil. Please don’t be so hard on yourself. I hope she will forgive you and accept you as you are. Good luck.
Thanks for the kind words. It’s been 1.5 months and she hasn’t changed her mind so I’m losing hope.
Do you still keep in touch with her? Please remember, it’s not your fault, nor hers
The last time I talked to her was 2 weeks after she ended things and that was to get my ring back. I tried reaching out a few times afterwards to see if she would talk or explain why a second chance wasn’t possible but I never got a response.
I see... it seems she’s made her mind that she will not be with you. How about you set a limit for example wait for her response for one more month, and if she doesn’t, you move on? I know you feel guilty and you regret that you lied to her. But you were panicked. People make mistakes. She should know that too. She will forgive you eventually and I think you are strong enough to move on, and you will not make the same mistake again
The joke is she said she does forgive me but I guess she just can’t be with me
It must be very tough for you to accept. I’m so sorry
It seems impossible to accept. Thank you for listening and the kind words.
Hey, you can accept it eventually. Time heals. Don’t you worry. Don’t wear a long face, it’s never in style! Chin up, ok? You will be fine.
Thanks =)

It's been like this for a while, I don't exactly know why. Any emotion really, if I'm bored, happy, upset just a little bit more than numb it feels like I physically cannot handle it and I break down sobbing. It's not even like I am overwhelmingly happy, just slightly more than feeling empty is too much for me.  Am I the only one who feels like this?
I feel like this too. It take very long for me though.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzltdc/quick_vent/
I love coming to this reddit, to vent, to feel accepted and not judged for who I am and for what my thoughts are, just wanted to talk about my day.  I woke up, I played video games, I ended up watching some Netflix, nothing out of the ordinary here and that was basically all my day, I don't talk to nobody, so... I winded down and just wanted to talk about some stuff that's really got to me as of late, I was about a day ago or two back in contact with a friend who I was on bad terms with in the past, we talked again, for a bit, I was the one to try to talk a lot as I really am craving conversations with people I stick with, and keep in mind this person knew very personal things about me as we were very close, after talking and getting into an argument I remember this person specifically telling me things such as "I wish I never met you" "you're just a manipulative lying shit" and the list goes on, I... Was literally speechless I didn't know what to day, because I mean technically they weren't wrong?  We continued arguing and it later led to an obvious block... But it just made me realize how lonely I really am, I can't even talk to an old friend as they will bring me down or I start arguing, or I'm awkward, or they don't wanna take time to talk to me...  Back on track I just... Felt so extremely lonely today again, especially in the evening, I cried a bit too... But that too is nothing out of the ordinary... Anyways, I just wanted to vent, it's nothing too serious I'd say? And if you actually took the time to read this long post, we'll thank you so much for reading, I'm not the greatest at formulating myself so excuse me in advance. Stay safe.
I can really heavily relate to your post. I am extremely lonely and don't think I will ever make friends due to my anxiety and how awkward I am. I spent 99% of my day alone and occasionally have some brief meaningless conversations with some acquaintances, no one who actually wants to be my friend. At this point I have mostly given up on ever having a friend to talk to. I know how you fell so I hope you have a good day and feel a little less lonely tomorrow :)

I don't want to live anymore, I have never felt a deeper desire to just blow my brains out then at this very moment and its fucking tempting. What's the point in living another fucking day when its the same pain filled torture day after fucking day.  All I can think about all day is how much I hate myself. I hate how I look, I hate my face, my hair, my eyes, how thin I am, how weak I am, how ugly I am. I hate how I think, I hate how I can't ever fucking smile or be happy, I hate how much of a pathetic shy piece of shit I am who is too nervous and unable to make a friend let alone talk in a fucking conversation. I hate how I good at absolutely fucking nothing, I have never been good at a single thing in my entire life and it makes me feel so worthless that I wanna jump out my window right now. I get angry whenever I see someone who is skilled at something, not an anger towards them but a deep fucking self hatred for what a worthless piece of shit I am. I know that they put in a lot of work and deserve to be good at what they are doing, but I also know that I am incapable of that. I am incapable of doing anything noteworthy or anything that makes me more than a waste of space. I hate how I have no motivation to do anything anymore, no motivation to work out, no motivation to eat, no motivation to do things I used to like doing such as playing video games or watching a show.  I keep this all bottled up inside and I can't take it, I have no a single person in my life who would care if I died. hell it would be better if I was fucking dead because then I wouldn't be wasting fucking food or producing waste, someone less pathetic than me deserves it more. Whenever I see friends I hate myself even more and I ask myself, "Why can't I have a single friend?" or "Why can't there be a single person who wants to be around me?" Then I realize the answerer, why would anyone want to be friends with a boring, anxious, depressed, shy, fucking stupid, uninteresting, horrible piece of shit like me. I have given up on anyone on this planet ever giving a shit if I live or die by tomorrow but that doesn't make it hurt any less to know I will alone and no one will even notice I am gone.  I am sick of hearing the same old "it gets better" line over and over being its a fucking lie. It does not get better, it gets more painful every fucking day as that's another day wasted, another week I will never get back, another month spent 100% alone, and before you know it its been another year of suffering and pain. I am sick of that lie, I am sick of being told to keep on suffering all alone at the fucking chance that tomorrow will be slightly better. I no longer see a point in trying, a point in spending another day in pain.  I doubt anyone will read this, I doubt anyone will even give a shit. I hope this is my last post on this reddit, I hope I get the courage to just off myself before I have the chance to have another mental breakdown and type out stupid shit like this again.
i hear you. i am sorry thst you are at such a low point in your life mentally. for today please have some rest.   as hard as it is , i suggest looking into medication and treatment. because if its hard to have any motivation (which i relate) why beat ourselves up for it. a therapist would surely offer a solution that will help with time. I , for example right now am looking into nootropics for brain function and mood regulation as I am still afraid to go to the therapist. but hey, if there is a chance that something can help you why not take it

Does anyone else find it extremely hard to take care of themselves for months on end? I tend to neglect my personal hygiene (brushing my teeth, showering, cleaning, etc) and it’s been this way for months. As I’ve been working and doing school from home it’s become less and less important and it’s really upsetting me how little I care for myself, looking back. But I’m sure the cycle will continue tomorrow and the next day.  Also, I’ve always had a tendency to ruin good friendships and relationships for no reason. I put so much strain on them and do careless things until that person is no longer in my life. It seems at every new milestone in my life, quitting dance, graduating, etc. I destroy the relationships and it fills me with so much guilt because of the things I do or say. After many years of not talking to my group of friends from high school, I still think about them every day. I still think about an apology that just won’t do justice. It hurts a lot.

I’m sick and tired of everyday worrying and not even doing shit about it. Stuck In some terrible cycle since 16. Always trying to do the best I can, setting overly high bars in life.   This mindset needs to change. Honestly I am my worst enemy.   This lockdown and this year has been the toughest so far.   But you know what... I’m still here.   I need to learn to love and accept myself.   F*** depression.

because hearing criticism makes all of my effort feel worthless.  because talking to people is too hard.  because I have always been "the wierd kid".  because people that bullied me follow me around in my head and I apply them to anything negative that happens to me.  because I see only success in everyone else when all I have is "wasting time".  because I have done to little with my life for too long.  because I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.  because every single task I try to put time into, I feel like I'm doing it wrong and everyone else is doing it right.  because I have no one to share with.  because I am overwhelmed by the problems I have to deal with.  because I'm an alien from another planet.  because I'm a nobody.  because everything I've tried to fit in and "learn right" have failed.  I'm an idiot. I shouldn't be alive. I really wish sometimes that my brother was still alive and I killed myself instead. It should have been me, not him.
Damn, thought I wrote this even that last line hit me too.

I'm 19 and have never been in a relationship. Live with my parents, never had a job, don't have a license. I'm not lazy and badly want a job to get out of the house and meet someone but I have insane social anxiety that makes me panic just thinking about it. I just want someone to talk to, someone who loves me the same I do them. It's not a sex thing I couldn't care less about that part of it. I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. I'm not good at anything and I can't afford college. I use to see my future ahead of me and was excited but each year that passes I seem to see my future fade away out of my reach. I could try antidepressants but I'm already overweight with a low self esteem and those won't help. Everything just seems hopeless.
My therapist told me somethings that really helped with my social anxiety and agoraphobia:  First, social anxiety is a trait from we have evolved into have because back in the day it was very important that our “tribe” accepted us, so we could work and live together without being exiled. Nowadays you no longer need the people around you to like or even know anything about you, and you can still live a happy life. However this trait is still wired into us, but is totally pointless.  Secondly, every time something seems hard to do, like stepping out the front door of your house, and you don’t do it, you build the connection in your brain saying “Look, I was scared to go outside and I didn’t go outside and nothing bad happened, therefore staying inside was the right thing to do” and our anxiety is confirmed and grows.   When you are feeling anxious, don’t agree with what you brain is saying, and don’t try to disprove it either, as giving the anxiety any attention just tells your brain this feeling is something worth putting energy into.  I’m sorry you are having such a hard time, and while I have given this advice don’t think that I don’t still struggle with it. You aren’t alone and some times no matter how hard you try things won’t be great in your head that day, and that’s okay, but when you feel like you aren’t having a really bad day, maybe try some of the things above, and confirm to your brain that there is nothing to be scared of, and that your anxiety is a boring useless trait wired into us, that no longer serves you.  Hope this message was okay xxx
I suggest you see a therapist they are better for these kinds of things. The job aspect can help you meet people and friends so its a really good ideal. Even though you can't afford to go to college there are trade schools. As for the love part take your time date when you let anxiety and see if you meet someone you. But i would honestly see a therapist.
same! i could've written this post myself. except I'm 24. but yes - so lonely, live with my parents, overweight with no self esteem whatsoever. so just know that there are others out there going through similar struggles - you are not alone. i hope one day things will get better
Try supplementing with Lithium Orotate.
This reply deserves a reward.
Thank you for helping, I'll think about what you said to try and better understand myself.

Tonight we was supposed to be about us. I got called into work. No biggy you have things you need to take care of while I’m gone cool perfect it works out. All day at work I expected to come home to all the house work done and a bath ready to go and a smoke. Nope. I come house I have to fold and put away three loads of laundry and do the dishes. You okay your game. I wait Patiently for you to get done. You promised me you’d be done by a certain time because I have to work In the morning instead you keep saying one more game. I pass out wake up and you’re gone. I crawl into bed, you join shortly after. Keep in mind my feet still hurt from work. Nothing you promised got done tonight. I lay there as you play on your phone. I get up and grab my game because I can’t sleep. You left me on bed, instead of cuddling me you left me once again to sleep by myself. Where did you go? The recliner. Numb.  I can’t even cry I’m so used to it.  I want to cry, I want to scream, break something anything rather than just sitting here wondering what I’ve done to deserve this, where I’ve gone wrong, what I can do to make it better. So here I am. Telling you all about my day. I’m open to advice, help me out. What am I doing wrong? How can I be better? am I not good enough? Are you missing her?
Talk to them, don't let pride or being scared of being hurt make you keep your feelings to yourself. If you genuinely love this person and want to make it work despite the hardships then they need to hear it.   The times I've been prideful and not wanted to be hurt, I just ended causing myself more pain. I would want nothing more than to tell the other person I love them, or just see them smile, but since I was feeling sad I would always come up with a reason why I shouldn't.   Dont be an idiot like me. You sound wonderful, caring, and loyal. If you feel someone pulling away, let them know how much you're missing them. Keeping it to yourself will just tear you up inside, trust me.
Leave this place. There is something better than this, for you.
This makes my heart sad... I have put people through this kind of treatment.... I'm going to be better thanks for your post I'm sorry.
But it’s just my side? What if I’m the problem?
Glad to have helped
It was more of a look at it from the other person's shoes kind of thing. I'm working on bettering my self everyday this just reminded me of a aera of life I fall short in.

and by that, I mean reasons to follow through with it. I’m an extremely passionate drummer and almost 18, meaning I gotta venture into the real world, in this case I’d like to get involved with the music industry. but live music has been on a decline. hardly anyone seems to care enough to see a live band anymore, compared to a rapper or generic pop artist.  music is quite literally by life. it’s what I breathe and live by. I’ve been wanting to be a drummer as my career since I was 10 years old, but now as I learn more about life, I now realize how hard it is to obtain that goal. especially in a time like this. I don’t want to live a life that I don’t want. I can’t find hope anymore, it makes me want to die. I haven’t had suicidal thoughts since 3 years ago so this is a very emotional time for me at the moment. I know this all sounds extremely over-exaggerated given the situation, but I can’t put into words how passionate I am about this all.
There will always be a need for drummers. What type of music do you listen to?
I mainly listen to 70s progressive rock, but for current stuff I usually listen to alternative bands too. It’s just that producers will just use a drum machine instead
Same here, any favorite bands?
My favorite is rush, but I’ve recently been getting into genesis and yes a whole lot, and pink floyd has always been in my life since my dad loves them
Same here actually. So sad that we lost Neil last year. Fuck 2020

I have diagnosed anxiety and depression and am heavily medicated because of it. I spent my entire life trying to make other people’s lives easier. I do the extra chores, I help without being asked, I drive my siblings places, I help with groceries. But it’s not enough. It’s never enough. The best thing to ever happen in my life was going to university. Living by myself. Taking care of only myself. No one to call me names or not make me feel good enough. I actually started to feel better. I didn’t have any more mental breakdowns, I had started to eat better, exercising daily, and overall just enjoying life. But then I came home. I got yelled at for not doing the dishes one day. It’s not that it’s my job, I have three other siblings. They leave their dishes all stacked in the sink and wait for me to come and clean them. So one day I decide to get my hair done and don’t do the dishes my mom yells at me and says I never help around the house. And I slowly start to slip back into my old ways. My bad though processes, I stop working out every day, I start binge eating. (I would like to claim I’m not unhealthy I am average weight for my height and build) but it all starts to add up then today I go to work for the first time because they are finally letting us back since they were scared of college students possibly bringing in covid. So I work my shift and come home to find out my grandfather is going on hospice. He’s the reason I’m majoring in engineering. The person who I found most interesting and kind. And my mom is upset. As soon as I heard that I knew I wanted to go to the gym. It’s how I relieve stress. It’s the day before my mother’s birthday. Since I had just gotten home no one had told me anything they just assumed I would already know. So I put on my workout clothes and say I’m going to the gym, next thing I know my mom is yelling saying “oh no you’re not. You’re helping cook!” I go downstairs to see my older sister and dad have started unpacking groceries my mom follows me down yelling that I’m inconsiderate. My dad asks me to put something in his car and I explain how the gym is my stress reliever how I used it at university. He says I can go later, I tel him it closes at seven so I wouldn’t be able to. My mom then says while we’re waiting for the meat to thaw and my sisters ran to the store to get flowers that I can go to the gym. That she understands why o want to go. So I go for a half hour then rush home and help cook the majority of dinner. Then I get mad at my little brother and tell him not to get in my dog’s face because it makes him anxious then my mom yells at me for telling my brother what to do... and it goes on and on. Me doing the dishes and asking for help etc. then it’s time for cake. We sing happy birthday and my dad doesn’t know where the cake cutter is so of course I’m the only one to get up and get it. I come back and my older sister is in my seat. I ask twice if she could move. Word for word, “can you please move. Come on, you know I was sitting there.” She says it’s not her fault and I shouldn’t have gotten up. So instead of getting mad and yelling, I tickle her side. Forgetting that she’s sensitive and hates when people touch her sides (mind you I’ve never touched her side before or tazed her or whatever you want to call it, I was annoyed and had asked nicely for her to move) I had barely touched her side and she falls to the ground crying like I had stabbed her or something. My mom starts yelling and I automatically go on the defensive and my dad jumps in to defend me. I think it’s done and my mom snaps, “don’t you ever do that again.” I look at her and she’s just cutting cake and slamming it onto plates and I’m just done I push back from the table and leave saying I didn’t mean to hurt and I had apologized. She then goes on to scream that I am pathetic and a selfish bitch and thank god I’m finally leaving them alone. I go to my room, bury myself in blankets. First my dad says to come and join them. I say no thank you and I don’t want to be persecuted anymore. He knows how when ever something goes south I’m the one my mother decides to take it out on. Then my older sister apologizes. And asks me to come, “her father is dying.” Yes he is and it’s awful and sad but that makes it ok to call me pathetic? And then my little sister comes in and keeps ranting that I’m a selfish person. That first I go to the gym and then I refuse to go down and watch a movie with them. My mom told me to go upstairs. That she didn’t want to see me. Why on earth would I go downstairs? My grandfather is dying, I’m a bad person for going to the gym, I’m a pathetic excuse for a daughter, and tonight is the first night that I’ve contemplated suicide in over a year. And I’m now getting one of my migraines that causes me to go blind. So wonderful. Anyone who could tell me that I’m not a pathetic waste of skin would be much appreciated.

Hi, I’m a 20 year old female. I make good money and i live with my boyfriend who has been my boyfriend for about a year now. I don’t know why I get so sad some times. It’s unbearable so cry everyday I really don’t know why. I feel like i have no one to talk to and no one who will truly listen to me. I have been debating picking up everything and moving out of state by myself because where i am now isn’t really where i want to be. Do you think that will fix anything? I am so tired of crying everyday and feeling like a burden to everyone around me.
I was bringing up the money part to mention that I really dislike my job and all the drama that surrounds it but the money is really good. Maybe that is part of the problem that makes me upset
Try to do things you love to do on your spare time. If your also unhappy in the relationship communicate that with your partner. About the job you’re really young if you have money saved you can always decide to look for another job.

Hi, first a little back story. I have depression and OCD, I had recovered perfectly but two months ago (just when I stopped taking my antidepressants) I relapsed and I kept it to myself and I though it was the best option but now I see that it wasn’t. I had a girlfriend, she is the most perfect woman on the universe. But she just broke up with me because she doesn’t feel the same for me and I asked her when did she start feeling this way and she said that like one month and a bit more ago (I never told her about how I was feeling, now I know that was dumb). I feel like we could get back together there because she was in love with me not sick me and I don’t want to drag her to my stuff so I told her that I was going to try and get better and after I feel normal that we could try it again. I don’t know if she agreed to the idea just to make me feel better but I am going to do my best to win her back.  Now, I need your advice on how to win her back. I know it sounds toxic but I feel like our relationship wasn’t toxic at all because we never stopped being ourselves or tried to change the other person and we can live being far from each other for a long time. But she is the person that I love the most and that is why I want to try again, but if it fails at least I would know that we don’t work and that it wasn’t just the sicknesses fault.  Sorry for all the text and my bad english.
I don't want to be negative, but it probably won't work. I've seen too many men try to build themselves up for a girl, only to have her date someone else within days, or always view him as incompatible, no matter how much work he does.  Ideally, I would hope that you're trying to build yourself up for your own strength and stability. If you make your purpose in healing just to get back with this girl, you might be putting too much pressure on the relationship, and putting too much of your identity in this girl. Then even if you get back together, every time you have a fight or break up, you'll just return to depression again.  Please focus hard on the therapy, building your mind and body up, and basing yourself strongly. If you get back together after your strengthening, cool. If not, you'll have the foundation to keep living and meet someone more on your level.
Yeah, I didn’t make it clear but betting better for me is the main goal and I want to do it even if she rejects me, but if I get better and get the second chance it could be the perfect combination and I wan to give it my best!
Oh nice, you're on a strong path!  Specifically to getting back together, come back with a stronger body and a cool demeanor. Don't show weakness with "I'm sorry" or "Please forgive me".  Be like "Hey (name), my bad about that stuff before. Hey, you wanna hit up a movie?" Quickly acknowledge the past, then set the new frame and direction. It's your best bet.
Mmmm kinda hard because we go to exactly the same classes hahahaha
Oh that's tough haha, then I suggest playing it cool, don't talk to her too much, let her see the changes you're making.  But be ready to meet another girl if need be. I had this exact same problem of girl trouble with a girl in my class. It ended badly. But I was dating someone else later. :O)
Yeah, I plan not to talk for a month and that way we can both re evaluate everything and appreciate each other

Hi everyone,  I’m writing this as I’ve never really had a week like this, and I don’t know what to do. I’ve had two members of my family come down with serious but non-life threatening health issues at the same time as some work stressors and it’s basically taken a sledgehammer to my mental health. I don’t know that I’ve ever been depressed before, but I am fairly certain I am well on my way this time. I’m worrying non stop, can barely eat, always tired, zero interest in my hobbies, etc.  I’ve met with a therapist to help with my sadness and the triggers, as well as my doctor who prescribed sertraline. I have hope these will help, but the drugs are at least 4 weeks from aiding, and therapy feels like a long term effort to me. In the mean time, how do you cope and function? Life keeps going, and I have work and family commitments that need upholding, but I can barely manage the focus and care to do something as small as shave. The idea of an 8 hour shift tomorrow is crushing me. I took this last week off, but don’t think I can push more.   I’m feeling very gloomy, and don’t know how to handle things in the short term while waiting for the benefits of the therapy and drugs to kick in. Does anyone have any advice? Any medication that helps quicker that I could look towards? I have a great family support system so I’m very thankful for that at the least.  Thank you in advance.
I have no experience with any medications, but here’s a few pieces of advice that’ve helped me through 10 years of the gloom and doom of depression...  Talk it out. Talk to whoever will listen (or pretend to listen). Your parents, siblings, aunts and uncles, or close friends. Simply ask for them to listen. Speak your mind, no matter what’s on it. Just talk. Talking about your stressors and your issues can help relieve stress and offer you an emotional catharsis (of sorts).   Keep going to therapy. Keep that momentum going as long as you are able. I stopped going in January of 2020 and haven’t had the courage/mental energy to schedule another session, even though I desperately wish I had the mental strength to reach out.  When you wake up in the morning, list 3 things you are grateful for, 3 things that truly make you happy, and 3 things you want to achieve that day. For whatever reason, this exercise made me able to get through the stresses of work and college without serious issue.   I certainly hope you are able to get through this rough patch in your life. I wish your family members good health and speedy recoveries. I truly truly truly hope you are able to kick depression’s ass. Do it for all of us who haven’t been able to do it (YET). Best wishes.

Drinkings got worse. My apathy has really just consumed me. School beginning to kick me out. I want to join the military and get shot somewhere. That doesn’t work just shoot myself.
I really recommend that you seek help sooner rather than later if you can  Please contact a charity ASAP.

So I get super happy when I’m exercising.  Life becomes all that it should be and I’m confident and all that shit.  But that’s late in the evening and by the time I shower and get into bed, I’m suicidal again and just waiting until it’s time to exercise again.  I wish it was all over.  Ugh. 6 more hours until I can get on my bike again.
Holy shit I relate to this so much, when I run I feel so positive and confident and then by the time I’ve showered I’m just back to feeling terrible. It sucks because it gives the illusion that I’m actually getting better only to drop down again :(
I think that’s so fucking insightful.  Like I’m exercising and sweating and suddenly my prescience erupts and I just know I’m getting better; that this is the beginning of the end of my depression and wow, I’m finally becoming a new person.. then I get out of the shower and my heart rate calms down and I remember that I can’t actually get rid of my dumb ass brain.z
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzdbda/she_wants_to_stop_taking_therapy_after_2_sessions/
This is continuing from my previous story,  and TL;DR, my GF is suicidal and I forced her to live, and told her family to take her to therapy. I'm glad she was able to get therapy and we were able to get back together and she's been doing great and all and was diagnosed with Major Depression. She was already told that she'd be taking meds but they won't be permanent. However, she wants to stop after her second session. She's starting to feel like she's being more of a burden. Her family is not the best. They think it's all in her head or that it's just a phase or part of being a teenager, when in fact, it's not. and this has been going on for years for her and she couldn't get out of it because of her parents.  &#x200B;  The dad went on about she doesn't need therapy, it'll just tell her to get meds and make her dependent on it. Her mom directly asked her if something's wrong with her head, and she should do it online because of COVID which is understandable but, the root of her problems is in that house and it will only stress her further.  &#x200B;  She wants to live and she wants help, but her parents are making her feel like she should stop and it's useless and she's risking her family's health out of worry and money. How do I convince her to keep going and to hold on?
Can you take her to therapy yourself ? or be there when she goes to therapy? having a supportive figure around might greatly help her since she cannot count on her parents.
She needs to stop listening to them, they are only making her life worse for her. You gotta help her understand that. It’s hard but it can be done if done properly. Be very passive about it when you tell her and hopefully she will listen to reason
Maybe look into cps (if she is under 18) and see if they cover this as a form of neglect

Im 17 5'6 and im abt 125 lbs. nit bad, im average but yk i have looked better i know im not fat by any standards but i feel it when i look in the mirror. i dont have a bulge, accept for my uterus poking out and i dont have stretch marks anywhere than my thighs and my chest. Im constantly being told over and over again that my body is perfect. BUT I DONT FEEL IT I HATE MYSELF, and when someone comes around and calls me skinny fat; when i see other people with the same body type-- that are called skinny fat, I lose my mind and rage, sobbing and angry. Shut it if you use that term. it really is hurtful and you dont know what ppl are goung through. you shouldnt make ppl walk around on egg shells fearing, brace yourself someone is going to say something hurtful. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THAT (now im realizing this is tying in with my other personal problems so i will end my point here with a final concluding statement.) Please, everyone be kind to others, please make an effort im begging you, be yourself yes,and if you're snarky and kinda rude thats fine! but acknowledge what you're doing and try please im begging you :)
Hey! So I totally understand where you are coming from. Can I suggest that you trying and understand where these feelings of h sure are coming from?   We will always thing we have something to improve when it comes to our own bodies - but like, when it comes to an extremely about how we "hate" our own body - then something isn't right. What makes you feel like that? And I don't just mean - I look in the mirror and I'm bigger thanwhst I want to be - I mean, deep down what is it about your body that makes you feel like that? Are you' scared? What is it?
i mean, its everything. But ig it probably roots from my family, everyone is obese. im the only one thas not, and im afraid at even the sight of fat or a possible stretch mark bc i dont want to look like them. they talk abt how small they were when they were my age, and i look at them and what theyve become and any indication that i could potentially look like that scares the crap out of me, im just being overly harsh on myself but its how o feel. disgusting.
Right I see! I think you're doing the right thing.. A but almost Fort he wrong reasons if you get my drifr?   Maybe it might be time to try and warp your thinking - so instead of " I don't want to be obese because I don't want to be like my family and it'll stress me out if I am etc". It is - I¥ don't want to be obese because I want to be a fit and healthy person"  This small change can honestly. Make a world of difference to your mental healtjm   Also please give yourself some slack! To be in an obese family and not end io being obese is a massive achievement!!
Thats the thing, im being healthy, and so was my grandma she exercised everyday and ate all her veggies when she was my age like i do, she was my size and then one day she said she was the size she is now. im afraid that ill be that way no matter what lifestyle i choose.

Every day, all day.   Either I’m sad and I fake happiness or I feel uncontrollable anger, and of course at that point I’m being more real than I could any other way.   Ah, that artificial, yet genuine sounding, laugh. My smile with the two dimples on the sides that complete it perfectly to convey a flawless expression of utter joy.   When I convince my best and closest of friends, my family, and other people who really have no place in my life that I’m *”doing fine.”*  I hate it.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzkv3q/i_dont_dream/
I used to dream. I used to want to do things with my life and honestly thought I could do anything with my life. Almost as if I could have anything I wanted if I just reached out and grabbed it.   Then I got older and learned how much I truly hated existing in a world where I couldn’t just reach out and grab what I wanted to achieve. And no, I couldn’t just work for it either. I wasn’t allowed it. Every time I tried to achieve what I wanted to do with my life I failed miserably. Over and over and over. I grew to hate myself for not having the success I should be having. All this work for nothing. I wanted nothing more than to succeed. That doesn’t matter anymore. Cause when I did succeed, it didn’t make me happy. It made me upset because it wasn’t worth it.  My dreams fell out of my heart. I forgot what it’s like to dream about the things I could do because I knew I can’t do anything I wanted. I was limited to my environment, body, and mind. I  never wanted to be held back. I hate myself for holding myself back. I don’t know what I want anymore.   All I know is I just want to stop living. I know it sounds cliche and overused, but I just don’t want to suffer. I don’t want to live in this place. It isn’t happy nor fair. It’s a dreadful, awful, no good place. I don’t want any part of it. Even if i tried to fix it, it wouldn’t matter. No one will remember my cries. And the dreadfulness would start anew.  I hope I die swiftly and sooner, rather than later.

And I don't even have any excuses. I'm not particularly anxious about the pandemic, my family doesn't bother me, I don't have that much work...   I just don't have any motivation to be alive. I'm dumb and my attention span is too short, so my grades are falling, so I lose motivation, so I don't study, so my grades fall, so I lose motivation.... I'm too stupid for this shit, and I have several important exams pretty soon. I just wish I could crawl into a hole and die. School is just constant reminder of how stupid I am.  Been contemplating suicide for a year and I'm not stopping. Everytime I go to school I have to take train, and it's struggle to stop myself from jumping on the rails. Feel like it's going to happen soon if I keep it like that. The only reason I'm still alive is because my family seems to care a little about me. I don't have anyone else other than them but I don't even talk to them that much, I'm just being here. So I guess it wouldn't change a lot of things if I was gone
I relate to a lot of what you said in terms of not having the motivation to live - sometimes I think why would i go through all this stress of studying hard when I’ll probably fail anyways? Why would i work hard when i have barely any friends and probably none who like me, will likely never be in a relationship, never have kids and my life just revolves around sport as a distraction... a lot of the time especially with the isolation Covid brings i just wanna end it all but then I put things into perspective. You see, I don’t believe anybody is dumb. We’re all above average in at least one sector of life - the problem is societal standards often overlook intelligence beyond school. The school system feels like hell to me too, but just remember what’s the worst that can happen? There are loads of other ways to make it in life beyond getting uni degrees so it doesn’t mean we can’t be happy without it.  I know we feel down and out now, in the dumps, there are grey clouds and no sun is shining through but so many people have felt like this before us. Thoughts aren’t reality so we often over-exaggerate how bad things really are.  We just gotta keep living, take it day by day, think about the smallest things that bring you joy and if we think positive, our lives may even become enjoyable eventually? Life is simply a journey where we learn from mistakes and try to have fun along the way, so let’s not take it too seriously. The beauty is it’s unpredictability. Let’s just focus on little wins every day, both you and I will find our purpose, please keep going

This is a real test to my suicidal thoughts, like really this pandemic and lockdowns are heavy

Hi!  I just wanted to ask if anybody had some recommendations for a book(s) which I could read to help my case?   I'm 22M and have been somewhat depressed for about 1.5 years now. I've not yet accumulated any kind of thoughts to harm myself but would like to avoid that. I've lost joy in things that made me happy and have not found anything for replacement. I feel void. I need some kind of a mental restart. I want to feel hungry again.   I think that I'm looking for some kind of new philosophy. Before I practiced stoicism and it somewhat mixed well with my hardworking personality. Now I'm not even happy when things turn out well. This state of mind is really harming my everyday life and I would love to find a way around it.  Thank you in advance & keep on fighting!
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzezz8/how_do_i_tell_the_psychologist_that_i_want_to_go/
First appointment coming up with a new psychologist. Trying to figure out what foot to start out on.  Hi, doc. I've always been depressed, but I never really cared and it doesnt really bother me. Life has no meaning and I've come to grips with that, but to me life has no value, I would be objectively better off dead and have worked out a game theory assessment to back me up. I deeply regret not killing myself when I was 10, but it is too late to revisit that decision now, but I can't because of how it would affect others, and I have never cared about myself, it has always been about others   But now I am in so much emotional pain that all I want is to go back to being despondent.  I sound completely nuts
I'd probably say something like "I'm comfortable being depressed because it feels like it's all I've known".
No you don't.  I pretty much just did the exact same thing.  I've been seeing therapists off and on for years.  I'm done.  Nothing ever changes, I have no motivation to change.  Seeing a therapist just makes it all hurt more from poking at the underlying issues.  I'd really just rather let them be at this point.  I don't really care about what happens to me now, my dad, who was my best friend, died 2 weeks ago.  But I would never kill myself because my wife has said that the thing she fears the most is being alone.  I couldn't do it to her.  So I'll just keep on being co-dependent.  Honestly, you're not nuts at all.  You've just reached a point where you no longer want to get better.  I'm right there with you.
It is all I've ever known.  Existential ennui sucks when you're 9. Single digits kids aren't supposed to be nihilists.

Lately I think I have hit rock bottom. I have been severely depressed for a long time and been moderately suicidal, but recently it has gotten much much worse. I think about suicide every single day, and the thoughts are so fucking often. It’s so distracting as well, it like pierces through anything else im trying to do or think about. It is extremely overwhelming.  Ive also done something recently that I never even really thought of before, and that was make a full plan for my suicide, which would be by hanging. Somehow knowing this makes it so much more real, Ive also gotten into this mindset that there is no way out and I will be in constant hell forever, it feels so fucking inescapable and I know it will just get worse and worse. I feel so fucking sad and angry all the time, it is just exhausting. I feel so sensitive to everything now, and there is no one to talk to. Ive just never gotten this close to killing myself before, it scares me a little bit. I don’t really know what to do, I’m trying so hard to keep my head above water, but it is getting increasingly hard every day. I haven’t showered in months, all I do is just sit inside all day and do drugs and jerk off. I am a literal recluse, I feel so isolated and alone, like I have nothing left. I don’t know how much longer I can put up with this.   Even if no one responds, I’m glad I could get my feelings out somewhere, so thanks for reading.
I've had experiences of planning to kill myself before but here's something to keep in mind: everyone has creative and destructive energies. You need to explore your creative potential and try and leave destructive energies behind. Everyone has hidden potential but you need to focus on positive energies and what you can personally create for people. The emotion you have will not go to waste if you push yourself to create things that you can communicate to others.
I feel every word you write, I actually posted a very similar post to yours last night. Once reaching this point I am sure you've done most things possible to get out of your situation. Therapies, meds, exercise, eating healthy, keeping a rhytm and all of that? What I found is that it helps me calm my brain to just write my feelings here and talk with the kind people of reddit about the pain I feel each day. This might help for you as well. I just want to you to know that I am here for you, write to me and I will read and reply if you so desire. \*Mental hug\* brother/sister, hang in there and keep on resisting, you are strong and lets hope eventually will reach a point where you can look back and feel a little better.
I relate your post very much. During quarantine I feel like I also hit rock bottom (hopefully it can’t get worse). I’m currently a uni student and failed so many exams since I can’t for the love of me force myself to study properly.   I’ve had suicidal thoughts and planned out how I’d carry it out. Thought gunshot would be too messy + closed casket, then poisons are hard to come by so that leaves me with hanging - after all as a civilization we’ve been doing it for centuries. I researched details on how to go about it and then it hit me. The feeling that I always have an optional way out now kind of reassured me? I’m not sure how to explain it but it helped me move on. I’m slowly getting back to it but it’ll be a long road.
Go have a shower and just sit in there for a while. Simple things like that are hard to do when you’re severely depressed but it will make you feel a little better. I was where you are for the last 2 years. Suicide was on my mind from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep. Even going to the beach, I’d see a cliff and imagine jumping off. I also made plans to hang myself. But they’re just thoughts. You don’t have to act on them and they will pass in time. Could be a few weeks or it could be a couple of years like it was for me. You can feel better than you do now, even if it doesn’t feel that way. Also worth noting that if hanging fails, you could end up brain damaged & paralysed. It’s not worth the risk. Life would be even more unbearable. It sounds like you’ve got a lot of pent up frustration. Maybe try going to the gym or going for a run and blast some tunes. You need to get that energy out.
First thoughts of suicide i had when i was 15. Then they went away for some time cause of business. But When i was 23 or so they came back, i have planned 3 different ways to do it. Once i kinda tried but i knew i couldnt. The thing is, i realised, i dont want to kill myself, i just want to get rid of the pain.   Now im 30, for the last 5 years i have been meditating daily, last 2-3 years i have been exercising regularly, for the last 4 years i attend one of the social support groups. I still think of suicide from time to time. I still dont have energy, i still dont find any meaning, i still dont want to do all of these things, they dont give me joy, i dont like them but i just push myself little my little. I never want to get out of the bed. I push myself cause somewhere deep down i know its right.  Oh, a year ago i gave up drugs and alcohol which i did for...emm...weed for some 4-5 years intensly, before that alcohol for about 5 years. I drank until vomited and then drunk again. I was very goal oriented on being drunk. I tried to cut all the things many times with many flat backfalls. After quitting i have cried for hours, expressed thousands of  anger, dissappointment, sadness. Through addiction i just tried to bury down all the discomfort. It was a tough year and still is. Its not easy. And at this point i dont really wait when its gonna get easier. Just effort. But yes, although its not easy, its different, i dont want to go back. Never.   I think there might be hope, but its not said there wont be struggle. I think its neccessary to do whats right even if its no easy. I really would love to live life in rose garden, but im starting to realise that its not gonna just happen, because i want.   I wish you courage and many many self soothing behavior.
Go outside and get some sunshine! invite a friend over, go out and get some coffee.. :-D
Same here, but when I feel that way I always try to talk it out with someone, literally anyone if not my psychiatrist. But it's true that having a creative tool to let go of that is really important, I remember one day I was really rock bottom and I just started painting how my pain felt and it made me detach from it in a way. I also just bought a midi electric keyboard and it's been really helpful to make music even though I'm just learning, it helps being more in the moment and feel more mindful!
**looks like you guys are in recovery, really glad for you both.**

I get shut down right away. 'everyone is feeling this way right now'. Well is everyone currently harming themselves and slowly growing more and more sure of the fact they wanna kill themselves. I didn't think so. I know times are hard for everyone, but god froid you give me some support for once and take me seriously
I feel you. But I suggest to only talk to therapists and other people fighting with such issues. It's a waste of time to do that with anyone else. At best people will ignore you, at worst they will gang up on you.
I don't know about that. They're right about me lol. What else can they say. They are just parents saying parents things.

Hey all, lately my issues with depression have been getting pretty bad. I've had to move back home into a semi-toxic environment from a town I enjoyed living in, I'm 26 and never had a job or significant other/relationship. the lack of a job due to issues I've had with anxiety and an intense fear of failure. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life outside of vague ideas that seem impossible to achieve and I'm doing a uni course that I have no idea whether I actually want to continue. I'm currently trying to find a place to move into so I can have my own space again but I don't like my chances. I know that this year is the year that I'll have to try to find some sort of job but outside of fast-food, there's not much available here.  All that combined is making my head a rather not so fun place to be at the moment. My grandparents who I'm currently living with aren't really helpful when it comes to mental health, my pops just naive and think it's as easy as 'just think positive' and 'just bite the bullet'.  My nan on the other hand has told me in the past that have nothing to be depressed about and that other people have it worse. couple this with her pressuring me about the house and job situation while occasionally reminding me that my friends and others my age have jobs/careers and relationships, it just isn't helping my current headspace and is just fueling the depression by reminding me how much of a failed mess I am.  I know that I need to do these things but my motivation for anything major has been virtually non-existent for a long time, which just gets to me even more. I can't tell my grandparents this because they'll just think I'm making excuses for being lazy. I can't even really honestly remember the last time I felt proper joy and the moment I do feel a modicum of happiness my depressed mind just comes in and drags me back down.   All this is why in the darkest moments my depression tells me to end it. because I'm a broken failed mess of a human that should just give up because it just's easier and better for everyone around me. thankfully I have yet to get close to going through with it but it does get awfully tempting sometimes. probably the only thing keeping me anchored to the world is my cat since I don't want to abandon her and I'm worried about what will happen to her if I'm gone. she's been the best lifeline I've had these last few years but even then I'm worried that she even won't be enough to keep going at this rate.  Anyway, my apologies if this came across as a jumbled incomprehensible mess of a post, I'm currently going through a pretty intense wave and just wanted to vent and get something out there.  Cheers guys.

i graduated two months after covid hit. i joined the work force a week before the mask mandate was introduced, and suddenly i had all this time on my hands. so i worked and i kept up with friends and things were up and down like always, until one day i just started feeling nothing.    and now everyday is the same, it all goes by simultaneously too fast and too slow.  i sleep as much as i can. i stress about how much i dont want this boring life, but i’m too tired to fix it.    i’m tired of being so tired.
This, too, shall pass. Remember that. (:  Keep moving forward, even if forward feels like the worst way to go. There will eventually be light at the end of the tunnel.

This is a rant, so take it as you’d like. I just wanted to vent and if stuff doesn’t make sense, I’m sorry, but it just how I feel atm.  I have done many things over the past few years. I moved to another country to study, I exercise, I try and talk to people with confidence, I try to stay engaged and fresh with current events, I try to be educated and all of that stuff, I’m working on being more disciplined, I’m becoming healthier, and many people would think that I am in a path of self improvement, but I think I’m not, and in fact, I think I feel even worse than I felt before, because I do all of these things out of fear.  I moved to another country because, way way back, I said I would, and if I didn’t make it, well shit, I would be a failure and I’d be criticized. I exercise because I’m insecure about myself and if I look normal, I don’t feel good about what I accomplished. I just feel like I’m “enough” or “what I’m supposed to be”, and if I don’t look like people expect, I fear I will be criticized and laughed at. I try to talk to people, because, at least for my family, it is “great to have as many contacts and connections with people as possible and you should be able to talk with people and have as many friends as possible”, and if I don’t do that, I’ll be seen as a failure. I always stay up to date about everything because of fear of missing out and feeling like I can’t talk to others about what is happening at the moment.  And I hate this. And I hate to engage with society because of how tiring and boring it is. It is very difficult to find people with whom I don’t have to maintain appearances or fake smiles, or people that are really interested in whatever I have to say. I hate doing all of that and lowkey I don’t give a fuck about any of those things or about myself or how I am. Hell if I did whatever I actually wanted to do, I’d go live in a cabin in the woods or go live on a desert island or maybe just go die in a hole somewhere and call it a day. But I can’t do it because I have to take care of people in my family. Other than that, I feel like I have no real purpose or direction in life and I do whatever I do following plans I came up with earlier in life, when I actually found stuff to be cool and inspiring. That’s why my plans for life end just after I finish university, which is closing in fast. After that, I don’t know what I’ll do.
I know how it feels to feel like u are never enough and wont ever be, But would u continue to do all these stuff if no one was watching? Checking? Criticizing?no?then stop.its soooo damn goood that u have the will and discipline to do all these stuff,and that these are things that actually help people toward self improvement.so just imagine doing it for ur own sake?
I know exactly what you mean about not having people you can just be yourself around. I have this problem as well. When we try to keep appearances, the vibe we send out is just that- you care what everyone thinks. I think the key is just being yourself and you will attract the company you crave because when you are being yourself, others will feel comfortable enough to do the same. It can be so scary but try not to criticize yourself. I am going to try it. You should too! Isn't it crazy how society has us thinking "life" is just going to school, making the right connections, travel, get a job- all while never feeling an ounce of peace inside? Why do we put ourselves through these ridiculous things we don't even want to be doing? Do what makes you happy. You have a unique set of skills/personality/love to offer the world. Embrace that.

I'm extremely talented at drawing, but most of the time I can't put in the effort to draw to that ability I know I have. I want to really use that ability, but it just "wont" and I end up drawing like a toddler because...well my brain just wont kick into to gear to do it, but I REALLY want to. This has been a problem for years, it eventually came to a point where I couldn't draw anymore unless I wanted it to come out like a toddler drew it. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD, I know that talent is still in there in me, but these conditions just sap the ability to use it because there's no enjoyment, no motivation, "no point", etc. I occasionally ahve moments, maybe a few minutes at most where it eases up and I'm not hindered but it's very rare. I'm getting treatment, I really hope things will get better and I can be me again.
Hey! So the fact that you are getting treatment is a fantastic big first step to take :)  Have you tried doing something else that you enjoy doing? Like perhaps taking a break from drawing  (guilt free) will help you.  What I'm trying ti's ay is thst it is easy to put in a lot of effort into a particular hobby right? And sometimes when you put a lot in - it's turns from a hobby into a weird job like things. And suddenly you'll start to feel guilty about not drawing etc - and that puts extra dded stress onto your mind.  Parhaps taking a break - where you guilt free tell yourself - for this enxt week I will not draw.. That might help?

Please tell me what to do, I have been screwed since I was born, been unhappy since I was 13, no friends since then, have not enjoyed working at all, don't enjoy any activities, don't want to get out of bed, just spend my life doing work and chores and playing games for an hour in the weekends. There is no reason to live, it is just too hard to kill yourself so what can you do?  I know nobody will listen or care, and there is no answer you can give me, but it is my duty to rant once a year so I can say I did it.
You are looking for a moment of peace,probably want to be alone and spend your time as you want. But hey, working and pain is part of your life,it is part of adulthood. Many ppl are objective to the reality and they want to escape and these ppl dont have any concepts to be entertained with so they become senile. We gotta find something which is precious for our idea,some want peace,some want war,love,hardship,sloth etc. Idk but if you have the time get some book,it may help you,even you can build a kinda hobby outta it. Or anything else you want.  "Freedom is beautiful but it is so cruel."
So you are saying that because we have more free time we have more time to think about how bleak life is? And if we were in the wilds fighting to survive life would be more fulfilled?
What i am saying is we want to flush the mosquitos from our mind. Dude i decided to forget my mess but i saw i have to remember and learn so then i can try. We should find a way to deal with it not escape.
How do you deal with the pain?
I used it,understood it and got along with it. I am still broken that nobody could fix but i got along. I found out it must have happened,life without pain is off the knowledge.   But let me tell you this: I'm happy that the pain entered itself into my life. Actually since i was 6.
But you would probably be more happy without the pain, unless pain is pleasure.
The pain gave me knowledge,i understood the shit was happening around me. I saw the true colors man from loved ones. I saw the bigger picture of life.
The bigger picture of life is that we are all going to die one day and this is all pointless.

Can't believe society expects us to choose one of 4/5 career fields (medical, technology, business to get some shitty office job or the military/trades ) as if that's going to make everyone happy and expect us to waste our days away at something we fucking hate but have to do just for the money. Fuck this shit. I hate all of these jobs, they're fucking stressful, kill me inside and make me miserable. No wonder depression rates are so high because of these shitty fucking jobs that take so much time out of our lives. I could have spent that time learning a new language, a new instrument, a new skill that doesnt fit those cookie cutter career fields, but no...we need more money. Slave your fucking days away and be happy.
Yep yep yep yep yep fucking hate all of this
r/antiwork
Theres any amount of careers you can have. A sad fact of life is you're gonna probably have to do something you're not crazy about so you can earn a living. I used to feel worthless for years because I dropped out of college and wasnt a pencil pusher like some of my friends but that life wasnt for me. Currently applying for culinary school after spending a few years working in hospitality and hopefully will own my own business some day. Being unemployed sucks ass but doing something soul sucking sucks even more. Gonna find that happy middle ground. Work gives you structure and routine which is something that is a big step in combating depression.
For the longest time I'd wanted to be a lawyer. Not because my parents pushed me, but because I thought it was all about debating and convincing people lol. My law school plans fell through because I didn't have high enough GPA or LSAT scores but I still got to work at a law firm, just in a different position.   Most of the lawyers I've met are so miserable. They're always waiting for something. Early retirement for instance. The only type of lawyers who seemed happy was the stereotypical douchebags. (But who knows, they could be miserable on the inside too.) This just hit me so hard... Here was a group of people living my dream and they just wanted out. There to slave away what's left of their younger years so they'll be provided for later. I don't think their mindset is strange, but it got me thinking about what I wanted out of life for sure...
It’s not about happiness, it’s about the economy and profits!
You want something nice and simple? Try security. Seriously, it's the best thing I went for since losing my college job. Barrier to entry is low for contract stuff and depending on where you go and what shift you take, you probably won't have to deal with any nasty ass people or customers. I do third shifts at an IT building and it's so fucking peaceful. I see the other guy I'm working with and, towards the end, the people I've been warming the seats for. Client's employees are still at home. I'm not crazy about it, but because I don't see my supervisor until about ten minutes before it's time to go, I can get away with basically anything. I bag up my chromebook and my switch to keep myself awake- honestly half the battle with most jobs like this.  I've had people try and talk me into working for Amazon but, in all honesty, fuck that. They may pay $4 more than where I'm at right now, but I would want to kill myself just working \*part time\* in a shit hole like that. Bezos can kiss my ass.
Yep and how dare you not be happy or depressed, seems like a compulsive things in our society nowadays. Everyone has to be happy and if youre not, people tend to avoid you cause they cannot handle the negative side of things. So sick of it as well.
2 months ago I started a job in a market. A week after starting my life I feel miserable and I cry constantly (I go to the bathroom to cry when I rest). I wanted so much to work to have money and move and now I hate it, I feel that I waste my life and my youth, but without money I cannot exist because I have needs.
I won't tell you an empty lie, the false promise, "Hang in there, it'll get better," but for me… It got better.  For most of my post-military adult life, I make it about 2 years at a job before I get to a point where every morning I worry it'll finally be the day that I won't be able to go back, ever.  I wear my happy mask so well and work so hard to exceed expectations because I'm afraid to fail, that I would be seen as a model employee and be "rewarded" with more responsibilities… And I just can't take that pressure that was on me, even if more than a little was self-inflicted.  Eventually, I ended up working part time 10-12 hrs a week at a tolerable job, but mostly being a stay-at-home parent. When a tornado closed my part-time job, I really leaned into what had been a side hustle that brought in a few hundred a month and made it a much more robust business that makes me several hundred dollars a week, doing something I love, with a significantly smaller time commitment than working part time.  A huge part of this was luck, but another part was having someone in my life who gave me permission to leave a job I hated, even without a plan, and try other things.   Good luck!
Yea. It sucks. But you have to choose. Work or poverty.
my mum chose to raise me and is now forcing me to do 136 math questions in one hour.
This is kind of how I feel. I feel like I had enjoyed my job for the past few years now (factory work), but as of late it just makes me feel like....."This is it?" Work, eat, sleep, repeat. I don't have a life outside of work and will almost instantly fall asleep when I get home because I just feel like a waste of space and can't enjoy life, just numb, so I'll just sleep away until I HAVE to get up for work just to be in this bitter state. If this is how it's going to be basically everyday for now on, then life just sucks. Then people tell you just to go to college like no thanks, I wasted my money there before and I'm not smart enough. Guess I'll just slave away until I die.

**I don't know you're from which country, but same scenario is there in my country too. I'm not from western countries where I can do whatever I like. Here parents, society expecting each person in these useless jobs and are narrow minded. Competiting for these jobs, is an another struggle.**
i am the opposite and i am depressed that i am out of work:(
Hey i feel you. Im getting out of the military soon. I love writing but I dont want to be pressured to produce shit books just so I can have income. I trade options on Robinhood and its a great way to make money but not have to work a bullshit 9-5 minimum wage job. Just do research, and dont be too risky.
Yeah a lot of people have sucky jobs they hate. That’s just life for now. But that doesn’t have to be your whole life. You just need to be sure you find some sort of balance. You have to find something to live for and maybe you won’t mind that job so much. Give yourself something to look forward to at the end of the day. Like it or not life is not all about pleasure. If that was all there was you would get bored and feel like something is missing.
Well, I don’t think the argument is that these jobs will make us happy. People who think such a thing don’t know very much.  It seems to me, according to life’s hierarchical structure, the lower level jobs are obviously more miserable. But such inane jobs have to be done for the whole of world to function as it does. So, it’s a requirement for a large position of us to be miserable, doing inane but necessary things for us all to survive.  I’m not sure learning those things you say will make you happy. Happy in the sense of being being high in the dominance hierarchy, which regulates your mood. But maybe it does bring happiness, finally being able to play the guitar, speak conversational German, or carpentry. What the fuck do I know.
We're gonna break out this cycle. Just keep the faith in your heart and don't be afraid or ashamed to hate this shit! Its inhuman
Somebody once said, In life we must choose our sacrifice (work) as it is unavoidable otherwise the suffering will be much worse
Have you even had a full time job yet? If you haven't it's likely you are falling into Reddit's toxic  whirlpool of hopelessness.  Give it a go before you make your own mind up about work, and ffs get off reddit.
You know someone said something to me once that resonated.  Work is only work if it's not your true path. Negative thinking doesn't breed growth I always hated math growing up like hated it seriously My mother always told me that it will get better but I never listened. Society wants you to either succomb to apathy and misery to settle or just fling hatred at everything. Fear of unfulfillment is the core issue.  Please trust your intuition and it will lead to amazing places. Always have an open mind and hey if your mind falls out of your head that's just a new experience lol Take time to truly meditate and know your self immerse yourself in what you may think is cheesy or lame Treat everyone with love and learn how to tell who is an energy vampire or who is someone that you have energy balance with. Please do this it's so important because you will find that balance and synchronicity Trust me seriously also learn to process emotions and cry if you must let it out and then move on to the next stage  You are electric and amazing this post was written because outside signals are messing ya up go back to basics  I'm here if you have any questions and remember anything worth doing isn't easy
wait who told you office jobs were going to make you happy? what is so stressful? At least you are not a correctional officer having feces thrown at you.
Yup. Time to revolt.
I was depressed that I was out of work, now have a job and am depressed because I’ve called off because it’s hard for me to pick myself up and go. It’s a double edged sword.
Just because he isn’t working as a correctional officer doesn’t mean he isn’t having a tough time. Remember just because someone is suffering on a greater degree than you does NOT negate your own suffering.
The United States is a failed nation and I am just waiting for us to be liberated.

Like seriously, in this world, there are people who win the lottery multiple times and than there are people like me.  People who, if they would have a winning ticket, would get robbed by robber who hires goons with his newly acquired fortune just to beat me up everyday.  That‘s the kind of life I live. Everything that could be bad, will be bad and everything that could go wrong, will go wrong.  I love sleep, or I used to love sleep. Cause in my dreams I used to be a hero, or a loving husband, or an amazing dad, or just a brat in school that everyone looks up to, or many other thing.  But not even that is happening anymore. The last good thing to happen to me were my dreams and even those are gone.  The only thing that remains...  Is just void
**atleast you remembers your dreams. In my case it's just blank, I don't remember a single dream when I wake up**
How is your daily life? Maybe you need to have a clean day. Smelling fresh wind, having a massage and taking a hot bath before going to sleep?  Idk but a change of pace may help you?  I wish you the best of dreams fella. Good luck

the title says it all. I have gotten a lot better, but I still feel empty, miserable, or lost for hours every day. I cycle between the same feelings every day, some moments I am incredibly hopeful and happy, other moments I've fallen down into the pit. and I can generally tell when I will feel one of these moods before it happens, I'm just not always so certain why. I wake up and I have all these things I want to do, but over time, I just start to lose more and more hope, I feel like my friends hate me. I just feel like I will exist in this struggle and pattern for years. I don't want to live like this for years. I cant put up with a battle every day.

back here again, is it surprising?   your role in life is akin to a train conductor, i think. you can speed up or slow down if you wish. you got people around you to help move things along. you got changes of scenery, from the dull greys and smokestacks of the terminal to the lush, bright, sprawling plains that you could just breathe in were it a gas.   and much like a train conductor, you can't stop. you're cruising toward judgement day, so you say "take a load off". but then you get sick of all the green stretching to the horizon because it reminds you that you're stuck in a lifeless grey husk of a train. can't ride into the sunset and take life into your own hands because you're on tracks. and fuck me if the bartenders and waitresses can help you do something they aren't trained for in the slightest. plus, it isn't your job to rely on people.  that's life's cruellest trick, right? you haven't got a way out of it all. death is death so fight that with all your might, but you're so stuck in your ways that death is a preferable alternative to life. me personally, i wanna tear this train off the tracks and go full steam ahead into the hills but this pathetic lump of meat i'm saddled with means that just ain't an option. it empties when i need to write like my life depends on it, it torments me with images of people appearing before me that my brain is highly convinced is real, like i'm the last bit of sanity along for the ride in this schizophrenic nightmare death train.   how's your lumps of meat doing you? you all stuck on the train tracks of life and chugging along just like me, or have you managed to abandon ship and take a hike into god knows where? if you have then hell, best of wishes, you've done what hundreds of people probably never could've. you'll get to your destination eventually though, so just enjoy the journey. ;)

Last year i started going to therapy, this was a very big step for me. I posted a lot on this subreddit about having doubts about going to therapy and i felt like it wasnt going to help me at all and that i would have to live my life feeling miserable, empty and lonely. I felt so guilty for feeling this way and i felt like the world would just be better off without me.   This changed little by little over last year. Me and my therapist talked about my past, my living situation, my trauma, the unhealthy way i cope with situations. We talked about how my coping mechanism was needed for me to survive when i was at my lowest, but now, when i am trying to get better it was only standing in the way.   There was a healthy person inside of me but my situation and my past was crippling this person. I learned that i am not my depression. I am still not a 100% ''healthy'' and i cant be because of my living situation but i am working on it.  i believe i can become better now. And i hope all of you can too.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz8ynz/i_just_want_to_know/
Why is life so shitty?  Like... Even when I'm having a "good" day I end up being way too aware of the reality that this is it. There is nothing more than working and then dying. There is no big impact that I'll leave behind. There is no way to not die. There is no point to anything..  This is it.  We exist and then we die.  And what the fuck am I supposed to do in the meantime? I don't know how to be alone. I don't know how to settle shit from the past. I don't know how to be independently happy. I don't know how to push myself. I don't know how to be productive and successful. I don't know how to date. I don't know what a healthy relationship looks like. I don't know how to talk to anyone without questioning what exactly I'm saying as I'm saying it...  I'm so tired of not knowing.  I don't know who I am. I don't know if I'm good enough. I don't know what I should be doing.  I want there to be something.. but I'm so stuck on there being nothing.  Everytime I'm on my own I'm seconds from tears.. crying doesn't seem to help.. talking doesn't seem to help. No one ever actually sticks around... My closest friends live far away... And it's not like their available 24/7 to quell my consistent anxiety.  How are there people that are just happy? It seems unfair that some of us are plagued with the knowledge of our own nothingness yet others get to live a blissful existence.
This might seem blunt, but one piece of advice I can give (financially permitting of course), get a cat or a dog.
Everyone has unique traits in their unconscious - you just need to find them. It's hard not knowing who you are or what to feel, I've been there. What do you create in yourself that you can communicate to people?
I know what it's like when you just see nothing everywhere. You just need to find your creative energies and connect with things and people.
Others are happy because they have a goal/hobby or are still delusional. No one is supposed to know all the answers.
I resonate with all of this. I hope we can find meaning soon
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kze21c/picked_up_a_knife_i_didnt_like_it/
I want to just speak to someone who doesn't judge me
Then let's talk
There's so much I want to rant about I don't wanna die. I don't wanna kill myself. The thought just passed me and I instinctively picked up the knife. I'm getting tired now. I can't face everything together. I just want that simple life where I play video games all day and somehow survive on it. This is too much pressure to perform under. This is ridiculous. Almost as if there is a steel wall shoved right on to my face.
Do you have anyone to talk to? See a therapist at all? A lot of the time the pressures we feel are just in our heads and we tend to escape those thoughts with videogames or sex or stuff like that. If you don't wanna die then you just need to make sure that you talk about the pressures you feel and make sure they don't just get bottled up my guy.
My final year exams are in a month. Because of my idiocy during lockdown, I have a month to prepare for 9 subjects and I feel I'll fail some of them. Even then I just can't concentrate for 10 min straight. It either my phone or something else. I'm not even playing video games. I feel like I have given up already. Even if I at all study, I can't retain it for more than a few days.  Right after this exam, I have a year of internship which is mandatory. Followed by an entrance exam for postgraduate. My dad retires this November and so it is imperative that I get into postgraduate in the first attempt itself. I feel ashamed already asking them for money when in reality at my age I should be giving them back.  I have destroyed my family financial condition racking in a loan of $75k+ (educational) all by myself when my family income is barely 13k/ year and now it's half of it because of corona. I just can't die with all this burden on them.  My elder sister is basically a good for nothing piece of garbage who is just killing the home's happiness and peace.  My love life is pretty much dead. Well who will love this obese piece of broke shit with blind eyes.  I have a good female friend that I empty myself to. She has been distancing herself from me from the time dhe started dating someone.
So that's a lot. Let's go about this step by step. I would recommend trying for a study group, and I know it's really late but it's still better than nothing. A study group can help you keep your focus and also help you maintain your information better. Also if you have any you should look at turning any missing assignments in to make up as a possible crash pad. Next your next year post grad and internship. I would probably say that that stuff just needs to happen when it happens, no use in worrying about stuff that you can't even control right now. That's in the future and you just gotta worry about the here and now. As for your families financial situation is probably suggest searching for debt settlements and as many grants that you can to help ease that burden. Past that you don't need anyone unless you actually want someone in your love life. There are plenty good ways to live without a partner
Also I will be in covid wards for my internship next year which I don't really wanna do it (studying medicine)  There's no way to settle debt other than selling the house in which we live. The category of student I'm, there's absolutely no grants available for me. My country is plagued with reservation.  I'm actually feeling a sense  of confusion towards my friend I mentioned earlier. However, she has clearly said she is not interested in me months before she started dating her current. Why would she even like me. No one likes me. I'm just ugly.

I don’t have anyone else to talk to I I figured I’d write on here. I want to die every single day. Well I do but at the same time I don’t. I recently just lost the one man I ever truly loved because of my mental health and insecurities. I also feel like he never really cared for me anyways and on top of that I was pregnant and no longer am so I feel like I’ve lost everything I truly cared about. I’ve been crying for days and I can’t get it together. I think about killing my self everyday but I’m too weak to actually do it. At the same time I just wish he would pull me out of it but I know he isn’t. I feel like my life has no purpose and that I’ll never feel better again and that I’ll never be able to really get over him and get over losing my baby. I hate life and I don’t know how to pull myself up out of this hole I’m in anymore.
Hey I understand exactly how you feel. If you ever need someone to talk or vent to I'll be here. It's nice to know sometimes that you aren't completely alone <3
Thank you so much!

I have very little energy for the day by default, but I found that talking with someone quickly drains me and depletes whatever energy i do have. After just a little while i feel like I can barely talk anymore, i feel literally like I'm losing air and then i basically have to force myself to speak. Oh well.
Most people yes. Once in a long while I'll meet someone where talking to them has the opposite effect on me. It seems like they're people who are wired similar to the way I am. But most people always feel like they have minds that are like a big heavy blunt instrument and talking to them is like getting beaten over the head with it. Or drowning or something. Losing air is a really good way to put it. I'm sorry people wear you out too. I hope you find a way out of the hole:/
**you got tired? I don't feel interested talking to them. While talking, in between my thoughts interferes everytime**
THIS POST!!! I have been a bartender for 7 years and my anxiety and depression have only worsened. It takes ALL of my energy to prepare myself to put a mask on and pretend I like socializing with my customers. I don’t. It exhausts me. I had to move back in with my dad for a bit bc of Covid, and I would get so angry if he would speak to me in the mornings before work, or when I got home. He doesn’t understand that I just had to use every bit of energy I had to make it through the day, I do not want to have to speak to someone when I don’t absolutely HAVE to!
Yes, so exhausted. I just want to hide in bed under a thousand blankets and never come out.
if i talk to people for a long time i feel really tired the rest of the day
You my friend are an introvert, this is an introvert thing, it happens to me as well. never force a conversation, I always let people know that I need some time alone atm.
Yeah I even find this with texting people, I just can’t keep myself interested and it feels exhausting
While I genuinely want to reach out to others and speak with more people, it’s incredibly tiring. No matter how much caffeine I take, no matter how well rested I am, almost all social interactions are terribly draining and only leave me with the realization that I’ll never truly connect with and understand someone at their deepest levels.
Almost instantly!  I feel like people usually talk on and on about stuff that isn't a big deal. I try to be respectful but it only goes so far..
Yes. I cant take it. Forming sentences and paying attention to know what the person is talking about so I dont look like an asshole is exhausting. I feel like such a failure that I can't even talk with other people
Yes.  Sorry I have to go. Work. Nice conversation btw
Take what you just said and apply it to every talk you have and think everyone hates you . That’s what social anxiety is like :(
yes , because even for "normal" people who are introverts it is taxing already , if you add to it the fact that you usually need to pretend that everything is fine ... then yeah your battery will drain real fast ... if you ever tried improv theater/comedy you will know what i mean ... also depression makes everything harder as you pointed out ... therefore the marriage of all these variables lead to rapid tiredness
All the time, excluding my friends. I also get exhausted from someone just talking too much to me. I could say three words and completely ignore them but as they continue to talk, I just get more tired and irritated.
I have this thing where when I become uncomfortable or feel done with the conversation I then avoid eye contact I only realised this recently and have no idea how or when I began to shut communication down this way I still talk n continue but avoid the eye contact after some time it's not out of rudeness more like a paranoid reaction.
i one hundred percent feel the same. After a few minutes i notice myself drifting.
Actually i am being like dat too bcs idgaf to their life
I’m usually doing really well too.    But there’s always that point where I just stop caring and feel like walking away
Only if it’s really interesting, haven’t seen them in a long time, or something else.
Yeah I do feel same but I do like a good combo sometimes but I rather just keep to myself.
all the ti---
r/introvert
I get tired of myself. If - on the rare occasion - I end up in a long conversation with someone then I tend to think they’re getting bored and look to close it off.   Long conversations are particularly draining for me as a result.
Most people. There's only maybe two or three people in my life whom I never get tired of talking to but sometimes it's just exhausting trying to explain certain things to them and I just disconnect myself..
What surprises me is what triggers it? For me it doesn’t happen all the time. Two to three sentences into conversation fatigue hits me brain fog, shortness of breath, total anxiety. To a point where I just blurt some non sense out just to end the conversation. Then when I feel like I have something to say I don’t, in fear I’ll either freeze up or just fade out
The very definition of being introverted! There’s nothing wrong with you. Just be sure you top up your energy with lots of healing alone time.  EDIT: I don’t mean to sound dismissive or minimising when I say ‘there’s nothing wrong with you’. Just want to reassure that you’re not weird or unwell or wrong for this trait - just introverted!
Yes, and it's common, I don't really understand it myself. I live alone, no friends, no family really so I am not used to talking to people     I made a friend yesterday, this ex Army dude that has PTSD and most of the same issues I have. I hope I can cultivate the friendship into something, I probably had not had a conversation with a new person for over a year before this happened yesteray     I was there for about an hour, wore me out. I was done by the time I got home. It's something about spending a lot of time alone I think
Yes. I’m introverted and once told my mother that I needed some time to ‘recharge my social battery’, she tutted and said that isn’t real... sure feels real.
I get tired from talking, thinking and from being awake. Sigh
🙋‍♀️
Yes my family if I have to explain something more than once I get very winded and agitated.
I always say that my social battery has run out, I can only deal with people so much until I get tired of it and it starts to make me uncomfortable. But I also really enjoy my own time and space.
I have to force myself to talk, but unfortunately I end up being weird and boring, and they hate me. But with some people I get so energetic and talkative, but its very rare. I hate this, this is the most annoying thing about me, I mean I literally talk like a drunk person, and when people start to make fun of me I cant even defend myself because I'm extremely exhausted. What is the solution of it?
When I’m by myself I can stay up til 2am if I wanted to but the second I do anything with social interaction, I’m ready to call it quits and go to bed at like 8 pm. It so strange to me.
For me it’s like I older I get the less I wanna have something to do with People. The Problem is finding Nice / Friendly People you want to spend time with is hard. I often think many People are quite unsympathetic and there is something about them that is not appealing and I talk about their Personality. Also that many People are so Materialistic and Superficial is something I don’t like all they Talk about is what they Bought, wich events they visited (Concerts etc. at Least when there Events at Normal Times) about wich Restaurant or Bar they visited (Again when those things are open) and their Vacations (again Normal Times) You can clearly see that now where most of this stuff is shut down (at least in Europe) People have seem to loose their only Purpose in life (that is to Consume) but they still flex with the Past Vacations Past Events and Stuff they still buy but just Online now. The Problem is that it seems that this is all they talk about they not even Talkt about Music, Favorite Movies etc. just about consuming and themselves. It’s really hard finding someone who isn’t that Way these Days
I feel more like zone out when talking to people, is mean that’s tried as well?
Very much so especially when you have schizoid personality disorder and/or social anxiety
There are people who are fueled by socializing and then there are people who are drained by it.  doesn't necessarily mean they are introverted, many still enjoy socializing and need it, but can only handle it for so long.
I am generally a low energy person as well.  When I am out in a social situation that is meant to be leisure ie a party and not work, I feel like people around me at the event are just sucking the energy right out of me without even interacting with me.  Immediately when I return home I feel a sudden rush of energy return.  It's almost to the point where I regret leaving but I know if I go back or don't leave in the first place I will just return to that low energy yet anxious state.
No, I sometimes try to talk to people irl but get bored because it's always superficial stuff. Online with people I know I get ghosted into oblivion. Online with strangers it's ok but even then it's either superficial or with no interest in me. I'm honest about my life and I think people take a look at my personal posts and think "eww what an insane weirdo". Oh well.
Hell yeah! My social battery is pretty small
our social battery runs out n thats okayy
Depends on who. Close family and friends I am fine. Strangers are tiring.
I feel like that all the time.
Yep I get the same. Even worse is if it is something where we're joking around a lot, especially with someone who I don't normally have a strong bond with already, it's so stressy I get a huge stress headache in the back of my head, instantly. It's awful lol.
I'm always tired
Ye just like you my energy is very low (wasn’t always like that), but even though I like the person and there personality and have no issues with them, my energy is quickly drained and I just want to go back home or do something else in my own company which is how I reserve or gain my energy. But the instant I start talking to someone I’m completely done. I feel like I disappoint a lot of people because of this and they may feel like I’m avoiding spending time with them or don’t like them, but in reality I just don’t have the energy to be around you and not enough energy to share. It really sucks though as I’m hella depressed and don’t even feel comfortable talking to people in the first place which is dangerous af but I can’t help it. You’re not alone fam.
Omg YES.   Like too much social interaction wears me down haha
Yea, mostly when I can't focus or when I'm not being authentic. And of course if I force myself to interact with someone who I'd rather not interact with.
Social interactions drain me for a few days
Yes, sometimes I simply dont have the energy to talk. People get offended when I'm quiet so often feel the need to force myself though.
Yeah, this feels familiar and it's frustrating :(
For me it will be going alright till my brain decide to forget how to socialize and I suddenly realize 'shit this is real life'
yes all time time. if i don’t feel 100% comfortable around someone i am probably stressing out while hanging out with them. i’m not NT so the interactions i have with a lot of people are really stressful because of all of these weird ass social norms people have and abide by like it’s written into the stars. plus i can never really keep friends. so there’s this constant fear that one day i’m getting cross over into “too weird” “too annoying” “too...” and then i am going to lose my friends. and then on the flip side, because no one likes who i really am, i can never be vulnerable enough with people to form real bonds, and when ever i try it’s always weird. it makes depression 1000x worse because instead of convincing myself nobody is there for me, it’s actually the truth. and when i try to open up about it, i get told that’s it’s just depressive thoughts. when in actuality, there’s genuinely almost nobody i can trust or feel safe around (and the one person i do feel safe around lives 2000 miles away.) i’m really tired of this planet.
I have Aspergers as well as depression so it’s a mixture of not having the energy and not really understanding how to make a conversation flow. I cannot for the life of me understand how people can keep up a banter.   I see normal people talking and it’s like a LP spinning around smoothly. Idk how it works but it does. And as soon as I chime in it’s like literally falling out of the groove.   I’ve realized that most people are very unsophisticated and crude, so I don’t even think it’s necessarily me that’s the problem all the time. I don’t speak Moron so a combination of these factors leads to me not caring and trying to avoid conversations.
Yeah, a lot of people seem to have this "heavy", annoying, unpleasant and suffocating subhuman vibe that just depresses you even more. It's weird. They don't even have to say much, you just feel their shitty overbearing presence by being around them. They are usually assholes and shallow individuals, so I guess it makes sense. On the other hand, I do know some people that are actually pleasant to be around and interact with. They actually feel human and stimulating, unlike others.
Wow exactly, perfect description. I'm really lucky to have a best friend who I could talk to all day and still feel like I want her company more
I think the Problem is that Most People just Talk about what they Bought and other Superficial Lifestyle stuff I rather Talk to People who got More interests than Consumerism and going too Events. There is that Guy at my Work who always goes Fishing with his Parents and he Talks often about it. I personally don’t go Fishing but regardless it’s interesting when People talk about their interests and I mean real Interests even when ist not something you do it’s still more engaging than People who just talk about What they Bought last Week and their Vacations even when they talk about Vacations it isn’t interesting most of they time because instead of Talk about the Country they visited and the Interesting places there is mostly again about what they Bought there and that the Beach was nice. I think that’s because they don’t really care about the place they visiting or the Culture they just go there because there the Weather is Warm, a Beach is there, they can go out at the Evenings and of course they can go Shopping there
Dude yes. It has caused me to zone out every single time someone is talking to me. It's so bad. I don't do it to be rude, but it obviously comes off that way. I just cannot retain anything anyone says to me because it just goes in one ear and out the other.  My brain just has no interest in conversation whatsoever. I feel so inapt in basic social communication standards.
This
32 y/o serverboi here. Haven't had to move in with my parents yet but I'm kinda thankful for my job although I think its silly to have dine-in seating during a pandemic. I do like that I have an opportunity to get out of my house and speak with people, cause now that my roommates moved out its just me, my cat, and my lizard. I hate going into work and dealing with people that may or may not have covid and also people are generally rude and horrible. But at the same time I get a lot of regulars, see ALOT of familiar faces and its nice to a degree to see people come out and support us during this crazy time
This is also part of being naturally introverted. It doesny mean there's anything wrong with you. It also doesn't mean you'll never be able to connect with people, it just means that you need your alone time and prefer people in small doses, and there's nothing wrong with that. However, like another commenter said, even introverted people eventually find someone that doesn't tire them out. You'll find someone like that, just keep in mind that the amount you prefer to interact with people is okay. You get to be the way you are.
I don't know man, sometimes I think I wouldn't be like that (at least not to this degree) if I wouldn't be heavily depressed. But it's hard to say since I've been depressed for most of my life lol
I cut off a “friend” because that’s exactly how she made me feel. I realized I’m MUCH better alone in my room than when she’s around.
Yeah I don’t really know how to deal with that. I cut off the very few remaining friends I had left because of depression and other issues, and I have no emotional connection with anyone minus my mom. I’m incredibly isolated and alone, but I don’t feel any happier than when I talked to people before.
You did a great job describing people with the suffocating heaviness. I work with a lot of people like this and I swear I can feel them enter the break room just as much as I can hear them. They’re usually insecure bullshitters, drama queens or narcissistic types who like to force their presence on you.
Me for a year now. I don’t hear what people say.
Personally I don’t think there is any guarantee in life that you have to find a person to understand you on some deep levels. I also feel like connecting with people in small doses is the opposite. For example in 2020 I met with one person irl one time who was not my coworker or mom/dad. It was a pretty small dose of interaction but the smaller and more infrequent interactions get the more isolated and removed from society I feel. The more alone time I get the deeper I slip into mental illness and the probability I’ll fully crawl out gets smaller and smaller.
Yeah, that’s fair. I hear that. Depression just saps the energy doesn’t it. Trying to pretend you’re fine in conversation takes it out of you.   Either way, taking that time to be alone and recharge on your own terms sounds like it will be helpful.   Sorry to hear you’re struggling. Sending you good vibes.
Can't agree more. A friend of mine is the same way. Can't stand mere than 2hours without getting exhausted.

My husband and I have been separated for about a month. The separation was civil and nothing nasty or shady happened.   My husband has been going through a really bad depression for about 2 years now and when I saw him last week he seems to be doing worst. He is now even taking unprescribed adderall to help him get through the days.   He has recently made a lot of remarks about suicide about how hes been thinking a lot about it and him being scared, but has assured me he wouldn't go through with it but idk. I cant help him anymore so I don't know if I should mention to his parents what hes going through to see if they can help him. I have a good relationship with his parents and I'm positive that if they knew they would do everything to help him.  Should I talk to his parents about it or should I keep it quiet?
If you have the concern he may actually take his life I highly recommend talking to his parents

Why can’t I get hard? I don’t understand why depression affects libido so much. I literally lay in bed and nothing will turn me on. I don’t get an erection. Only thing that gets me going is my girlfriend but I need a lot of foreplay and everything to achieve an erection that isn’t even that firm. I don’t know what to do. I already got checked and have no physical issues. Did someone else experience this? How did you overcome it? I have no desire in sex 95% of the time and it’s making me even more depressed.
You have two modes of operation. Pleasure mode and problem solving mode.  When you sit there and expect yourself to get hard, you are in no way in the pleasure mode. Even if you have your girlfriend there doing her magic, if you go "y u no hard now" and get into the stress of overanalytical problem solving mode, then the pleasure mode goes away, because your body thinks "ok, there's some more pressing issue here now, have to work on that first".  What helps is to realize that, meh, if it happens, it happens. Whatever. It's not the end of the world and she's not gonna hate you and there is especially no reason for you to hate yourself or try to force yourself to get hard just to prove you can do it. That's a recipe for disaster. Let it go man. If it doesn't wanna work now, leave it. Go play a game, or watch tv, or best of all, do some sport instead.  Sports btw is something to help both clear your mind and get the right hormones flowing through your body AFAIK. So it's a win whatever the reason you do it.  If it affects your sex life, talk to your girl. The sooner you are able to talk about this with her, the sooner your problem might be solved. Depends on her character, but most probably she'll not judge, she'll try to understand and help.
We already talked a lot about this. She knows everything. I had problems at the beginning where I had zero erections, now it’s better but still have some problems which really bother me. I will try with the rest though, thanks man!

I'm a 20(F) y/o junior in college about to enter my second semester and I feel like I haven't experienced the joy of college that many talk about. I transferred to my current college last year and found that I've barely made any friends. I have one of my best friends from home who goes to the same school as me but I want to expand myself. I'm in so many clubs, I even hold board positions in some of them. I feel like I'm doing everything that people tell you to do to make friends yet I feel like I barely have any. I'm currently struggling to find a place to live for my senior year and I desperately want a good roommate. I've had really bad roommates in the past because of random selection. I actually live in a single dorm right now because my roommate from last semester was horrible. I seriously dont want to live alone next year. I feel so lonely in college and everyone has friends around me or people to live with. what did i do wrong? how did i mess up college? i dont know what to do anymore...
my friends and also myself were talking on the other day about college hype  We (5 people)all experienced that expectation and reality were very different and somehow also disappointing  None of us was the type people will flock to nor popular during high school and we all got to know each other a few years after college but now we have become a tiny group that support and understand one another.   For myself, I was in many activity clubs and also went to parties and all that but I also felt rather alone. Til today I don’t really keep in touch with any college acquaintances at all. The 5 close friends I have now, life threw them at me at different times of my life after and outside of college. I’m also happy and really appreciate their friendship. All in all quality is better than quantity.   Maybe it’s also about you clicking and feeling connected with people around you and not just about whether they would like to be connected to you or not.  IMO I don’t think there’s any thing wrong with not fitting the conventional vibes and values in college today. You might find friendship in other environments be patient with your progress.    *virtual hug*
I’m not sure if this will help you feel better, but I think your experience is far more common than you think. The days of enjoying college ended with our parents’ generation. For most of the people I know in our age group (I just graduated last December), college was the worst time of our lives. I felt the same way you do, I didn’t understand why I had only one friend when I pushed myself to be really active in extracurriculars. Just know that you’re not doing anything wrong and it’s not your fault. I wish I had something cheerier to say, but this is just how things are now. All we can do is try our best to remain open to new people and cherish the quality relationships we do have in the meantime. Hoping your pain eases soon <3

I wish I had a different life I'm 13 years old with a abusive family I already cut myself I've stopped doing the one thing that makes me happy games stopped talking to my friends except one who's got my back always my family feels like strangers to me I always think the same thing it will get better it's been 3 years I thought this is the year but it's still the same
Keep waiting man. I know it's miserable, trust me, I had a shitty home life too, but once you're an adult and able to live on your own, life can improve so much. It doesn't *automatically* improve, but the possibility is there, you know? It's hope.

I am 38 year old male. Been depressed for a long time, only figured that out and started trying to treat myself over the last five years. Was very desperate and had a lot of suicidal ideation when I started taking medication (buproprion) regularly about a year ago. I no longer have serious ideation or thoughts of suicide. That's a win. However I don't seem to feel or want to do anything ever all the time. Over the years I lost interest in all my hobbies. I look at things that used to excite me or at least command interest, now I can't be bothered to pick them up. There is a thick layer of dust on my kettlebells. Everything makes me angry. Everything feels a 100 ton burden. I go months at a time without cleaning. I no longer have the discipline to do anything physical and my body is starting to hurt most of the time, so I smoke/eat a fuckton of dope and it did help at first but I've abused it - because of course I did- so I spend most of my waking hours hating myself and seeking distraction, waiting for the day to end.   I'm stuck. I don't know what to do because I have zero confidence I will be able to execute any plan no matter how modest. Any suggestions?   Thanks for reading.
Hi. I'm sorry about the anger and how hard it is to try to do things. Really glad you're not thinking seriously about suicide these days though. I don't have any solutions, but just going to throw some thoughts out there.  The first one is that for whatever reason you're going through this, it sounds really hard. I would think that the first step might be to try to acknowledge that and at very least cut yourself a break on whatever judgment you're adding to the rest of the difficulties going on (as in, trying to let up on the self-hatred, to whatever degree that might be possible. Even just thinking about making an effort in that direction might be worthwhile, I would think.)  Next, idk, when I'm having a really tough time getting myself to do even the simplest things, I notice a couple things. One is that if I have a tiny bit of motivation/energy/whatever, it's often just barely enough to move me the smallest amount, and it's insanely fleeting. So I can't really afford to spend any energy thinking about what I might do. And sometimes I find that I don't always have the kind of focus necessary to think of what to do at the same time that I have energy to actually do anything, so there's a coordination/timing problem. My way of dealing with that is to make a list, on paper, of things I could do if I had even just a little bit of energy. This is \*not\* a to do list. It's just options, that I can scan through like a menu, if I want to do something. And you've got to make them super non-threatening. Wash one dish. Do one rep of a light exercise. Put one thing away. That sort of thing. Of course if you go to do it and find yourself sufficiently engaged, you're free to do more, but it's totally not any kind of requirement. So then when and if you feel able you can look through there and see if there's anything you're up for trying.  I have to stress that I don't really know if any of this will be of use to you, but sometimes I think that hearing from someone can just be way better than not hearing from anyone, plus I needed some interaction, so I decided to try to come up with something.  The weed. Yeah, I guess it's pretty notorious for killing motivation, right? But it sounds like you were getting some benefit out of it so it'd probably be hard to get away from that (also because everything is so hard right now) so idk, I'm wondering if a tiny bit of tapering off of that might be possible, maybe if you tried to detour yourself into looking at the list of "doing things options" once in a while when you're about to reach for an edible/joint/bong/whatever.  Telling you this for no reason, but I'm laughing at myself, because it took me a second read to realize that kettlebells was not a euphemism.  I hope you can make your way through some of this!
Maybe this is a dumb response from me but whenever I feel shite I just think about nature and how beautiful it is. Like watching a video or walking around outside I think how it'll never expect anything from me and I don't need to expect anything from it. If you're feeling completely disconnected from anything that might bring you joy then just stopping and enjoying the natural world might help even for a few minutes. Sorry if it's not much help, hope you find happiness soon mate.
Well honestly i don't feel entitled to tell someone who is more than 2x older than i am what to do. I've never been on any medications so i have no idea how it truly feels like. I can only offer you things that have helped me and i hope that can help you. Starting off, for me I think it was always about the pride and hating myself for not being good enough either for me or for others. I'm to this day really worried about my future, finding employment and being financially stable as i have no actually skills other than soft skills. For the lack of belief in myself and feeling like I'm not enough, I do things that make me feel proud of myself like giving up on my addictions or doing something good for someone else. One of my favorite activities was reading books, now days i lean more  towards playing games and just wasting time on PC but I used to read a shit ton of books every day and it was great. I tried to pick up a lot of hobbies along the way but i couldn't manage to stick to them for longer than few days. The only thing that clicked for me are workouts but I'm not that consistent as i wish I was. Fixing my diet also helped quite a lot, i transitioned from eating mostly bread and sandwiches to more meat based diet and i must say that I'm quite surprised but my stomach aches passed and i feel better in my everyday life. But don't force any strict diet like keto at the beginning, it will make you dislike food. Try smth that tastes good and it's healthy at the same time. Try a different sport if you don't want to use weights, maybe consider calisthenics or running.  Also find one thing you enjoy doing, it doesn't have to be anything that you can make profit from or something others will consider a hobby. Just something that makes you feel good. I would also suggest giving up on addictions like porn ( i am 16 and I've been addicted to porn for more than 7 years now) or smoking. Important thing about giving up addictions or actually about changing your life is to make one step at the time. Don't try to quit smoking while giving up on porn and changing diet at the same time. Pick one thing to u want to change and stick to it. If u can handle this for some time make another step. That's pretty much everything from me, i hope u will find at least something that I've said helpful. I hope you get better. Peace
Thanks for the replies

im a fat teen with no mom no friends and a ugly face
None of that is "fact". Look, there's so much more to life that just looks and body type.  Right now it may seem a bit difficult. But it can get better. Have you considered joining some clubs in your area to try and make some friends?  What happened with your mother?
well she is an addict and she abused me for 9 years at 9 my mom was killing me and killing herself but my dad had enough and he packed our stuff and we left i was really sad because that home is the place were i grew up and i have had depression for 10 years but in the start i had no therapy but now i do and i dont live with my mom anymore i go to see her everyother weekend but not anymore she  kicked me out
I'm so sorry to hear that about your mother. That should never have happened. I'm glad you are going to therapy. You should never have been put in this position.
thank you so much

I just need some love right now. I’m feeling very alone and dealing with a lot of self hatred today. Any words of love and support will be meaningful... even from strangers online ❤️ I am committed to living a beautiful life. No matter how hard it feels today. nothing is fixed.
I love you, keep pressing on. Things can't stay bad forever. You'll succeed
I don't know you. But I know what you are saying, which makes it easy for me to say I love you. I appreciate you for speaking up because your in a dark place. Keep your head up, whatever it is your going through
I can tell you now you are much more amazing than you realise. You are incredible, awesome and a great person! You are clearly far too hard on yourself and you deserve to treat yourself better! Never forget that you are a truly unique and important person... No matter how you feel about yourself of how others treat you :) Stay strong!
You’re strong and brave. Standing up against the harsh conditions we’re living in head on. I love you, you’re amazing!
Sending you lots of positive vibes and love whoever you are :) In the eternal words of BoB: Every little thing, is gonna be alright ;)
I love you back. Thank you.
Thank you for your reassurance, it means more than you know.
This means so much to me. Thank you, I love you.

To me, it's a terrible hopelessness. Also, anhedonia (unable to experience any joy). My depression was so severe that I developed psychotic symptoms.. But hopelessness and low mood are killing me...
Worst thing for me is that it makes mr realize that the times where I do feel happy are just an illusion. Life is actually sad, bleak, tragic, ridiculous, unfair, and mostly shit. The emotion of happiness is just a distraction from that.

I feel so disconnected from my friends and don't feel close to any of them and I feel like the reason is because I'm not good enough. I feel so inadequate. I constantly feel like I love my friends more than they like me.
I know that feeling pretty well. As far as I am concerned that can be a side effect of depression and it might just seem like giving in those friendships is unbalanced.  Have you talked with your friends about that particular topic? That did it for me. My friends were able to adapt on that. At least a bit.  For me because my friends are the only support I really value at the end of the day, I give them all the love I can offer. It is the only thing giving me some slight joy. So I love wihtout getting the same amount of love back. Love is selfless for me. Even, if that might hurt.
Nobody ever messages me first and I'm always worried I'll smother them. This pandemic doesn't help either. I have a very hard time feeling connected to my friends if I can't hang in person, I only have one friend who's down to hang in person but their schedule is irregular. I've tried to set up video chats with friends but it always ends up falling through and never ends up happening. I really want more than just having a group of friends. I want more intimate one on one friendships because that's how I feel the most connected to my friends but a lot of my friends aren't comfortable hanging one on one.
I totally get how you feel, cause it is not too different of a situation for me. But there is not much you can do. Either your friends are no real friends and keep you on distance on purpose or they need that distance themselves. It is sad, but als true, that not everyone is ready or capable of upholding a friendship in such an intimacy, while not beeing able to meet up.  For me you seem to be type, who really cares for their friends. So I dont think, that your true friends will fail you for too long, cause they should know what they got on you.  One factor also could be: How long do you know these friends? Depending on that they just might need more time to open up and start a more initmate friendship than. Don't rush them in that case. Elsewise you are doing good in trying to engage them and organize "meet ups".An intense friendship needs a lot of time and even than it still might feel like not intense enough.
I've had such a hard time maintaining a lot of my friendships because of this pandemic. I just can't feel close to my friends if I can't hang in person or have consistent communication. Even then, chatting can only do so much, I wanna do activities with my friends because thats how I bond with my friends the most. It's hard to feel close to my friends when I always hang with them in a group. I've had friends who I would only hang one on one and I've felt way closer to those friends in the past but I haven't been able to hang with them.
Sadly that is one of the side effects of the lockdown. I know that just chatting or even video calls aren't the same, but it is at least something. I would try to keep that up as a minimum.   You mentioned one irregular friend to hang with. Can you ask him/her to please come over? You could tell that you need that rn and he/she should be in need of company as well, cause of the pandemic.
I'm trying to set something up with him this week but nothing is concrete yet.
Hope you will be able to meet him :)

I'm 22, I suffered of anorexia from the age of 18 to 20-21. Because of that, i didn't enjoy my college years and i didn't do the studies i wanted (medecine), my mental health was way too brittle to handle the pressure of these studies.  So i'm now doing my last year of studies (after 5 years), that i don't like at all, i'm feeling useless and i feel like I screwed up my entire life to come because i won't be able to do the work I want. I also want to do another master degree which i'll have more interest for, but i think that i'll be disappoint anyway  i'm afraid of death and i can't stop thinking about this last week, like I'm going to die having done nothing with my life. The covid situation does not help, i can't travel, i can't see my friends etc. The only person I see other than my parents and my boyfriend  I feel useless and I find that life is meaningless. We are all going to die one day and I feel like I'm wasting my time doing anything since the end is the same: death  I don't know what to do to recover my naivety without spending my days thinking about death, i don't know why it came suddenly in my mind like that but i'm not enjoying my time this past week  (sorry if my post is not appropriate in this category, i dont think i am depressed but i dont know where to post this)

I'm sorry in advance for what's probably going to be a long post like a lot of other people, but...well let me just tell you. It's also my first ever big post I've made probably anywhere on the internet so please bear with me lol.  So I lost my job as a childcare teacher in March due to the pandemic, but the center re-opened again in mid June but unfortunately corporate was forced to make layoffs due to our low numbers of children so I was let go at the end of July after barely even working decent hours during that time.  The dreaded job search started again and it was not fun at all, after filling out numerous applications for different places I would get calls/emails back with employers wanting to set up interviews, but when it would come time for me to have the interview I would get ghosted either by them not going through with the interview or having the interview and then not receiving a call back informing me on whether or not I received the job. So that was a huge disappointment and my self-esteem took a huge hit.  December 20th is extremely hard for me because I lost my older sister in a terrible car accident and this year marked 5 years that she has been gone. And I have been struggling to accept the fact that she is really gone because for some ungodly reason it has taken her ex husband 5 years to get her a headstone so I never really had that closure. But thanks to my youngest sister taking over the responsibility she finally has a headstone. Thanks to my boyfriend I was able to go to the cemetery and see the headstone and get the closure that I needed to reassure me that even though my sister is gone she is finally at peace.  January is also extremely tough because the 16th is my late sister's birthday and I miss not having her here to celebrate. But I was able to purchase a tiny cake from the store and video chatted with my older sister and we sang happy birthday and will continue to keep our sister's memory alive, especially for her children my beautiful niece and nephew.  My boyfriend's dad unfortunately was diagnosed with stage 3 esophageal as well as early thyroid cancer, and I'm deeply saddened by it because I happen to have a significantly better relationship with him than with my own dad (but I'm trying to work on fixing my relationship with my dad). Thankfully he is improving and will one day soon be CANCER FREE we can only hope.  Then covid hit my family my mom got diagnosed with it and has been isolated and depressed at home whereas I've been living with my boyfriend for about a year now. Thankfully her symptoms are not as severe as my dad's which I'm going to mention below. I try to talk to her a few times a day whether it be voice or facetime, so I can get an update on what the doctors are saying about my dad and just so we can hopefully make each other feel better or one of us just end up crying a lot. I also try to drop things off for her if she's in need of things.  My dad has been in the ICU going on 15 days now due to COVID. He had a pacemaker put in a few years ago after having several heart surgeries, ablations (when they burn heart tissue to control the rhythm)and zapping of his heart. It doesn't help the situation that he is 70 years old so both his age and having an underlying health condition has greatly increased his chances of dying with COVID. They also found a blood clot on his kidneys, and then on top of that he also managed to pick up pneumonia which was caused in part by fluid build up around his lungs.   He has been on a ventilator nearly the entire time he has been in the hospital. They performed a tracheotomy to allow them to remove the intubation because the longer they do it that way the higher his risk of infection will be. To top it off, they also had to install a feeding tube.   He is slowly improving his kidneys and other organs are functioning properly which is a good sign, his heart is surprisingly under control through all of this although he did have a little irregular heart rhythm which they were able to fix with medication.  But then again it's gotten worse in one way as he is no longer in the medically induced coma but is still really out of it, and is in a semi-conscious state. I was able to have a one way video chat with him the other night and I don't know if this was a coincidence or not but earlier that day I was told that he can't move his arms and legs but when he heard my voice he started moving them slightly which hopefully meant he was at least aware of my voice.   Unfortunately being in this semi-conscious state he's slightly aware of the trache and we're told that he is starting to become agitated and has been trying to remove it so much that the nurses were forced to put him in restraints, but for some reason are taking forever to give him some sort of medication to calm him down and keep him comfortable.   Before and during all of this I finally found a job after my long search and started right in the middle of the worst of all this. I was given an amazing recruiter who after telling him what was happening at home he was trying to help get my start date pushed back 2 weeks, but it was shut down by a third party HR rep who is not known for her generosity as I later found out.    What is even worse is that when I started everyone was actually under the impression that I would have been starting two weeks later, so they had to figure out what was going on and that officially became my first day.   After receiving a call from my mom with an update on my dad earlier this week (which I was able to answer thanks to my boss who has been very understanding) one of the guys from HR had noticed that I was crying. He asked if I was okay and I tried to downplay it, but he could tell something was off so I explained to him what I had going on at home and he generously allowed me to go home and take some time to handle all of this. As a bonus they also paid me for those two days, which normally wouldn't happen because I'm a temp there.   I'm incredibly thankful but I am still worried about how I am going to perform when I return to work because I am still in my training process and I was messing up a good bit due to how distracting my problems have been.   It's even more difficult for me because of lapsed bipolar meds due to being unemployed and unable to afford my appointments. I'm back on them now thank god but it still has to build back up in my system and I've been an absolute mess crying god knows how many times. Sometimes instead being an extremely angry nightmare for my boyfriend who has been the victim of my lashing out which I never mean and I feel absolutely terrible for doing it to him.    He has been extremely patient with me and trying to suggest things to help me relax and I often never want to do anything lately or have the energy. And when we try to play a video game or something I end up getting so frustrated that I will either quit or find some reason to start a fight with him making me feel terrible. He does understand me though as he has been suffering from depression himself for years.   So in the end things are technically better then they were like a week ago, but the combined weight of everything makes it feel almost like it's actually getting worse despite the improvements.   That was probably a lot to take in, but I just needed to get it off my chest and writing it has definitely helped. I'm also not very good at writing so my boyfriend helped proofread for me and fix most of the mistakes I made. Thank you so much if you read this.
You're good to get it all out there, listing the pain one by one like this. You're doing strongly to keep on through all of this.
Thank you so much for the encouragement and I hope things are good for you also.

I feel helpless, It’s like this thing Addiction I have to this I controlling me. I was self harm free for a year until today and I just feel awful about it, I feel so guilty. I just want to be able to make it though a day without crying because my mind wants me to hurt myself. Having depression is the worst thing in the world, I just want to feel good about myself and not self harm.
Same I was clean until today I wish I could get better this fucking sucks the entire thing is a paradox because my depression is directly causing me to not get better and get proper help. This shit sucks
Yeah I have the same problem I want to get help but I also don’t want to be help idk it’s a confusing way of thinking

I started to feel better now , but my feelings are very fragile now , one little bad word and my depression starts over again.I still think about suicide sometimes , but not that much.One of my teacher saw that something is wrong with me , but she didn’t asked me that much, she just aksed that am i okay.I answered what i usually answer to these kind of questions, “Yeah , im ok”. Its hard hiding something like this.
Hey so - you don't have to hide jt :) and firstly - we'll done on feeling better!  I hate to say this but getting better from depression isn't as simple as - poof it's gone! Sadly =( you'll have good days, and you'll have bad days. The hope is that the bad days and spread further and further apart.
I know that it will never go away, but its progress feeling better a little.And the reason I’m hiding it is complicated.

My severe insecurities, body dysmorphia, social anxiety, unproductivity, and so on. It feels I've always had severe depression since I was 13 and those problems I mentioned are some of the causes that continues being perpetuated as I have gotten more depressed. But deep inside me I am self-aware that I can probably really help myself a little bit if I take the first steps. Then it hits me as I sit here all alone in a pandemic for 10 months that I truly have no support system. No friends, relationships ever and a family thousands of kilometres away. Completely alone. I know people who are depressed, but many of them do have a support system. I know a person who has been more public about their depression and they have gotten so much love and support. I'm not putting them down, I applaud them for being so brave. But I don't have anyone and I know even if I am more public about it, I'll only receive indifference or at worst further isolation. It honestly hurts and I have always thought that I have some sort of 'repulsive' aura that makes people naturally distance themselves from me. Now I know that a lot of depressed people are surrounded by people but still are severely depressed and they don't help all the time. But the point is I wouldn't know since I have never experienced such a thing, no 'you can do this' or 'we're here for you' ever. It's things like this that makes me feel utterly ashamed of admitting to anyone I am depressed or seek therapy. It makes me think, even if I do get better, then what? There's no point and noone waiting for me. Anyway, that's the short gist of it from a narrow angle. It's 6 AM here and just felt I needed to get something out.
I believe in you! If you feel better you’re probably attracting more people along the way.
I'm not entirely sure about that but thank you for the words of encouragement
Yeah you’re not sure about that right now, because you’re in a state of negativity. But the more you like yourself, the more you open op to other people. Subconsciously, if you’re afraid of rejection, its very likely that you’re building a wall around yourself.

We’re all going to be okay bambino’s. This illness is a cunt and we will beat it.
Kick it in the dick yall
Yes we will bro fk this bitch!!
There isn't much hope for me since I've been diagnosed with treatment-resistant major depression and have been hospitalized 4 times for attempted suicide. I'm running out of options for help.
This is inspirational
Reminds me of something a wise man once said:  "When you fall off that horse, you get right back up, and you eat that horse!"
Microdosing helps a ton. I suggest you do your own research though.
I used to think the same way but when you’ve been telling yourself that for 5 years straight an no improvement I am finding that hard to believe
One day, we will look back and say: We did.  And laugh like we always did before it. My head is up
Actually there is a discussion about whether depression is illness at all. There is theory that it is another evolution mechanism.
Sounds like you need to try upper level treatments next. I'm sure you've done DBT, therapy, in patient stays, psychiatry, etc.  The next steps would be perhaps ketamine infusion clinics, mushroom retreats, or even as a last resort, ECST.  Look into them, people have some miraculous comebacks with ketamine and mushrooms. Professionally administered, of course, absolutely.
[removed]
it can do. it didn’t for me. i had no luck with any drug-related treatment i’ve tried, as of yet (ketamine; acid). i have yet to major-dose mushrooms or do the MDMA PTSD thing, though. may be doing the latter, soon.
I wonder if that's just placebo
Are there any serious adverse effects with ketamine or shrooms? I'm kinda scared to try them.
Not sure what you mean with the 1st question, but with the second question, just being awake is brutal for me. No matter what I do, work, school, exercise, relaxing, I feel miserable all the time. I've failed more than 10 medications which is how I think I got the diagnosis. I've been hospitalized 4 times for suicide attempts.
I don't think you should ask this in this subreddit... Might give people ideas...
I don't think so, but like i said you'll have to do your own research and decide for yourself.
I have tried ketamine and acid (not at the same time and once at the same time) and didn’t know at the time about the mental benefits at the time I tried them, but had extreeeeemely positive results from them. To describe each effect for me personally:   Ketamine made me feel extremely emotionally safe and whole, felt safe to be emotionally vulnerable to others, and had an inner dialogue running as well that helped me realize that my depression was only type of reality and I could adjust things to make a new reality. Acid did make me a little anxious, but it broadened my mental avenues (let’s say you come to a crossroads and there are 3 ways you could go, acid makes you see the other 8 that you’re normally too distracted to notice), basically taking your creativity levels to a much stronger level. The acid also helped me deal with some huge “what if” mental spirals since acid usually keeps you on the mental you’re on unless you can distract yourself, so the social anxiety and depression spirals I normally felt, the acid made me get to the end of that inner “conversation” and at the end realized everything would actually be okay. My personal favorite was mixing the two, because you can find new mental avenues using the acid and the ketamine makes you feel safe during the whole process. Each experience led to a lasting results of a few months or a few years, depending on which particular time.    Hope this helps!

This helps a lot thanks! Do you know how difficult it is to get prescribed these methods in the US?

No need to respond to this guy anymore... based on all the other comments he is making he is clearly just trolling everyone.
First time was trying to hang myself. 2nd was suffocation by plastic. 3rd and 4th time were attempted overdoses.
i wonder if yelling insults at people in a thread about depression is such a considerate thing to do?
I didn’t say I tripped on it

Mom came in before completion
exclamation mark indicates it.
As I said in the post, I was describing the experiences that I had, and explaining what they did to me. I didn’t do them as a clinical means, I had those experiences recreationally and those were the surprised but extremely positive outcomes I had from them.   Maybe focus on me sharing my experiences to help someone looking for answers, instead of assuming you know the dosage and my experience and situation and history, and judging people inside a post where people deal with isolation....
[removed]
I wasn't able to begin hanging myself, I just set everything up before she came in. But the bag, I was close to suffocation when she stopped me.
[removed]
Umm, yeah I suppose. I hope you're not asking to get any ideas, because I'd strongly suggest getting help if you're thinking about it
[removed]
Please, please don't do that. I see from your account that you're a dad and your kids would be absolutely devastated to lose you. Reach out to friends, family, and doctors for help because even if they can't cure you, they can still provide some help.

I've had enough.  This world has nothing to offer anymore.  I'm drunk now, maybe I won't feel the pain when I slit my throat.  No need to leave a suicide note, no one cares plain and simple
Dont you dare do it! I care about you!
God has a plan for you, and he loves you very much. At least wait until you're sober. Please don't do it! You have so much to live for!
There is nothing worth living for anymore honestly... just emptiness and despair
Like what? Going down to CO and finding out someone was just being friendly and they don't have feelings for me? Letting my mother and sister try to use any slight concern be the reason they control me and my lifestyle? To let my roommate act as if I don't exist?  Man those all sound like great fun
A better time will come, I am sure of it. It can be difficult to see now, but it actually gets better.

Venting  6 months ago I tried to kill myself but I wasn't able to go through with it.  Since then I'm even more disappointed of myself. I had my chance and I wasted it and I should have done it   Just needed to say it somewhere. I don't really have people close to me I can talk to about it and keeping it in makes me feel even worse so I decided to vent here
I know how it feels. I still have days when I think that I fucked it up back then.
Just want to say thanks to everyone whot took the time read this post
I want to believe that it'll get better someday but honestly I'm not so sure   I hope that at least for you it will get better  And thanks for reading
It didn't get better, it got even worse. But I managed to adapt to it, at least partly. Life is suffering, the world is a shit hole, happiness is just the temporary inability to see how things really are, that kind of mindset. It helps.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzm564/good_friend_ditched_me/
Hey so I don’t have a lot of friends. There’s only 2 people that I text: my boyfriend and my friend who we’ll call Luke. I met Luke a while ago before I met my boyfriend. We met on a dating app and hung out but there was never a spark but we became close friends. He got a girlfriend recently and he said that we have to stop being friends. I’m really heartbroken. He threw our entire friendship away for a girl he barely knows. He was always really fun to talk to and we would send each other memes throughout the day that we thought the other would like. Now besides my bf, I have no one to talk to.  I’m really sad about this. My depression has been getting worse and I’ve been dealing with some drama with my family as well as some health issues. This feels like another blow to a year that has been awful so far. I feel so alone, I know I have my boyfriend but I have no other friends to talk to. I feel horrible.
I guess you eventually get used to not having people to talk to, that's depressing but it happens..
Look your talking to people. People care. Sometimes, especially now, it’s hard to find friends. Don’t worry it will get better. I’m there now, I’ve been here before, when the time is right... Friend!
I dont have any friends either its part of life for some people i think. I dont even text my husband lol
Ya I just really wish I had more people to talk to. I don’t know where to meet new friends especially with the pandemic. I also have bad social anxiety which makes it harder for me to make friends.
That sounds contrite. What I mean to say is that seeking new friends is always a challenge (at least for me) and in the current environment it’s more challenging. Also, to friend who left you high and dry, it seems kind of lame. But... Big But... they found happiness for a time and your friendship helped facilitate it. Find something you’re interested in (hunting, Pokémon cards, being vegan, gym rat, selfies, etc.) and find a group in your area that thinks it’s cool too. #friendfinding
Online is the best answer, but people nowadays are so centered on themselves that it's going to be hard to find someone that truly cares about you.
That’s true

Since years I am plagued with depressions, but lately it just got to the point, where I can't find  any energy to deal with it anymore. Not just that corona keeps me isolated, but also my friends and family drain my energy a lot. I feel that they do not understand on how my depression works and that I am not able to be as supportive as I used to be. I still try all I can to be a support for all of them, but I dont have any energy to keep going. But that fact alone makes me even more depressed. The only thing that can still give me some joy is helping the people I care for. I might be kinda obsessive about it, but that's literally the sole thing I still care for. But by me "not functioning" as supposed the last thing I enjoy will be gone soon. I hate myself a lot for that, while still knowing it is not really my fault. I just really get anxious about that whole thing, cause I fear, that when I "missfunction" for too long my friendships might crumble at some point and my last support I have will vanish.  It gets increasingly harder for me to open up infront of friends or even be around more than two people for too long. I avoid even my flatmates for months now, just cause I severly get stressed out even when meeting too many of them in the kitchen. I know in a way that my actions increase my distance to friends and family and also my loneliness, but I just can't deal with those simple situations anymore. All that fear of people is probably just a result of me getting disappointed and hurt for years, but it got even worse last year. The person I put all my trust in let me hang in a way. Since then my trust issues just increased and my mental health drastically declined. Ironically I feel extremly lonely, despite having problems with beeing around people. Basically the only reason why I post here. Just want to feel less lonely.  I am in a state of loosing the control over my life and the depression and I feel like I just can watch it happen. I do not sleep, I eat way to less and elsewise I am just wasting my time by doing nothing. Allthough realising all of that, I still dont care enough to change. Same goes for my drug abuse, which probably slowly fries my brain. I don't do any work and it's piling up, which makes me feel even more guilty. But how shall I be able to withstand? How can one change, who has no energy to do so?  I am not suicidal, but I sense, that I am moving in that direction just cause I lack energy to continue and don't know how to get out of it as well. I basically can't defend against it anymore. Anything I can do to avoid drifting further in that direction?  Thanks for every reply :)
I can feel your pain. I think drug use causes depression as well, so you might want to do something about it also? And when you’re depressed, all you need is to rest. Don’t you worry so much about ppl around you, if they truly care and appreciate you being supportive for them, they will understand. and I hope you can take rest as much as you can.  You just need time for yourself for now. I hope you feel better soon.
I know how you feel, I also can barley handle simple social situations anymore, I have to think about every word that exits my mouth and by the time I am done thinking the opportunity to say something has passed. I am scared of everything I say being too stupid, unfunny, or weird. Maybe its because I used to have a strong lisp in my childhood that even today I am terrified of even a slight lisp coming through and preventing me from talking.
Thank you for replying so quickly :)  Well rn I try to stay "sober", but fail miserably. I am back at one day sober now. Allthough I know the drugs might have a role in the whole thing, its just that I can't stop easily either. It is kinda a trap for me.  I try resting as much as I can, but don't feel it helps me much, cause I can't stop thinking about all that problems. I do hope my friends will understand though, but when I can't give them anything in a friendship I just feel extremely upset. Idk really why thats is, but I feel like I care about them too much in way.   So do you think I should do something counterintuitive and get some distance and more me time? At least for a while.
&#x200B;  Glad to hear I am not the only one with problems and fears like that. Have you developed methods of making that fear less severe? Even if just short term?  I never experienced something like that before and struggle to deal with that even after half a year now honestly.
I can’t tell you what you should do, I’m sorry. But I think you don’t need to feel upset when you can’t do anything for them. You are a good person I can tell because you care so much about your friends. I think they know that. I hope they know that. Try to rest your brain :) you’re thinking too much and exhausting yourself.
I appreciate your reply. Thank you very much :)  I'll try to give me and my brain a break. Somehow.

You realize you do feel anxiety. Take it easy. Hope you feel better.

I’ve finally accepted that I’ve been seriously depressed for two years and finally made a doctors appointment after avoiding it and cancelling it for months. I’m 23, in grad school, and feel no excitement or hope for the future. I only feel a plateau of nothingness/numbness and then sadness. I don’t remember the last time I’ve been happy. I’m pushing everyone away, even my amazingly understanding boyfriend. It feels like too much effort to do anything. I sleep for 13 hours minimum and if I don’t, I need a nap throughout the day. I feel so lazy and worthless.   I need hope from you guys that have sought treatment that it gets better because I can’t imagine going the rest of my life feeling this hollow.
Motivation of things getting better is just as useful as motivation of things getting worse.

I’ve been in a pretty serious depressive episode for about 3-4 weeks. I don’t deal with depression a lot. It usually comes from exhaustion after days of panic attacks when I’m exhausted. I’m primarily diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder.   Over the past week I’ve been doing what my psychologist asked to get better. I got exhausted with it yesterday. I felt a little better, on average. I went from horrible every day to bad days with good evenings alternating with very bad days with so-so evening. Since yesterday was worse than the day before, I got frustrated and thought it wasn’t working.   I woke up today and still felt depressed. But I gradually got better throughout the day. I got up and around, made myself do some things I like, did some light exercise, like I’ve been doing for the past week or so. I started to get work done without having to break and crawl into bed. I even found myself enjoying doing something silly, and enjoying the way an old song made me feel. And enjoying the nostalgic feeling the song gave me scared me.   I would stop short of saying I feel 100% like myself, because I don’t. But when I scan myself, I really don’t feel any of the depressive symptoms anymore. And that scares me. What if I healed too suddenly? What if I’ve got a mood disorder and have to start treatment and meds etc. all over? I had a massive panic attack and interpreted the resulting irritability, stammered speech, etc., as potential manic symptoms.  Please don’t misunderstand me. I’m not saying this is some horrible condition that people cannot get past. But I am 33 years old and have been in treatment for something for six years, and I am just devastated at the thought of starting something over. I also primarily have health anxiety/hypochondriasis so I tend to medicalize every fear.

I'm part of a group chat and I loathe it. I hate how everyone is able to interact so easily with each other because they're all already friends. I don't know most of the people in the chat irl and I don't really want to tbh. I hate being in it. Just having the notification at the top of my screen of my phone makes me feel bad. I don't belong in there. I never do. I can't integrate into groups. I'm only staying because some people that I know irl are in there and they're kind of my friends but not really. I thought I'd like it in the chat because the people in there have similar interests and such but I just hate it. It always reminds of how incompetent I am when I try to interact with people. It's like watching a haply couple in front of you while you're going through a break up. I think the worst part is that I unconsciously always compare myself to them. It's not their fault ofc but me making myself feel more miserable because I always come to the conclusion that I'm worthless shit and I'll never be good enough.

I feel like if I disappeared today, no one would notice or care. I feel like I don't mean anything to anyone and never will. I've been feeling so empty and the worst kind of depressed ive ever been because I dont feel anything except this overwhelming feeling of worthlessness. nothing matters, because I have never and will never matter to anyone I care about. all I feel is emptiness and worthlessness.
There is someone out there, who indeed loves you and cares deeply for you. A person searching for you, cause he/she needs you as much as you do need her/him. You just haven't found each other yet. But that person will come.

Honestly a little scared to post this, but here goes.  I'm probably just typing to the void here, but that's okay. Days are blurry - I am aware I go to sleep, and that the sun rises and, technically, it's a new day. Even as I live in those moments it's all just a blur.  Life hasn't been fun. It hasn't been something I look forward to going through anymore. I still remember feeling happy to wake up and do shit, even if said shit was sitting on my ass playing games all day. Now, it's just something to pass time until I can properly kill myself. I dread waking up just to feel hurt. If I'm lucky I'll feel nothing at all.  My mother was diagnosed with cancer early last year. She wasn't sure if she'd make it to the new year, but she has, and is cancer free now. Her and my father would be devastated if I kill myself. Before the cancer I had dabbled in the thought of doing it regardless of how heartbreaking it'd be for them, but I can't now. I can't do that to them, especially to my mom and all she's been through.  So, I wait. And rot internally until they have both passed, and I can finally die too. It's weird, but thinking about how badly I want to die hurts so much.  I am 33 years old, a woman, and I live in America. I'm sure my residence has a lot to do with my depression. I have never really had much for long relationships, but I yearn so badly for someone to share life with. I want to live so badly on my own and support myself - I'm 33 years old for God's sake, and I can't get a loan over 3k despite my pristine credit because I simply don't earn enough. I live with people I once enjoyed, but have changed into negative people. One in particular after getting a boyfriend - one that has touched me inappropriately.  I am a failure. I will never succeed. I will never have a good relationship. I can't even support myself. All I am to men is an object.  Life isnt fun. I dont want to do this anymore. I can't die yet, so I slog on until both my parents are gone. I want to die, but when I think about how little I matter and how there's nothing that makes life worth it, it hurts so much.
Hey :)  There's a lot to unpack here. But I want to start off with the boyfriend inappropriately touching you that's assault. I'm sorry you've had to go through that, and it wouldn't surprise me that it had effected you in ways that you don't want to be effected. If you can, I would talk to a professional about this.  What's interesting about your situation is that your mother had cancer. I can't imagine how difficult these last two years just have been - you must have been to hell and back right? Like so much could have happened - so many stressful scenarios. It must has been devestaring. Although ultimately its ended well. The after effects are still there.  Couple that with COVID, and then with the assault - and suddenly it fits together like a jigsaw you know? You're a fantastic person. Youve done  brilliantly, you really have. You've fought through more these pasf 2 years than some people ever do in there lifetimes!  You are more than an object. Learning to love yourself is the best thing I think you can do. You see yourself in a way that just isn't how you really are. Fine your wage isn't as high as you'd like it - but that can be changed. I think right now you're in a rut - and honestly I think some change would do you some good :)

I've known for a while that I make everyone around me upset and stressed. My dad tells me that all the time because I swear pretty often. In the last two to three weeks, I have made my mother cry more times than I had in the last 5 years, maybe more. I expressed that I don't feel like I can talk to her anymore, and was immediately told that I have a double standard. I always expect her to be very polite, and I can treat her however I want. I know that I'm like this. I've known for a long time.  I just fuck everything up. I have only been out of a hospital depression program for a few weeks, and I'm so much worse than when I started. I wasted my family's money, which we are already short on. If I had tried, I would be better. If I would just fucking work, I would be better.  Every day, I make things so much worse. I'm frustrated, and want to punch things, but I can't do that for so many reasons. And I'm just constantly torn. I feel frustrated, but I'm so depressed that I can't figure out how I'm frustrated, and the two feel incompatible. I'm irritable to the point that making my bed causes me to yell and swear when the sheets aren't perfect or I drop something.  I always have something to worry about. Even today, which is supposed to be a break for me, I'm worried about a piece I was assigned for my music lesson that I didn't practice for. Part of it was that I was away from home and couldn't transport my instrument, but that was only part of the week and my teacher doesn't give a shit anyway.  I'm tired, and don't know what to do.  Edit: Just realized I didn't finish the title. Sorry.

I was only on them for 5-6 months, my Dr kept saying to stick with them but it made my anxiety and depersonalisation sooo much worse. I haven't taken them in a few months and honestly I don't know if stopping them was the right thing or what to do really. Had anyone else had antidepressants that don't work for months then suddenly do?
Have you tried other medications?
I've gone to the Dr's a few times. 1st time they said I should find myself therapy. Which I did and didn't help that much. Went back they said meds won't help and the last time I went back they just shoved me on some pills and I spoke to the Dr every 2 weeks and they didn't really seem to care so idk if I really wanna try again.  Sorry for this wall of text.
Normally for medication psychologist and psychiatrist swap you between them instead of just telling you to stop. also you should try to attend therapy while on medication as it actually improves your results from attending such sessions.
I have to wait until June earliest to go sign back up to threapy. ( I can't afford it so I found some for free. Go NHS) and after I sign up gotta wait 12 weeks cuz if the waiting list and I need help n shit like sooner than in 8 ish months.
Try some free options like phone therapy the fill you in.a lot of therapies is really venting so having people to talk to.
I guess I'll see what I can find. Cheers.

my brain is literally just so terrible at being a brain. I literally wake up each morning and pray that i dont royally fuck up in someway, somehow and still, someway, somehow, i manage to piss someone off, mess up something easy at work, ruin group convo, miss payments, forget every single thing possible, or commit some other failure that shouldnt have been in anyway difficult, and each time it just reminds me of how not normal, how not useful, how not important my existence is and just...... ugh.  i feel as if my life as a whole is just an example to everyone else as to what not to look like, to what not to turn into. I set the bar for the lowest standard of living everyday and i just want to get life over with.  The frame of Kane Strang's "my smile is extinct" has literally been my life mantra.
It sounds like there's something inherently wrong with you and you can't fix that. It sounds like you keep trying to do great things but somehow find a way to fail nevertheless. It sounds miserable to live a life that you can't do anything good, but I want to ask. How did you come up with the conclusion that you're broken?
life has multiple ways of letting you ( me ) know. but mainly through the dissappointment of others as well as from myself.   There will be functional days and dysfunctional days, with seemingly a 1:2,000,000 ratio; just enough to let myself see what I can possibly do, but not consistent enough for me to ever be able to imporve or advance myself. I feel stuck in a never moving train, always waiting to arrive at a better destination but never getting there because the train is Defective.  I feel behind everyone I know, i cant process information pretty much at all, im 90% sure my cognitive functioning either never was there or has sunken to a level of stupidity that cant really be hidden anymore. meanwhile everyone else is able to use their brain effectively around me, at least enough to understand new information input. So it must be a defect somewhere.
I get what you mean though. It sounds like everyday when you wake up you see people doing stuff and then you look at yourself and you're where you were yesterday. It sounds like it feels demoralizing to see people progress but you've stayed still in your life. I want to consider that you don't particularly need a fast moving train to enjoy life. You could turn your train into the most beautiful house, and enjoy life like that. Many successful people I've read books about seem to be very focused on the goal that they've forgotten to take a moment to enjoy the scenery around them, and when they look back they realized how much of life they've missed out because they kept chasing their goal.  I remember my local librarian though, she was a lovely lady and had more joy than the other people who keeps chasing and trying to get ahead. Life can be about having a fast moving train, but the beauty of life is that you can enjoy it too by having the most beautiful train.   "How Simple life is. It's as simple as this: you're hungry and you eat, you're full and you shit. Between eating and shitting, that's where human life is found." Pramoedya Ananta Toer

I just went to a psychiatrist for the first time and got diagnosed with depression. Apparently they really think i should take medication for 3 to 6 months but i am really scared of it. I am looking for advice or experiences from people who took it. Side effects, dependency, effectiveness? Or how can i treat it alternatively? I am going to go to see a therapist but she seemed to think it should go together and not be an alternative. Thank you by advance

I’ve struggled with severe depression for a long time, and sometimes I wonder if it started earlier but wasn’t noticed. Recently, it’s been worse than ever. I’ve tried so many different medicines but they don’t work, not really. I’m afraid that I’m just wired this way. That something in my brain is broken that keeps me from ever feeling joy, that keeps me awkward and unattractive and uncharismatic, that keeps me in the fucking dirt. I can’t focus or work anymore, I just get no joy out of accomplishing anything. Even if I do, it just hits me over and over that people my age don’t give a shit about me. They don’t care, and it’s my fault. I started to distance myself from my friends because I couldn’t put on a happy face anymore and they were super put off whenever I tried to talk about what I’m feeling. I haven’t talked to most of them in a while, and I know they won’t reach out no matter how long I wait. I don’t feel confident or attractive at all, to the point where it seems like girls don’t even know I exist. It’s not their fault obviously, but it doesn’t stop me from feeling so unwanted that most days I just want to collapse. I used to get joy from playing the piano, from video games, from working out. None of those things seem to help anymore, and I’m afraid they won’t start to be fun ever again. I feel like a cold, disgusting rock most of the time, just shuffling by. I wish I had people to turn to outside of my family. I can talk to my parents, but they don’t know what to do and I know they just feel obligated to care. I wish I could feel confident and attractive in my body, and be able to engage with people properly. I wish I had something to be proud of. I wish I could feel accomplished when I do things. Sorry if you read this far, I don’t really have anything interesting to say. I’m only eighteen, but it already feels like I’ve wasted so much time and so many opportunities that the chance for me to be well-adjusted and happy is gone. I don’t really know why I posted here. I’d ask for reassurance, but it would probably feel hollow, I don’t know how to make things better. Thanks for reading.
I cant talk right now but know care and feel free to talk to me whenever. \*hug\*
I can relate. I’m sorry you’re feeling that way, it’s painful.
I’m 30 and feel like life has only just begun. I can’t say that I can relate, but I do know you’ve got so much time to make things right. Keep your head in the game kid, one day the sky will open up. Believe in that day and make sure you don’t miss it when it arrives. You’re not a joke. You just haven’t fallen in love with who you are and who you have yet to become. And that’s ok. Take care and take it one step at a time.

Hey guys! I know there's people here who need much more attention than I do perhaps, but if you do read this, thank you. I (16f) have idealized suicide and have planned to kill myself for years now. Every time I've written my suicide note and tried to plan everything out, I realize how many obligations I have on this earth. I am the older sister of an 8 and 10 year old, who I both love to pieces. I've been a "third parent" to both since the eldest could talk. My parent's aren't the most emotionally available, and although by financial means we are very comfortable (think upper middle class suburbs) my dad definitely has rage and violence issues and in general, teaching things like emotional regulation and other important lessons for kids was always on my shoulders. I try pretty hard to raise my siblings right and be the best I can possibly be as not only a daughter but a role model for the kids, but it really fucking sucks sometimes. I'm also a high achieving student (president of multiple clubs and lead two nonprofits) and I get good grades (straight A's in AP's etc). My parents don't put a ton of pressure on me, but I definitely do pressure myself and have kind of realized that I might have anxiety issues over it. I'm not trying to sound arrogant, but rather I guess trying to explain how I used to always justify not killing myself.  Here comes the thing. Im just starting to spiral more and more and realize it doesn't matter. Everyday I wake up and I walk downstairs to get some food or something and just think over and over about how much I want to just be dead. To just have so much burden lifted off my shoulders and how nothing actually matters. I know people have it so much worse and I sound so ungrateful for what I have, but I want to kill myself so bad.  I drafted out a final goodbye. I have a couple versions for important people in my life, but for my siblings, I wrote how sorry I was. I tried my best, but I keep feeling like I'm failing and not being the best I can. It just really feels like I spent so many years trying and trying to fulfill some purpose and it doesn't matter. I really am not worth it. I feel like a con with everything I do. So many people think of me as that friend or girl that is doing it all, and I can barely get up every morning and get through it with a smile plastered trying to make sure I am doing everything right. It just feels like I try to be such a good student, friend, etc. and even at "peak" performance this is all life offers. I'm shirking on my obligations, and the guilt is killing me. Thank you if you read up to this point! I posted this on suicide watch, and I guess I just really need someone to talk to me in some way. I don't want to burden any of my friends or family (although parents have refused to get prof. help) and I haven't seen a friend in person since august bc of following pandemic rules. I don't know if I'll actually follow through, but I have the pills and a full day off from school tomorrow to deliberate i suppose.

FUCK. It is so meaningless and pointless. Like life can be cool!!! If you're not depressed, mentally ill, ugly, dumb like me. I do fuck all, all day because nothing motivates me. Theres no point of doing shit in life because I still won't be happy and i'm gonna die one day. I'm already dead dont people seee? Even If I try I always end back up on my ass where I belong. Lmao I just wanna sit and do nothing my whole damn life. I literally refuse to work I hope it kills me, I might just end up going and starving to death I hate life. Theres NO way I can do a 9-5 job daily. I can't even move i have no energy. Theres NOTHING IN MEEEE, life is a fucking troll. People take life so fucking seriously, what the HELL. HOW DO PEOPLE HAVE ENERGY AND HAPPINESS TO DO SHIT WTF
Bro literally same. It sucks being exposed to the amazing things that life does have to offer but not actually getting to experience any of it because we happen to be part of the masses of basic ass workhorses.
Then fucking try something new, people who are happy do something they love or to make people around them happy they love . Try every job possible in the whole MF world and you will your ass loving to one job you can die for.

I have a rare congenital visual impairment called septo-optic dysplasia which renders me blind in my left eye and low vision in my right eye. I am 19 and I have stagnated; I need a job or to start college but can’t motivate myself because of how difficult my vision makes everything. Even things that should be leisurely and entertaining like watching videos or drawing are becoming a chore. I love to read but reading has always been straining for me. I pushed myself through high school and performed at an advanced level thanks to my natural aptitude for academic and artistic work but after graduation I started to stagnate and can no longer motivate myself to work as hard as I once did. I feel like everyone else around me has moved on to the next step in their life whether that be college, the work force, or the military but I am still just hanging out at my mom’s house waisting the days away and waiting for a shit situation to magically improve. I feel like a massive failure and disappointment. I feel like I should be able to push myself to work extremely hard like I did in school again but I am just kind of tired of busting my balls all the time. I am suicidally depressed and I feel like the biggest loser on the planet because I have given up on life and all of my dreams for the most part. I want to be a contributing member of society and feel like I have a purpose.

Hi,  I know that no one can medically advise me or be able to tell me what's going on with my personal body/brain, or what might work best for me, when y'all aren't me or my doctors. But, this is the main thing I've been struggling to figure out for years now, and so I wanted to try and just finally put this out there and see if anything comes of it.  Essentially my biggest struggle since end of high school, so about 8 years ago, has been huge difficulty with doing academic-type work (which now translates to job applications, and office work). I find huge difficulty in all parts of the process, from getting myself to want to do it, to sitting down to actually doing it, and to making headway and getting it done. Up until midway through high school, I could make myself study for hours for all subjects, whether I found them that interesting or not. Math wasn't my best subject, but I did fine. I was very concerned about grades though and I took on more and more and essentially spent most of high school on an extremely sleep deprived schedule and a totally junk food vegan diet. My health tanked, my grades tanked, my productivity tanked. I feel like I've never fully recovered. I had some sobbing spells senior year, but I think that was largely due to severe lack of sleep and poor nutrition and also correlates sometimes with my cycle (so maybe PMDD, but I feel depressed other times of the month too, and it's not consistently bad every month). Whether because of that or due to post-puberty shifts in hormones and genetic predispositions, I feel I have some mild-moderate anxiety and now-and-then depression, including SAD. No panic attacks, no suicidal thoughts, just a restlessness, an 'I can't sit still for more than a bit at a time, or I'll want to get up and walk around or clean/organize things' type of feeling, and often a loss of interest in things/no huge passions, no interest in doing hobbies, no major pleasure or happiness from anything, and a fatigue and brain fog.   I have endless energy for walking around, running errands, cleaning etc but when it comes to academic work, I avoid it like the plague and in college I'd stuff myself with snacks, which I somehow felt I needed in order to get myself to do work -- not as simple as needing calories for brain power, cause I'd eat a healthy meal but then want processed snacks in order to do homework -- chasing dopamine and pleasure chemicals maybe? Work drains me, it feels mentally/emotionally painful, and I never feel like I have my full brain power or creativity that I had in youth. I never also derive much excitement or interest in/from it or learning or achieving. I also wonder if I have developed a huge anxiety/stress response around it. Like oh this paper is going to be so difficult and take so much time and work, and not be fun, so now it's this big awful thing in my head.  I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but scared of meds/pursued the 'everything but meds' natural routes. I finally had one zoom call with a new psychiatrist who said he doesn't believe in the need for testing for adhd and instead just has patients he suspects have adhd to try meds... he gave me concerta (36mg to start) and I took it twice and felt like I was in major panic/anxiety, I was scared of how I felt, so I didn't take it again. I also went to the eye dr who think I don't have adhd but instead have an eye focusing disorder and am in eye therapy for that... that could be part of it but it doesn't seem like all. My other psychiatrist says she believes in trying to treat the anxiety/depression first and seeing if adhd symptoms remain. I just restarted therapy, both talk therapy and EMDR. Some days I'm open to trying meds (I have prozac I was prescribed in case I wanted to try it, sitting in my drawer, never tried it; I also have wellbutrin that I took twice and had massive insomnia that I'm not willing to experience again) and other days I think no way, I'm not at all cool risking weight gain or loss in sex drive or insomnia or a shitty adaptation period or tapering off period. I'm trying to exercise more. I just don't know. I might find another adhd specializing psychiatrist who could test me for adhd. I've tried so many supplements.   sorry this is an incredibly long post (my first one, too).
Meds are great, they work in the sense that they keep you afloat and makes you less depressed / anxious, im on Sertralin / Zoloft, which is an SSRI and is actually used to treat both depression and anxiety, it is also the most common antidepressant with the least side effects, it works for me and a lot of other people, keep in mind though it doesn’t fix anything and it certainly won’t make you happier, but it makes life more tolerable, and you shouldn’t be afraid to go down that route, so definitely talk to your doctor about starting on a SSRI antidepressant, good luck!
thank you for these kind words. I was even considering doing psychedelics again before/instead of trying meds, even though I've had sad trips (especially since I know you're not supposed to do shrooms while on meds). But I'll keep this in mind and maybe give meds a try instead
Yeah I won’t advice doing shrooms or anything like that if you start on antidepressants.

Everything about my life is just fucked. Im sitting here antisocial crying in my room fucked up while my family is downstairs having a great time. I’m for some reason programmed to want to be cool and accepted, but too smart and aware to be cool. My brother was just as depressed but is a fucking idiot I cannot figure out why I strive to be like him. I fucking hate my life and could end it right now. Everything could be better if I just fucking ended this shitty boring useless life. No drug in the world mutes this depression engrained in my mind what is wrong with my Jesus Christ. I’m so over this shit. Why do I have to be the youngest in my family and get picked on for every single thing I did. Why do neither of my  parents give any sort of care for my issue that they know I have. Do I even have an issue? All I know is I’m fucked in the head and I’m posting this screw it. This is so incohesive but whatever no one in my life gives the tiniest amount of care I just need anyone real to read this.
i’m antisocial person myself and i’ve learned to just not give a fuck anymore. like i went through a phase where i was overly analytical of every word i said and obsessing on how people will see me. i still kinda do that a little but it doesn’t bother me when i mess up because i just got so used to it.   you said you get picked on by your family? defend yourself (i know, sounds bratty and rude af) but srsly, you need to make them respect you even if it’s with a rude comeback. you don’t want to be messed with? don’t let them mess with you. in the end it’s self defense in a way.
True i Need to just start snapping back. What i hate is that I feel I've been beaten down to the point where my mind races too much to even think of something good to respond with when they call some shit out that I do.

So I’ve been having a couple of rough days lately but I thought I was doing all right until I literally bursted into tears after lying in bed without distracting myself with anything . Those thoughts are all so dark and so addicting . I’ve always been struggling with mental health but ever since our country has gone into lockdown it’s been way worse , way way worse . I feel so lonely in this world and unwanted . I have literally no one to vent to and it’s been exhausting. Anyone else feeling like this ?

I've been trying to drink my way through this past year...I got sick of playing of video games so I started playing video games drunk and it was more pleasant, I still feel that initial hit of pleasure when I start drinking and I dive into a classic game, but the hit just gets duller and duller over time, it feels like I should kill myself but I'm just trying to put it off through drinking and gaming. If only there was some semblance of hope I could latch on to, but this fucking pandemic is gonna keep going until the end of time...
Hey man, I used to drink a lot, then I started smoking weed ( pick your poison i guess ) but weed is just so much better to me, try playing a game or watch a good movie while high, thats the real deal, I would never advice doing hard drugs though, and the long term health effects of alcohol compared to weed still makes weed better ( its not even legal here so that doesn’t make it easier for me but still its better )

As I'm sitting in bed I am painfully aware of all the shit that needs to get done. I can't do it. I can't bring myself to do much of anything these days. All I want to do is sleep and I can't because I get lost in my own thoughts.  That's the other scary thing. My thoughts aren't just hopeless daydreams anymore, they are a disorganized manic mess that I can't keep track of. I am so frustrated with my inability to concentrate on one clear thought and I just want to scream or go nuts and break something. I guess there is still some rational part of my mind working because I haven't done that yet.  I feel like scratching the skin off my body I swear I'm going crazy.
The motivation is in you - you just need to find it. Everyone has unique creative and destructive energies. Think about what you create in yourself that you can communicate to people.
I lay in bed most days no desire to do anything I make food when it gets tough my meds help physically Anti depressants + stimulant keep me sane

My partner and I have been together for five years. He is aware of my depression and anxiety, it's something I have dealt with since I was ten years old. Lately, my symptoms have been really taking a toll on our relationship. He does not struggle, and does not understand, and I hate to say that it angers me. I know I should not look to him to save me or change me, it's something I need to do myself. Any advice would help, as my mood is fogging my reality and feelings for him.
Honestly I'm in the same situation. I don't really know what to do. I hate bringing it up and it seems like it's all I ever talk about.
Me too. What we have to remind ourselves, is that our partners do not know how it feels, so it can be hard to support consistently.

Today I read some while about Taoism and it greatly helped me alleviate the loneliness I usually feel.  It is a concept basically aligned with ourselves and a nice instrument to use to gain what you will.  Just getting this out there for those who would try.    Be in with yourself and flow like you will.  Accept what all is and all will be better. You're part of the all, after all. Be truly part of it.  It all stems from your mind, so let your mind flow and be free  Meaning is fluid Your tastes change each day You try to move on But the world also moves  Move with it Accept what you have Let go of illusions Forget what you know  Find out who you're being  Bye - M

paranoia is terrible. I can more or less deal with my depression, but this paranoia is a whole other level. I'm not sure if this is a vent or asking for advice, but here goes:  I don't have "the govt is watching me" or "im being stalked by aliens" kind of paranoia, just the casual kind, if there is a casual kind. Things that I do now and plan on doing in the future have all been built around keeping my paranoia at bay, which I don't think is even possible. Things that the average person wouldn't worry about, I think about in tenfold. For example, when I'm older I'll eventually need my own place to stay. If I could afford a big house, would I want one? No, because if I'm on one side of the house then someone could sneak in on the other side, and find me and hurt me. But there are more places to hide there. Do I want a smaller house? No, because if someone does decide to waltz in then I'll be much more easy to find. But I can keep a watch on everything more easily. Do I wanna live in the city? No, because it'll be easier for people who can hurt me to hide in plain site. But people are more likely to witness what happens and help. Do I wanna live in a secluded area? No, because if someone wants to follow me home and hurt me, no one will be there to witness or to hear my screams. But there are less people around who potentially want to hurt me. Do I want locks on every door? Yes, so it'll be more difficult to get to me on the inside. But then if I need to get in somewhere, it'll take longer, giving someone more time to catch up to me and hurt me. There's soooo much more that I could honestly take hours writing them down.  Of course there are other things that people might think are less strange. I always check to see if the child safety locks are on in a car just in case I'll have to jump out. Walking in front of people in the street is a nightmare. what if they're following me? Buying things is inconvenient. What if my info gets stolen, or if I get hacked again? And any time I get a delivery, I shred anything that has my name and/or address, so people won't be able to find me and hurt me. I got molested as a kid and ever since then I can't really trust guys of any age. At this point, overanalyzing is my specialty.  the world is a scary place, and i wish I could ignore it most of the time. I'm usually not suicidal (I do get there sometimes), but generally I wanna live life. It really sucks that I can't really live it (even in a pandemic-free world) without being anxious of everything

Sometimes i can have a few days where i am somewhat ok, but then it all just comes back to me.  I have thought a lot about what that teacher who knows told me, and one of the things were that if i didnt get help, i would end up wasting my youth and regretting it for the rest of my life. I need help, and at this point i actually want it too, but i am in a position where there is nothing i can do.  I keep telling myself that i am fine or that im making it all up, but i know that it isnt true.  I constantly think about everything that is wrong with me, and i just want it all to stop. But i cant.  At this point i just cant wait to die.
Hey. So you want  help but yous aid thst you are imnit in a position to take it? Why?  In terms of your teacher. What they said is slightly right.. But I would mostly disagree. You're learning.  I'm in my 29s right? I had horrific depression when I was in my teens. Did I ruin my youth? Kind of. Do I think of it like thst? Never. Why? Because it made me who I am today. I am better. I may not be 100 percent. But I am better.  This isn't you wasting time this is you learning and developing :)
Thank you. I hope that i will turn out ok in the end and that things will get better.  I am unable to get help because there is a quarentine in my country at the moment, so nothing to do about that.  Again, thank you so much.
You will - keep the faith!  Hope is an interesting feeling right? Hope does not guarantee things will get better. But what hope does it give feelings of encouragements.  I want you to be encouraged, and to know that things could get better.  Yea I understand about covid. If you ant to chat - feel free to post something here :)

“Here we are again, tortured by these incessant thought and feelings of insecurity and unacceptance. I am without a doubt, other, an outlier, the imperfection in a most beautiful image. But, who am I to blame other than myself? I have always been cold and aloof, confiding in no one but myself. Letting people see the scars I bear would only bring out the fury and vitriol in me. So I’ve made a prison out of these walls, confined to a state of privacy, isolated from everything. Nevertheless, ridicule and judgement follow me everywhere. They plague me like a sickness, a sickness for which there’s no cure. All of my days seem gray and lackluster. But I’ve made something out of my state. It is this insufferable predicament that has made me a more resilient person. In this anguish, deep within it at its roots, I’ve discovered myself and who I’ve yet to become. I am tied to it like it’s a critical part to the whole of me. It’s fuels every fiber of my being; my passion, my poise and my rage. It has taken so much from me and yet shown me so much too. At times I’m convinced I love it more than anything else. I’ve known it all of my life and it will be there at my side to remind me of my truer self until the absolute end.”    I promise you I’m okay. I just feel a lot. Thanks for reading :)

Personal opinion or let me call it my personal experience, the feeling of lack of motivation to anything or getting up from bed, I used to feel like that all the time, for all of my teenage-hood and my early days of being an adult. I love thinking about things deeply sometimes so I once decided to think about the main reason I feel that. It was that we live in a society where everyone around us keep telling you stuff like you need to be productive and do stuff such as reading or learning something and they keep pressuring us ever since our childhood for real. And this thing is one of the bad things our society normalized and there are a lot of other stuff. Like I started doing what I love the most sit down and watch series or do stuff I enjoy and sometimes do nothing and the feeling of no being motivated to do nothing and me feeling bad about it everyday disappeared and like with peace with myself doing nothing. Do nothing if that’s what making you happy and relaxed don’t feel pressured to do anything because doing nothing is normal.
Same. Been like that forever

Maybe I should try to get help but I can’t my parents don’t think depression is real and I can’t tell them I’m depressed because they would just say I said it for attention.

For 2-3 years i had episodes of random sadness like every week. I was diagnosed with mild depression. I’m pretty sure i may have anxiety but that’s not diagnosed. I don’t give a fuck about my depression, it’s the anxiety that’s just horrible.   Somehow those episodes just went away?? I used to have episodes from a trigger or maybe just sitting on my bed. I still have zero motivation to do anything but sit on my bed and play on my phone.  I’m behind on school work. I’m still suicidal but never really remember how much i wanna die until i have an obvious trigger, like getting yelled at or just anything horrible reminds me of how trash my life is.  I feel worthless.

The past year I was able to transfer to a relatively prestigious university. I did decent the first semester. I was able to meet some people and form some friendships. I am currently financially stable and my major is conducive to that staying that way. I have no physical conditions.   Despite being blessed with all this, I’m still persistently depressed and discontent. I hate myself and I hate living. I’ve been passively suicidal for a few years and it’s gotten no better, despite me making attempts at fixing my mental.   Honestly, I don’t see the purpose in life in general, all we do is distract ourselves until death anyways. I’m aware how entitled I am and sound having all these good things, but it doesn’t really change the fact that I couldn’t care less and I would much rather not exist at all.   It doesn’t help that my manager at my job this summer also killed himself.
That's in term of situation that things are well for you, but what about your feelings, is there anything that make your mentally like that?  Also, is there anything you like to do and actually make you happy?

I don't have any advice but you aren't alone. I have a similar issue, it's hard. I feel like when I try to talk to people about it they act like I don't deserve to have emotions because "you're so lucky" ect. Stay strong.
Not really, I have a a decent amount of hobbies but I just do them, I don’t feel a sense of enjoyment or accomplishment from them.  There’s nothing too major, my girlfriend and I broke up but that was a full year ago as of now.
Yeah, i’d rather you not spam post your comments everywhere
Well thanks for letting me know i’m not alone. I also don’t know who to talk to about it because they would have a similar reaction.
Fair enough I just thought it was a good point.

Much of my adult depression comes from low self-esteem that I developed as a kid. I grew up with both classmates and family members commenting on my (fat) body, shunning me for being a teacher’s pet, not wanting to be around me because I stunk, and telling me that I have “heavy hands” and a “sharp tongue” and super negative, and that’s why I’m hard to get along with. Nothing quite like growing up in a small town and leaving with not a single friend.  I hated myself for those things and I hated my experience of constantly being told that I was less than worthy. As an adult try to look past those labels and see myself as worthy of being loved but no matter my efforts I end up being just as toxic as ever towards my loved ones. I think it’s time for me to just accept that what everyone was saying back then as true. Maybe I really do stink and have a negative outlook. Maybe I do come off as being a know it all. Maybe I am stubborn and that’s why I haven’t been able to be physically or emotionally healthy.  I really hate that I’m listening to the things that brought me down in the past. It pains me knowing that everyone was right, and that I have been so wrong to try and justify my existence as is. But maybe it’s my resistance to that initial feedback that kept me down all along. I should have listened, even if it hurt me for a long time.  Is giving into the negativity ever the answer? Is this what we call acceptance?
Well if everyone tells you the same things it possible they are right. If this is something purely mean like ,,u are stupid,, that you can't really do anything about since you can't just become smarter, don't care about it. But if this is something that you do have control over like your body, your weight or your attitude to others it is a good idea to seriously thing it thru. Hate is not the same as critique. Whilst you should ignore hate, you can really get some valuable informations from critique. Either way I hope you figure it out for yourself. Peace
I think I responded badly to critique esp when it was delivered hatefully (often). It’s been a struggle to tease apart what was hateful and what was true but they’re not mutually exclusive. And you’re right, the reason why I am starting to scale back on my attitude is because now I’m hearing the same feedback from my husband, and realizing that I have no friendships where I’ve actually put my real self out there. I usually save the shitty parts for the people I love :(( and it hurts them so much. I really need to change. Thanks for the well wishes.

So I just got compared to myself. My boyfriend (we are long distancing) just told me off for being sad. Like, why are you feeling like that and why is it lasting so long? Like he met me year and a half ago and I was fun and careless and full of life so he asked why can't I be like that?  I just felt so ashamed and lonely. Trying to explain what suffocates me and he just being like you take everything too serious life is  easy. I lost my job, financial support and all my future plans went to shot with this pandemic, and I know its like that for most of us. I love my family but I resent them bc I want to live out with my boyfriend, he has a house of his own 600km away from my  city. My parents are not gonna be happy im afraid they won't even talk to me anymore because without a job and moving there its risky no I know that but I just can't stay and don't know hoy to say it. I don't want to hurt anyone. Trying to talk to my BF and he reacting that way...I'm just feeling worse and in a spiral of anxiety and sadness that I don't know how to get out. I cant even joke anymote and i feel im not fun to be around...and that im going to be alone in the end. I just want to end this feelings.
Try to take care of yourself. Start working out if you can (that's a really attractive trait in anyone no matter woman or man), change the diet and maintain good sleep routine. It will help you out with your confidence (anxiety) and your overall mood. But if working out really doesn't feel like your thing you don't have to force yourself. Just give it a shot. I think that you should aim to cure depression rather  than to get rid of sadness, cuz sadness is one of the symptoms of depression not a problem itself. Try to explain to your bf how you feel and ask him to support you mentally. Talk to your family too, explain to them why do you want to move out and what are your reasons. Don't get into unnecessary conflict with them, they love you. Don't put pressure on yourself, give yourself some time, it's really hard period for all of us and no one can expect you to just get over it in a day or two. I wish you the best.
Thanks for taking the time to answer. I will definately try all of your suggestions. Great advice. Thank you again

During the period between march through july was one of the toughest periods in my life. I struggled with self harm constantly. during the month of May I couldn’t go a few hours clean.

No physical touch, intimate or otherwise for over 5 years. It really feeds into my low self-esteem and ideation about feeling ugly and unwanted.  I've got this constant feeling of emptiness and dead feeling inside.  No one is ever going to love me despite having love to give. I have a big heart but that's obviously not enough.  All i do is go to work then go home even before the pandemic this was my pattern. I'm 30 this year and there's probably 10 year olds out there with more life experiences than me.  Is this all that life has to offer for me?.  If so, what's the point in going?
I know that feel. It sucks. I have no advice because I'm in the same hole myself but hopefully this award cheers you up.
I feel the same way. Loneliness is definitely a killer.
I'm a bit like you, but i really wanna try to fix my problem by doing small stuff and building it up
*virtual hug* I hope it helps. I feel the same way, but I think that maybe one day we will find someone to hug.
I feel lonely as well. There is comfort in knowing you're not the only one. Reach out and talk to people, it helps.

I don't usually do this type of thing. When I was a kid it was considered pretty taboo to even entertain the idea of having a mental illness, much less talk about it. But I'm 26 now and I've found myself without anyone I can actually talk to about how I've been feeling.   &#x200B;  I'm a masochist. Pain has always been my thing. When I cut as a kid, it wasn't just a release, it was all I had, the only scrap of control. Suicidal thoughts were super rare, I never wanted to actually end my life, I just did it because I was hurt and confused and didn't know what else to do to snap out of that stupid numbing veil.   &#x200B;  I've tried to deal with things, get better, and I feel like I have. But when I look at how old I am now and how many things I've felt like I've been sitting in the passenger seat and watching someone else destroy, I want to cry and cry and cry until I dry up. But I can't. And I want more than anything just to tell all of these people I love so much that it isn't me, or at least it isn't who I want to be. I came so close a few times but I can always see it when they seem to just click off or go away, because eventually I've fucked up enough to drive them away. I'm turning into my narcissistic mother, as much as I've fought to not be her.     I really did think I was getting better, though. I haven't hurt myself in a decade, unless you count fucking myself up being clumsy. Until last year, I didn't even *want* to hurt myself. I was still getting down, but the days where I would be an absolute monster one day and an infuriating maniac the next were getting fewer and farther between. I met a guy who took care of me and understood me, got pregnant two years later, and now I've got the best reason to try and take care of myself.... playing by herself as I type this because I can't bring myself to smile for her, and god damn it that shit plays hell on my take on myself.     For the past month, now, I haven't felt like myself at all. I feel like I did when I was a teenager, when I wasted all those days trying my best not to be awake. When I didn't get up to bathe, eat or brush my teeth for days, and nobody paid it any mind, and I made a dark little corner to blind and deafen myself in, where no one cared to go.      All I can think of now is how sweet and peaceful it would be just to let it end. God I love my little girl but what good is a mother who can't even find a way to have love for herself? I would die before I let her turn out like me. Her dad is the best man I've ever met in my life, and I drove him away from me, but he loves her fiercely and he can likely parent *better* without having to worry about me. I'm dead weight, and a ticking emotional time bomb to boot.      I don't have any control over what I do, and I'm scared. It's getting harder and harder just to put my thoughts somewhere healthy. I feel like I've been fighting a tide for years and it's been teasing me, letting off a little to allow me some progress, then ruthlessly shoving me back to the start. I feel helpless. Part of me wants to feel pain and be punished, the other part just wants this to be over. I'd kill for someone to just beat the fuck out of me, and it hurts just to admit that, or any of this. I know I need help, but I don't know where to start. I feel like I'm all alone.

i hate this world, i'm so done here and i'm such a fucking failure. i fail even at attempting, i just wanna get out of this goddamn planet. this world is so cruel, people are so insensitive.  i've never had rl friends, i've gotten ghosted about 20 times in the last few months, mostly by people who texted me first, no therapist whatever wants to help me, none of them reply to my emails. i have extreme abandonment and trust issues.. maybe that's what i fucking deserve. i'm done with living, i just want everything to end and will do my best to reach that goal.
Nobody deserves to be lonely. The world is cruel and it's feels so unjust that we have to suffer when all we want is the pain to stop.  You're still fighting though. You are strong. You do seem to have an idea of what a better future might be. It may seem unattainable now, but it also may come with time. Can you think of one thing you could do, no matter how small, that might start you on that path? Even if that's doing something that makes you feel better just for a few moments?  I'm sorry you're going through this. There are people out there that care about you even though it often seems like there aren't. Take care.

I thought I won over my depression years ago. Maybe it's because of lack of sunshine or drop in hCG hormones..  Ex and I broke up due to his anger issues. I then got into an accident and am physically disabled. I also found out I miscarried.  Now, I'm stuck in home alone for the next couple of months, unable to shower. Eating and drinking water became extremely hard due to lack of mobility. Silver lining, I guess I get to lose weight.  Is there anyone who wants to be gaming buddies to help distract me from reality? :) Bonus points if you play Phasmophobia!

hi there,  I'm so sorry to hear about your accident and everything youre going through. last year i was badly injured for the whole year pretty much so i understand how debilitating it can feel. I would love to game with you sometime! hope you feel better soon.
Thank you for your reply :) It is a strange sense of comfort that I am able to connect with someone who had similar circumstances

Hello everyone,  I'm really defeated in general. I don't know where to start.   Basically I want to know peoples' personal experiences with therapy and how it helped them (especially If your depression is mostly biological based).  Currently, I have a great therapist, and I really like him. My issue with therapy is that I don't think it helps me much. I've tried a lot of different types: CBT, DBT, sensory processing, along with many others I can't quite remember now.   Let me explain my issues:  Mainly depression. Cause is almost solely biological. I was born premature and wasn't touched by human hands until 6 months of age which obviously causes a lot of problems in the brain and all the synapses, blah blah blah. My dad also has major depressive disorder. I have little to no trauma that my therapist and I feel affect my mental health.   Anything you can think of therapy helping someone do, I do. Most coping skills don't work for me; they don't give me relief. I live a relatively healthy lifestyle (working out, walking daily, journaling, sometimes meditate, try to "feel" my feelings but not get stuck in them, I have a good self esteem and self image, a GREAT family and support system, common social interaction, etc.). I'm very stuck and having a hard time because it feels like everything that "should" help someone and I hear people say helps them, doesn't help me.   When it comes to therapy now, I'm kind of defensive because I feel like I try everything and it doesn't work to give me any positive result (insight, relief, etc.). So when something is mentioned, I put walls up because I know myself and I know what does and doesn't help. Are there just some people that therapy doesn't work for? Because I think I might be one of those people.   I just don't feel joy anymore. I can live the "best day ever" but I really wouldn't truly enjoy it. It's like someone put a bubble around me so I interact with the outside world but never really get to "connect" with it.  Life isn't worth living at all anymore to me. I know it will be one day, but I don't know how much longer of this cycle I can take. When I'm not depressed, I'm a relatively happy person though.   I just can't find relief at all. I'm constantly in distress, and emotionally uncomfortable. The only times I notice coping skills and therapy to actually work is right when I'm about to come out of a depressive episode. Other times, nothing helps. I just hold on for dear life and hope I don't get drowned/kill myself.   My depressive episodes last 1-2 years on average and there's a break of 1.5-3 years in between of living like a normal person. Life doesn't feel worth it if I'm spending 1/2 of it in a depressive episode.

This is going to be a long post. I'm sorry. I'm 29F. I'm married and I have 2 kids. 8yo and 6yo. My 6yo is nonverbal and autistic. We have a pretty standard life. We live with my in laws. WE DO NOT MOOCH. We have our own bills and our own separate "financial life." We don't ever dump our kids off on them. In fact, we haven't had a night alone in over a year. We are very present parents. We live in an area with a top notch school district and would love to stay here bc of that, mainly bc my 6yo gets really great services. The problem is, my in laws are so toxic. Do I love them? Absolutely. My kids adore them. But toxic, they are. Any issue we ever bring up to them (very genuine issues), they completely disregard and brush off. They are very selfish and don't even realize it. I would even say they gaslight us about things a lot and make us feel ridiculous. I often wonder if I'm a bad person, if I'm the gaslighter, etc bc of all this. It's honestly so stressful. I will literally google "am I emotionally abusive" and quickly realize it's them!! For the record, they are never like this to our kids. The problem is, we want to move out. We want our own separate life. But homes here are SO EXPENSIVE. Homes nearby are SO EXPENSIVE. I'm so incredibly depressed. I feel like I'm in a hopeless situation. I'm estranged from my family. I have no friends. No job. Covid had made everything worse. We can't afford to move out, but living here has taken a toll on my mental health and my husband's. I genuinely feel like nobody cares about me. I genuinely feel like there is no help for me. I tried to tell my MIL that i was feeling very depressed and she completely ignored me as if she didn't hear me. It's making me wonder if there are actual people in the world that care about each other? Is everyone this selfish?Why don't I have people that care about me? That is so foreign to me, like a fairy tale. I would literally do anything for anyone. I would literally listen to anyone without judgement. It's so lonely. I would love to see a therapist but I don't have any insurance bc my husbands insurance is so expensive and he has severe issues, he needs it more. The free clinic is not taking new patients bc of high demand due to covid. I've literally been googling tall buildings, high bridges, suicide methods, etc. and contemplating which ways would be best and which ways would be not great. The thought of traumatizing my kids used to be enough to nip that in the bud. But now it feels more like they would be better off. I wake up in the morning ready to try and have a good day, feeling silly for being so depressed the day before, for not eating,  for crying. and as the day goes on I remember why. And each time I sink a little lower. I definitely am starting to realize that there is no hope. Maybe I actually am a shit person.
I CARE ABOUT YOU   YOUR KIDS NEED YOU THINK OF THAT
what about renting?  Is that an option?  If your depression comes from living with your in laws, you should definitely move out.
[removed]
Your kids will not be better off without you. I can tell from what you've written that you care about them deeply, and if you were to leave them it would deprive them of your love and support for the rest of their lives, not to mention how traumatic the experience would be for them. If you haven't already, you should probably open up to your husband about just how intense your thoughts and feelings have become. He may be dealing with his own issues, but now more than ever you should be leaning on each other for mutual support. You may not want to burden him, but allowing yourself to suffer or giving up is going to be much worse for the both of you. If things get worse, it would be better to go to the hospital than to leave behind your family. You are not a shit person, you are being abused. Don't let them twist the narrative on you: your in-laws are absolutely in the wrong here. You are not at fault whatsoever. And you are not alone in feeling the way you are; the isolation has been getting to a lot of people. You sound like an amazing person stuck in a horrible situation and dealing with a difficult disease. Please continue to be strong until you can find a way to see a professional who can help you work through this. Lots of love from an internet stranger ❤
U honestly seem like a really good person to me I know it can get lonely but just hang on a few more months,not all people are like that We care about u Take care
I know they do. It's hard to see that sometimes.
I'm honestly not sure if it is an option. Most of the places are just above the limit. Once in a while I'll see something that is just "cheap" enough and nice but those are RARE.
Thank you for the good vibes
Thanks so much. I know you are right. It's just hard to see that sometimes.
Thank you for your kind words.
>I'm honestly not sure if it is an option. Most of the places are just above the limit. Once in a while I'll see something that is just "cheap" enough and nice but those are RARE.  There's always a way...  with kids it's harder, maybe ask your husband if he can make a little more money... or better yet, ask your in law to take care of your kids while you get a job to make some cash.  Never give up... there's always something better waiting for you.
Thank you for your kind words. I am working in starting a small side hustle. I think it will help give me focus on something their than my situation while earning money.

I've always been a loner and very been the sharing type. Im quiet if I must say. Almost 3 years ago, I opened this reddit account to escape/find an avenue to escape what was happening to me.  I was married for 2 years to the most amazing woman I'd ever known, but she life couldn't just let us be.  She was diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer. When I first heard I don't think I handled it well. I was angry, I was scared and confused. I confess I was selfish. I'd always been a loner, my father was a preacher and he never really let me do.anything but church activities and prayers.  He was trying to groom me but I hated every moment of it. And then came this interesting and annoying girl who I seemed to never get enough of and just like that, she changed my life. She helped me grow by letting me know I wasn't taking control.of my life and i had to do so to grow. 6 months months later we both moved to the states to start a new life, 2 years later I asked her to marry me and she said yes. All of a sudden, the only person Ive ever shared who I really am with, who knows me more than anyone in the world, my best friend ever is about to leave me like that. How was I supposed to react?   I was with her and I tried everything to make sure I don't lose her, I lost alot but I didn't care, I just wanted her. I went to sleep on a Friday, about woke up the next day but she wasn't by my side, I called her name and no answer and went to look around the house. I found her but was gone.  On February 23rd, 2016 (my birthday), the love of my life took her own life, and didn't even say goodbye cos I think she knew I wouldnt accept it. About 2 years after that her sister told me she had actually gotten diagnosed with cancer twice before we met (which she never told me) and that she was depressed for years and always running away or never really wanting to talk to people. I guess I was the exception.  Basically I've been depressed ever since and I've just been throwing myself into work. I'm accepting my fate and hoping to heal. So here I am.  * Forgive me for the rough post. Sharing is new for me and I'm sincerely struggling to type this. *  Thank you for reading...

Sometimes I get mad for really no reason at all, just out of the blue, and I can't focus on anything but it. It's at these times I hate everyone, and want to be violent, but I know it's not me, so I just boil until it passes.
I can't say i get violent necessarily, but I definitely do feel anger after a while. I think those feelings usually go hand in hand.
Do you happen to be a chap? If so anger, irritation and frustration is a more common presentation of depression than sadness or other symptoms in men.
Quite often, yeah.
I've never been asked in that way lol, you've made my day :) Yk, could be it. Sometimes, I'd rather be angry than sad. I think my dad is running off on me

Hi. I just want to share how i feel this past few months. I'm a young adult, 22 years old. Ever since the pandemic started, i lost my job. I became more miserable. I can't find a job because of COVID. I don't have anything left on me. I always keep wondering why am i still alive, i don't have a purpose. My life is a series of torture. I see my friends grow and cant help feel jealous over them. Like i always ask God why am i like this? I always did well. I worked hard but why am i suffering like this? I just want to end things. I've been thinking of killing myself everyday ever since May of 2020. I even started preparing myself. Deleted my social media accounts, emptied my bank account. Now, i'm left on deciding how should i kill myself. Its a burden right now.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzch6c/my_dad_tried_to_kill_himself/
My dad has always been very healthy but lately he's completely changed. He doesn't eat unless we advise him to, multiple times (he lost 10 kilos/22 pounds in a month because of it), mind you, this is someone who used to be very very strict with his eating habits - he never skipped a meal.  He doesn't give his opinion on things anymore, only if you directly ask him to, which is so odd to me because he was always so passionate about expressing his point of view on things. Now he barely talks to us. Now i know this may seem small to some people but little changes like these kept going on and i was starting to get worried. And then yesterday happened. He tried to kill himself. I will not describe how.  I feel overwhelmed and helpless and guilty and just want to cry with him all day. I love my dad so much and just want things to go back to what they were.  I am now terrified of leaving him alone which he doesn't like.   I think he's depressed but nothing has been diagnosed.   I can't force him to get help but i also can't just sit around while he's clearly in pain. I don't know what to do and it's killing me.
I'm so so so sorry :( There are no words. I hope you find some peace within soon.
Depending on his age and your laws, you may be able to get some sort of caretaker role of him through the legal system. That way you can keep better tabs on him and not to control him but to make sure he is taken care of
Thank you :)
Thank you for the advice, i will look into this!

Dude idk what’s wrong with me. I’m drunk right now. All I ever want now is to get drunk. There’s so much pressure. I’m in my last year of the Irish equivalent of high school and I’ve a bunch of exams in that I need to do really well in to fulfil my dream of going to a great college to study data science. Anyway I’be been super duper sad for like a couple years, but never really thought about it till now. I just told my best friend how I feel. Again, I’m drunk as hell. What’s wrong with me. I’m too afraid to tell my parents, I don’t want them worrying. I’m just lost and I feel alone. Please someone respond. With anything
I'm 22 and on my last year of American college and I'm drinking rn too. I've been mixing this sketchy but unopened starfruit liquor my grandma brought back from senegal in 2015 and has been afraid to open so she was about to throw it out when I asked if I could try it. it's really good as a replacement for peach schnapps in the Sex on the Beach cocktail. I call it the "Starfish on the Beach" cuz it has pieces of starfruit in it
Why you down bro? What's up?
Glad to reply and happy to talk. Listen bro, regarding school, you can't measure your achievements by the same standards as 3 years ago or even 2 years ago. You gotta see that surviving and mainiting mental health is way more up on the totem pole when it comes to taking care of your self.
Sounds fucking delicious dude and that’s a great name lmao but I think we should probably both stop drinking and maybe just sit back and watch Netflix or some shit. If you promise me you’ll stop, I’ll stop too.
Dude I honestly wish I knew. I think it started with School pressure back in like 2017 because I’ve alway been a high achiever but I don’t even know. Maybe it was relationship problems either. I wish I knew. Thanks so much for the reply. It means so much more than you could ever imagine.
I'm drinking the third drink and that'll be it. honestly I left out some of my ingredients to use for another one but I'll put em away. I don't need to get wasted tonight, nor really any other night- people just don't *need* to get wasted.   I've struggled with a lot of depression, too, especially in the last year. I've been getting help for many years now, and I've found that a lot of the treatment through counseling boils down to gradual changes in your habits of thought. I found that I'm actually an optimistic person, but I can't see anything as going well or turning out good while I'm in a depressive episode. Sometimes it's just easy to get stuck in the cycle of disastrous thinking, and it takes a professional to help break that cycle and give you something healthier to think about.
Thank you so much. The rest of my cans are going straight in the bin. Maybe I just need someone to help me break the cycle of “disastrous thinking” like you said. You’re amazing. You’ve done more for me than you can believe. Thank you so much. I hope that whatever you’re doing through, you’ll come out the other side, and you’re last year of college is the best yet <3
no problem- I'm used to helping my friends with their depression and anxiety. some of them haven't had as much counseling as me because my parents have good health insurance that I'm still under, so I'm trying to teach the things I've learned to other people.  It's hard in the moment to realize that your thinking is irrational when you're depressed or panicking, but it's helpful to have someone to remind you about the last time this happened, and how you made it through a time when you thought everything was over. how you thought you wouldn't make it through the day last time you had these thoughts, but you made it then and you'll make it now. these thoughts seem potent and logical now, but later on you'll start thinking normally again and remember those thoughts as crazy or stupid. I often look back at anxiety attacks and depressive episodes and think "pfft, that was so dumb" but in the moment it was my only reality. it feels so scary and inevitable in the moment, but it will pass and you will be ok.   have a good night or day. I'll be praying for you ❤️

It makes me feel tactless, just about a decade old memories fills me with sadness, like I am not able to cope with anything and the time, for it's being; the people i loved, i lost, ^my Grandfather .  It makes me feel happy, and sad retrospectively, and feels like i am suffocating, for the time, I've wasted..
I lost my grandfather a month ago. We were never very close but when I hear his name I cry. everything that reminds me of my childhood makes me sad. I buy toys and sweets to feel like a carefree child without obligations as before, ignorant but happy.
And It feels as if we are entangled in present not able to do anything, just meta bash ourselves, sorry for your loss.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzeq9q/should_i_get_a_fish_or_plants/
I have moderate depression and my therapist has suggested that I get something that forces me to get out of bed and to actually do something. I was thinking maybe getting a fish or some plants would help? Fish are rather low maintenance pets so even on worse days I can still take care of it but it's still something that I'm looking after/working towards in a way. Plants are a little more high maintenance but are very pretty and could probably make my house feel more lively.  If you're depressed and have tried looking after fish/plants, how do you recommend it?
I'd recommend plants to start with. Fish can be more work than most people think (water changes, tank cleaning) which are necessary to care for fish properly. There are great subreddits like r/aquariums that have info on fish care.
I'd say fish because with plants it can be easier to just stay in bed and let them die. When you have a fish it's a living breathing animal and that may be easier for you to get up and take care of. Also, fish are more of a daily thing where plants can be left alone for days and still be okay. Just my thoughts wishing you well!
6 months ago I set up a few small fish tanks and added a bunch of plants to my home. Horrible depression set in a little over 2 months ago. A lot of my fish have died, and most of my plants have died too. Personally I wouldn't recommend either if you are struggling with getting things done due to depression. Dead fish weigh on your conscience, and dead plants are an eyesore that remind you of your failure to even care for a stupid plant.
Some good advice so far. Here’s my input hope it helps...  so I wouldn’t take fish. If they die and you blame yourself it’s going to be worse. You don’t want to be scooping floating dead fish out of murky green water when you already feeling down.  Plants on the other hand can “die” but quite often they just look dead. A little water, some sun and they can bounce right back. Get flowering plants. I have 6 in the kitchen. They smell nice and add colour. If you manage to keep your plants alive and you want to move on to fish then it’s a good way to measure progress in yourself and your ability to care for something.  Anyways, whatever you decide to do I hope you find the answer you are looking for, good luck out there. Peace:)
Yeah. I live somewhere tropical where it's hot and rainy so I could see myself just putting my plants outside and giving up on them. Thanks for the comment!
While I agree with the caution that u/fishandbirds8892 gave, i also recommend fish. If you just need time to sit and think (or if you don't wanna think about anything) you can just watch them swim around if you're into that. I feel so calm watching fish so hopefully I'll be able to get my own fish too

Nobody cares if you get killed get over it. The earth will rotate people will continue to poop and fuck and MSNBC will report on the protestors at the capital. See it's true you've been mind fucked by society. The truth is when you get killed you no longer matter because you're irrelevant. Goodbye.
It's more complicated than that. People don't often care if a random stranger gets killed but people do care about suicide.
Hardly anyone will be remembered by a lot of people when they die. It is evolution. We are wired to stop mourning after a while and get on with our lives. But you should live your life for you. It doesn't matter what others think of you or if they will remember you. Live for you

I’m so sorry, you must be struggling a lot, I feel u. Try to find things to do that occupy all your time. Listen to music, talk to people, start a puzzle, read a book, watch a tv show. Any time you start getting urges, go somewhere you wouldn’t self harm and just distract yourself as best as you can. Also if you sh with an object, put it somewhere hard to get to that way you’ll have more time to try and talk yourself out of it. *virtual hug* I hope things get better, good luck.
You have some options. Get a therapist. Go to a mental hospital. Remove all sharp things from your area. Tell some friends, adults, or mental health professionals

I've tried so many things to help my head and been on the real stuff, which helped better, but this GABA stuff is making me feel worse and extremely foreign to my own body. Maybe it's adjusting. Its only day 2. But it makes me feel so so so terrible inside its just a grey thunderstorm inside.   I feel so alone and people close to me feel like strangers to me. Im pushing people away and its only my fault but my emotions feel so empty its like I dont care that I'm letting them walk away.   None of this is like me and im scared, shes holding me captive inside. Will this day ever end? I hate myself. Its cold. I will try to sleep once more. THERES MONSTERS IN MY HEAD THERES MONSTERS IN MY BODY! MAKE.IT.STOP.
Emptiness comes from hiding aspects of your personality. You need to uncover hidden feelings and thoughts from your unconscious.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzbs13/cold/
In my first relationship, which took place in the midst of depression, my partner suddenly started calling me "cold". This coldness was a byproduct of many factors - there was my piquing depression, with insomnia and constant fear of death after several years of relatives passing away; school, where teachers would say that I'm all play-pretend and constantly threaten me with "the second year"; my mother's depression which lasted almost three years; two years of trips to a medical camp where I would get bullied by older girls; and the relationship itself, which started on the basis of depression, but resulted in a one-sided attachment with constant "you are too emotional".  By the point he called me "cold", I knew that no one really liked me when I'm emotional. Emotional me was defined by metaphors and tears - if I spoke about things too poetically and passionately, or started crying all of a sudden, no one would really sit through it with patience. Teachers, friends, parents, mentors - they all, to some extent, liked my poetry, my short stories and speeches. So my feelings were accepted from a piece of paper, but not in the form of an utterance - especially a personal one. Cold me was defined by the dominance of silence and apathetic perception of things happening regardless of their nature. It's just nodding, looking at something, and being silent - if necessary, I can start the whole "I'm fine" narrative just because in this state I rarely find myself able to communicate why I'm not. I think it'll pass, I'll crack the shell and act as I should - but it requires extensive effort from the other side, which only makes me feel more guilty of being the way I am.  Now, I manage relationships and friendships quite poorly - it's hard for me to open up, but when I do it's even harder for me to believe that I'm accepted the way I happened to be (that being "too emotional" and "with some past issues"). The friends I have are those that happened to stick by since school - nothing too personal or frequent, just rare talks and even rarer meetings. However, I had a few shots at relationships - and the feeling that I cannot escape is "cold".  I'm dragging this out a little, but I've been crying all day today because of an emotional lockdown. It was a split second of barely intentional neglect that made me come back to the "cold" side of things with someone who seems to be supportive and mindful of my shticks. It was in the tone of my voice, in the way I acted, in thoughts - I think for the first time I followed the process very clearly, not in the passenger seat. I felt absolutely miserable - I couldn't approach the situation as an adult, explain myself, pretend as if nothing happened, or tell that I, only I was the main cause of such an overblown reaction. My self-confidence plummeted - it wasn't a talk of equals anymore, it was a parent-child situation. I was just asking for us to stop, dismissing any support or resolution - it was a sudden fear of losing someone important mixed with a sudden understanding that I'm better off silent. The moment I dive into my thoughts, the risk of me being rejected or interrupted or dismissed escalates. It cannot be others all the time, I know that - something has to be wrong with the way I express myself that makes me revolting, makes those disgusted faces and impersonal messages appear.  My first partner never really tried to figure those states out, to navigate them to a better place - now I find myself wondering whether that is even possible as I try to do it on my own. I know that those few with whom I talk now on a personal level have no elastic patience - at the same time, I realise that maybe, just maybe, this coldness will never go away, staying as a coping mechanism, and everything will keep shutting down the moment someone does something that supports the idea of me being "too emotional" or the reoccurring thought that no one really cares about what I have to say. That drives me towards solitude, towards the abandonment of any hope about having a normal-functioning relationship or friendship - which only more so supports the "cold", the hiding in my shell.  I don't think that I've captured the point I wanted to make when I started writing - but it's been comforting to waste two hours on not crying. Being in an overly alert state is tiring - I don't know whether I'll receive a warm welcome from this person after acting like a child, and opening up to them about all of it would be only more so emotionally draining for them. I don't want to let someone go because of it but it feels like something predetermined. I don't think like this "coldness" defines me or crosses everything else that I have - but it seems like it does, and have been doing so in almost every relationship and friendship that I had since depression hit.

After a relatively boring day of trying to watch movies and dozing off (my Dr put me on a new med and it's making me so tired, but my sleep has improved a lot) I got a few things accomplished. I walked the dog with my husband, this is something I don't normally do. I cleaned up a tiny bit (which is better than none at all) and I took a shower. It had been over a week since I showered. I know y'all are like "how nasty, what a grub," but taking a shower is a big deal for me. I hate showering. I get afraid in the shower, like overwhelmed... it just gives me anxiety. Idk. It sure feels good to be clean. I feel super exhausted, I'm guessing it's from the new med, hopefully I adjust soon and I don't feel so dizzy. I also have borderline personality disorder, and I'm really at an all time low... My paranoia is off the charts, my mood swings go from anger to depressed to manic (manic as in delusional thinking) so I really had to try a medication to try to shut my brain up. I guess I call today a good day.... At least I'm clean.
Well done, I’m glad you are taking these steps and you should be proud of every little win or task you complete a day. I hope you get used to the medication asap and that it really benefits you. As a teenager I experience mood swings but thankfully haven’t had to go through bad depression as of yet, apart from minor things like exam stress etc. and can’t imagine how tough this must be so I admire you for continuing to fight against it. Take it one day at a time :)
Thanks.

I hate my life, no i don't hate my life i just hate myself and how i'm wasting my life. More importantly how i will continue to waste my life, simply because i can't do anything like a normal person.   I will prolly never be able to get a job, go to college, or get a girlfriend. so why even bother, i've thought about this before and i think 18 or 19 is plenty old enough for me, (x0x)
Why do you think like this? What's making you feel like this - I'd you don't mind me asking?
what like i will never achieve anything? i have some mental disability, idk maybe mild aspergers or some shit.  honestly doesn't matter what it is, i'm socially crippled and i think have some form of depersonalization or something?  i've never been diagnosed but my dad said he was once, didn't accept because of pride. so if whatever i have is genetic i could've gotten it from my dad, and my mom isn't exactly the brightest either.....
Even if you did have mild aspergers, that doesn't mean that you can't achieve anything :)  There are loads of people who go onto to do wonderful things with disabilities - I have dyslexia for example!  Have you considered seeing a professional? Like a therapist etc?
na as far as ik there is not a therapist for miles from where i live. also even if there was i doubt my family would want/have money for me to go.
How about a charity that specialises in asbergers? You could reach out to them for sure? And charities rarely charge for that

Ive been taking different antidepressants but they keep making me feel worse. And my anxiety meds only work for a very short time after taking then the panic just sets back in. Ive also been talking 50mg desyrel and it makes me extremely loopy. Its kinda hard taking about med options with my therapist and stuff and i dont really even know whats out there to choose from or where to look.
You should try Rexulti as an add-on. It worked wonders for me!

i’m going through a break up right now but to be honest i don’t feel anything. i thought that i’d be in tears breaking down every second but honestly i’m feeling nothing. the more i think about it i’ve started to realise i’ve been feeling this way for a while and spending time with my gf, even though we were long distance, was the only way i would feel any sort of emotion in months. shes the only person i’ve really felt close to for the past few months so she’s the only person i really feel comfortable opening up to and telling all of this but she’s gone. she brought the best out of me but now that she’s gone i just feel empty and alone.  nothing feels the same anymore. i’ve tried listening to my favourite podcasts and songs, watching my favourite films and tv show but i can’t enjoy any of it right now. if i’m spending time with my family i just find myself putting on a face for a couple minutes and as soon as they turn away or do something else i go back to nothing. today was the first time i decided to play games with my friends online in a couple of weeks due to school, they were all excited to hear from me and i was too for a moment but it started to feel like a chore and it felt like i was only staying for them. i was afraid to leave because i felt bad i hadn’t spent any time with them in so long so i forced myself to just stay and talk. there was a moment we were laughing and joking but it didn’t feel genuine and i just went back to feeling nothing.  they’ve been my best friends for years and i miss them because this was the first time we were all together, even virtually, in weeks so why did i have to force myself to spend time with them and pretend like i was enjoying it. i want to spend more time with my family and friends because i know it will help me but i just can’t find the motivation and it feels like i’m lying to them. i’m afraid to tell them because i don’t want them to worry and with the pandemic going on we can’t see each other so there’s not much anyone could do right now.  i’ve been able to work through my depression and anxiety before but right now i’m struggling to see an end. there’s just so much going on and  it feels like it’s fallen apart all at once.

This is going to be a lot more boring and short than most of the other posts you see around here but here I come.  For som time now, I am asking myself what's keeping me from ending it right here? Like... In the end, our lives always end the same way so why not just cut straight to the point.  I had a really good childhood, both parents were and still are loving even after they had a divorce, I always got what I needed and whenever I needed it. But still I feel empty inside. Other than my family, Noone cares about me and I don't care about anyone. Everytime I started getting attached to someone it didn't end well resulting in me asking the same question again and again...   Why continue living when I will die later on anyway? I feel like I am absolutely okay and absolutely broken inside at the same time...
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzdwne/nsfw_venting/
Sooo, I can’t really talk about this to my friends.  I really wanna kill myself, I’ll probably take this down. I’ve been trying to find painless ways with things on hand, I’ve heard that cutting is actually super painful. Maybe if I take an ice bath first, which I’m sure will be uncomfortable but it may like numb the pain. I looked into helium but it would be risky to buy a canister and get it filled up with no like need for actual helium like would people ask. I thought about buying a gun but I’m kinda strapped for cash at the moment just lost my job. Idk what or how to do it. I really want it to be painless. Like that’s my main concern I don’t mind if it takes a while but I want minimal pain. And yes I know there’s “so much to live for”, I should “seek help” I’ve been there. I’m tired, it’s the culmination of many things that’s pushed me to feel this way and I’m really just tired. At first I figured I’d ask for advice, but I realized no one will advice me on how to do this. So I guess I’m venting at this point.
Venting is good it's the first step to understanding why. I can't tell you what. Your post has helped me though because I know that Im not alone in my misery

It really sucks, and I’m sorry you relate. Seriously I’m sending you so much love, I’m just tired.

Hey, Wanted an advice on something I want days of this month to go by fast :)  I live in a toxic household and I’ll be leaving home in a month. It feels impossible for me to live my life like this for another month, it feels like a long time. So is there anyways in which I could feel that time is flying faster? Idk if I’m making sense 😅 but yeah, if anyone feels the way I do or has any solution to it, please do help :)
I'm sorry you're in a toxic household but I'm happy to hear you're moving out! I actually just got out of a toxic household three days ago, I'm now living with my sister and it's 1000x better. Soon you'll be out of there, it's okay. Just keep it low-key and try distancing yourself and do the things you love. I love watching shows, Ted talks, reading. You can learn a new thing like a language, how to play chess, learn morse code etc. Do a painting by numbers activity, do a project, write an essay on something you're passionate about, write a book review, read a poem book and mark all the good ones. There's so much you can do, hang on there, you'll be out before you know it :)
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz13h8/my_career_has_destroyed_the_last_bit_of_self/
I graduated college 3 years ago and past 3 years have destroyed any illusion I had that I am smart. I've been battling depression since I was roughly 15ish so about 11 years now. I always knew I wasn't exactly a looker and my personality is not exactly what one might call engaging or fun to be around. I always felt smart though. Always got top grades so I felt this is how my self worth will be. Whenever I felt ugly or unlike I just reminded my self we have different strengths and I dealt with it. Now 3 years in and I feel like a fucking idiot. Constantly overbudget at work. Slow to grasp basic shit. Not sure where to go from here.
It's a slippery slope to have your self-worth tied to something like your grades or work performance. It's something that I did for pretty much the first 20 years of my life, and when I started failing shit, I was absolutely crushed. Felt like life had nothing going for me anymore. The one thing I was good at out got thrown out the window.  My advice? This is not going to sound like very good advice, and I might get downvoted for this, but just keep pushing on. This sounds absolutely impossible, I know. Force yourself to do different shit, until you find something that doesn't suck too much, then continue doing it (even if you're not good at it).  And just accept the fact that you're not as smart as you thought you were. It made things a hell of a lot easier for me, to the point that I'm now easily able to laugh at my mistakes instead of beating myself up over them. It's also pretty conducive to learning, knowing early on that you're not that smart, you're going to fuck up, so you try and learn as much as you can from others.
I feel really connected to this. I am so sorry, it sucks...
Are you saying because you made a mistake at work and are not performing well you now feel worthless? You job should not define you where is your leadership team supporting you and helping you figure this out?
Remember that ur wayyyyy smarter than alot of people. It's easy to just compare urself with the smartest people. But if u compare urself with the average human ur actually really smart.  Think about this, there's alot of people that aren't able to reach college or finish it, much less have good grades.  I'm feeling the same tho, but I'm my cause i always thought I was hella smart and could just come into college and feel top of my class, simply bc i don't memorize stuff but instead "connect with concepts and I'm fascinated with them" but my first semester in I'm doing horribly and I feel like I don't even belong in college.  I think it's mostly to do with crippling depression (which makes it super hard to find any motivation or focus to do anything really) idk...
We’re all smart in our own ways. Keep in mind that depression can impair your attention and memory, as well as information processing and decision making skills.
Lol at a leadership team supporting employees.
It's not so much make a mistake here and there but consistently not improving and not working fast enough I guess. Just the stress of always being behind or overbudget.
:-(
I'm sorry I don't know what  exactly you do for work  First question: “What are your personal goals in this situation?”  •	Do you want to stay with your current organization or find a different place to work? •	Do you want to remain in the same field or consider a different occupation?  •	Would you like a more comfortable relationship with your boss? •	Do you want o be given more challenging and interesting assignments? Are you interested in getting promoted or expanding your responsibilities?  •	Do you want more recognitions for your contributions or accomplishments? •	Would you like a better working relationship with certain people or department?  •	Do you simply want to keep your current job in order to finance the rest of your life?  The difference between a goal and a wish: When we are having problems at work, we often think in terms of wishes, not goals.  Wishing is a passive activity that can easily degenerate into whining and complaining. Goals, on the other hand, help to define the actions we need to take.  Wishes put the focus on what we want “them” to do. Goals highlight what we can do ourselves. Wishes take us out of the power position by implying that we are at the mercy of others. Goals give us power by describing results that we intend to accomplish. When converted to goals, the wishes would look like this.  •	I am going to develop the skill I need for a higher paying job. •	I will ask my manager about how to prepare myself for the next available position •	I am going to start communicating in a more positive way with my boss •	I am going to discuss the important of deadlines with any employees and see that they meet them •	I plan to update my resume and start checking out jobs in my field Goals imply Action. Wishes Imply sitting around and waiting for something to happen. Changing from wishful think to goal-directional planning doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get what you want, but it certainly increases your odds.

In and out of depressive moods, anxiety crawling all over my skin. I should leave home to revive my spirit but too down to put the ‘happy, trendy make up’ on. Or am i just too lazy? Im not even sure anymore..   Ever experienced being called excellent at something, surpassing expectations and decent looking enough to fit in but still feel so detached and you just cant believe all the niceties? Then along comes people with crab mentality who’s made it their life goal to bring you down, clawing at you on your way down, stepping on you as soon as you hit the ground, then spit on your face when you’re just about to burst. Then all those people who said you’re good suddenly just vanish, leaving new words that would eat your shredded soul.. whatever’s left of it..... ‘she’s not even that smart. She was pretty useless. She’s not even pretty too, just her hair’s nice’.   Hmm.. there’s no need for other people to help me get on the ledge.. Ive always been there before they even came along. Ready to jump.. just too depressed to move.. always just asking ‘now what?’
You need to find your unique creative energies and find a connection to things and people. What do you create in your self that you can communicate to people?
So what’s the alternative if im not the creative type? Cant draw, cant sing, none of those artsy things. Socially awkward + resting bitch face already makes strangers stay far away from me or have impressions that i’d be a total bitch?  Dont get me wrong, i have close friends but i wouldnt want them getting all worked up to come rescue me all the time.. people already think im weak and useless.. i dont want the people close to me thinking the same.. faking everything is exhausting.
Even if you can just find a way to communicate your unique traits by talking it helps. What do you feel like you'd be faking?
The people close to you should understand you have issues.
I don’t really think i have any unique traits.. I’m mediocre at best.. so.. i have no idea.. even if i have a sliver of skill in something, my interest and motivation doesnt hold long enough for me to progress into any level, even if i push myself to continue.. so what’s the point
1 or 2 of them did understand. They didnt know what to do about it or how to talk to me about it..  eventually it created so much gap between us and now its just awkward being with them. Coz i know they pity me..   The others dont even know i have issues.. coz i can act normal like nothing’s wrong, suppressing the voices screaming in my head, curious about what it would feel and what it would be like to finally jump off that ledge.. the messed up part is that these things happen while i’m simultaneously with people and supposedly having fun..
Your traits must just be suppressed. You might find them.
Must be really hard. Try to find a way to make a connection with your friends.
I’d love for you to be right.. if you’ve ever felt deeply helpless and void of any motivation to even breathe, you’d understand why it feels impossible.
I have and I do. It's a long process.
Right now, to me, i cant even begin to think how to even start that process. The greatest desire i have is to just fade away. No pain, no effort. Just be erased and let what’s left of my soul sleep in eternal abyss.
I don't know what your looking for but I hope you'll find it and you probably will if you keep searching.

Anyone had an experience of being prescribed the 'second line' of anti depressants? I've been unresponsive to SSRIs so now it's onto the next round of things. Genuinely can't imagine not feeling this way all the time anymore. I don't know why but having how bad things are acknowledged has made me feel worse about it. I feel more hopeless than ever
On a non-SSRI serotonin modulator, Remeron. Low dose did nothing for me, now higher dose with abilify; although exhausted the best I’ve felt in months. Don’t give up! There are lots of other non-SSRI things they can help you try.
Thanks, I've been told it'll be months before anything even kicks in. I've been like this for a long time but the thought of months more feels fucking overwhelming
Not all take months, but some do. Just be open about your concerns with a doctor.

Hello, a little context to begin with. I saw a psy and a doctor during 6 months last year, at the end of the 6 months the psy came to the conclusion that i m making a depression. Hard to hear, plus the doctor wanted to put me into anti- depressants for the next 6 months. I scared me a lot, so much that i went into the mindset of " i can do it all by myself, no need of them blablabla".  Time passed and im isolating from all the " friends " i had, feeling lonely like never before, and sad every night.  I am wondering if im not self sabotaging my life ? Lately i feel very overwhelmed, by my work, by what people thinking of me, by everything..   Maybe the medicaments the doctor wanted to give me would have made the difference ?   I don't want to see the psy again since it costed me a lot of money..  If i am coming back to my doctor, what can i expect from antidepressant ? Will it change my personality ? Am i going to be an addict and never could go back to normal life ? What are some side effect i can expect ?
If being sad and suicidal is part of your identity, yes, they'll change you. But there are lots of different drugs out there and all of them affect each person diffetently. Some are more prone to give you terrible withdrawal symptoms, for example. Others don't but those might give you anxiety. Who knows for sure.   I've taken different antidepressants over the years: There was one that had terrible side effects, and another that had no effect whatsoever. Anyway, when I hit the sweet spot, they helped me to stay alive and move on. But this whole process, especially the beginning, has to be carefully monitored by both you and your professional in charge. Of course, whenever you (both of you) think is good to stop it, same thing.
I took some for 6 months and it only increased by anxiety to the point I got paranoid and starting dissociating constantly. My Dr's told me to keep with it but I stopped taking em. I don't think I wanna go back to the Dr's.  Some people seem to benifit from it sometimes so I guess give it a go.

Hey everyone I have a history of anxiety/depression and OCD. I stopped taking my zoloft during the summer (personal reasons) and I felt great. But recently, I've had a lot of changes in my life. Good and bad! We bought a house 2 months ago. We've had a few deaths in the family, im also a stay at home mom raising my 2 boys on top of everything. We are having a really tough winter.. weather wise. Its always freezing and grey. Plus, covid isn't helping anything.  I have been feeling really weird lately. I can't find the motivation to do any of my housework, I feel all signs of depression, but I am not sad. I just feel so weird. Its hard to even explain. My anxiety/ocd is telling me I have a chronic illness. I just have ZERO energy, motivation, I feel like a hollow shell. I don't want to play with my kids, i don't want to cook, I stopped my small buisness. I barely even have the energy to talk to my husband. I take multivitamins and vitamin D. I started an herbal mood supplement with ashwanghanda and st johns wort. I am just not sure how to explain how I am feeling. Does anyone understand? Does anyones depression present with no sadness? Just... kinda numb? Also, could I be physically ill? Could it be something other than depression? P.s I have this constant feeling of butterflies in my stomach too. It's weird.. like 24/7
My depression often feels numb and empty or suicidal. The sadness only tends to be when talking in therapy.   That's a lot to deal with, I hope things get easier and your boys are behaving ❤️
Thank you ❤ they are okay.... hahaah they are 2 and 5. So you can only imagine how well they behave 😂 i love them though. And I have my first therapy appointment Friday. Maybe I will be the same way. I hope talking to someone helps me figure out how I am feeling
Aww I have a 3 nieces and nephews and one of them is 3 so I can image 😂 hope therapy goes well for you!!

Started off with my whole friend group getting invited to somewhere except me by this one person. At first I let it pass. It happened again the same person invited my whole friend group again to a get together and I wasn't invited. One of my friends said something to the hostess, the one who invited them, but idk how good of a job he did because the person who invited said I couldn't come with some lame excuse how too many people. Now that time hurt. Then what do you know, it happened again. I wasn't invited by my whole friend group was, but this time felt different because the next day I texted the hostess of these get togethers nicely asking why I am never invited, but all my friends are and if I did anything? All I got was that they are close with them and not me. I told my friends this response and all I got in response was, “damn, that sucks.” It feels like they don’t care that I.m never there and feels like I’m slowly getting pushed out of my own friend group. I feel like I put in the normal amount of effort to be a friend while I feel like I get a fraction of that back. Any advice???  Sorta off topic, but what can I do if just feel like I'm there and not actually feeling like I’m THERE when I am hanging out with them. I feel like I’m the weakest link in the group.
You should try to enjoy your own company more it is actually very natural to become more alone as you age.  Do not feel that you're losing anyone there as you are more aware of your own thoughts and desires such as that you spend time with people you actually care about rather than spending time with people just not feel lonely.
Well I’m actually at uni and these were the people I first met and thought I have become close with. It hurts. Thinking the people you thought cared about you just kinda brush off something like that like it's nothing makes me fell like they don’t care if I’m not around.
Honestly bro if you've made friends at uni you're doing better than 90% of people
Well I'm on a team so it was sorta inevitable unless I just blatantly avoided everyone

Yesterday and the day before that I was feeling incredibly depressed and completely hopeless. Didn't even have a good reason why. I did everything right.  Today I feel quite happy almost manic. I would think I have bipolar disorder but usually bipolar depressive and manic episodes last minimum 2 weeks neither of mine have ever lasted more than 5 days.
I've had extreme mood swings before but I don't have bipolar. I do have psychosis. In your hopeless times you just need to find your unique creative energies. Everyone has abilities and traits that they perhaps haven't realised. Keep working on finding them.

Is this normal? It got really bad at some point and now it’s flat. Empty and nothing. Sometimes I feel glimpses of emotions come through randomly, and I’ll start tearing up or I’ll  start losing it and feel the need to isolate myself.  But otherwise it’s flat with a few negative emotions sometimes and some random tearing up.
Yes, numbness is a symptom of depression. Are you prescribed medication?
Yes you can. I’ve been that way for years now. It’s taste that i will genuinely feel an emotion at this point.
no I am not!! I don’t even have a diagnosis because my parents are timid when it comes to taking me to a therapist. But to answer your question, I don’t
Psychiatrist don't even need a diagnosis to prescribe you antidepressants. they often prescribed Zoloft for the first option or some generic version of it and see the effects of it over the course of weeks or even months.
oh I understand then. that makes sense thank you. it’s just the whole process of visiting one is a little impossible right now but I’m sure that isn’t forever. but thanks for answering < 3

Nothing is *ever* the end of the world. Sometimes we think it will be. Sometimes we *want* it to be. But it’s not. It never is. Life goes on, no matter what.   I’ve always both loved & feared getting close to people. Because of shifting situations, I’ve never kept any friends. Out of the hundreds of people I’ve ever known, I have three who are still in my life today just as casual acquaintances. Basically they’re just extended family members. All previous partners. We’ve had long long long histories together and that’s made it so I don’t feel much for any of them. It’s just the way it is. But I won’t cut someone out of my life forever... if they find their way back to me and take on a friendship role, then so be it. So I have these three people who I can call if I ever need someone to talk to. But there’s really no point, because they don’t understand me. They never have, and that’s why we didn’t work out as partners. And I wonder... what’s even the point of friendship if you don’t *understand* each other?   I have one person who I love very much, who I can tell anything to, but he’s physically far away from me. Still, I’m incredibly thankful for him. He’s by far my favourite person.   I have my parents, who have usually done their best to help me, but have also done their share of hurting me. They don’t understand me, and they have their own problems to focus on anyways.   I have my son, who is my responsibility and my reason for getting out of bed in the morning. Literally, I would stay in bed every day if he didn’t exist. Sometimes I’m more thankful for the time I get *away* from him, rather than the time I get *with him*, because I want him to see as little of my issues as possible. I want him to connect with other people, enjoy life, have things to do...   No, this isn’t going anywhere in particular. It’s just a stream of consciousness. Word vomit.   I’ve always had such anxiety over losing people. Sometimes it’s the people who I could take or leave. Sometimes it’s my parents — worrying that they’ll die before I can bring myself to *feel* for them again the way I want to. Mostly though, it’s the people who I love the most. The people who I feel at home with. It’s so rare to find and I’m always terrified to lose it because I think it’ll be the end of the world. But it won’t. It never is. I’ve experienced it enough to know that life goes on. And I’m working on looking at it like this;   People will only stay present in your life for as long as *they* truly want to, or for as long as is fated. Their time is a gift and should be enjoyed and cherished in the here & now.   And if we lose them; If they were good to you, then be thankful they were around. If they treated you poorly, then it’s for the best that they’re gone now.   If I believe this, then there’s really nothing to worry about...

I am over the fighting for a better life. I just want to crawl inside a dark cave like a wounded animal and sleep...maybe not forever, but for a long time.  This world is just too much. It‘s too loud, too crowded, too bright. Too many expectations from myself, other people, society...but mostly myself.  Get a job. Have a home. Eat. Shower. Sleep. Study. Socialize. Have hobbies. Take everything this world has to offer...well, what does it have? It feels wrong. I don‘t want to be ungrateful, but for me, living mostly means suffering. Struggling to get through the day. Faking to be a functional normal human being.  If I had all the money in the world, I wouldn‘t travel. I wouldn‘t buy things I need (or think I need). I would just vanish under my covers, thankful that everything is being taken care of.  Just waiting for my life to pass by and a hopefully peaceful death to embrace me.   Other people, human relationships just mean...drama. Conflict. Disappointment. Judgement. The feeling of inadequacy. I cannot stand their voices. I cannot stand their thoughts. I cannot stand that they form opinions about me although they dont even know me- and I am too tired to prove them otherwise. I cannot stand that everyone else has their own little world they live in. It may be fascinating, but to me it‘s just overwhelming.   There are people out there...enjoying life? Looking forward towards things? Living in the moment? It‘s like a foreign language to me. I can barely grasp the concept, but I cannot feel it.   I don‘t even know what‘s wrong with me anymore. Is it depression, depersonalisation, trauma? Or just myself. Is that what life‘s gonna be like for me forever? God.  I feel so old. I am a student, for fucks sake. I should enjoy myself, meet other people, have fun. But all I can do is vanish in my room, under my covers. Thinking back to my childhood every fucking day and wish for better parents that I‘ll never have.   I am stuck in the past and at the same time I am happy to not live in the present- because my present is pretty shitty.   I‘ts funny, I am writing these words while I should actually listen to an online lecture for one of my classes. I‘ts gonna be deleted in one minute and I am watching it pass by. It‘ll never come back. Just like my childhood or any chance for a better life.  I am not always this depressed, lol. But I guess writing is like an outlet for me and sometimes I just enjoy shouting my pain into the world.
Hey. It sounds like there's a lot to get rough here.  Have you soekk to a therapist firstly? It sounds like something has happened in your childhood?  There is one constant in life - and that's time. Doesn't matter how you feel, what you do - time will always pass and it will always happen.  You mentioned that you would jsut want to pass time.. Well you are? This is happening. And honestly - it's clear that that isn't really what you want. Just because you are a student it doesn't mean that you can't be feeling low or down.  Covid on top of studies is horrific, and I really feel for studeenda today.

hello I'm matt I want to tell you my real name. I want to talk about these feelings I've always had. therapy doesn't help pills don't help self medication makes it worse what should I do? I want to disappear so nobody has to worry it's better that way why do I feel like this ? and I care about my friends and family what do you do I want to run away no identity nothing is this the right choice
Hey matt - what kind of feelings do you want to talk about? Why do you think that therapy hasn't worked?
I feel like I can't say what I want. I've always been on court order except now it's my own choice but I still have that feeling like I can't say what I really feel.
and it hurts so much.its hard to explain I want to cry every time but I hold it in I don't want to get in trouble. I know I won't but I have that feeling still I hate it so much I just want to tell someone

I know last year has been sooooo hard for a lot of people and wallowing in self hate and pity isn't going to fix anything but hear me out. I have it pretty good but I dont know I have nobody to talk to all my grades are failing I got dumped and other more personal things have happened. My parents are the best I could ever ask for so I think im just being petty and ungrateful ive been trying to think about everything good thats happened even still nothing is making me happy. just while writing this I'm crying isn't that weird  am I just being insane and needy. I just want somebody to talk to right now.
The fact that you speak so highly of your parents shows that you're not ungrateful and you definitely don't sound petty either! You sound like a sweet person who's going through a tough time. I'm more than happy to chat but will be sleeping soon as it's late where I live 😄

I don’t know what hit me the past few days but I started thinking about how good life actually could’ve been.  The amount of bad decisions and missed opportunities (relationships, applications, etc) are driving me nuts. I could literally be living a completely different life instead of this one where I hate myself.  Right now it is so painful trying to fix all those mistakes I made just for a small chance of getting where I could have been.
Can't change the past; its a waste of energy to spend time pondering of it; live and learn;

Hi. Nothing is working out. My career prospects, my love life. My friends aren’t free/close enough to meet me and even if they could, I can’t go due to my parents pretty much putting me on house arrest. There’s this sinking feeling inside and I want to sleep in all day but I have class to attend and projects to do. I used to be so driven and self motivated, a go getter. Now everything’s vanished into thin air. I don’t feel like completing all the projects I have going on. I feel like being alone all the time when I used to be extroverted. I loved listening to music and reading but now I feel so annoyed(?) when I listen to any and restless when I start reading and can’t pay attention.   Despite feeling the way I do, I have to appear that I’m doing okay. If I’m sleeping in too much, I claim headaches and if I’m ever crying I chalk it upto a blocked nose. I constantly keep feeling like life’s going to be like this all throughout and that makes me not want to continue at all. But I know that’s not true yet my mind keeps feeding me lies. I can’t get professional help.

It’s all I can think about, I never wished nor wanted to kill myself but it’s hard to not see it might be the only way to get some peace of mind... I just wish I never existed, I wish I wasn’t me.
I've been there, sometimes still visit there. Today is one of those days.  Try focusing on a goal, a hobby, study or something. It'll focus the mind away from the things that make you feel like this. Over time it will get easier. Talking therapy helps a lot of people as well. Also speak to your doctor. Opening up is the hardest step, once you make that step out gets easier.
A human that seeks relief is a human who’ve been through stress, relax a bit start doing what you love and mostly enjoy I’d do that.

Depression has me beat. I have complex ptsd that has been incredibly brutal in the last two months. Multiple deaths in my family including my Grandfather who spent the last two years with extreme Alzheimer’s. Earlier in July i had a massive falling out with my friends leaving me with about two friends left. Im on a waiting list for therapy and hopefully treatment soon as I have tried to avoid putting drugs in me but I think I will lose this fight if i don’t do something.   Everyday i feel lost and hurt. I constantly think about suicide. Not a plan for it but just thoughts and urges to do it. Im so moody and raw right now it feels like everything said to me is a slight or insult and I don’t understand why. Im so incredibly angry at myself that I keep myself up at night thinking about things I’ve done and over analyzing everything i did in the day.   Im not sure where to go from here. I just know I’m stuck in this rut.
I've had many suicidal thoughts in the past. Finding your unique talents and creative energies helps. What do you create in yourself that you can communicate to people, even if just by talking?
I went through this about 4 years ago now and I've come a long way from then. I'm not anywhere near where I want to be mentally but there has been an improvement. It will take some time to cope with the losses and people will come and go. Just make sure you don't allow yourself to hate being around people like I do. It's really tough then.  Long story short. You seem like a level headed person. You just have to do some soul searching and maybe devise a plan to help regain some mentally stability. Therapy will be good to vent and get a different perspective. A chance to ask and have questions asked to you that were never asked before.   I hope you find some solice power and peace within yourself!!!  RJ

I've put so much effort to get out of this, and here it is again. My old friend and enemy. I am trying my best not to fall for it, but damn it. It is so difficult and I am getting more and more tired.

Right now... I've feeling extremely worthless. There's this one person... My best friend, and we haven't talked since I woke up. I first messaged her about 4-5 hours ago and left more but they haven't responded. And we've had a really rough past so my mind is just screaming at me that they're ignoring me because of how I've used and manipulated them in the past. I regret more than anything, but I continue to use people without even knowing it, it's just become part of my personality. And I hate it and myself more than anything. and evn tho it hasn;t been too lonmg going without talking to her, it still has me incredibly depressed and suicidal. Though lrtting this all out through a reddit post is kinda helping... I tried watching YouTube, my main coping method, but that failed. Nothing really seems to be helping, and all these thoughts on why they may be ignoring me... it just really has me feeling completel worthless.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzgzn9/how_to_communicate_a_breakthrough_in_therapy_to/
So long story short, I am 36 years old and have realized I’ve had horrible depression my whole life. Discovered this through therapy in 2020 and kicking a drug habit that has finally regulated my hormones (and began seeing an addiction psych).  Anyways, I’m great. Feel like I discovered MY meaning of life. My family thinks I’m maniacal. Or bi-polar whatever that means.  Surely I can’t be the only one going through this! Any advice?
Is the breakthrough recent?
Yes, today. For context, there is no way for them to know me because truthfully I haven’t been forthcoming about who I was. Didn’t know the answer to that question myself in fact. I have more context I can share but I don’t want to influence anyone’s objective assessment of the situation.
So, unless you’ve have a fantastic relationship with your family where you’ve previously been able to share things, I wonder why you think it’s pertinent to share this moment of growth with them?   Also, you’re an addict. You think you’re whole world has changed, but They are used to the continuous repetitive cycle of who you have been for the last few years. You cannot expect them to be anything but negative or detached, until you actually show different behaviour over a longer stretch of time.   Besides, this breakthrough is for YOU. Not to validate you to others. Not to make people forgive you, understand you, excuse you, etc. this is YOURS. It’s an intimate self awareness and now you need to focus on building your life back up with good solid skills, boundaries, meds if needed, therapy.....and then SEE how the people important to you change as YOU change.
Thank you for your honest assessment. What if I were to tell you that by most conventional measures I am extremely successful? Multiple degrees from elite institutions including the #1 program in my field. A beautiful home. Lovely companion at feet at all times with my dog. Cushy job with conscientious employees and tons of economic security that frankly in that past I was too depressed to appreciate.  Also, no one can prove I’m an addict though their suspicions are true. Most people would be shocked at the “real” me.  How does this change your perspective?  And again, thank you. This exercise is intended for honest feedback for a highly intelligent man (I couldn’t type this until today) that loves his family unconditionally. My family is all highly educated with healthy functioning kids. I am the only “black sheep”, an idea I have entirely fabricated in my head.
I’m not “highly successful”, BUT, I excelled for most of my life. I would be what one would call “high functioning”. Only people who lived with me knew something was off but what I presented to the public was enough to make it even more confusing.   It’s enough that they have suspicions. You don’t know how they fully perceive you, unless you ask them.   For me, as I got older and better able to vocalize my issues, it was hard trying to explain how “tough” everything was. Because to many people it takes hard work to be successful, get good grades, etc. but I got good grades fairly “easily”, in that I didn’t do much in terms of studying, but I used a lot of bandwidth in my brain to just do all those things. Everything was a production for me. Something as simple as emptying the dishwasher had 20 different steps my brain had to process.   You say you’re the perceived “black-sheep”, but then your family thinks you’re maniacal or bi-polar. Maybe I read that wrong. Maybe it’s because you’re so elated you figured things out, and you’re doing better, it’s only NOW they think something is wrong with you?
Again. Great feedback. Can we feed some more data into the model? This is not a hypothetical btw. These are real facts and your voice is helping me shape my views so thank you.  1. I was diagnosed with “depression”  2. I became an addict  3. I saw an addiction psychiatrist  4. The addiction psychiatrist does not know if #1 caused #2 or vice versa. Correlation/causation.  5. I donated an organ to a sibling with a rare disease no fault of their own 6. Organ recipient tells me every day they owe their life to me (including my god daughter) 7. A part of me can’t reconcile if I donated the kidney because I wanted my life to end without the moral ambiguity associated with suicide. 8. My dead mother was very religious, but in a good way not a judge-y way.
No help? Not trying to bait but you’re my only response in the world!
Sorry! Will get back to you. Just had a bit of a day! :)

Edit: holy shit, the amount of people who've commented and liked this have made me feel a little better about my situation. Maybe there is still hope about finding someone who does feel similar and like me at the same time  I've constantly posted and I feel like a broken record, I feel like some sort of fucking weirdo or creep or monster because no matter how hard I try to impress anyone or get them to fall for me. Nobody understands how it feels to be at rock bottom, to have horrible disgusting thoughts 24/7, to look happy but wanna just sit and rot away in a corner. Everyone around me has someone who loves them and don't understand what it's like to be truly alone and not having someone love and want you for you. I'm a guy and I'm 21 and my last girlfriend was 5+ years ago. Everyone tells me I'm amazing. I'm funny and cool and that my personality is funny. But then the moment I want a girl to talk to everyone's gone and doesn't want me. I don't know what else to do. Everytime someone comes they ghost or don't care.
We live in an instant world and the youth are the hardest afflicted. If someone doesn't get it when they want it they feel they'll never have it.    It's part of developing... to feel isolated. Alone. Life is a brutal game of balance. light with dark and all that.  We have brains that don't even finish developing until around the 25th year ... You're literally not done becoming you yet.  Amazing right?

Brother I know it's fucking hard.  And the constant rejection from apps is miserable, unhealthy, and not even your fault. A man's chances are extremely, extremely low by design and by statistics on those things.  Honestly, I'm going out on a limb here and hope it resonates, but i say that you should put all your efforts into being the person you want to be. Make plans. Is it your body, your money, your style, your photography,vwhat is it that would make you happy with you? How do you reach them?  I'm extremely vain and conceited, but I like me. And people always respond to confidence.  Once you become the person you want to be, and you still get no love, then you have every reason in the world to be sad. But you will be able you say you gave it every chance.  I believe in you brother. Stop trying to impress everyone and just impress yourself. You accomplish the same goal, easier.
im sure this isn't what you want to hear, but ive had the same problem in the past, i didn't fix this by getting a girlfriend, i just stopped being interested in dating. if no ones dating me, then i can spend my time improving myself instead of worrying about dating someone. its a process, but i think it gets rid of the pain AND makes you feel better about yourself when you improve yourself.
Honestly I used to feel like that, I had a gf but she broke up with me. Were great friends but I just don't feel the same level of intimacy or understanding. Its fucking terrible being on your own and it hurts. You shouldn't feel this way, but your stronger for opening up about it.
Everyone deserves to feel love and happiness, it doesn't help that certain people get fucked over than others, all I ask is to find someone that feels similar and talk to them and see where it goes
It's completely normal to not be content with yourself , a lot of people who are happy aren't. Every human is different, everyone obtains happiness in different forms. There's always going to be more you wanna do to better yourself. In my case , being in a relationship is something massively important to me. It is a life goal and something that I strive for. It may not be the same for you but it is for me. Feeling happier because someone loves and accepts you is the most natural thing a human can feel. It's normal to gain happiness from another human. So many people nowadays tell each other to not rely on others for happiness, only rely on yourself. But in reality , its completely normal to rely on others. Humans are social creatures and need to interact with others, only focusing on nobody but yourself and not being able to rely on absolutely anybody will dig you a bigger hole.
I have nothing to impress myself for. The world treats me like something I know I'm not. I've been working on loosing weight but besides that nothing is wrong with me. I have video games and collecting as a hobby. I joke around , I talk to friends. I'm super funny. I'm not deformed, I'm not crippled or disabled . Nothing. And yet somehow every single fucking time I wanna impress a girl , there's always fucking something and it KILLS any happiness I've gotten and I hate it
I agree. I just think that awareness take some of the sting out of the unknown. You feel lost and sad. I can recognize that and relate to it. I felt lost and sad before. Sometimes I still do
i think the chances of anyone at all to finding a real, committed life partner—one who inspires and supports you, and whom you want to inspire and support in turn—are longer than winning the lottery. those people around you who seem to have that: their relationships will all fail over the next ten years. every last one of them. i don’t know who suggested to us that finding such a person was something that was likely to happen, but in my experience, from observing both my own life, and the lives of those around me, it isn’t. there’s nothing wrong with you. i’d be willing to guess things just come to a head quicker because you’re less easy going. but, in the scheme of things, that means very little. easy going people’s relationships fail, too, just on a slightly longer timeline. you have just as good a chance as they do of finding lasting love, because it is infinitesimally low for every single last one of us. try and learn to be alright being single. it’s something i fail at, as well. but i try. like a starving man searching through bins for scraps, i try not to expect a michelin starred dining experience.   and i’m sorry you feel bad. i know how rotten it can feel. lean on friends and family, if you can. some of them will carry you better than most other people you’ll ever meet.
Its good that you know what motivates you. That is strength.  And it sounds more to me like you're just taking the rejection and bad luck to the heart. That sucks, and I am the same way.  Does it help at all looking at it as bad luck? If you're content with yourself otherwise, then it is just that, bad luck.  Hang in there. I can't promise you extreme bountiful good luck at this time, but keep rolling the dice. Luck always changes.  I don't think anything is wrong with you as a person. If you lost 20 rounds in a slot machine in a row, anyone would feel like they just suck. Anyone could take that personally. But it's just a game of luck.
I can understand that. Something that's always helped me and people I know is that when you have someone here for you and someone understands , it' makes the horrible and disgusting feelings a lot more easier to make them go away.
I just can't see it "bad luck" your telling me that the literally 100's of girls I've talked to have all just been a string of bad luck. I do nothing but bust my ass for someone. I love and then when I show emotions I get none back. That's why I feel like some monster. Like people look at me or how I feel and switch clicks telling them to leave
If I can offer you anything useful just try to remember that your perception of other people's lives it's happening through a lens of myopic exposure to them. You're only seeing the mask that they put on for others to see just in the same way that we have our masks that we know that people don't know all of our thoughts, we can't know all of theirs. More people feel alone and lost and sad more often than they care to admit and they often make up for it with exaggerated responses of being outgoing and funny because that seems to be how a lot of people cope with not feeling great. It's almost like this unspoken thing that you just act that way eventually you'll feel that way. That's not totally true. What happens if you get used to acting that way and you adopt more of those characteristics and some of the more sad and difficult characteristics can go away but never forget there's also a chemical component to depression. You can't act that away and not everybody has it. Just like not everyone has an internal dialogue. Just like not everybody has two legs. It all seems so unfair until you accept the randomness of it.
That's valid man. It's an awful feeling.  I'd just keep in mind that you might not have all the answers and the **logical** part of your brain is jumping to conclusions about yourself to explain the **emotional** part of your brain that's affected by rejection and girls ghosting you.  This kind of dubious, self-targetting, self loathing logic is common in sufferers of depression. Even as i'm typing this out, i'm mostly just describing myself, cause this is what I do too.  Especially if you are using dating apps, holy fuck are the statistics bad for men.  Some people have the logical brain jump to the worst conclusions though, and blame all women, like you see in redpill and incel forums. I'm glad you're smart enough that you aren't taking that road.  xxxxxxx  I don't know you, so I can't say if there's anything you need to work on from an outsider's viewpoint. Maybe a friend can help you troubleshoot what's up? Like you might need better photos, or you're intimidating or  whatever? Spitballing here, I dunno.  Anyway, much love brother, I hope you find someone soon.

Hi guys, I’ll start by saying I’ve never used this before and not really sure why I’m posting this.  I’m a 24 year old guy and I’ve always kind of struggled in social situations, don’t have much self confidence/esteem and I guess I have a pretty negative outlook on life. My relationship with my girlfriend ended in July last year( we had been together for 1 and 3/4 years) it was my first serious relationship. 6 months on I’m still kind of not over it, I mean I miss being in it but I also glad I’m not in it now (she broke up with me btw)  My life just feels really empty I only have one real friend and that’s the ex from the relationship I just mentioned. She says she is very happy to be my best friend but I feel like she’s just saying that because she’s knows I don’t really have any friends. We text a lot but it’s only really one word replies that I get, sometimes we end up talking quite abit but after she always asks if she can borrow money, asks to borrow something or just needs my help with something. I can’t help but feel she’s just using me? Maybe I just encourage it because I always say yes.  I’ve tried to distant myself from her recently because it always feels like I’m last on her list of friends, that’s not a problem she has lots of friends. It’s just that shes the only one I have and seems really unfair on me when I get a reply 3-6 hours later or never because she busy with them. I also know that when she starts dating other guys that I’m not going to have that friendship anymore. That would really awkward and weird, right?   I really want 2021 to be good year for me, I want to be able to really improve myself, by getting some new friends and start doing some hobbies(I really don’t have any haha) but obviously with COVID I don’t think that will happen.  I do have one positive though. I’ve started a new job which will be really good. After working dead end jobs for the last 6 years, it feels really good to catch a break.   Anyway sorry for the long post and wasting your time if you read it. I just needed to get this off my chest
You can go in r/relationship_advice if you want.  But anyway, no judgment from me. I see why you are doing this.  I hope you will meet some other people.
Oh I thought I’d put this in there, my bad.  Thank you
No no, post what you want. I just wanted to say you can have some advices in the other sub.  This one is for venting.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzgdrx/my_job_is_destroying_me_and_im_at_a_loss/
I'm a healthcare professional, and to put it bluntly, I think my job has wrecked my head.  I had a very difficult placement last year which was essentially months of constant anxiety on a high-stress ward. I sought counselling at the time, which kinda helped. However, following that placement, I was totally burnt out, and for the last 6 or so months, I've largely felt very flat and ambivalent. I've drifted through work, lacking motivation and drive.   My self confidence at work has been destroyed - I'm constantly questioning myself. The feelings of being a fraud are stronger than ever. But the final straw has been a shift I did over the weekend.  Somebody I saw on the ward really affected me and I tried my best to manage the patient as best I could. Turned out the initial diagnosis was completely wrong, and now that patient has deteriorated and won't likely make it. I'd also seen a medical emergency where the patient was septic and close to having a cardiac arrest. Everything was happening at 100mph and it was just frantic. I was only a spectator really, but the anxiety was just rising watching. I left that shift feeling mentally bruised and destroyed.   I don't know why it's affected me so much, but it's finally made me believe I'm not fit to do this job, amongst other things.   I'm sick of my imperfections and that no matter how hard I try, it's never enough. This job is destroying me. I thought I was OK after counselling, but I'm really struggling just now. This weekend, it felt like I was grieving almost, just constantly reflecting on the events of the weekend. I was really upset.   I can't do this for another 40 years. And yet, I feel stuck. I'm supposed to go to work tomorrow and pretend I'm OK and put a brave face on, but I'm dying inside and I don't know what to do.
I'm not a healthcare professional, so I can't pretend to understand the level of stress that you guys operate under on a *normal* basis, never mind in the last year. But I'm going to try to offer a variety of thoughts, not all of which point in the same direction.  1) If you genuinely think that you are less skilled at your job than others who do this job, who  have the same amount of experience, ask someone you work with, that you trust, to give you an objective opinion on that. impostor syndrome is very common, and it may not be true that you are not good at your job.  2) If you hadn't been on that ward with that patient that affected you, they likely still would be in the same condition medically right now (I'm going on the assumption that another person would have managed their caseload about the same as you did). The only thing that would change is whether you would know about this specific case or not. Their suffering and death would be just as real, only it would be witnessed by someone else - or, if too many healthcare providers quit, possibly by nobody at all. Perhaps you gave them something of value, spiritually, that was of comfort to them. If you quit, sick and suffering people will still be out there, and you'll know that, as a general fact -- you just won't see the specifics. And you won't be helping them or comforting them. You just might need someone then that you can vent to, on an ongoing basis, like a counselor.  3) That said, if the suffering being so in your face is truly too much for you, perhaps you can find a job in a healthcare setting that is likely to involve less death. Or move out of healthcare altogether. It is ok to make a change for the sake of your mental health. \*hugs\* to you
Many thanks for the reply. Much appreciated :) To address your points:  1) I have a very supportive supervisor who hasn't flagged up any concerns, but I have made a few mistakes myself in the 18 months of doing this job. My peers just look so much more assured and know what they're doing, and that plays on my mind a lot.  2) venting on helplines/to counsellors/friends has helped. The only thing I'm finding is I having to do it very frequently because I can't seem to process my own emotions. I live alone and a lot of the time, it just all builds up in my head. Never in my life have I felt more confused about my mental state and where my life is going. I don't know whether I want to do this job anymore. I don't know what kind of depths this job could drive me to. I can definitely see a point in the not-too-distant future where I could contemplate the unthinkable if things got really bad, although I would never act upon it.  Which all leads me onto my next point...  3) I've been having real doubts about this job and every bad shift I have is just an assault and a scar on the mind that doesn't just leave me. Yes, I reflect on mistakes, but the reflection goes too far for me. I will finish my placements as a junior doctor in August, but I'm already a shell of the person that started 18 months ago. The only thing that is stopping me from quitting is that I have nothing in the pipeline and I have great financial security.  So in summary, my head is absolutely fucked. This is the kind of stuff that just circles in my head and trying to make sense of it exhausts me.
I think #1 - the fact that your peers LOOK self assured and all that doesn't necessarily mean they feel that way. They might feel the same as you.   I would definitely recommend that you start mindfulness meditation right away to help you cope while you are deciding what to do. There are youtube vids you can use, or you can choose an app. I like "Meditation" which has a white icon with a smudgy blue dot.
I appreciate this, I'll give meditation a go :) and that's also a very fair point too. I think it's just easy for me to lose perspective, seems to be happening very often of late.

I have heaps of friends, but for what ever reason I still feel lonely. I have people that can make me happy and make me feel like I belong but some how it still feels like I never have anyone to go to and I’m alone. My friends alway seem to be out doing things without me. They always tell me That I’m always welcome to come and I just need to say something, but most of the time I see it when they are out doing these things. They never just invite me to anything and when people do invite me out they always seem to flake on me. Same with if I try to invite people out. It’s always an excuse but maybe in a bit to then another excuse to why they couldn’t later.   I have also made quite a lot of friends at my work and it’s always fun to hang out with them. But because I don’t really use Snapchat I seem to be out of the loop and they’re always posting on things like insta them all having fun.  When I had a girlfriend it didn’t really make me feel any better. A lot of the time I would try plan things with her and she would make an excuse. She would never come to mine or do anything I suggested. The only times we would hang out is at her house or when she planned something. And I also came to find out she would be constantly hanging out with other people too. She even admitted to not inviting me because “I’m not fun” and when I did ask to hang out with her and her friends they just rejected me. Thankfully I’m out of that toxic relationship now but it doesn’t make me feel any better  It just feels like I stay at home all day playing games like halo. It’s mind numbing and I feel like I’m just wasting my life away. I just want to go out and hang out with friends. My family calls me things like lazy and act like I just play video games all day. I guess my family isn’t wrong about playing games all day but it’s not like I don’t want to go out.  Some people tell me advice like “you gotta plan things yourself” which kinda works but never really goes anywhere other than the one night. Yes I do gotta keep planning more things and make it more regular and common but then people just start to flake on me and make up excuses. And it doesn’t help that my friends only know how to plan things when I have work (which just makes me look like a flake).  I do have online friends that I talk to and play games with regularly but that’s it.   It just feels like everyone is out doing things without me and never inviting me.  Sorry if this doesn’t make sense or doesn’t belong or anything like that. I just kinda wanted to write something down and send it somewhere. I don’t really have anyone to talk to or anywhere to go.
I had many friends too, at least it was what I thought I had.  I was the one putting effort on the relationship. And as soon I stopped, all went down.  I can say today that I have 0 friends. I have my wife and kid and my family. So I put more effort on them now.  Before I met my wife, I was focusing on my stuff - university, job, etc.   I’ve learned that I don’t need “friends” to be happy. Sometimes it’s hard... but keep focusing on you, improving yourself and you will see the light in the end of the tunnel.

I've been struggling with depression for many years, most possibly since I was a teenager; but I never searched for help until a few months ago when I finally started psychotherapy. And even then I am still feeling badly. I'm aware this takes ***a lot*** of time to fix — I just wish this pain would go away faster.  &#x200B;  I'm not sure if I want to do this just to vent, seek for some kind of suggestion or maybe because I wanted to share my life with other people who might have had any similar experiences as me; I simply feel like I should talk about it. I'll censor most names for the sake of privacy, both mine and of other people. **Additionally, this post WILL be LONG and includes some sensitive topics in some points and personal thoughts**. My apologies; I'll try my best to summarize as much as I possibly can, and skip some stuff.  &#x200B;  I had to move not once, but *twice* during my childhood and at the beggining of my adolescence. On both times it was on different countries, so making new IRL friends and keeping in touch with them was out of the question at that time.  &#x200B;  The first time I moved, I only made a couple of 'friends' on middle school. They only were interested in me because I was a hard working student, and my family and I would gladly help them study and do their homework for free. I didn't get any notice from them after I moved to the next country. Nonetheless I was lucky enough to have internet and I met some amazing friends online from this same country, who I still talk today.  &#x200B;  The second time I moved, it was rather.. difficult. I was 13. The language was not the problem because I already spoke it. The thing is, I had to adapt once again. Besides my parents and sister, there was no other family here. And I got into a class that they knew each other since they were in primary school. It was hard to fit in. Plus there were a classmate and other people that bully me occasionally.  I stopped caring about school. My grades were dropping as expected and although I had those online friends and my parents taking care of me, I was lonely. At 16, I ran away from home. Nothing made sense to me, I was feeling lost — school wasn't going well, I didn't have any strong connection; I even started to distance myself from my parents and it was the time I was also questioning my own sexuality.  It was overwhelming, yet I also acknowledged running away wasn't the solution so I went back home after a few hours, when some officers recognized me. Nothing bad happened in the end, my parents only made me go to a psichologist — which I should have gladly accepted, but I was quite reluctant and went only for a few appointments, thinking my issues would settle by themselves after some time. How dumb of me.  &#x200B;  After finishing high school, I wasn't sure of what I wanted to do. My grades weren't high enough, so college wasn't an option. I took a sabbatical and then decided to study a 2 year programming course: I met some cool friends, learned lot of new stuff and, for the first time in more than a decade, I celebrated my birthday. It looked like my life was starting to make sense: after many years, I felt people cared about me. My issues didn't go anywhere though, I was only repressing them and I was developing new ones, like excessive self-criticism and trying to not make mistakes, to be useful and perfect.  After the second year of this course, I went together with these friends on an internship on *another* (third) country. Things went good, and the headman made us a contract. He esentially promised us we would 'reach the top and become rich'. Of course nothing of that happened: we didn't get any task some days while other days they would ask us to develop new features as fast as possible.  I became alcoholic during this time I almost had an ethyl coma once. And I also accepted the offer to go to whores, so I could stupidly "prove myself" I was straight. Both of these things occurred because I couldn't say 'no'. I wasn't unable to refuse what my superior asked/offered me, or I couldn't draw my boundaries. I wanted to get along with everyone, to be accepted by everyone. To not be myself, but to not feel lonely anymore.  In the end, I couldn't handle all of this and I flight back home with my parents. **I felt like a total failure** for not being able to stand by myself and endure the situation. And after all of this, from one reason or another, over the time I distanced myself from these friends I made during this course, until I stopped talking with them.  &#x200B;  Another year wasted by taking a second sabbatical, and then I decided to study another course. During this time, I *finally* accepted the fact that I like men, and that there's nothing wrong with that. I started playing an online videogame and met new group of friends again. There was this guy I clicked with immediately, and.. I started developing some feelings towards him. He was already in a relationship with another guy, and I was fine with that because I was sure my feelings would have faded away. Except he broke up with his boyfriend after a few months.  I told him about how I felt, however he wasn't sure he would or could be able to reciprocate, plus he doesn't date guys he hasn't seen IRL. It was pretty understandable. Regardless of that, I still had my hopes high. I became a bit *obsessed*, thank god not in an exaggerated way, but still.. it **wasn't healthy** for anyone. I often checked whether he was connected in the voice channel, because I wanted to spend more time with him. I also wanted to spend some time with his friends too, I really enjoyed their company. And I wanted to know more about him as well, although I don't like to meddle in someone's life.  Another thing is, when I entered the voice channel, if we weren't doing anything all together, I would often stay silently for hours and for many reasons: I either didn't have anything to say or when I did, I wasn't sure if what I was going to say would be appropiate or make them laugh. They felt uncomfortable with that situation, so they created other private channels.  I was so dense to not see how I was behaving and I was feeling left out once again. This time, I think it was justified. So I took the decision to stop hanging out with them for the time being until I take care of myself, and told them I'd come only if they wanted to play stuff with me or if I wanted to. Because it was making them hide from me and it was making me feel bad. Because I believe it was the best decision to take.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  I still have a slim hope that things will sort themselves after some time, that therapy will help me improve my self-esteem, solve my personal issues and how I interact with other people.  Nonetheless, I'm in pain and hurt. I'm not motivated on my work. I actually don't want to play any stuff anymore. The only thing I want to do is stay on bed and cry, possibly stop existing. I failed during many stages of my life, be it on a working-environment or with friendships, while I lost many years doing absolutely nothing. I'm just.. Lost and empty.

Have you ever felt like getting off all of them. Sometimes i feel like they remind me that i’m not ‘normal’ because i need like 3 different medications to get trough the day. I know they help me, they have been helping me. But sometimes, i just want to quit, to get an illusion that im mentally healthy, that everything’s good. Example: I wish I could go out and have a beer or two, be just ‘another person’. I don’t even like getting anything beyond ‘tipsy’. But these 2,5 years have been hard, so i kinda developed a false memory of these nights out being the best things that happend to me. Idk if i’m being coherent, but i hope someone understands.

TW mention of death of parent       I lost my beautiful mother to cancer a few months ago. My father is estranged and it was just me and my mum growing up. When she was dying in hospital, she made my in laws promise to look after to me, which they swore they would. However, it is becoming apparent that anytime I express grief (which I seldom do to them) they make it obvious that it's not interesting to them or cut me off. I  feeling like I "should be over it by now". I hoped I could count on them to act as parental figures to try to support me but it seems that support was only for a week or two at best. My problem is that I have nobody to talk to. I miss my mum so much it hurts and there's nobody looking out for me anymore. No mum to talk to. My husband tries to understand but he's frustrated that I have a low libido and don't want sex right now so that's put a wedge of hostility from him. My 2 best friends are both dealing with big life changes right now so I don't want to bother them. I need to talk to someone so badly but I've nowhere to go and whilst I've been anxious with ocd my whole life. This is the biggest dip of depression I've been in. I don't want to get out of bed. I'm crying every night. I'm so lost. Can someone please just comment so I don't feel so alone? Thanks
Everyone gets over things at different paces. Focus on trying to find your unique creative energies and making something you can communicate to people - even if it's just expressing your feelings deeply through talking. You should find a way over it eventually but it sounds like it's gonna take some time.
I’m incredibly sorry for your loss. Just know that groef doesn’t follow a timeline. What you’re going through is normal!   If you’re able to get a therapist, counselor, or peer supporter, definitely consider it. They can support you and make sure you’re processing this tragedy in a healthy way.   Your husband is being insensitive. Don’t let his actions or your in-laws’ actions make you think you “should be over it”.

I’ve been there before man, multiple times. literally just lie down and do nothing. Don’t let yourself move. Go to sleep if you have to, trust me. Call the suicide prevention hotline, it’s not embarrassing or shameful, it’s quite the opposite
Bro if we all got to do this together...u can’t go anywhere
Don’t let depression win. That’s what it wants. Survive out of spite.
talk to me, hold on for a bit. I don't know who you are, but you matter. I am 17. I'm from Canada and I paint sometimes. What about you?
Hey, I’m here. It sounds like a lot of people are here and want to talk to you. Can you hang on for a bit and speak to one of us? I bet you’d be surprised that you aren’t alone. Please let us help.
I hope you have a change of mind
u/dead2oche Are you still here?
What are you thinking about? What will your final hours consist of?
No don’t. Tell me what u like to do in your free time
I attempted in April last year, honestly if you’re going to do it, could you try these things first.  1) Call your therapist if you have one, or your emergency contact if you have one.  2) go to the hospital and admit yourself.  I did both. I’m getting better, not exemplary but better.
Hugs.... whatever you are going through...know that you don't have to kill yourself... you matter...  I know you are in a great deal of pain right now... I see you... I get it.... It's hard... but hang in there....  You deserve to go on... you deserve good things too... ❤   Wishing you all the best...
Please wait and think about this okay . But just for now please talk to me . Um my name is Carter and i i like writing . i write when im happy and when im sad . but i find that when i write its usually deep and philisophical . i write about things i didnt know i knew . and it all pours out . im not sure if it helps or makes things worse . do you like to write ?
Why do you want to kill yourself?
I’ve felt like this before. It was when my life was coming to a mighty halt - where I was stuck between two options; die or die. At the time, there was no conceivable silver lining to grab at, no matter what I tried next, “my life was still shit” is what I thought. “There’s no way out of this one” I even chuckled, fully believing it. But, you know what? I chose life anyways. And now, looking back, I’m glad I did. I’m glad because it turns out that we don’t always know what our options are in the heat of the moment. There are things that simply just happen that can change everything. Even if they’re not “real”, physical things, these small, seemingly insignificant, things inevitably occur that have the power to change everything for us if we just take a second to calm down and let life throw the next hurdle at us. You can live. You can get past this plague that afflicts you. Have faith in your life, even if only to humor yourself.
Please don't. Every time I get to that I place I think of what it would be like to live on the other side. Imagine feeling good again if you can. If you kill yourself, you wont get to experience that. Pain is meaningless if you really think about it. Why risk missing out on joy? Pain is always temporary, but being dead is just a drag.
Don't do this. Please reach out, do anything other than harm yourself. I'm from Wisconsin
Life is a mess bro. Just searching people to talk to too. From the outside my life is so damn good, but Jesus if people knew how I feel.
I don’t know what to say to you anyway... But you are courageous that I know....  Please don’t die? I am sticking around, maybe you can too?
I love you
Please don't,  please💕
hey man i know it feels like all these people don’t care because it’s just the internet and you’re probably set on it. but trust me man i’ve seen people lose people to suicide and it’s so sad. i promise you things will get better i was in a shit place where i was doing drugs all day everyday constantly putting myself in positions to overdose. and i got my life back together and shit, took some time and thinking but man i promise you this shit gets better. you’ve hit rock bottom man only way to go is up
Let’s have a conversation about a meaningless topic I’ll start... do shadows move at the speed of light
You know, I love people like you... seriously. You're the type of person who can understand the daily, sometimes minute to minute struggle that I also go through.  You are in no way shape or form alone. I will never ever judge you for feeling like this ((I am almost certain that everyone here agrees)).  You probably have a brilliant and deep thought process about everything that you encounter. I am willing to bet that you're intelligent, interesting af, and creative as all get out.  I have tried really really hard to end my life 3 times in the past, and I'm glad that I failed.  It may seem like everything is shit, and you may feel like you hate yourself, but you might just not see the absolutely magical and amazing individuality that you bring to existence... just by existing.  For me, I know that nobody is exactly like me, and my times in the hospitals, introduced me to many other never before seen, amazing, beautiful, individuals.  I love you, because, you understand. I hope you're still with us. The war may never end, but this battle can be won. You're amazing.
Don’t do it! The world will be so much better with you in it
Tommorow is another day for you to improve your self and others life is a train wreck some days and I know the feeling. I just look at what I have and think about what others would think. Family pets and friends what would they think if you died.
You are stronger than you think. You can keep going! I'm sending you love and high vibrations! You deserve to live.
I'm here, and I talk to you. <3
the world will still continue on , so why waste a life that could be healed
Please please please please don't kill yourself... It can get better. I know you must be in a terrible mental state right now but please don't let it get the best of you :(
Man I feel you and I’ve been in your shoes wanting to end it all but trust me it’s not the way.  Don’t let depression win conquer that fucking shit.
WAIT NO PLEASE. Please don’t do it please. I’ve attempted many times, and right now I feel like doing it but I know I shouldn’t. Neither should you. I care for you, even if I’ve never met you. Just knowing you feel the way I feel and so many others makes me care about you. Stay with us, us depressed people. Because we are here for each other.
Hey. What are you feeling right now? Has something happened?
Plz don’t do it, I’m begging you with all of my being. Don’t. One thing I’ve seen is that depression gives people some empathy and we need more empathy in this world. I know it sucks but please, you could be such a positive influence to someone someday.
please don't do it. i'm here; talk to me.
I don’t know what to say and how to say it right but I give my best wishes to you <3 I don’t know what struggles you’re going through, how you feel, but you intentionally made this post for a reason. I hope all of these commenters have helped you. There are amazing people like these out there, and you are one of them. I’m praying that you’re okay :)
I really hope you don't go through with this. I think you should give yourself a chance to see if your life can get better. The future isn't set in stone. Anything can change. Things are rough now but give yourself a chance to see if you will feel better. If you kill yourself, you're depriving yourself of a life that might actually make you feel happy. Suicide is permanent.   If there are crisis respite centers in your area, please go to one. If you feel like you need to be admitted in the ER, please go. Read out to anyone who you might talk to.   Don't go through with this. I'm rooting for you.
dude he made this account one day ago just to post this on two subreddits. thid doesn't look good
Please I hope you did not, mediate, breathe, there's always a new day full of opportunities
Still there buddy? Please tell me you're still here. Hopefully i can help. And I sincerely hope one day, you will fall in love with life again.  Talk to me if you need. Im always here, except for when i have schoolwork.
Im from the Philippines. Come visit the beaches here buddy. Should be on everyone’s bucket list for sure
Are you still with us mate?
Do you have any pets? They won’t know where you went..they will keep waiting for you, by the door, every single day. Every time the front door opens... “is he home yet? Is that him finally? Why did he leave me?” I have a cat and every time I think of this, it breaks my heart but also makes me want to continue to live. Pets love you unconditionally.

Alright let me assume that he/she will never get better  and let them kill themselves thinking that there was no other choice. That sound better?
This actually works. He wants the dude to think about it so he gets scared and doesn't do it

Ah, I get it. Never mind.

Don't you want to see your kids reach milestones?  You seem hammered based on your typing. I'd avoid making a huge decision like suicide while hammered.   Your kids will miss you. Imagine what it will be like to watch them go to prom, graduate, get jobs, have kids of their own, etc.
get better.
[removed]
[removed]
Your ex-wife gave you two kids. You should be happy for her. Lower middle class ain't bad. Your existence is not pointless because you have your two kids to live for. As far as working until you're 70, join the club. I'm 29, so I've got 41 years to go.
alright
[removed]
What did she do to make you hate her so much? Is her only crime living a better life without you?
[removed]
If you kill yourself, do you think even a tiny part of her would feel any guilt? If you want to get back at her, you could surprise her by living your best life. What you are doing now gives her all of the power.
[removed]
I understand wanting to just end it all. I was bullied, but I am glad I never let what my bullies did to me cause me to end my life. They would have only laughed about it. Fuck them. They don't have all of the power and neither does your ex-wife. Who cares what that bitch does? She might look good on the outside, but women like her are a dime a dozen.
Don’t do it. You are most likely THE positive influence in you kids lives. Be honest with yourself, do you really think your kids will turn out alright if someone as messed up as your ex wife is raising them? You offer something your kids probably don’t get from their mother, pure love for your children. Your kids DESPERATELY need you so please don’t go.
[removed]
What do you mean, Nahhh...?
[removed]
You're giving her the power to make you feel worse. Why do that? No matter what she does, she should not be able to make you want to end things.
So I guess you're just going to let her keep your balls in her purse even though she's not with you anymore. No wonder you want to off yourself. Maybe if you never let her control how you feel, you wouldn't even have made this post.
[removed]
[removed]
Think of how it will feel to live your best life. Think of how it will feel to tell her you got a new job that you love that also pays well. It's got to feel good.
Ok, I get it, but why give up hope on making your life better?
[removed]
[removed]
It can happen without luck. It may take a while, but it can happen with hard work. If it does, don't even tell her anything. She will know anyway, and not telling her will make it better. Like literally, ignore her questions and her in general. Your body language will give away everything, but she won't have any reason to ask for the increase because she won't know.
Stats mean absolutely nothing. Nobody who ever succeeded at anything waited to see if the odds were in their favor. They just did it. What do you have to lose from trying? You are already about to take your own life. Why not at least try to make it better? At least go down swinging.
[removed]
I know what you mean, but if you just start trying different things, there's no telling where it could get you. You'll have to break it down bit by bit. Scope in to see one thing you need to work on, then scope out to see the bigger picture. Take your typing for example, that can be easily fixed (maybe not a big priority right now, but it helps). You can improve that and see the small increase in confidence spill into other things. You can also move into more difficult things to improve like grammar (God knows I need that myself). You will begin to write better emails, communicate better, and this may even be noticed by your boss.  I have mentioned very small things, so you may want to focus on improving other things to have the biggest impact, but I'd rather spend my life fixing one small thing at a time then spend the rest of it feeling miserable.  Here is my logic: if you are going to end your own life, why not at least try every opportunity you have in front of you before doing so? Hell, I would even try an extreme sport or something. Why not at least go skydiving before you end it all? Spend all of your money on a trip to Europe. Go skiing in Aspen. If you hate your job, then quit. Wander the earth.  I know you're tired. You've been living the same way for a long time, and it has gotten you nowhere, so it figures. At least try something crazy/fun on this earth before you end your life.

Honestly, idk wtf to think about not killing myself. Now that I’ve survived rock bottom I’m pretty much stuck cuz its not like there’s any reason to put an end to this shit anymore. I mean, don’t take this seriously, but shit; sometimes I wish I killed myself just so I could avoid the aftermath of everything that’s happened. Like, fuck me. This is some bulllllllshit.

Well, why not learn who to associate with instead of wasting your time on very obvious men who only think of themselves coming from a 19 year old guy. I mean it's obvious, I don't associate with anyone who just thinks about themselves. I may live in isolation but at the very least there's no person to put me down. I will always wait until I meet the right person.

Ok so, this is my first time posting here, so don't go too harsh on me please.    I'm 18, and a few weeks ago I've been diagnosed with depression after 10 or so years, and since then I've been taking antidepressants everyday. 4 months ago, I lost my grandpa due to a heart attack, and I believe this has influenced very negatively my depression. I had never been suicidal until 1 month ago. It all started with worse thoughts than usual such as "You shouldn't even be alive", "Why don't you just kill yourself? You'd be more famous dead than alive anyway", "Do everyone a favor and just end your life, please" and so on. 3 days ago I tried to kill myself, I wanted to cut my arm so that I'd die due to bleeding, but I didn't make it... I couldn't even had the courage to do what I was supposed to do. Now I have to live with a scar that'll remind me of that time I failed at killing myself. I failed everyone, I've always done that. I've always hurt and pissed off people who tried to help me out of pity. I'm just worthless, I should've been gone long time ago, and now that I had the chance to finally find peace I couldn't make it... I don't have any friends, and I've trust issues due to past relationships. The current classmates I have, they try to act kind, polite and ready to help you whenever you need them, but then as soon as I try to give a sign, they just ignore it... while they all show affection and love towards one another sharing hugs, kisses on the cheeks and other gross shit. I just wish I could get some affection too, but I guess I'm just asking too much. Who'd love a person like me anyway? I'm just a failure to everyone. I just wanna die, I can't bare with this pain anymore...   Sorry for this rant, had to get shit off my chest...
You're not worthless, you matter

M(23) , I do not know what to do. Depression is hitting me like train and when things are gettin little bit better , it hits me again and again.  For few years I am always trying to help my friends to find a love or achieve something , helping them with their relationships , schools, financial support, motivation speeches and so on. It drains my energy away, but I really want to help other people.  I am helping others but I can t help myself. When I was younger I used to study lot, was best student at high school.  Now I am in collage, but i am here stuck like in the prison for 3 years. I do not want to finish this damn school.   But my stupid family around me is pushing me to it. I am Mentally bullied by them, "I will never die in peace when you will not graduate" , "You will  work forever  in the shop market" , "look at your cousins they are doctors and You just work in the shop" ...   They never ask me about my feelings , my dreams , my goals... But my dream is having lovely wife and have a kids. I dont need to be dentist, programmer, doctor or teacher I just wanna be happy...   To be honest I never had a normal relationship before. Only once, one sided.   Of course she comes back to her exboyfriend who abuse her. Because he was a "man". Like she said. I was only boy trapped in the male body. Yes ofcourse, but that boy literally saved her life, always stands up for her, got stabbed 2 times by some gypsy when he tried to rob her, found her job, she was conflict type so I had to defend her or beat guys who was tried to punch her cuz she was acting like bitch and all other shits I done for her.  My communication skills are not that bad. I think I am not even bad looking, I used to workout for 5 years straight. But everytime I try  to "date" some girl it ends in few days. Did not even obtain kiss. But I am just that kind of guy in the group who is acting like completely idiot, telling jokes , do stupid stuffs just to make them smile. This shit is my fuel to survive another day in this world.   My mood is switching to depression from laughter in the number of second like 10 times per day or after masturbation. And every day it s getting worse and worse. I cant get happy from anything , I lost my way in the life, do not know what I want to do when I left schooI,  Covering pain with laughter is slowlly killing me.  Just wanna get a hug from someone after tought day, pat my head , whispering in my ear , I dont need sex I just wanna be loved.  Sorry for my english I study it for only 3 years, maybe I just wanted write myslef there to reduce my stress.

Why is it so hard to stay clean? as soon as I stop smoking weed I get so bored with my existence and being sober, I immediately start to consider drinking again.

My life has become unbearable. My job ruined my mental hecalth and Im in a hopeless situation with no way out. I wish I could disappear. Nothing helps. I cant do anything because Im so tired and have no money. I just feel like Im gonna crack and explode at some point. All I want to do is sleep. I sleep through all my days off. I have zero motivation to cook or clean. The only source of joy  have is the Ball Python Im going to get and since its winter, its too dangerous to have her shipped to me now because she could freeze and that just makes it worse because its the one thing I have to look forward to.   No one cares about how Im suffering. My family doesnt care. No one else cares.Im meaningless to everyone. I just want a different life.  Im reaching my breaking point and I cant stop it.

With every day that goes by studies feel less and less important. Right now I open a book and start listing the things I think I don't need to learn, and before I know it I've listed so many things that I just give up. Studying in general just feels like a complete waste of my time. I keep trying again and again but I lose any focus I had in just a minute or two and my mind wanders off to something else. I have an important test tomorrow (which starts a series of other tests), I haven't studied once this whole year and now 5 minutes are all I can muster before I lose interest and either go do something else or start thinking about something else.  Why aren't we just allowed to study what we want? Like learn the basics of all subjects and then choose 1 thing to go deeper into, why do I have to study so much material that I'm 90% never gonna need to use ever? This feels like a cliche "I was born in the wrong time (or generation, if you will)" scenario where the whole process of studying hasn't yet evolved to the point where I need it to be. I was never a good student to begin with but I had some basic curiosity. Now to me if something isn't immediately useful then it's not worth learning it.  Studies aside, even the things I do on my own just seem like nothing more than passing the time, as if I'm waiting for something to happen, or something to end. At this point I feel like I could give anything just to die...
Hey my friend . I live in a country that I'm in it's 9th grade of school . We have 13 different subjects every year that we can't choose wich ones to study . I don't want to say "You have to be happy that you're not me" . I'm just saying this is life , we can't change it at all . The fucking school is the jail of teenagers . It won't change until about 50 years later at least , and we can't do anything about it . I'm depressed from 2 months ago . There are people near me and I have friends but still I feel alone soo much . I couldn't get up from the bed today because I was soo tierd to continue this shitty life . I really don't care if I die just right now
Yeah I feel you, same situation here. At least eventual future generations won't have to go through this hopefuly
Yeah I hope too . I hope they don't overthink about the school , exams , heavy subjects and having anxiety about their future ..

I'm 19 and I'm struggling to get into college because of my motivation. I don't have a driver's license and struggled getting good grades in school. I graduated in 2019 and took a gap year so I can control and heal my mind from my mental health issues I faced during school. I was tormented constantly in middle school and high school because of my ADHD and autism, which gave me my depression and anxiety in the first place. I thought that maybe being at home for a year would work out for me but it's evident that my mother is worse than the bullies I've dealt with during school. It doesn't help either that my younger sister talks down to me and says I blame everything wrong with me and what I'm going through on everyone else.  I live in a very toxic household in a nuclear family. My mom constantly says that I feel sorry for myself. She always says that I'm selfish and I never think about anyone else. I'm tired of her saying that she understands what I'm going through even though she's a complete mess herself. For the past seven years, she micro-manages and heavily restricts me from the internet for no apparent reason. She says that everyone on the internet doesn't care about my problems and that I don't have time to be depressed and for me to suck it up.  I don't have any irl friends to speak of and I don't have any internet friends at all. I feel alone even when I'm around the family. Being around her is exhausting. She never takes responsibility for what she does or tries to improve her behavior or admit that she's wrong. My mom is emotionally abusive and sometimes threatens to burn my art supplies or take all of my electronics away over the most stupid things I mess up on. She never takes what I say seriously. She keeps telling me to make friends but I can't since she barely allows me to go online or leave the house. I have to sneak around so I can have access to the internet. My mom is the only one other than my dad who knows the password to my laptop and uses a Screentime app on my phone for no reason.   My depression and anxiety worsened during October and November ever since my great grandma died of a stroke. I fell into a deep depression after that and had dark thoughts after that. She told me that my depression is self-induced because of the fact that my grandmother died and that I need to move on.  I've constantly asked her about doing art commissions ever since I was 13 so that I can be independent but she either ignores me and walks off or she gives some stupid reason why I can't do  it.   I isolate myself from my family so that I don't have to be around anyone. My mom made me dislike being around humans in general.
You are over 19 so look into moving in with other family members or get some sort of job. You are at an age where she shouldn't control you
My extended family lives primarily in Texas and Tennessee. I've been constantly asking her for me to get a job and she would act like she cares but not help me at all. She treats me like a child and barely allows me to act like an adult.
My mom told me I can only live with my extended family if in the case of her and my dad dying. She said that they would move here and watch over us.
She has no legal say in where you live. You are an adult
Thank you for helping me.
Something new happened? Another thing is you should always get your paperwork if you decide to leave. Mainly your birth certificate and social security card. You need to know your social security number.
I don't even know my social security number, I don't have my certificate, my  card, or my debit card. My mother insists on treating me like a child because she thinks I can't handle being an adult.    Today, I feel asleep while watching something she was showing me and she snapped at me. She decided that she was going to take all of my electronics away, which is going to make me have really dark thoughts.   My mom has no regard about my mental health and doesn't give a shit if I have friends or not.  I don't know why but I despise her with every fiber of my being.   She always has to be right all the time and always assume what my mood is. I hate every single day I have to wake up and deal with her. I'm tired of it.  The only times I ever feel happy is when I'm online or playing videogames with my dad/myself.  I've been starving myself so that my mom would treat me with the least amount of respect for me. I weigh 122.2 lbs as of today.   My mom makes me hate being alive, especially because of the fact that I'm a premature baby who had a 95% chance of dying. I just feel like a mistake.

Tw: depression and suicidal thoughts.   My boyfriend of almost 2 years is being extremely depressed and suicidal. Hes started smoking again, even. Not taking care of himself properly.  He's doing his best to push me away and break up with him. He's saying all these hurtful words that makes me question everything weve been through, but i still refuse to believe what hes saying right now. Hes told me that I'll be able to find someone else better and I'll move on quickly once he take away his life, which is clearly not the case    I tried asking him to get professional help... that I'll help him with the finances if his family wont help funding it... but he refuses to and tells me that hes fine. He's building up a wall between us and i do not want to ever lose him. I really dont know what to do anymore to him.   I always give him my full support, i do love him so much and truly care for him but on the other hand I'm also getting tired, and struggling with my own mental challenges.... i dont want my heart broken by his words.  I really... just need tips on how to cope with this. I need strength as well...
Unfortunately, I’m not able to provide you tips since I am going through somewhat similar situation and don’t know what to do as well :c But I can give you a very tiny tight hug, you’re lovely and amazing. Do try and take care of yourself first, for the situation can be draining, heart crushing and utterly confusing.

Hello, i don’t know who to talk to anymore because I feel like I am boring my friends and girlfriend  with this type of stuff and I feel like no one cares anymore even though they obviously do care about my mental health and what I have to say. A month ago I never would’ve described myself as depressed, I always thought that I had to go to a doctor and get diagnosed by a profession before I knew if I was depressed or not because I didn’t want people to think I’m just faking it or some shit or offend people that actually have depression. Honestly I still arent 100% sure wether I’m depressed or not but my girlfriend said that the way that I have been behaving lately really resembles depression and anxiety, I have intrusive thoughts, sometimes I can’t stop shaking and my head has this feeling that I have never felt before and it aches, other times I feel empty and hollow and detached from my feelings, I can’t even feel anything towards my girlfriend sometimes even though I know deep down that I love her so much but it’s frustrating that I can’t feel the love that I have for her. I am constantly in a shit mood where I just feel like no one likes me and get into what I can only describe as a self destructive mindset where I’m just tempted to end every friendship I have and my relationship for absolutely no reason other than “I am feeling bad”. I don’t even understand my own thoughts, feelings and I can’t even form my own opinion anymore my chest and head feel hollow, I have no motivation to do anything and I doubt/second guess/overthink everything that I think or say, even the simplest things while having a normal conversation with somebody who’s very close to me. I don’t know what is happening to me, I feel like it might be related to drug use, although I didn’t do any of that stuff nearly as much as some other people that I know and when I did it I, which I rarely did, I didn’t do much of anything, I have stopped doing any drugs or substances since. If it helps with answers or anything I am a 17 year old male idk how or why that would help but yea... I don’t really have a question or anything but any advice on how to get past this or something would be really really appreciated.

Not necessarily about anything specific, sort of a mix of things...but I will gladly accept words of encouragement or kind thoughts.
It’s ok to feel low. We are human. Just don’t make a home in the feeling. It will be better later.
I'm feeling quite low too. I've been crying a lot and couldn't sleep. But I believe that things will get better and we are not alone. It always has been.
Thank you 😊
I hope you feel better soon 😊

Hello everyone, I don't know if this is the right place to post this and I apology in advance if it isn't.  My academic life was never too good to begin with, but I feel that since covid broke out things have really started to fall apart. I attend a cultural heritage course in the university near my home town in southern Italy, the first three years were not too bad, I guess, I managed to pull off 4 out of 7 exams each year. Three-year courses in Italy are averagely made of 21 exams in total, with the credits per exam ranging from 6 to 12, the average being 9. A 9-credit exam, at least in my university, consists in 3.000+ pages of mandatory reads and several hours of classes, and then a 20-40 minutes oral interview with the professor. If you fail an exam, you have to wait for the next session (almost 3 months) to try it again. Most of the professors are very strict and easy to upset, they can make you fail an exam because of that one single silly question you didn't particularly look up. It has not happened to me in person, but it's not rare to see students cry or having an emotional breakdown during examination sessions because a teacher has started yelling or calling them names for them not knowing how to answer a question. A lot of them tried turning to authorities for verbal abuse but the police doesn't really care about this kind of matters because of our fuck\*d-up "me ne frego" mentality.   Not to mention that the taxes are pretty high, and they didn't get a lowering or a delay even though we're in a global pandemic and we're attending classes from home. Since the pandemic outbreak I only passed 2 exams, my mood has become very unstable because of all the factors mentioned above, plus the fact that I can't see my friends, I can't go to the gym, I can't go to the mountainside and I can't have any hobbies outside of watching TV or playing videogames. The pressing from my parents has always been there, but lately has become unbearable. They have doubled their work schedules to overcome the financial crisis and they're always stressed out, even though I'm helping them at work. All they tell me in our free time is that I'm not studying enough, that it's my fault if I don't pass the exams and I shouldn't blame the teachers or the global situation, that I only care about spending time with my girlfriend (yes, the law permits us to have a one-time visit to a close one each day, that's why I usually stay at her place when I'm off from work).   Tomorrow morning I have an exam, and the thought just won't stop obsessing me. I only managed to study 2 hours in the past week, because just the idea of sitting on a chair and reading up a cr\*p-load of papers over and over and then failing because of a single stupid question just makes me sick (I already failed this one exam in November). I seriously just want to quit and I don't remember why I wanted to pursue this path in the first place. When I finished high school I wanted to become a psychologist, but my parents persuaded me in choosing biology instead because they own an analysis lab. I absolutely hated it and quit after a few months, the next year I ended up signing for cultural heritage because it was the closest course to my high school background (I went to an artistic high school) and it sounded quite comforting to me, having previous knowledge of almost any subject. Going deeper in university I matured the idea of attending a counseling course after my graduation, pursuing a profession which is close to my original dream job, but it only looks like a distant hope at the moment and I feel like I have to move mountains to eventually (possibly) get there. The thought of spending at least 3 years more studying, living with my parents, without any personal income except the money they give me for my work at the lab scares the sh\*t out of me. Not to mention that my mood swings have started to negatively impact my relationship lately.  My alternative to the academic/counseling career would be writing. I love reading books, watching TV shows, playing games with deep narrative, and I always feel like I have a volcano of ideas in my mind but I can't put them to paper because I have no free time. Do any of you feel the same? Do you think that university here is legitimately very hard or is it just me being lazy? What do you think I should do? I know the choice is ultimately up to me but I really would like some feedback from strangers that are emotively detached from the sitaution to help me see things more clearly. Thanks for the read.

This is more of a vent than anything, because I don’t feel like I can talk to my friends about it and because I obviously can’t talk to my now ex, but to keep it quick (since I know anyone reading this already has a life and probably doesnt care much about mine), my friend died on January 12th, who I met through several other friends who all worked with him. I know this whole group of people through my roommate, who was dating said friend, and when she called me to tell me what happened we were both in tears (called because in early December I moved back in with my family after graduating from uni, I’m roughly 3,000mi away now). I haven’t heard much from them since and I realize they were all closer to him than I was, but I found out his funeral was today - not because any of them told me - but because one of them posted the memorial card from his service on their Snapchat story. I’ve been crying for days and I feel like an idiot because no one told me and since no one told me I guess I shouldn’t be as sad as I am, because I’m obviously not seen as someone who gets to know about when his fucking funeral is.   On an entirely different note, I had been informally seeing a guy for the past few months but knew it wasn’t working out, and since I moved about a month ago it’s only been getting more difficult. When my friend died it highlighted even more of our differences and I got to the point where I was too emotionally exhausted to keep trying when I already knew the relationship wasn’t working out, and it seemed wrong to keep it going just to have him as a crutch for my grief.   Anyways, now I’m alone in my room and I feel like a fucking idiot because it seems like I’m delirious for thinking I was entitled for any info about the friend that just passed away, and it seems like I’m an unloving bitch for ending things with someone who had been begging me to make things work. I feel like a piece of shit and I just want to forget I exist tonight.  Thank you if you’ve read this far, I just feel exceptionally lonely right now and wanted to find a place to vent.
I’m so sorry. Having the weight of life drop on you is difficult, it’s even worse if you have no one to help bear the weight with you. One way I would suggest to maybe ease the pain  is to go on walks, take a look at the world around you and reflect. Who knows maybe you’ll meet someone also. Also find something that you enjoy to keep yourself busy, or find a subreddit about something you enjoy. There are lovely subreddits with amazing communities.
I am so sorry you had to grieve the loss of a friend alone. Considering the current world situation they may have assumed you wouldn’t travel/couldn’t come. I understand your sadness is more about the not knowing than the not going but it may help you to think it had less to do you with you than you think. I tend to get sad/anxious thinking I suck when in reality most everyone is thinking the same. Sometimes it’s helpful to think outside that box. Also as far as the guy goes if it’s not right it’s not right. It would be convenient to have him around right now because you are feeling lonely but it’s even braver of you to be alone knowing it wasn’t working out and fair to either of you. Don’t beat yourself up 💕

I’ve been on Celexa 20mg for many many years and my depression has been under control. I wanted to give Wellbutrin a try because I’ve read that it may also help with my ADHD. My doc wants me to stay on Celexa as I adjust to the Wellbutrin XL 150mg.  I’m only on day three and out of no where I feel horribly depressed and sad like I haven’t in a long time. Is this normal, will this pass? Why is this happening if I’m still taking my Celexa?
I believe most anti depressants take 4 to 5 days before you'll start feeling "better". I was on cymbalta and the 1st week sucked, but I finally gave up after feeling like a zombie everyday.. I took wellbutrin years ago to help quit smoking but its been so long I dont remember the effects it had on me.. just hang in there the bad stuff should pass in.the next couple of days.

My 2nd session with my therapist is this week do I say anything about my suicidal thoughts and urge to self harm? I am not sure if I even want to keep her as a therapist yet she a specilize therapist in trauma so idk if she even works with people with those type of urges and feelings ....  Thoughts ? I'm an adult but also not looking to go into a mental hospital right now .
I would be honest about your thoughts and feelings. She’s trained to deal with suicidal thoughts and urges
What will happen?
If you have a plan, made preparations, and intend to follow through with it, probably end up getting hospitalized for your own safety.  If you have a plan but no intent, that’s going to set off alarms, but not necessarily mean hospitalization unless they seriously think you’re going to harm yourself imminently.   If you end up going to the hospital, you get assessed and you generally won’t be admitted unless they think you absolutely need to be there. I had a psychotic episode last summer and went to the hospital but wasn’t admitted, thankfully. Already been there, done that.  I’m open with my providers about suicidal thoughts and urges to self harm. I make it clear that I’m not intending to act on anything, I’m confident I can keep myself safe, and I’ll admit myself if I have to.
It depends. If you have a plan, you will be assessed. If not, coping skills and strategies will be taught to you. I’ve been hospitalized more than 16 times. It’s worth it to get help, than to hide it and for it to be worse.
Thank you so much!!

I’ve been feeling like this for a while and figured it would be nice to just get it off my chest. Ever since I was little I’ve noticed that I never had an interest in anything. I never fully grasped the importance of things. So when I started school I was mediocre at best. I suppose I did decent the first two years of middle school but once I reached 8th grade and into high-school I was a mess. I never did school work and just thought it was all meaningless. While at the same time my childhood friends where in advanced classes and where doing very well. I was falling behind so I decided to homeschool in order to be able to graduate early and also on time. I managed to do that and had graduated 2 years early. My original plan was to go to community college and study to become a physical therapist assistant. But I ended up withdrawing from my prerequisite classes. I decided to take a year off and get a job. Those didn’t last long either. My money management skills where horrendous too. I decided to take those prerequisites again but ended up failing half of my classes. Meanwhile my friends where almost finishing up school and already buying there first cars.   That was in 2018 fast forward to now. I’m going to finally take the entrance exam to see if I get accepted into the program but I’m very afraid I’m going to fail. I haven’t studied even though I should. I try to study but then I begin to doubt my self and think back on all the negative things and I just become paralyzed with fear. It hurts really bad seeing people my age go to college and even my friends getting accepted into schools while I’m here struggling. My parents went to college and some of my family members did too it hurts me knowing I can’t do something as basic as that all because I just couldn’t grasp the importance of it.   Although I’m 20 I feel like my life will amount to nothing since I’ve had so many great opportunities wasted. If I would have taken school seriously I would have been a physical therapist assistant by now. Apart from that all of my friends have their own cars and steady jobs and great credit. I just feel like I’m so behind and that I’m not going to catch up anytime soon.   I guess what frustrates me the most is how everyone seems to have this spark or sense of meaning. That has helped them with school and other things in life. I’ve never gotten that spark I’ve even asked people what motivates them or why did they do it but they couldn’t answer my question. This has been on my mind for a while but as I get older I feel like I’m running out of time and it scares me.
I would like to say congratulations! Sounds like you have been trying hard and alternative things when things have felt difficult! 💜  Although it sounds you are putting a lot of pressure on yourself and comparing yourself to others?   You are you, from what you have written you seem very determined 💜  It’s so easy for us to focus on paths we could of taken. Please don’t let this distract you from future ones.   Easier said than done, take a breath and perhaps write your achievements. I can see you already have many 💜

So I’ve been on Prozac for over a year and have literally had zero interest in sex. It’s horrible and can’t imagine it’s healthy to not ejaculate for weeks and months. Anyway I got myself on Tadalafil for a month so that watching porn would get me hard and I’m forcing myself to have a wank every day. I can tell you that my mood is better and I feel better about myself. So even if you are like me and have very little libido give this a try and it slowly starts to help things.

Like the title says, I'm(14f) thinking that it'd probably be best for me and my mental health to go back to the mental hospital and sort some things out.  I've had issues with self harming for a number of years now and I've never stopped for longer than maybe 2 months. I've started up again and am starting to worry that if I don't address it now I'll only continue to get worse. My cutting has gotten bad and is crossing over into borderline addiction. I've noticed that no matter how much I do I still never think it's enough but I'm starting to think that it's probably way worse than I realize.   I admitted to my therapist that I had been cutting again when I was pretty high and have emailed her about it a few times. She asked me "What do you feel like you need to best support you right now?" And I've really been thinking about that. The thought of going back to the mental hospital has been on my mind so this isn't an impulse decision sort of thing.  So, simple. Right? I just need to tell my mom and get myself admitted into the mental hospital. Simple really.  Nope.  I've never been very open with my family, it's always been hard for me to talk with them about my personal affairs in a serious manner. I know that going to the mental hospital would be good for me, probably the best thing for me to do for my mental health right now. I just dont know how to go about bringing this up to anyone. I don't know how they might react so I'm hesitant to say anything at all. Plus, no one knows that I've been cutting. I dont know if my family could afford me going to the mental hospital or if they could mentally handle the fact that I've been cutting myself. I want to look out for them but I also know that I really need to care about myself and do what's best for me and my mental health. I need to take care of myself too. I'm not sure what to do and honestly any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.   If you wound up reading this far then thank you for hearing me out and I hope you have an amazing rest of your day/night <3
Just tell your mom that you don't feel safe.   Expand on that as needed, but if you feel you need the hospital then, do what you need to (safely) to get there.  I hope things work out.
Tell your family to take all sharp things away from you. It will suck when you are looking for them but you need to act now while you are thinking more clearly
I'm not with my mom atm, I'm at my dad's house

Anytime I try to vent to my parents about how sad I feel they literally sing “let it go” from frozen to me and it makes me so angry
Wow that’s extremely dismissive & invalidating.
Well that sounds irritating. I hope you can get the help you deserve
Yeah it’s hurtful especially since (trigger warning) two years ago I had a suicide attempt over the very thing they’re singing to me about. You’d think they’d remember having to sleep next to me, be home at all hours, not let me lock doors, taking away everything sharp, not letting me around medicine and having to make me promise not to Kill myself every night but now it’s just a joke apparently
That’s so much
I'm sorry if you wanted me to say more :(
Oh sorry! I meant thanks so much stupid spelling error
Oh I see! I'm sorry I jumped to conclusions... Its OK :) I'm here if you need anything BTW

Im not sure if this is the right sub nor did I know what to title it, but honestly I feel like im just watching as my own live is being carried out and I cant control it. Like im not sure how to explain this properly but its like the seen in Click when Adam Sandler is fast forwarding to the future and just sees himself living life but not being able to control it. And i fucking hate feeling like this, like theres no quality to life its just watching and realizing how shitty everything is. I don't know if im the only one but I absolutely hate this but dont know how to change it or even have the motivation or will power to, hell I struggle just getting out of bed and doing something like studying.
Sounds like derealization (detached from environment) and maybe depersonalization (detachment from self) to me.  I’ve definitely been there. Look into some grounding techniques and try them out until you find something that works. Mindfulness exercises can also help.
I didn't know it was an actual thing, another thing i have to worry about now, but thank you for the suggestions

For 5 years now I've worked a job full-time. And for the majority of those 5 years the thought has lingered in the back of my mind that trying to cope with the lifestyle is driving me into a deeper pit.  Yet.. I continued to do it, day by day. And only now have I reached a point where I'm unable to focus, where there is genuine concern for productivity on the company's side, and where I feel like enough is enough.  Ultimately I don't think I'm 'well' enough to work anymore.. It's simply too much. And no amount of words can really convey just how bad a state my head is in, and just how heavy on my mind it is when I 'have to' work every day of the week.  I'm at a point where I feel enough is enough, and I need to take what contributes so much excess stress & pressure to where I can't cope anymore and put it aside; in this case, my job.  What I want is to be out of work for a while whilst I get better... Having spoken to a psychiatrist I've had an initial diagnosis of Mixed Anxiety & Depressive Disorder.. With a further suggestion of yet unconfirmed Bipolar Disorder. Work knows about this. They don't care, and why should/would they?  I live at home with my father, I'm 25, have been in this job for 5 years.. And could probably get by with the drop off of income... Although yeah, less nice things. I'm obese, and have unhealthy coping habits that I need to work on.  Meanwhile, at work, there's significant stress & pressure because of the workload our team has.. But there's always a significant workload.. Though still I find it difficult to not blame myself for being the reason colleagues will likely have to pick up the slack... But even if I wanted to help, I know that I can't anymore..  My parents seem onboard with getting out of work to get better... My plan consists of firstly eliminating that work stress & pressure, having more time & motivation to exercise, time to maybe get back into hobbies, and also to find passion in something once lost.. I used to be passionate about programming but the industry I work in, role, & full time lifestyle has taken it away. Maybe with more time I could shift that passion once again to something I do wanna do, like maybe developing my own video game.. It could be cool.  I just feel like a failure regardless though.. Like in the eyes of society I'll be nothing. I'll be letting work down, my boss, colleagues even... But I don't know what else to do.  I live in the UK, so I dunno... I guess sick leave should be the first step while I think about handing my resignation in (if work doesn't sack me).  I'd appreciate any input / opinions / etc.. Especially if you've had to take a similar route and how it impacted you, whether it was worth it, any advice, etc..
How much sick leave and holiday pay do you have? If you want to quit anyway maybe use all that up first?  I took three months off work, (I had two back to back jobs of horrendous bullying and needed time for myself) and it was great, I saw a therapist, got new meds. Now I’m at a new job, only part time, off my meds, can exercise. It helped a lot taking time for myself, I’m not “fixed” but at least I don’t cry every day now. If you can afford to take time for yourself then go for it, even if it’s for a short time!
I mean the company doesn't do sick pay, so I have to get that via SSP (Statutory sick pay). I have 25 days holiday, 28 including the 3 carried over from last year.. But I can't take them because of workload, they simply won't sign off on them unless I were to submit it as an 'emergency' holiday which goes against my file anyway...  As for sick leave the company works on a basis of sick 'occurrences', and I think its like x many occurrences in 12 months hits a warning, verbal warning, some other shit, and discipilinary. I know I'm already up there in the 'concerned' level, it has come up a few times.  I was off sick 2 weeks before christmas due to COVID, and as far as my boss was concerned; that was all the 'holiday' I need off over christmas lol.  I'm in a spot where I've been home working and now my boss wants me in the office because it would 'make his life easier' regardless of issues raised relating to my diagnosis, and lockdown.. I've told him I can't be in the office with how I am, whether he wants to account it against lockdown or my mental illness/disorder.. Said he'd need to raise it further up.. He's noticed a drop off in productivity and I can barely get any work done anymore because my head is always elsewhere.  I've been told that HR & Head of ops want a meeting following the diagnosis, painted as a "what can we do for you" situation, but its just because they noticed a drop off in productivity, and there's nothing they can do.  Next work day is tomorrow... I can't deal with it anymore.. And ultimately I wanna resign... I've thought about asking for significantly reduced hours but it feels like an empty request and more a compromise, although I think it could be a waste of time going through the contractual amendments/agreements for it (if they even approved of it) to then still wanna quit.  Calling sick & having a doc sign me off via a fit for work assessment or whatever seems like the most expedient solution until I submit resignation or whatever.  Honestly; I don't have a damn clue what I'm doing or how I should handle the situation, feel like I'm drowning, and am attempting to barely keep my head above the water lol
You get a warning for taking too many sick days? What a joke lol This company makes it sound like you are just a number and they only care about themselves.  At least if you quit/get fired they will pay you out, so that’s a bonus.  Getting a doctor to sign off on that will be helpful to, you will get benefits from the government so at least you will have some income coming in.  I think for your mental health, it’s best to take time for yourself and if or when you want to go back to work (if ever) you will feel better by doing some self care and looking after yourself
Pretty much just a number. I told them about my issues 5 years ago when I started and it got forgotten about. I also brought them a doctors note / fit for work assessment before covid hit recommending workplace adaptions such as working from home. The only reason I was able to work from home was covid... The mental health stuff got swept under the rug and was a lesser priority. Additionally my boss made the comment that the fit for work note had a date range.. So I guess he thinks after x weeks of working from home I must be cured. He definitely doesn't get the whole mental illness side of things.. It's no secret to people.  But yeah, they're only showing a degree of concern now because it's affecting my productivity & they have pressure from 3rd parties on one of our priority projects right now... Otherwise, they don't care. They just obviously don't wanna go through the efforts of having to find a replacement for my role and to lose 5 years of experience & familiarity in the business.  I feel like I have to force myself to be 'cold' as a person right now... I know I need to be out of work to get better, yet I can't help but obsess over what people at work will think, and put myself on the border of a panic attack near consistently.  But yeah... I appreciate what you said.. I feel like I need to confine my head in this space of "I'm not well enough to work", to try to ignore thoughts about work's perspective.. And to lock myself in sick leave until either I submit a resignation, or work gets rid of me (I doubt they'd do it though as they'd want a handover done at some point between myself and a less experienced colleague).  Thanks for taking time out of your life to put some words my way.. I appreciate it..
can you get a review from your doctor and still work from home ? Yeah, sounds like they don’t care and are just worried about their business failing more than your health.  It’s very daunting not working, when I decided to take time for myself the first question I was asked was “when are you going back to work?” People are very self involved and if you don’t fit into the norm, people judge you very quickly. My own mum would tell me, “it’s not normally to not be working, you need to fix that.” But she eventually saw the toll it took on me and understand more. But even if people don’t understand then fuck em lol. You need to look out for yourself and do what’s best.   No worries, I enjoyed it. Let me know how it goes !
I could get a review and get that pushed.. But I've been working from home and have still hit that same point of being unable to focus because my head is everywhere else except on the task in front of me... It's pretty bad...  I'm just so exhausted now.. Everyone has a different opinion... Some to just quit work for a while, some to take sick leave, some to stick at it for the routine, etc... Pretty overwhelmed.  Feels weird to be paralysed by my own anxiety. Stuck in a vacuum... I'm starting to doubt my own intelligence & sense of self, because others seem to think I should do differently... But I know all that is from a conditioned mindset as people of the same society in that work is just something we're expected to do for most of our lives... I can't exactly blame them for that.. I just hope I'm right in feeling the way I feel in that I need to be out of work for however long it turns out to be... Idk anymore..  Self harm, near constant borderline panic attacks, just tonight my brain was on overload with anxious thoughts that I gave myself a damn headache..  Am I alive, see the world a different way, feel it differently? Or just another +1 to the broken brain count with chemical imbalance... Idk anymore..
Is the unfocused from depression/anxiety? I get 'brain fog' which makes it difficult to concentrate and haven't really found anything that helps sorry.   Everyone always has an opinion but what do you want to do? I know you are confused about what to do but do you feel strongly about one way? Can you go anywhere at the moment, even for a weekend away to get a change of scenery?   There is no wrong or right way to feel. Just be kind to yourself, it's not a race to figure out what to do, some people never do. I think taking time for yourself will be a good thing, even a new job eventually because going back to the company you are currently at sounds detrimental to your health.   Are you on any medication or getting help for your anxiety/depression? Its not a fix but it can help.   In my opinion, I think you need to take some time for yourself, have a break, and work on yourself by doing things you enjoy. Find enjoyment in things again because we often forget that when we feel overwhelmed and depressed. Just be kind to yourself and look after yourself.
Yeah the lack of focus stems from depression/anxiety... Sometimes sure it's brain fog, especially after I got covid around christmas time.  But primarily these days its anxiety & depression in the ways of my mind being so congested with other thoughts. Worrisome thoughts, suicidal thoughts, depressed thoughts, anxious thoughts, and you may know how it is with anxiety where one thought becomes another 2 thoughts as you inevitably beat yourself up over your inability to focus etc..  I feel strongly about getting out of work.. It's just a question of whether I should be trusting that feeling. The only reason I doubt the feeling is because of mixed opinions from people I've asked / talked to about it. As for getting away, with covid & lockdown I don't really see that as an option.. Moreso that's me using those factors as an excuse, just about any significant change or journey brings up anxiety.. Like the idea of a new route, etc. But tbh, it's been a while since me and/or the family had an actual holiday... So maybe that's something I can think about doing this year.  Used to be on Sertraline (SSRI) a couple years ago for about 6 months. I felt like it was working, but ended up crashing and because I may be Bipolar the whole thing was somewhaf reminiscent of a manic period whereby I was splashing out on buying things to feel better & all that until an inevitable drop.. Tbh it was probably wrong of me to stop taking it. Recently having been put through to a psychiatrist I've been recommended to take up the meds again.. But obviously with effects generally not being noticed for months it's no 'quick fix', or maybe even ever a fix.. I know people on anti depressants etc that still struggle to a bad degree.  I appreciate you taking the time to put your thoughts my way.. I'm of a similar mind where I feel I need to disconnect for some time as a broken, worn out cog in the machine that is work life.. Enjoyment in things is something I'd love to gain again - I'm so dissociated from things I once enjoyed, or friends I'd speak to etc. I've spent so much time in bed just watching stuff & repeatedly scrolling through reddit & shit like that whilst still having work be a significant crux on my mind. It's definitely felt 'empty' of late.
You had Covid, I know that's not what I should be focusing on but what was it like? I haven't spoken to or know anyone who has had it. Is your boss aware of this? They shouldn't want you back in the office if you have had it, I know Australia is very strict about letting people return to the workplace after getting it. Oh definitely, an anxious mind is not a fun place to be. Have you tried 'Grounding'? when thoughts run away from you, you try to name things around you so it brings you back to the present and gain some control over your thoughts. It might not work for you but you could try it out.  What about taking unpaid leave from work? Take some time off but there is still that security of being employed if you decide to go back. Going away on a trip doesn't have to be an extended thing, it could be for a few hours, a day, two days. I believe that getting away for a little time is helpful, even it's only 20 minutes away from where you live, I love going for a walk or having lunch by a river and just peacefully watch the world go by in my own little world for a while. Even finding a new movie or book to dive into, I don't know if it's escapism but not being focused on my own problems for a while helps.   It might be something to look into especially with anxiety, depression, and bipolar. How often were you in contact with your doctor when you were on it? My doctor, who is great, when I was put on them, I had a two week follow up and then a monthly review every month after. It's something we really monitored to make sure they were working for me, if they didn't, we changed them until we found something helped. Anti-depressants aren't a magic cure but they can help for me they stopped racing thoughts but it doesn't help 100% of the time, it just makes life a little easier. Something to talk to your doctor or psych about if their techniques arent helping as much as they should.  This is something I've been working on, my psych asked me 'do you know how to enjoy life and have fun?' I cried. It was something I hadn't thought about and it messed me up because I realized I no idea how to enjoy life.   Try to find something you enjoy, something that you used to love or something completely new, don't be scared of new experiences. It's all about shifting your focus, make work and work stress the lesser focus, and your health and happiness to the front. Its easier said than done but being selfish and putting yourself first is what we need to do when we feel like this. Its no problem talking to you about this! It makes me feel less alone knowing someone else feels the way I do.
I always find it curious how the people that suffer in the darkest of places are the ones that manage to find some light to shine on another, but typically not themselves... So you should know how thankful I am that you took the time. And at that, it sounds like you're on the mend to a degree which is awesome to hear.  I did have COVID, or at least I got tested positive & felt unwell lol, I know the world is a right political shit show of conspiracies and all sorts of madness atm. It was honestly not that bad for me... Like, it sucked don't get me wrong, but in contrast to what I deal with mentally most days it was almost a breath of fresh air as fucked up as that might sound.. I guess more a distraction if anything... Perhaps I'm deluded though, because I was off work for near 2 weeks I believe while I was working from home...  Basically felt like I had asthma out of nowhere. Rough throat, headaches, fatigue, dry cough. The worst part was the breathlessness which brought on a consistent-ish light headedness.  So anything beyond 'resting' would cause me to be short of breath etc.. Like readjusting in bed, or a trip to the bathroom, etc. I pretty much just lay solitary for most of it while wearing a mask around the house to protect family. Somehow / fortunately no one else seemed to pick up anything... Though I was being careful where I could with wiping things down & wearing the face mask.  Oh yeah, work and my boss is aware of it alright... As far as my boss was concerned over christmas, the time off sick with covid was all the 'holiday' I needed over christmas... So that was a bit of a slap in the face. Because there's some priority projects and he doesn't want to have to communicate non verbally so it's like COVID is now non existant or something, or even my own mental illness/disorder lol.   To that end, I've just now been signed off work for 2 weeks initially, had medication reintroduced, and had the crisis line contacted by the GP to get in touch I guess.. Probably because of the key notes like 'self harm' being brought up, and suicidal ideation.  I completely 100% understand that vibe of getting away into nature and just sitting with the world with nothing burdening you at that time. Grounding is something I try to do, mindfulness and all.. But damn it's not easy... Sometimes I think I'm smarter than I'd like to be... I'm very introspective & question most thoughts & things about the world... So even when helping myself I'm still questioning or thinking things over lol.. Being conscious of the fact you're just trying to ground yourself because you feel a certain way begs the question as to whether you should ground yourself, if its the best way to do so, and whether you're right to feel the way you do and if you should even have to fight back, what are the consequences of that, what contributes to that feeling etc.. It's like a never-ending tunnel of self examination etc  I've considered unpaid leave but the main drawback on that is income and it getting a little awkward if I need to apply for support / benefits in some capacity.. So sick leave is the goto for now anyway so I have SSP coming in whilst I figure out the best next step. Trying to stay 'cold' towards work & not obsess over what they think etc.  The main reason I smoke weed is to slow my brain down and just be able to process things a little simpler & laugh / take in humour more easily lol.  I seem to cry whenever I say something about having someone care or not being alone, because it emphasises just how deep a pit of loneliness it is that resides inside me.  Definitely hope to find enjoyment in hobbies again... Seems like it might be possible, I feel a little better not having work looming over my head & confining where my brain is allowed to be for the sake of productivity..
I think it's because we can sympathize with others. Most of the time people who have never experienced depression just can't wrap their heads around it and want us to 'get over it'. It's not that simple, if it were a lot of people would be out of a job. You don't need to be thankful, im glad you find my thoughts helpful haha. As for myself, I'm getting there. I have been through a lot in the last 12 months and it has taken a major toll on me. Im better but now I have thoughts and emotions that I didn't have before so that has been a lot to deal with.  Ive heard its just like really bad pneumonia, which what your symptoms sound like. It sounds terrible, im sorry you went through that. I get it, new problems are sometimes easier to focus on than your old ones. Its good to hear how vigilant you were with it, a lot of people make light of it.   Your boss just sounds like a dick haha. Covid was a vacation for you, yeah right!  Im so glad you went and saw your GP and got some time off work! I hope the meds work for you, you probably already know but try to take them at the same time every day, it makes a big difference. I hope it helps with the self-harm, I don't want you to hurt yourself.   I get that, my therapist told me to start journaling and write down my feelings and I laughed. She told me to write things like 'journaling is stupid' which I did but it still didn't inspire me to write more. I think grounding is more of a way to distract yourself, to get your mind to stop overthinking.   Yeah taking some leave will be good, try not to think about work which is easier said than done. Try not to obsess about the next step too much, just enjoy the time off.   Relatable! A lot of people say they are there for you when they arent, it feels like something they have to say. When someone shows me kindness it makes me cry, its so rare these days and I just dont expect to get it  I hope so, find something you enjoy with your time off, even if that is just sitting on the couch in your underwear watching tv haha

I try to get up and do things every day, but doing anything feels like climbing a mountain.  Nothing brings me pleasure. I go out to eat at my favorite restaurant, going for walks, hanging with friends. It's nice, but I don't feel anything from it. I don't even play videogames anymore because I don't see the point.  A week ago, I got prescribed Wellbutrin, but it had the opposite effect, as well as horrible side effects. I didn't eat for two days, didn't sleep for two days, got very irritable, and felt worse. I stopped them, and my psychiatrist still hasn't gotten back to me about what new medicine to take. I just want to get better.  Its weird for people to think I'm fine because I act fine around them, but I feel like I'm drowning, is the best way to explain it.  I should get my new medication tomorrow though, so fingers crossed on this one.  Sleep is the most pleasant part of my life right now, as long as I don't have sad dreams about my ex. I keep having dreams where we're back together, but it's the past, like I time traveled. And we're doing a thing we did months or a year ago or something. It's actually nice until I wake up, then I'm flooded with sadness.  I just keep reminding myself that things get better with time. Just gotta let time do its thing I guess.  Not sure why I'm posting this, but it feels good to scream into the void. Validates my feelings or something I guess. Who knows.

Might sound dramatic but I feel like it’s an endless cycle of not practicing proper hygiene because I’m depressed and then becoming more depressed because I’m literally a disgusting slob. I haven’t showered for a week and I have no motivation to do so. I should have washed my clothes today but I haven’t. I feel like im aging faster because I don’t take care of my skin and it looks rough. I’m sorry for making you read this. I hate myself and I feel stuck.
Update: I just took a shower. Still feel like shit, but the edge is taken off. Thank you all.
[removed]
you dont suck, youre just suffering. I know you feel disgusting but you aren't. soon you will feel good showering
What about making yourself do something effortless at first (like brushing your theeth longer), and gradually advance into more complicated tasks?
There’s nothing immoral with not smelling good and not showering. I only shower and wash my hair once a week.  Maybe try being your true slob self on 3/7 days of the week, so like Friday, Sat, and Sun. And being clean the rest of the days?
Even if you do nothing else for your skin, treat yourself a nice new water bottle (one with a sports lid, maybe insulated) to keep with you all the time. I drink so much water that way because it’s always with me (except the bathroom!).
Thanks
I feel ugly too though.
Maybe. I can’t really bring myself to get up though.
you can, your mind doesn’t want to.  You don’t need your mind.. the same power you have to physically move your finger to write this post- you can also make your body get up and do..

Who was gonna tell me that at my age I would try many times suicide? I'm Lucas and I am 14 years old. It all started being 7 years old when they changed my life forever. My parents told me that I will be changing school. They brought me to a "school" (basically a hospital) because of my Asperger problem. Dude, that was a fucking torture for me. Whenever I cry, they hold me so strong that I cried so hard, and then they left me in a small room for 30 minutes. It's hard for me to talk or write about this. In that period of time, I just wanted to commit suicide to stop suffering that torture of being alone with my mind and thoughts. When I remember all of this situation I just feel so bad.   Then, high school. With no friends, serious Asperger problems, and suicidal thoughts, I entered for the first time. The first day, the first problem. A group of kids that I wanted to enter just mocked me and hurt me. Day after day that will happen until today. I got diagnosticated depression in December. I was crying in my class because I told one boy that I needed help. He mocked me (what a surprise) and I started crying. The highschool called 112 (emergency number in Spain) and they put me to sleep.   Today, I feel bad, if just some of you can tell me what's good in this life. I don't remember anything but a horrible experience that I caused to my loved family
That wasnt your fault, you are you and theres nothing wrong with that its the schools fault because they dont know how to properly handle that situation.  And one day youll be out of school and on your own in your own place doing your own thing and u can be u. I think thats a pretty nice thing to look forward to.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kmskz3/i_know_one_day_i_will_kill_myself/
One day i just know i will do it. I don’t quite know when because i still hold on to the tiniest bit of hope that things will get better. But i feel so worn down and broken, after giving my all to others and emotional trauma from my childhood I don’t have much energy or will to go on. The dark thoughts creep up on me everyday, and i find myself saying “not yet” rather than not ever.
i literally just said the same thing in another post. i want to say something that will help but i literally have nothing because i feel the exact same way. but it helps knowing i’m not the only person who feels this way. the only thing that keeps me going is my dream of having the life i want to have. i have the tiniest bit of faith that maybe i’ll be happy. MAYBE i can be happy without needing to do drugs. and i’ve been in this constant cycle for two years. so honestly i don’t know if things will ever get better. and as much as i want to forget about this dream and just end it all, i literally can’t. but i’m thankful for this hope bc it’s keeping me alive for now. so no matter how hard it is, keep holding on to that tiny bit of hope. maybe if we keep believing things will get better they actually might <3
[deleted]
I understand completely. I never have and still don't think I'll make it to 30 the way things are now.
This actually made me tear up a bit because I feel the exact same way. Please stay strong my friend
Same, it’s scary knowing that I might not make it to 20, because I’m still so young and being told these are the best years of my life and I’m already in this state of mind. I try to give myself goals “if your going to kill yourself get your test scores back” “wait until the last season of a show comes out” and it sucks but I’m still alive but I may not be next week or tomorrow or in an hour and it’s so scary because I can’t control myself when I get into that mindset.  My therapist noticed my scars so I convinced them I just self harmed which is also true but not me wanting to die. My mum knows too so she’s used to seeing my scarring but I just convince her it’s old.
Stay Strong Buddy. Enjoy the silver if it helps. You are loved don't forget that
You are not alone. I feel the same way. I honestly didn't think I'd make it to see 2021, and even though it's not here yet, I'm trying to fight, but my fight is fading. I feel like im in the 11th round of a 12 round fight.
sigh, me too man... fuck feeling like this omg
Me too.  When I was in the hospital after a lethal overdose, I asked my inpatient psychiatrist "do you think I'll end up actually killing myself one day?" And he took a deep breath and paused and said "I know you will"   And I was like  Damn. Yay. But damn.   I wanna be happy I dont wanna be dead, yknow? But I dont think I will be happy so this is the next best thing I guess. Idk. I wish there was more for us..
I have the same feeling. No matter what changes i make in my life, I know how its going to end. You can change your habits, get a better job, move someplace else but none of it matters. I just tell myself maybe not today, everyday. Sometimes I think the only reason I haven’t done it yet is because it takes too much energy to even get up and do that. Maybe its all about putting it off constantly.
Please hang on, friend. Ask about experimental drugs, and treatment. Like you, that’s my only hope.
me too man, me too, I want to hold on to hope that everything will get better, but reality just punches me in the face each time something gets better, I feel like suicide is my destination one way or another
I feel this. Yes I struggle with depression but also I don't want to die of old age, disease or heart attack. I don't want to deal with the bother of being old and having my mind and body deteriorate. Who wants that fuckin' mess. Yeah I'll live for now but we're in my late forties or fifties when I see the writing on the wall imma have to bounce. Bounce off a cliff.
If it gives you a bit if hope I felt the exact same this time last year and this year I'm in a totally different place.  I know it really does feel like you'll feel like this forever but there is hope.
I know eventually i will do it too. Honestly, it must get to the point where i just don't want to live a life full of hate, anger, sadness, anxious, etc. It's miserable. But there's no way i can give up now, i still need to take my shot at things first. If i'm older and still in the same place, then idk..
Wow this sounds so much like me, I remember telling people when I was younger that I always knew I would kill myself. “Because I wanted to go out on my own terms”. But what I really meant was, “eventually it will be too much”. Not yet is better than today but it will get better, but it will come back depression always does. I’m still trying to learn how to prepare for the next hour before it arrives.
I recommend the movie "A Single Man"  A man lost his companion and thought about suicide, but in the end he realized why he shouldn't.    "Just like that"    I dunno, maybe you would get something out of it.   It helped me a bit, although I'm still a long way from "fixed"
I feel the exact same way. I try to block it or avoid it but it’s the only way I see myself going. I can’t see myself living past my 20s if I stay like this...
You are worthy and needed in this world. ❤ Please know that you can do for yourself just as much as you do for others.   It took me a long time to realize that. Please don't leave.
you said it word for word. i know one day I'm gonna kill myself. it's all I think about. you explained perfectly.
Hello there, I know all too well how you feel...I still feel that I may do this very same thing someday and have struggled for several years with it but I just want you to know that you are not alone in this endeavor and while it seems pointless I still manage to hold onto life with the help of people in my life whom I love very much. Please try not to give up hope and know that you can vent here about anything and perhaps you can try talking to someone you really trust like a close family member or friends too because they may want to try to help...Stay strong out there and never give up the fight! No one is truly alone in this world...
Man please hold on please dude I’m begging you It’s fucking hard isn’t it? I don’t know you or what your going through but I know it gets better trust me on this you get stronger and better until your happy people on the internet helped me and I got better and you will to I promise man please I’m hear of you want to talk or rant or whatever I want you to be better we all do.
Wow. If its any help, I’m the exact same and I’ve been this way since about July 2020
I am in the same boat of sad shit
You can do this.
I gave a rant about something similar to this in one of my post. It's not like I have the will to die. It's just that I don't really have the will or energy to live anymore. Only reason I'm living is because of my family that sort of depends on me. It's like I'm their last hope. I don't feel the pressure or maybe I do. But that doesn't change much of my actions. I care but at the same time I don't really want to care. I don't know if any of this makes sense.
Same. Only reason why I’m still here is because of the selfishness of my family. If i could disappear without effecting anyone I’d be gone already.
I wish I could give you more than a hollow „it’ll get better someday, it has to ... right ?“  I was at a point to were it would feel like eternities passed just thinking about when and how to do it   Really hope you get out of this mate Find something that makes live worth it
I kinda feel like that too. I just want you to know things can get better, but your chances of that happening are bigger if you try to change some things in your life to be better. Id advise self acceptance or self love. Best of luck
My only reason to stay right now are my parents. I never got along with my dad but he is dealing with cancer currently and I can't do that to them both. If anything happens to them before I beat depression I'll be gone too and honestly that thought gives me peace. I don't want to be here anymore.
I can relate to that feeling and you're not alone in feeling it by any means.  &#x200B;  My trauma doesn't originate from a singular traumatizing event or not even several, its more of a slow unravelling which results from a lifetime of conflicting emotions and opinions on different subjects, different world views and lost friendships or relations between family members. The feeling of isolation and loneliness.     But I've managed to stay mostly positive, atleast in general. Sure at times I feel what you're feeling, but I also know that there are people who have come through it, people who are no better or no stronger than you or me.
Sort of hard to live also hard to kill yourself as your instincts kick in to save yourself and live and it would be those horrible last moments of life when there's no coming back and you are now fighting for your life but know you will be dead. Things such as that is what stops me.  Also knowing that most suicides fail and your life will be worse if make it either having some sort of disability worse than depression or a very bad injury you now have forever until you do go when your time is up. Xx
I’ve been there too. It runs heavily in my paternal side of the family. My grandmother and I once agreed that it was a “safety net.” As in, if it ever got bad, we promised to ourselves that we could leave if we wanted to. However, it ended up being a way of telling myself to hold on a little bit longer each time I got deeply set back, because I didn’t want to choose the nuclear option just yet.
Its good to see someone saying something that i don't have the strength or energy to say it myself, it makes me feel like there's people out there who understand what im going through, hope you get better though good luck buddy
It’s been one of those years I’m afraid, everything on top of the isolation, people passing. I hit a bad part in my life a few years ago after a bad accident and I have been emotionally eating ever since. My own fight started more when I was alone, I would berate myself and tell myself I wasn’t worth while. I got to the point where the thought of being dead and not having to work anymore, worry about paying bills or fighting through every day was a positive. As I was shaving one day the thought of cutting my wrists and not being here made me feel good. If it wasn’t for the thought of my family finding me I think I may have gone ahead. This made me sit back and think what was the main reason for me feeling this way. For me it was my relationship with food that was making me feel bad. So I attacked it the only way I could think of, as soon as a bad thought came into my head I would stop eating. As soon as I would be alone and start to punish myself I would not eat. It took a couple of days but I am at a point now where I am actively doing something to counteract the thing making me feel bad.   Try not to focus on the many but try to focus on that one thing that makes u feel worse. I’m not through the end but I will use the negative to make a positive and hopefully be somewhere better in a few months time. The one thing I learnt from it all though was speaking with whoever you are closest with. A problem shared really is a problem half. Just remember light shines through even the darkest of holes.
I don’t got much so I can’t give you a reward but if you need to chat, I’m here if you need it
Hey I think all of us have been through something . the past and the trauma from when we were young eat's at us .  Don't ever think what happened to you make's you broken. your stronger than that <3  Were here for you <3
I feel this way. Even though I constantly write. I write at work and on off days. I often write about feeling suicidal and how I’d do it. Or will one day do it. Most of it is in the form of free verse poetry and I let my husband read it. It concerns him that I feel like this, but I tell him that getting it out is better than leaving it bottled up. I feel sometimes that if I was going to do it, I would have done it by now. I was suicidal in junior high, high school, college, post-not graduating and working full time since. Basically since I was old enough to know what it was. That’s been nearly twenty years ago.  What complicates things is that I’m trans and my husband doesn’t understand. Like I’ve had terrible dysphoria this year and he says we’ll get through it together short of actually supporting me doing what I need to do to feel happier. Like I need top surgery, but he doesn’t understand that. His mom had breast cancer so he thinks it’s selfish for me to get top surgery because he thinks I don’t need it. You know not like his mom did. I do bind but that only helps so much. At this rate, I’m going to not live past my thirties. I’ll be thirty this summer. But I don’t see me living past forty in the body I have.
Your post is so relatable OP.  I often think about taking my own life, but then don’t have the guts to do it, and then tell myself that “maybe things will get better”.  Just like you I feel like I am putting off the inevitable.  One day...one day it will happen.  I don’t know when, but I know I just really won’t be able to go on any more; I just don’t see the point.  I feel like I have zero to live for.  The world is a miserable place, full of evil and suffering.  I am trying to find the light, but all I see is the dark.
Dude. I feel the same way
I’m in the same boat. It feels inevitable. I’m so sick of everything. I’ve said I’m willing to give it another year or two if things doesn’t eat me up inside before then. I doubt anything good will come tho. Like always.
I've had the knowledge that I will someday jump off this ride since I was a child. It's a shitty thought to carry. I'm sorry.
I know we don't know each other but I'm sad you feel like this. If you can get therapy I do reccomend it, but you've probably heard that before so I'm sorry if it's not what you want to hear. I can't say things will get better for you today or tomorrow but I genuinely hope things do get better for you. Until then, try and do something today to look after yourself, can you speak to someone you know, or wrap yourself up in your duvet and watch your favourite film? Take care of yourself, you are worthwhile even if you don't feel like it right now.
It’s like the scene in big fish where the kids look into the eyes of Helena Bonham Carter, that’s how Ive described it for years. You kinda just have this feeling you know you’ll end it at somepoint.
I've lived with this feeling since I was a teenager - it has eased a little since I got to my early 30s, though not a ton.   I won't try to fill you full of sentiment or presume to speak to your situation, but I will say this - identification serves to shape  the narrative of our lives in ways that aren't always immediately evident or even entirely conscious.  What I mean by that is, I spent the lion's share of my life identifying as a "suicide case" - basically confining myself to those somewhat vague and nebulous terms. It was going to end in me killing myself and, what's more, this didn't feel like a prediction; it felt like a fact.  So with this as the underlying assumption, my actions ended up supporting this premise, ala self-fulfilling prophecy. Any move that didn't keep in line with my idea of myself as a suicide case was eventually abandoned.  At some point, and only pretty recently mind you, I started to question this assessment. To even slightly undermine it. Have I attempted suicide? Yeah, couple times - last was in 2010. Have I lived a destructive lifestyle meantime? You know it. But still - it wasn't written in the stars or in any ancient Holy Book that I'm aware of, that my life ends by my own hand regardless. I can point to my history and try to explain otherwise, but that still doesn't guarantee me killing myself.  Not sure if that will help; probably won't. All I mean to convey is that even a small degree of skepticism surrounding those really negative, fatalistic core beliefs can work toward reshaping something that once, and maybe still does, seem concrete and immobile.  Sorry to prattle on. Best wishes.
I’ve been inching towards it slowly for 7 full years now, and I’ll tell you right now if I make it another 7 it will be a miracle. Whenever I get on a good streak I try to ride the positive wave out as long as I can but it only lasts a week or so, and then I’m back in that darkness. I feel what you’re saying on an incredibly deep level.
Dude, do what i’m gonna do: wait until everyone you care about is dead before you ever hurt them like that  I won’t talk you out of it because i can’t even talk myself out of it. Just don’t do it until you’ve actually lived a life
Yea, my parents are the only thing stopping me, the moment they go away, i will go away too..
Do you ever have the feeling that you want to be the one to do it, instead of something else causing it? Like, you’ll decide when it happens, and in that way, it gives you a little more control over your life?
Can relate so much, i know that after all im just procastinating suicide but from now we should be in a good mood and have fun for a while. Thats pretty much my approach, stay there bro. :)
Most people here are focusing on the positive ways you can end straying from that path and finding a new perspective in life or just relating to themselves. So I'm gonna pull a devil's advocate here in saying that is quite possible you "try killing yourself" if those dark thoughts or if your life in general does not improve significantly.    Be aware that most people who try to kill themselves not only do not succeed, but get even worse, not just in overall health with things like broken bones, permanent scars, ruined digestive system, losing body parts and sometimes losing partial or full autonomy of your body, but sometimes with social and financial issues like losing friends and family trust in you, losing jobs or careers and similar issues. Add to that that most people do not go gentle into the night. They try and try again until eventually you get out either by finding a way to cope with life or finally getting out of existence.   So sometimes is better to accept a miserable and mediocre life than to try to end it and make it worse every step of failure on the way out.
Reading a book that has helped me so much “The Empath Experience”  Maybe you are an empath too, we tend to be overwhelmed with the state of the world often and are constantly being bogged down by the feelings and energy’s and emotions of others.
This is very relatable to me. My dark thoughts were usually hoping something bad would happen to me, but then I tried to hurt myself. Now I’m getting help, weekly therapy, anti-depressants, and monthly meeting with a psychiatrist. It took a bit for me to adjust to the medication and I also ended up needing to change medications, but so far my dark thoughts have stopped. I’ve only started getting treatment a few months ago but so far it’s been helping me, so if you can it’s something to consider. I’m lucky my insurance covers it and they’ve waived copays with the therapy while they’re televisits due to the pandemic.  I also want to mention I also tried therapy at the beginning of the year but I don’t think I clicked with the therapist. She was nice and everything but I just didn’t feel much help from her. Then the pandemic started and I stopped seeing her. So also, if you seek therapy and don’t feel like it’s helping, try seeing someone different.
I've uttered these words verbatim before and no one seems to really understand the degree of commitment i have to leaving. People so often disappoint me and capitalize off my kindness. Take advantage. When you're already at rock bottom but you commit your last bits of energy to trying to be there for someone else and they let you down (to put it lightly)  it just seem like a reminder of why i need to leave. I've given every bit of love i have left to people who take it and stomp it into the dirt. People will say "They're just not the right person" but that doesn't make sense when it comes to betrayal from people i've known for years and the wicked extremes they'll go to to fuck with you. In my opinion this is the "Mental Dark Ages" so to speak. Tormenting others and being apathetic is the name of the game and I don't want to play it anymore.
I don't think there's anything wrong with saying "not yet" if it helps you get through the day. Some advocates for assisted suicide say that knowing there is a humane way out gives them comfort. Sometimes the things that help us survive the day to day grind aren't good long term strategies, but they may be enough for today, which is sometimes all we can muster.
I feel the same way, but funnily enough I think "living with a deadline" has made me appreciate the little things more and helped me connect more with the people I love.  In fact I've postponed this so called "deadline" a couple of times before so who knows, maybe I'll just carry on for now
I feel the same, OP. It's like a dirty secret I keep sequestered in the corners of my soul. No one knows. And somehow, that brings me a sense of twisted comfort. At least when I'm struggling fighting the urge to go for one last, very cold walk in the woods, no one knows that's what I'm thinking about. I can have those thoughts in peace, picture myself just falling asleep in the arms of hypothermia, and then continue to grind whatever it was I needed to do.  It's....exhausting. I'm exhausted. But I feel a little bolstered knowing I'm not alone. I'll be thinking of you from now on, OP. If I could, I'd hold your hand.
I really hope that you never do that. Things do change. The world needs people like you. You are kind hearted.
Same. Though lately I've been enjoying a spike in anxiety and now I'm convinced I'll die of an illness first.
Same bro...Same
I think this is my last give it a go Year and then I’m done
This is me in a nutshell, shit doesn't seem to be getting better, doesn't seem like it will, I'm just hoping. And that's all that's keeping me here.
we all have a breaking point when we can't take it anymore i have the same thought
Yea man me too
Sigh, this is what I'm thinking right now.
Literally feel everything you're saying. I have no hopes for me so cant offer u any too. Just that I'm in the same boat as u too
I feel exact same way as you. I'm just living because I'm not dead.
I feel the same way. I know I won't yet. I might not even soon. I might even live a few more years. Who knows. But every day I see a vision of my life ending by me drinking myself to death and/or overdosing on drugs. I feel like that's gonna be what ends me and when people find me like that knowing how I died, it just goes to show, I have nothing to show for the life that I lived. My death would just make that more apparent.
I tried doing it for three times and it didn’t work
I’ve been terribly depressed for 7 years. I have just recently started to feel so much better, within the past year or two. I don’t know what changed for me to finally feel better. I have also faced my demons and have faced what has haunted me for years head on...well not fully, but I can now look someone in the face who has greatly hurt me and feel nothing. I don’t know how long you’ve been struggling or to what extent, but just hold on. You will find something that makes you happy and you will find a new purpose. I know hearing this may just be bs now but soon it will mean something!
I don't think I can be there in 2021... I'm soo stupid that I can't even die... Ok, I will just drink the poison and die in pain while my internal organs burn, I think the pain level won't be much higher than the mental pain I'm going through. Wish me luck...I don't want to see a new year.
You can make it through this and things will get better. I promise you.
Maybe not. I spent my teens and 20's wanting to die. Now I am just like not depressed anymore. It just went away. You can't kill yourself, the world is too absurd. Don't you want to find out how this episode of Black Mirror ends?
Fuckin relatable man :(
Same. So sorry to hear someone else is going through it. I’m just so tired of pretending like everything is fine. It’s really not fine
I know exactly how you feel. I’ve spent much of my life knowing that there was a ticking clock counting down the days until I would gather enough courage to leave this world. Surprisingly it was this horrible year filled with so much collective pain and death that led me to realize that isn’t the choice I want to make and that it would ultimately hurt more people than it would help.   Every time my mind returns to this thought I think of the Samuel Beckett quote, “You must go on. I can’t go on. I’ll go on.” I’ve been meaning to get it tattooed on me. What really speaks to me is that the character that speaks it in Beckett’s novel is bodiless and acutely aware of his own mortality. If you repeat it to yourself out load a few times it starts to calm you (at least it does for me).   I’m here if you ever want to talk, no judgement at all. I know how hard it can be to find people who are willing to listen to the darkest of thoughts without acting uncomfortable or passing judgement. Stay strong & know that you’ll always be in my thoughts.
Just think that one day you will over come this. I’ve been diagnosed with clinical anxiety, depression and tics. Life may not be good now but it will one day. Times can be tough the more we have them the more resilient we will become. YOU ARE LOVED!
It’s not the way sadly I’ve had the same thoughts but it’s not the way there’s always something worth holding on too
It sucks being in that loop hole of not yet, sadly i have nothing to say that would help because i still havent over come that. All i can say is good luck and i hope for the best
I know I'm just one comment in the sea of others who unfortunately also feel this way but I've been thinking about this myself. Honestly dying is on my mind every day, multiple times a day. I have so much wrong with my brain I'm not sure if i can actually get better anymore and that has crushed me. I've only ever mentioned this once censored to one person but behind anonymity of reddit where no one knows me I guess I need to say it somewhere for now. My father took his gun and tried to shoot me repeatedly when I was about 13, because he knew I was going to be depressed and mental like my mother who suffered from bipolar. My father was well off and had connections so the incident never was reported, even after he shot holes all over the basement and house. He told me for years leading up to it and after, that he knew I would be a fucked up burden on everyone around me because my mind wasn't right either. These memories came back to me a little over two years ago and it's all I ever think about because I think he was right about me all along. I also realized I'm borderline becoming addicted to pain killers and benzos because I'm desperate to turn off my brain.  I wish I had something positive to say to you, hell even to myself. I want that tiny glimmer of hope to be worth something. I hope you find something that helps you get through this and to a better side
I know this is only a temporary fix, but I’ve found ketamine to be a remarkable rapid anti depressant. To the point that within minutes I couldn’t understand how I had been thinking about suicide. Though it wears off and I run out,  I still remember the head change. Just my 2 cents.
Trust me, man, it’s impossible to be happy without drugs once you realize how shitty this world is. Or you have that one person in your life who will mean more to you than anyone else ever will throughout your entire (unless you have kids with them)
The thing that fixes drugs is getting a freind to smack you in the face ( metaphorically) and drag you out of drugs
It is poetic. You should try your hand at writing and maybe that will be what will make your life better and worth it as if you write so honestly with the talent you have it will be helping other people and that is a very good purpose to have. Xx
I'm no expert, but think about it this way: Suicide is not a normal last resort. Seriously, I hope you find that one lifeboat that never pops. Good luck my friend.
This right here summarizes things for me pretty succinctly. If COVID has shown me anything, it's that when the chips are down I really dont want to die.   However, COVID has also shown me that I dont want to die LIKE THAT. Idk what I would do if I got diagnosed with cancer or some other terrible illness befell me. I think I would just be like: "Well I spun the biology roulette and lost" and pick a way to die that doesn't involve literally being sliced from the inside (OsteoSarcoma was made by the devil) or being unable to breath and get oxygen to my brain.   As things are now, they are tolerable. Hell, they might even become good in a couple of years. Pretty soon we might have a cure for biological aging or be able to transfer someone to data. The world is a crazy place. If I cant have some form of mmortality, I'd rather be able to make my own peace before I chose how I wanted to go out.   Now I just need to not fall in love so that I dont feel like I should continue to suffer....but I'm a romantic so that's not happening XD   Let's hang out and watch the genocide happen while we argue about whether polar bears will be extinct in a few years and which side has a right to erode freedom of speech more. Woo!
Xx
Hold on it doesn’t seem worth it or it’s to much pain tired of trying but it is stay strong until your body and mind can defeat your illness. and until then we’re all here for you
If you feel this way to then I’m your friend also
Don’t let that ridiculous saying freak you out. The teenaged years are not the best years of most people’s lives. They were certainly the worst of mine (so far, lol). I remember the feeling of becoming an adult and escaping my home and hometown. It felt like going from a suffocating little room into a wide open space. Your life expands so much.     Being an adult is awesome. Yeah you have responsibilities and they can feel crushing sometimes, but you also have unparalleled freedom. I feel that life is meaningless but that doesn’t mean it’s worthless.    I’m almost 40 and still depressed AF, but the “not yet” approach to suicide prevention is still working for me after all these years. You can always find something to stick around for, no matter how trivial. Hang in there.
I have to say, life didn’t get meaningful for me until I reached my 40’s. And something wonderful happened then- I no longer cared what people thought of me. It has been liberating. That feeling that you can only get after you’ve lived more years. It’s almost like zen. I wish I would have had it in my 30’s, but reading some of my past journals, I was too involved with what people thought.   I still struggle with depression, but it’s a cage I know I have the key to. It takes time to figure out the lock, but it doesn’t have to take decades. What it does take is the willingness to see why you are the way you are, and that isn’t pretty. Most people in their 20s and 30s are too impatient for that.
Sheesh man. Seriously, dying is not good. It just ends, no more excitement, no more memories no nothing, and your family/friends would probably become depressed as well. I don't mean to pressure you but I hope you can make it :)
thank u that is very kind of u :)
I'm a shitty person so everybody hates me, I'll end the pain.
I made it out you all can to there is light at the end of the tunnel keep walking or even crawling until the light is there don’t let something eat you in the dark make it to the light please you must try harder I know that sounds stupid you’ve tried to much to achieve to little you try to hard for to much pain but it gets better please stay with me and with everyone
You sound done in pain used to it that’s a sign of strength your getting close
On a long enough timeline the survival rate of everyone drops to zero, so why even postpone it?, that's what i keep telling myself, even though i know i wanna live, but in a way i am too afraid of staying alive and too scared to die aswell. I agree with you, i wish there were more options for us.
I honestly felt this so much. I am so scared of dying a painful death. But I want death to happen, just on my own terms. I want a nice peaceful death, caused by me, where I can just rest. I know im gonna do it when i'm older just don't know when or how but it will come.
No you won't!!
Dont man, dont fuckin do it
Just remember that's because they love you
It'll get better, i promise 🙂
Thank you for the silver, kind soul.
Don’t think to much about the outcome of social situations that fixed my anxiety that really is and tho
My sister suffers with her mental health - has for a long time. Her ex-partner turned her to ketamine. She now can't eat without feeling really sick. She's weak all the time, all she can do is sleep, cry, and equal parts regret and yearn for ket. She looks sick, too thin and distant all the time. She even smells sick, like her body is decaying on the inside, and that's not far from reality; she's practically incontinent from the holes it's burned in her bladder. She'll be drinking water and then all of a sudden just piss herself. Great fun. And she will never have children because her womb also has holes burned in it. From the ketamine.  Don't be out here telling someone at their lowest to take up opioid drugs. That's a fucking shit idea. Just my common sense.   Edit: Oh, and let's not forget that she's riddled with UTIs that don't respond to *any* treatment, so that's painful as fuck, I'm sure. Round it off with constant, severe stomach cramps and hey, yeah, life's a pip with ket.
True... If you can get your hands on it.. They been doing stupid trials since forever and know it works but they dont want you well. Just like LSD was originally invented to cure alcoholism etc... Microdosing it and also mushrooms works a lot as well...   Everything that does work is illegal .. I'm not talking about hard addictive drugs..  Yet everything that causes more depression such as alcohol is legal.
I’ve tried AA/NA before and one of the biggest things I always struggle with is the “we believe a power greater than ourselves will restore us to sanity”   Given how fucked the world is it’s completely rational to want to get fucked up all the time, but it’s not gonna make the world or your situation any better.
The goal isn't to get sober, it's to love yourself so much you don't need drugs/ alcohol/ possessions/ etc..
My SO's cousin committed suicide because he was depressed and couldn't get free of drugs. Drugs don't make you happy. They may make you think you're happy, but you're really not. But others can make you happy and your loved ones. Being content with your loved ones, your job, where you're at in life, etc. can make you happy and create happiness. Giving and serving others, especially those who don't expect it or don't think they deserve it, creates happiness. Enjoying the little things in life creates happiness. But drugs do not. Drugs only mask pain, stress, anxiety, etc. They don't get rid of it. In fact they make it worse. Believe me, I know from experience.
The thing that fixes drugs is no longer needing to escape and having a will to quit  Yes, some drugs are bad, including ones that get prescribed. But most are either good or neutral in effect
I agree. We need writers in this world. Please consider it!
Hope I'm not starting a thing, though I feel if may be helpful if you don't already know this: guilting someone who struggles with suicidal ideation is exactly the wrong thing to do. We get to this point because we've found enough guilt on our own that we think it would relieve the people we love if we weren't in the picture anymore. This only serves to fan the flames.  Also, a lot of folks who deal with depression don't feel excitement, and memories are often used by our brains to cause us more pain.   I hear where you're coming from, and I appreciate what you're trying to say. I can tell that you care deeply about your loved ones. The words that have actually been said, though, can do more harm than good to someone who's hurting this much.  In the future, a comment like "sheesh man. Seriously dying is not good. I don't mean to pressure you but I hope you can make it :)" is a far, far more supportive thing to say. Hope this helps. Peace, friend ✌️💛
No problem. Hope you get better
wait getting close to what...
Sadly, no one will make the world better since everyone who can just gets silenced
I've been through rehab and AA/NA. Was sober for 7 months but the depression never stopped all the way through. When people talk to me when i try to explain how fucked my life is they always mention the drinking or drugs, and i reply NO the drinking and drugs are a biproduct of something bigger. It didn't go away when i was sober I never had a thought of wanted to go back to putting myself in shitty situations and using again. I think more often than not addiction is intertwined with trauma and there are a lot of lucky people who didn't have to experience fucked up shit throughout their life who take advantage of the weaknesses that those like me have. Anyone who sees shit clearly will seek some sort of coping mechanism and the bad ones are the most readily available.
It’s hard to love oneself when one feels narcissistic for even the smallest of self/compliments
I've done acid a few times and it actually has helped a lot. It really helps you see the world or even your own life from a different perspective in my experience. After an acid trip I feel I can generally be content with my life for a month or two and then I go back into a depression and I feel stuck again.
Weed has saved my life on several occasions  We need words to define helpful and harmful substances, because drugs is too ambiguous
Ah got it sounds like you know more then me well good luck
Close to the light to the end of your pain sorry for the bad speech I meant you will be happy soon I hope
Yea, I understand that.  “okay I’ve been sober for x amount of time, whoopdeedoo, I’m still fucking miserable”
I think thats the one drug that actually can improve mental health. I like to use it every so often as a "reset" and i always feel "cleaner" and lighter afterwards
By drugs, I mean drugs that aren't meant to treat medical conditions, such as the ones that Doctors prescribe (although even some of those can do more harm than good). How did weed save your life?
I read up on Erowid every now and then
ah i see i mean i hope kinda idk it seems super unlikely :/
Healing is a whole other process
It’s stopped me from committing suicide several times because it stabilized my mood. Girls can ruin your life, man
Oh uh wow
Good luck!
I can see that. I helped my SO get off of nicotine by doing lots of research and finding out that vaping CBD oil/juice without thc can pretty much rewire your brain to no longer crave nicotine, plus it helps in relieving, not masking stress and pain.  I can totally see that. I'm a girl myself, but I know girls who've ruined guys' lives. I always tell those closest to me that if they start to see me acting like someone I'm not, which includes being manipulating, controlling, narcissistic, etc. that they should tell me right away, because I want to get as far away from that behavior and that kind of girl as possible. It's hard because of childhood trauma, I've developed symptoms of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) where another personality(ies) takes over to try to protect me from my trauma when its triggered, but then I get amnesia and don't remember what I said or did for a time and that caused all sorts of problems in my relationship with my SO because I didn't know I had that until recently.
sure, but wait for when you gotta quit. weed is like pressing pause on your life
Currently high on mugwort. A 100% legal herb that’s safe to smoke. Really nice
Can’t find it on erowid tho. It’s considered an herb, not a drug
It also gives me something else to enjoy in my life, because everything changes when your in different mind states and when things look different. I’m glad your SO was able to quit, ik nicotine is highly addictive for most people (i’n fortunate). And I hope your SO helps you with your DID. I’ve honestly started disassociating after my life literally changed in one night for the better, but i hit rock bottom for weeks because of it. Honestly, if i wasn’t so used to being so low, I’d still be there
I don’t rely on it to function. I can go without weed and be fine if life doesn’t throw me a curveball like it has been lately
Oh wow well I hope it makes you feel better
Everyone cares about the holidays but throws us away like trash
me too for the most part. though in 2020 i got absolutely stupid with it, so i'm having a proper break now
It’s bliss
I get thrown away like an unwanted kitten
I usually get stupid with it this time of year because of my job. Honestly, had many things not happened, i would probably have just justified using as much as i was by working more. I hope your break goes well. Also, you should try mugwort if you ever get the chance. It’s intense
That’s good I guess I hope you find a better way to deal though
I think it’s better than taking “antidepressants,” which is typically far from looked down upon
They bad for you?
Antidepressants’ most common side effects are suicidal thoughts/tendencies and depression. I’d say they are
Whaaaat that’s horrible
Yah stay of those my man
Trust me, i do. I avoid psychiatry completely. They’re not payed to listen, they’re paid to give you drugs with complex names that typically piss off your insurance company
Yikes good to know
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ki4i70/do_you_also_feel_like_this_totally_neutral_and/
Hello folks, I feel a certain way since years and I try to muffle it as hard as I can but it's getting impossible and I wanna know if you feel like this too, or what is it.  I've always found interest in quite everything and i've tried to do everything around me that I was actually able to (psychologically or physically speaking).   But I can't get invested in anything I do. Any activities that I do are short and if they go on for too long I get bored.   I force myself to do quite everythings, I force myself to feel emotions (like happiness when I get a gift or happiness when I win on games) and the only emotions that are spontaneous and "real" from me are frustration and absolute void.   When I don't force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure, I feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life.   Everything seems washed out and boring, literally everything.   Nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy.   Nothing really interests me and I feel like i've done everything that I HAD to do in my life and I only see one option now : that it's over !   (I don't wanna suicide even if sometimes I think about it, I won't do it because I don't want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and it's the only logical choice)   I got the checklist done, everything else is purely boring and non stimulating, so I don't really wanna live anymore.   Because literally everything that I do makes me suffer, even writing this text.   Because I feel like it's useless and boring.  Is that just depression in a way ?
Yes, depression takes the love out of everything and it feels like I've been rubbed down in anaesthetic paste but also been given a sensitive serum, everything feels so dull, even the physical pleasures but exercising or working out hurts. It's like something broke inside me and I can't feel joy or excitement but I ache. I ache for my friends and family when they see me like this and I know I love them, but I can't get excited when they make plans with me, or feel joy when I need them. I started feeling this way relatively recently, a couple of months but if it's been years for you, reaching out for help would be recommended
People who say life is not black and white are correct. It's shades of gray.
Yes I feel very similarly. Absolutely nothing brings me joy anymore, instead it just makes me ask why I'm bothering to do it. The purpose of everything has vanished, even things like video games that didn't need a purpose just feel absolutely meaningless and a waste of energy. I feel an ache inside, as if I'm bored of absolutely everything. Even eating is difficult at this point.   I have felt like this for years now but it's much worse lately. Christmas was the only thing I was able to get *slightly* excited about but Christmas just got cancelled in the UK.
yeah, its called apathy
Yes look up the term anhedonia.  If you no longer enjoy things you used to enjoy it's probably because of depression.
Yes, I feel the same,  I think about things I used to want to do, or that I was passionate  about and now it's  just boring, its just more work...
Yep. Recently I’ve been feeling like I’m not living life like life is just kind of happening around me, and I’m not even really witnessing it or taking it all in. Everything just doesn’t seem to process. I’m like this can’t be real life can it? When will it be my turn to actually live life? I’m so sick of waiting...
I get you, everything seems very bland and unexciting regardless of what it is, as if nothing ignites that spark in your mind. I have lost so many interests because of this.
I can relate.
yeh I totally get feeling void, and it came make the easiest tasks like showering or brushing your teeth or making a samdwich like simple stuff feel so difficult and tiresome. I’ve found it i just do knew things every now and then that gives me a feeling of something so if i find a new game i like or new band or musician. Another thing to help is changing scenery so say you spend a lot of time in your room playing games or you are still in school or have an office job- you can get stuck in those settings. Its really good to get out for a walk somewhere quiet and far away from your usual places and it can help you relieve pressure or just feel like there’s more out there i fine.  I hope that maybe helps a little :) Lil (F18)
100% same boat.  I barely experience any sadness, grief, anger, hatred, self loathing etc.  i’m actually very confident in myself.    I just have pretty much 3 “emotions”:  numb/bored, annoyed or mildly uncomfortable/anxious.
Depression is so weird because I’ve been assuming adult life is just dull and overwhelming but apparently some people feel emotions regularly?
Absolutely. Been depressed for a majority of my life, but there are periods where it's much worse. Those periods have lasted for up to a year. And I feel like I'm starting a new period now.  Whenever I recall memories, they seem to be grayscaled. I've lost my passion in drawing and playing my instrument. All I really do now is sit in my room rocking in my chair, feeling foreign in my own skin and foreign to the world.
Everyone needs something to look forward to. We shouldn’t go hungry before we appreciate our favorite food
it's nice to see someone say what I feel a lot of people don't get. I think it is depression? maybe a specific form of depression or something because I can't seem to find friends who are depressed who feel just the same way. if I'm understanding you right it feels like sometimes there really isn't something you can do to "fix it" and everything we do is just to make time pass if even that. then it gets to a point where even the "coping mechanisms" are extra work to just feel the same in the end. it sucks I hope there's an end to the everything is blegh. it would be nice to know what other people see in life
I have this and discovered I’m ADHD which is why I don’t stick to things. Meds have helped.
I would suggest to stop looking for happiness in pleasure, I think we humans are wired in a way that makes feeling rushes of pleasure the main thing that keeps us thriving, we were raised this way starting from the comfort our mothers gave us when we were babies.  So instead of seeking pleasure in doing things what I try to do is try to just be, I say to myself fuck everything and I just sit and empty my mind from all the crap, I become a plant, even though it's just for a couple of minutes, but this state really helps me.  I think all of us humans really give a shit about each other, what people think of us matters, because we grew up fueled by our parents encouragements and opinions, we think we only matter if we are appreciated by our peers. and this state is pathological in its nature, because it makes our lives depending on the approval of the outside world.. Try to forget the outside world, you should train yourself to not give a shit about the outside world, be a plant, sit still and breath, do nothing, go nowhere, Own that feeling, then you will move on.  Sorry if I wasn't that clear I write like a speak
I feel this void. It's the weirdest feeling because it doens't even feel like a feeling.  Frustration, anger, void. This is the full list of my emotional spectrum.  And it gets amplified by itself. The more frustrated I feel about my frustration, the angrier and more frustrated I get.  &#x200B;  The void, if anything, in a lot of cases is my most favorite feeling.  Because this void, as unlimited as it is, can be shortly filled with ACTIVITY.  Basically, as you said, it's just short time Anything... and that's better than anger and frustration I guess.  &#x200B;  I read a lot of manga, light novels, books. The internet archive is endless.  I don't even enjoy most of them but getting tired of reading is still easier to swollow than getting tired of being tired...  &#x200B;  I'm sorry, I was trying to find a way to give you support but nothing comes to mind.  I hope you can endure this life, I guess
I can definitely relate. I feel like I should be feeling happy about something or sad about something else, because that's what's **expected.** I don't really feel anything, I just...... kinda exist. Like I'm just floating through life, observing. It sucks to not be stimulated by much, it's really difficult.
I find myself feeling similar to you on many occasions. I don’t feel like I’ve tried everything and am bored of things though. I’m more frustrated that I don’t have the resources or experience to enjoy the things I wish I could/already do. Sometimes this results in botched confidence in myself. I’ll tell myself that those things shouldn’t matter and have little meaning/importance in the first place. But ultimately, if those things are meaningless, then I too am meaningless.
Same here, I just started a new job and a coworker was asking me what I get excited about and the only response I could think of is nothing. I've been going down a list of things I have wanted to do before and I don't feel anything. I sometimes get excited when I think I might actually enjoy it but after I start doing it I feel nothing and get bored. I've been feeling like the enjoyable part of my life is over and now at best the rest is nothing but feeling numb and at worst the rest will be suffering. I've been thinking about suicide for so long it feels like it's only a matter of time before I do it and that I am destined to die by my own hand.
Sounds like chronic low grade depression. Look it up. It’s basically everything you wrote
I don’t like to say I force myself but to just put on an act so others feel good makes me feel better about it.  I know this feeling it’s how I felt on antidepressants and I can still feel now but there are days and sometimes weeks where I don’t feel it. It’s just a process and honestly with covid I feel it just made it harder, was feeling pretty good before it all. So I just have hope that when some things come around after covid it’ll get better.
All you have said describes my entire being. I'm really starting to feel hopeless now, and it's scary. I've got a deep heartache for the lifelong lack of emotion and excitement that I now face.
I know exactly how you feel! If I do something for over 20 minutes, my brain is just begging to leave. I force myself to have a smile in public or around family to appear “presentable.”   I hate it.
Yes, it's very peaceful in my opinion. May this feeling never fade.
Absolutely. I just finished a quarter of college with my highest grades ever and I feel devoid of pretty much anything. I feel tired, but I’m not happy, sad or excited. I just feel kinda dead to be honest.
I feel the same way, but this is a state of being that can change depending on the actions you take. Exercise in conjunction with SSRIs, I hear, can help. I'm looking at seeking treatment
I can relate to this, but instead of giving up I am forcing myself to believe in hopes that one day I can finally trick my mind into thinking that these emotions are real. I am scared of the void after all and there really isn't a better option other than to keep going and continue finding new things to do.
Total apathy.
Yup
Can someone tell me where to start if I want to get back to normal?
This is how depression is. I can relate to feeling like this a lot for the last half of this shit year. Throughout 2020, all the things i used to love have just lost all colours for me because they have ended or been failures and I’m too stubborn to accept change and move on.   It sucks and i hate that all the things in my life have lost colour and vibrance, which is why i hate hearing and reading that this has happened to you too. It’s like all the life has been drained out of us. I do wish we were able to move past this easier and figure out a mental remedy to get over such a terrible mental condition
Lately, yes. The holidays are always incredibly sad and stressful for me. Hopefully by January I will be out of this funk.
Have you tried giving psychedelics a try? I can’t say they cure depression, but it has definitely helped me work through a lot of my issues and perceptual misreadings.
Yea, recently even the hobbies I used pour my heart into just aren’t appealing. Feels like the passion got sucked right out
Can totally relate however being a music producer I do enjoy my work/job or atleast it puts me in a meditative calm state and the day goes by smooth, however once I finish I'm in the state you describe and usually it's at night the depression strikes hardest
Every feeling is numb now. I have developed great acting skills laughing and engaging with others but I really don't give a fuck about anything
Hi there, I’ve been feeling this way a lot especially this year. Always finding something to feel good and excited about. But there was something that I realized just this past month that I was missing. Feeling sorrow and pain. That’s something that I usually avoided cuz, what’s the point, right? But just like exciting things that need you to overcome some fear, I did the same for sorrow. It took some time, and was ready for the challenge, and within a few days, I was crying. nonstop for 2 weeks. I hadn’t felt so much emotion this pandemic. but it felt like a giant hug. Made me feel more human again. I was feeling pain on the inside, but it felt better than feeling nothing and boredom. And I got to see things a little differently. I reached out to an ex and now we’re working on a friendship, and it’s been a nice addition to this heavy month. Depression is the lack of feeling, and if we can’t feel joy, gotta feel something else... sorrow... anger.... feel it all.
>the only emotions that are spontaneous and "real" from me are frustration and absolute void.   When I don't force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure, I feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life.  I feel similar, and as a result, I've adopted a hybrid philosophy called nihilistic doomerism. Nothing matters or ever mattered, and no God is waiting to tell me that I was a good person in this life either. Alas, I am a shell that is slowly decaying and will only experience suffering until I take my last breath.
Wait so I'm depressed again then. Fuck.
I believe that is literally what depression is, sadly.
Ohhhh yes. And it's just been getting worse iver the laat few months because pandemic.
Yeah, but that's because my life actually is boring (even moreso now with the rona around).
Yea and everything you vaguely enjoy is actually an escape (music, books, games) anything to fill that void
Are you a driver? Are you a good driver?  You might want to try a motorcycle, its the best thing ever to occupy your mind and body. And the fun never ends, I promise. Helped me out a lot.
[removed]
sometimes you can't really tell apart depression from enlightenment.
My thoughts, paralleled.
Yeah I sometimes feel like that. Especially now, I don't get excited about anything, I don't feel much, and I kind of just wait for covid to end, and for all of it to get better. Everything feels so null and just not interesting. But I don't understand why I feel like this, I am only 14, and my life is going "some-what ok" comparatively, I don't know why I feel like that at such a young age. I just play video games to entertain myself, they keep me doing something.
I remember asking myself this same question when I was still in public school... started around age 7? When I look back at any picture of me, I look emotionless. I was in fact emotionless. I remember wondering... why am I the only girl who isn’t bubbly? Or proud? Why am I not excited? I think I felt too much, so I blocked it out. My parents always always always had the news on, and that shit hurts. To this day I don’t watch the news and have disabled the Damned news widget on my phone. I’m not really sure what it was but I did get better... maybe it was moving out, maybe it was having kids, idk. But it’s coming back a bit. This year has been poop.
Try to search for solutions instead of focusing only on problems
Yeah that's totally what I feel   I am already getting help, it's been two year that i'm on therapy   I had a rough relationship that totally destroyed me and made my anxiety problems go through the roof    And I always kinda felt this depression thingy in the back but I always denied, I was like "eh that's not possible, that can't be me, being depressed and all"   But I think i'm slowly realising that the real reason why I feel bad isn't random anxiety from things but the big depression lying behind my back   Thanks man
I feel totally the same, it's cool to know that i'm not alone. You got diagnosed with depression so ?
I'm so apathetic I don't even get bored.  It's ridiculous.  I didn't even realize I was depressed for 8 years because while I had all the usual symptoms of depression I wasn't "sad".
change your scenery, do something you never did (or dreamed to do) before, try something new.. it might help
[Hotel apathy - The magic gang ](https://open.spotify.com/track/0pxKNb56MrqN6ir8ILYbww?si=CVx8MKFJQfCDdwmd7xk57w)
Yeah exactly this
Exactly this
Thanks ! I exactly feel that, taking a shower is awful and I try to change the scenery as much as I can,  i do walks in the forest sometimes, I change games and all and sometimes I make music    But it still has this weird non-pleasure-giving feel and it feels like a chore
sorry i feel that’s so long aha but yeh also baking sweet stuff because it like satisfies my cravings cause i over eat chocolate when i’m sad so baking something a bit more healthy like vegan choc m banana muffins or something helps with cravings but less bad for me
Just stumbled upon this subreddit by clicking the random button. After reading this thread, I'm just realising that I've been depressed for years, this is how I feel every day. Living in the UK doesn't help, its a shithole, its been raining every day for months. Dark cold evenings. Fuckin sucks. My situation isn't too bad either, I'm married, we're OK together, both have good jobs, no kids, but just an enormous feeling of emptyness, quite looking forward to dying. Where's a freak accident or natural disaster when you need one.
Absolutely the same, even for confidence
God damn bro I feel for you. You have therapy ?
But what do when nothing makes me look forward :s
I'm very active sometimes so maybe it's my case also ?
just wanted to say, as someone who related to OP's post, i tried thinking this way today when it got really bad and... this helped a lot. It was such a relief to turn off the part of my brain that cares what anyone thinks or about anything at all. (Cause plants don't have to worry about any of that, all they have to do is exist.) It seemed like the lack of self-pressure was more helpful than a 'pleasant' activity, if i'd done something 'fun' it would probably have just made me mad at myself that i wasn't feeling as good as i was supposed to feel... but just going 'fuck it i don't have to feel anything' was really nice and helpful. Thanks so much for sharing this.
I try to do that sometimes but it makes me super anxious because i'm not productive
That's good to read no worries, thanks !  you have a pretty smart way to tackle this problem
Yeah I always try to think what I expected and act through this lense, it's weird
I'll look it up thanks
Yeah I kinda feel like I put on an act but like   It's more inconscious, when i'm with people I appear happy (but I feel bad) and when i'm alone it's all bad again, but like, I do not control this.   I hope I won't need antidepressant though...    I hope that you'll get better !
You got therapy ?
Feels good to not be alone man, thanks !
Same, really, same...  And I feel like my energy is going down and down, never reloading and I fear that one day I would have none left
I've done some exercise for months but it didn't do shit sadly
Really good way of thinking, props to you man
I would also like to know. Therapy doesn't even help sometimes.
It's weird to see though because I always thought of the depression of people being sad and crying and shit (saw that in my family)   But it's weird to see that it's just dullness
I'm too scared to have a panic attack lol
Yeah even the fun things and games seems to have a weight and tire me. it's awful
I produce music too ! But it still feels kinda bad.  Paradoxally at night i'm hyperactive and i usually feel good lol
Lol I felt this
Yo have you ever seen the movie Inside Out? It’s a kids movie but damn, it’ll make you cry your eyes out. It’s incredibly relatable for people with depression imo
yay
Yeah totally, it feels like i'm a pig with a carrot in front of his face lmao
Well I like going out in my car and drive so i'm okay :p
Say it anyway mate
that's what i'm getting from my therapist.  Apparently it's just that things doesn't "stimulate" me
That's the problem, the solutions i've found (do something new etc) don't work, and the solutions I got during 2+years of therapy doesn't too :)   (not to be mean but that's not a really useful answer. Like for me it doesn't do anything but be wary, don't say that to someone who's suicidal or what it could get things worse)
You are not alone. I think once we accept that life fundamentally sucks and we have no horse in the game, paradoxically we may start feeling better. Once you surrender, and acknowledge you are the only kid that can't swim, in that moment you are suddenly afloat
The last time I had a psychiatric evaluation for anything like this was back when I was about 17 and I don't remember if they officially diagnosed me with depression or not.
Exact same boat. It wasn’t until my relationship combusted in spectacular fashion that I looked into therapy. I thought talking through the heartbreak was what I needed, but learned I’ve had depression for a little over a decade at this point.
That's the problem, everything new that interested me are done and nothing new sparks any interest because it seems like a redo of something i've already done
wow forests walks sounds really tranquil and it’s really good you’re trying all those things. what about trying to cook new things i’m so bad at cooking but still find it fun to try making random stuff just adds a different thing to the day because altho a routine in mindfulness and such is good a routine that’s the same everyday for physical activity i find can drain me more than spontaneous activity
Ahahaha I eat chocolate everytime I can't get enough of this drug    But I don't take weight i'm so lucky tho
i live in the uk too but i kinda like shit weather makes me feel nice and cosy when i’m inside and also sometimes going out and walking in the rain and getting absolutely soaked is fun( bit cringe but yeh). Have you spoken to your partner at all about how you feel ?
Welcome to the club i'd say ! I discovered this today by asking a question so yeah, funnyyyyyyyy
Boston here, haven't seen the sun in two months.  Dark cold evenings are the worst 🙂
I just started a second attempt at therapy last week. I'm not sure how it will go. But I'm hoping that the therapist can at least help get my life in order. How about you?
Become a pleasure seeker. Is pleasure like happiness ? Is it where we can find it or can we create it ? The only reason I stick around is for the transient moments of happiness that may to be. So often they are hard to see. I have an inverse look at things. You are the best when you can find and identify what may have made you glad.
Could be, you should try finding a few good tests online and if you score high go talk to a professional.
Well productivity as a concept is completely man made, it's just the way modern society gauges people starting from school to the professional field, Listen if you find yourself doing something you like and enjoying doing it, spending a big amount of time on it is not called being productive, I call it being in harmony. Sometimes you can be in harmony while doing nothing, no one is there to judge that except yourself, so be indulgent towards yourself and let things flow.
Same for me too. Once everyone goes to bed I feel like I can finally make time for me. But they don’t make me unhappy. It’s weird. Always been a night owl for this reason. Maybe it’s having the pressure off?
yes i have!! what a fantastic movie and lesson <33
The upside is that if anti-depressants work for you it might help with this feeling as well.
I consistently feel detached from most people I know, almost all of my actions are forced because they need to be done or I need a distraction from feeling empty. I view my life as a home with lights on a table set for dinner but nobody is inside, a constant emptiness gradually grows larger even as I'm typing this, my only happiness comes from the few people I know that truly understand me.
Okay I got it , I'm sorry
I’ve had depression through many many years. My survival motto has become “it could always be worse” although I admit I have a false sense of envy at the happy person in a wheelchair.
Yeah I get that, this way of thinking passes through sometimes but it hurts.
this is how i feel as well. its not like im a huge achiever with millions of dollars or anything like that, but all the things that i really wanted to do, either out of curiosity or to remove that thorn from my life, ive done and achieved them to a certain degree where im comfortable with the level. other things remaining... don't interest me. is it cool if i saw the aurora, would i be totally in awe? yeah, maybe. but, its not something i HAVE to or really really wanna do. things like marriage, raising children... i dunnoe. i think they're not biologically engineered in me.
Well I try but it's so tiresome and I feel like it's useless. I feel like more and more giving up but eh, i'm still trying for now   Cooking do seem fun tho, it's nice that you try, what are your favorites things to cook  ?    I also tried sports but meh
me neither fast metabolism for the win ahaha but my therapist told me it was a bad coping strategy because it could lead to mor serious addictions especially with the personality disorder i have
Carry on man, it'll work I knew it ! It's been two years that i'm under therapy and I felt horrible for like at least 1 whole year and 8 months. But it's been let's say 2 months that I feel kinda okayish sometimes. It works !
That's what i'm trying already, thanks :D
Really deep words, thanks.
Yeah I know but I fear being on medication... being dependant and all.  It would also validate the fact that i'm crazy and out of norms and that's my worst fear.
I feel you, really...
No problem <3
I hope you and your therapist are able to talk through how normal it is for you to have these symptoms if you have major depressive disorder.   It might also be worth a consultation with a psychiatrist to see if it might make sense to get started on medication.  When my depression is bad, I experienced the same lack of pleasure along with a debilitating lack of motivation. Because of antidepressants, these periods don’t last as long as they used to, are not as severe as they used to be, and happen less often. I also am able to truly feel, unlike the numb feeling I had during the worst of my depression. I wouldn’t say I found an inspiring meaning to life, but I do have a life worth living, which is a hell of a lot better than I was doing even two years back. I have wrestled with depression since I was 10, which means I’ve been at this for 34 years. If you have been on psych meds for a while, it’s also important to be aware that sometimes antidepressants can poop out after a few years, and sometimes a switch to a different medication is a good idea. Sometimes, it’s a matter of raising the dose.   I have lived that colorless, dull, numb life before. It was 1992 when I had an “a-ha” moment that the Prozac had started working: I felt actual happy emotion when I was listening to a favorite song, as opposed to just “not-sadness.” I was 16. It had been six years since I had felt joy.  You don’t have to go through the rest of your life feeling this way.
I totally feel like that it's incredible, thanks.
i really like doing different pastas because it’s easy but like salmon and greens in a creamy sauce with tagliatelle is so yum and i out chilli flakes in as well, and i make a lot of soups because they are like comfort foods and you get a lot of portions so lasts a couple days, really like potato and broccoli or butternut squash and ginger or good old fashioned veg soup and i whizz all mine cause like them smooth
I'm hoping! Hope it all goes well for you!!
Well, I mean, depression isn't normal and is an illness after all.  Some illnesses can be like the common cold, and medication only eases the symptoms rather than cure the problem. Other illnesses are like infections, and antibiotics literally cure the problem. Some are even like diabetes where it's not something you've caught, but a break down in how your body works.  And Depression can often be like any of those for different people.  An anti-depressant might literally cure your depression, if it's caused by an imbalance in brain chemicals that those antidepressants target.  A diabetic who's body doesn't produce enough insulin naturally needs insulin to keep living a happy healthy life, maybe you need more of a certain brain chemical to do the same.  There's no shame in being a diabetic, and there's no shame in having depression, the medicine is there to help. You're not some weak minded nilly and anti-depressants are some crutch that a stronger person wouldn't need. That's just silly talk.  Anti-depressants might not fix the problem, but they might make it more bearable, or they might do nothing at all. Not to mention that there are tons of different antidepressants that work in different ways, some may help and others may not, it all depends on you, and sadly the best way to figure it all out is experimentation.  The idea that you're crazy because you need antidepressants is a bit backwards, and almost completely wrong. You're not crazy, you're sick. And medicine might help.
Thanks for this message really !  My therapist never actually told me what I have for now and sometimes I am able to feel happiness so i'm not so far gone for now. It's just that everything feel kinda forced you know. That it's far from natural and spontaneous. Your testimony really gives me hope, thanks.
Soups are so based ! You seem like a lovely cook, it's impressive really, I can't even cook pastas lmao
Same for you bro <3
Yeah true.. thanks man, really
Hope is such a huge factor in recovery from our illness/disorder/condition, it helps any formal or informal treatment work even better, particularly if the relationship with providers is good. That therapeutic alliance is everything. Well, 80% or so.
ahah it’s just practise and i’m really not very good like i always need help and will be ringing diff people when i get stuck which is a lot of the time aha
It's normal to need help ! I would've need a lot of help if I started cooking too i'm so bad at it lol  But you seem good from what you  tell me :) I would love to learn how to make spaghetti bologna
i love spaghetti especially carbonara or linguini which is slightly thicker so yummy aha, maybe for christmas you should treat yourself to a pasta recipe book and learn some new dishes ?? :)
Eeeeh i'll try to search one pdf somewhere on the internet, I don't wanna spend money on that hahaha  Do you know what a spetzle is ?
no what is it ...
