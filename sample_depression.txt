We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say "PM me anytime" in a casual social context.    We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.    Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.  *****  ###Summary###  **Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.**    "PM me anytime" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.  * **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.    * People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue.   * **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)    * In our observation over many years, the people who say "PM me" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.    *  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.  * If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.
Understood and I apologise if I forget in the future and break it
I agree wholeheartedly.  When you're struggling, the random person you are not acquainted with saying "pm me" is generally not comforting, and I don't like seeing it thrown at people who post looking to get an honest discussion.  We're all damaged, and having an open support group is better than a one-on-one most of the time.  As an aside, I slightly disagree with this:  >The 1-9-90 rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  It doesn't change the point you are making, but I think it's interesting.  I feel like this subreddit may be a bit of an exception to the 1-9 part.  If "creation" is making posts and starting discussion and "contributing" is replying to posts, then I think we have as much or even more creation as* contribution based on the low number of responses the majority of new posts get.    It's an understandable issue that I don't think can be resolved; people come here to try and work on their own issues, the issues presented can be very difficult - leaving people afraid of making an unhelpful response, and a lot of our potential contributors lack confidence or are dislike direct interaction.    This just makes it even more important to keep discussions in an open comment section rather than a PM.  Lurkers are all over, and sometimes will come upon posts well after they reach their peak popularity through searching.  If progress is made, we want it to be accessible.
Biggest Problem on private talks may be that you may reach a point where you're out of advice for the one who needs help and then what ? just leave the chat ? - that would even make it worse for both of you. In Public chat there's a good chance others may jump in where you got lost
I have to agree with this. I know that people mean well but sometimes it’s better to let the person vent and make that person feel understood instead of trying to change that person and make him/her happier.   I feel that forced positivity has a worse effect on me than sad posts. It’s hard for people without mental illnesses to understand that.   Sorry for my rambling. That’s my two cents on the topic.
Great rule! I’ve never thought about things you said but you made some great points.       And even as I didn’t think about it I still felt like this type of comments were unnecessary. Like most of them aren’t ready to commit to having a thoughtful conversation but they comment anyway.      It is also very hard for a person who struggles with depression to initiate a conversation. “PM me anytime” isn’t an initiation. OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don’t deserve the time and attention.      It would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP’s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with “PM me if you want to answer privately”. Now OP won’t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn’t initiate a conversation — it has already been initiated. As you said, it’s better not to offer to PM and as it’s a rule now nobody should do it — I’m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where “PM me” is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.      Also seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker. It makes you feel like nobody really cares about strangers’ problems.
Thank you for posting this.... as much as I want to have a more personal connection with people here, I realize how that pre-disposes OP's to VERY bad advice and people who are suffering are often in an altered state that DOES NOT benefit others.  That's why I try to only reply to posts when I'm up and only make posts when I'm down (don't try to look for them I use multiple accounts and delete old posts and so should you guys for the sake of not being discriminated against for your problems, which are normal and sometimes feel extreme and can make the general public react to you irrationally because they don't understand).  Love you guys so much, I wish everyone as much happiness as possible, especially coming up on the holidays.
I really appreciate this post!   As someone who's posted here, I've received a few PMs that started off with the usual: "Hey, how are you? I felt like you needed to talk to someone."  I really appreciated the sentiment, but it felt like a forced interaction. Not without care or consideration, but catered specifically to be a body to talk to and knowing the intention behind it, ironically made me feel obligated to politely respond, but pussyfooted (for a lack of a better word) in my attitude.   This is only because I know it's a sincere, but more importantly, an instantly sympathetic reaction to a sad post. It's not something I expect to be a meaningful, lasting relationship, but one born for a moment out of immediate sympathy. Like a hand on the shoulder.   I do appreciate them. I really do, but I also can do without it, and like the moderators here have said, comments are all I need. Commiserating, advice for me or anybody relating to the OP, or a simple upvote to show support is really all I'm looking for. If a meaningful online interaction \*naturally\* precipitates, I'm all for it. I hope I'm not being too sensitive, but hey... I guess that's why I'm here haha
I’m guilty of doing this and, as others have pointed out, it has always been out of goodwill but it is too unpredictable and therefore dangerous. Especially earlier this year when I started therapy and found this sub I wanted to feel better and helping others or the though of helping others aided me in that;  I fell into the “I want to feel helpful” category despite my best intentions.  I did end up having a private conversation with someone, helping them as best I could, as often as I could and it started of pretty good no matter the time or topic. However, a couple days in I was out of advice and at a low point myself. The conversations came to a screeching halt - they couldn’t help me and I couldn’t help them. Their issues had transformed into (or had always been about) something entirely different than their original post posited and I turned into a helpee myself instead of a helper. We both went our separate ways none the better.   After that I never replied regarding dm’s and kept it to comment chains only.  Thank you for doing this and thank you for your work, this is a safe place which sometimes might need protecting from itself. After all, in the haze of my own misery and thoughts I never properly read the rules and just.. reached out.
Thank you for this ! Offers like this intend to help but no.. Just no lol
Thank you so much for this.
I think I broke this rule more than once in the past..I'm sorry guys I will think more before leaving a comment.
I agree "pm me anytime" is useless, imo if someone was that concerned, drop them a message not with a "I'm here to help message me anytime" but ask them what's up, people don't want to ask for help, especially in cases like this where someone's depression might feel silly even though it's not, I'm not sure on how much harm would come of it but possibly just being direct and making the person talk about it, starting with the concerning person might possibly be the way to do it
Wow. I understand that the rules are the rules, but you just painted *everyone* who offers that as either a psycho or a predator. I must say I am feeling like one now because of all the stuff you have said about a simple act of kindness, which is the only reason I ever offered to do so. Sad really. But, the rules are the rules. Now I have some hard thinking to do. Again, just wow...
Here’s my story and experience with this- I posted on SW a long time ago and was targeted by a much older man (I was an 18 y/o girl) preying on vulnerable women. He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted.   He convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being “crazy”. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could “find me easily”. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house.   A couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I’m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop. I don’t know if my video was used in court I kind of left it all behind after that.   But anyway. All this came from one PM. You should never trust a random stranger not everyone is just looking out for you and wants to talk.
I personally don't come here looking for helpers or to become a helper for other people. I'm mostly looking for people I can feel more connected to, for whom I can feel true empathy. And if I could make friends that would be very nice but I know that's not easy.  I don't know about the others but the whole 'relationship with the institution' thing is a huge part of the reason I personally don't like help lines. It's like we're supposed to talk to NPCs. Just like therapists (who I see as helpful tools rather than people who care about me. Well at least help lines do their thing for free.  Not trying to question the rules or anything just expressing how I feel about this. I'm pretty sure a lot of people would agree with me (which is also why I'm thankful to this community, I can relate to people, they can relate to me).
I wish I would've seen this sooner. I apologize for all the infractions.
I think this is a good rule, thanks. Someone's who's depressed doesn't need to risk being hurt by anyone here potentially offering to talk to them but not following through on it, then maybe feeling even more like no one cares. Besides, perhaps others could use the advice that would otherwise be given in PM's.
Good shout. I would never presume to offer that kind of one-on-one interaction mainly because *I do not want that myself*, and I am pretty sure most of us are in the same boat.
I apologize for breaking this rule. I never had the intention to put anyone at risk by doing so. I do hope I'm not going to break this again.
Had posted something here and someone PM’d me offering cbd oils for my depression.   Glad my depression can help someone earn money /s
I really agree. People start talking to me and then just stop. In that moment of depression I feel like we're friends, but I guess not.
Yes, this is a very sensible sticky in my opinion.  I have been on both sides of this coin. As a "helper", I find that I didn't really help the person via a more live chatting or back and forth messaging. Posting a few replies on the person's thread and boosting them up is fine, but you it's just a whole new ballgame to try and be the person's friend/advisor.  As a helpee, I've found myself disappointed as the person (understandably) just seemed like they didn't actually care all that much with their proposal, and even if they did, it's just not what I was seeking (which is not their fault obviously!).  So yeah, in a way it might even worsen things sometimes. I'm all for support, but I think that it's actually best to just keep it on the thread.
Almost every day i see someone I want to talk to more about what's going on and then I realize where that might lead when one of us reaches that emotional fatigue. It's good advice. It does make more sense to me to post it publicly also, because as you've stated it will likely be useful to a handful of people. Thanks so much for clarifying this.
ahh shit.
this makes sense thanks mods
What if I've been talking with someone in the comment thread for a while? Like were 5-10 replies deep and talked out the current issue? Cuz at that point I don't want to just say good luck see ya, so I'll sometimes say pm me if you want to talk more. But often avoid it, even tho it feels wrong, just to respect the rule even tho I feel like I've appreciated and understood its intentions
bro I feel so bad... I'm sorry
Agreed. Even if PM me is from a person who really wants to help it looks like 'ok I understand, send me a message whenever you want because rn I dont have a reason to try and help'
This makes me feel better about the way PMs in response to my depressing posts make me feel.  I never really feel comfortable with it.
> **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP.**   This is sort of counterproductive though. Most of the time, help isn't generalized, it's personalized by nature. Not everyone's depression look the same, some advice can trigger anxiety in others while it can be a wake-up call to some.      Generally a common way of dealing with depression from a CBT perspective is things like training mindfulness and practicing it often. But this is extremely hard for people with diagnoses like ADD, ADHD to get a working routine on, I'm not saying to defend the "PM you anytime" but reddit is a horrendously bad forum to help people quickly, often people get replies during a week's period and some form of support group for this type of struggle, not when people are suicidal low, but still depressed enough to make it hinder their lives can be helped if we could setup some form of group chat to remind each other or give ideas of how to deal with certain situations. A lot of times people know what they need to do, but hearing someone else tell them to do it will be of great importance.
When I’m on Twitter I get people saying ‘My DMs are open’ or ‘I’m here to chat’ but like I barely know them and I’m not one to talk it out privately, so I get it.
This is the reason why I use large chat groups. Even with those who have been trained in supporting ppl,I feel they might get too drained out. There is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.
So on Twitter, I’ve expressed my woes before and the DMs I got weren’t really assuring. I get that people mean well but pep talks don’t really help. Because even though they mean well, it comes off as, “Hey, you’re a freak. But don’t worry, someday you’ll grow out of being a freak!” Empathy is so much better honestly, but not many people give that. That being said, this is a great reiterative step in the right direction. Thank you!
I think I get it. It makes sense since I've helped people through difficult situations through private chats, and it can be extremely distressing when the person you're trying to help is suicidal. I'm not a trained mental health professional, and yet I've already dealt with enough of that stuff for one lifetime. Unfortunately, I have a tendency to play the savior for other people whilst neglecting my own issues.
I'm sorry, I just realized that I broke this rule. Won't do it again.
This isn’t related to the post but can I message someone? I really need someone to talk to and I can’t post because it always says post failed
[deleted]
Rules broken and fixed, but though i might share some point of view mod.  In the info section it's mentioned that helper can write in comment if their intention is positive, yet for some they are shy to post in public but they want to share their experience so they might opt to PM.  Although i understand that this rules is to prevent consequences, i am just sharing a view so that PMs are not so negatively viewed.  Although again yes, positive PMs might result in getting the OPs hopes up and gullible for bad-intentioned PMs, but i think i just need to share this.  I don't know if the english is too confusing or understandable though.  Anyway cheers for your wholesome effort 👊🏻
I agree, and I appreciate scorpionstanks and others good intentions. It's amazing to see that volunteerism and sometimes it does help those with depression. But agency/community contact is important. Everyone gets compassion fatigue. Having seen and heard our crisis coordinators, some of the most compassionate individuals I've met after a 12 hour shift. And you get the idea that their rapport building and call quality goes down substantially.   These are people who have brought people back from the ledge on a 30 minute phonecall, but clearly would barely be able to handle a simple check in with a well known well behaved caller after their shift.
Shit, I just broke that rule, I just panicked when I saw a post of a young girl talking about harming herself.
*Let Me Add My Thoughts with this, I've  must confess I didn't  read the whole post* (or the wiki, wanna check it out later, full focused  in it, I'm  kinda busy rn xp, I promise)  *and I will appreciate  greatly all kinds of feedbacks you all would like to give me. Well, with your permission:  I've suffered depression/been depressed since I was around 10 yo until this year's  February (2019). (Major depressive disorder, severe depression, you name it. The first  condition it's only a raw translation from my native language to English, although it may be different as the actual English name, sorry if I've made a mistake)  I don't  want to offend anyone here or make this condition appear to be worse than it really is, but for me, it was Hell. Perhaps I'm  lacking the proper words to describe it but for me it feels/felt like that. Around the same age ( I've  started  my toxic relationship with depression) I've  developed anxiety disorder, I'm  still struggling/fighting against that B****.  A nasty combo.  For some reason unknown, even for myself, in some moment in that time I've started to think about both conditions as females, ladies, nothing against them obviously, they are more beautiful than men,  proved they are more intelligent than men and without the ladies we are just savages, love them all. Xp   Now, as an adult (25 years old, male) I've took a phrase for myself, it says, more or less:  "Depression is nothing more than a sad lady knocking at our door in a rainy night. Let her in and listen carefully what she has to say, but do not let her stay. Once the rain has stopped, say goodbye to her. Otherwise, she *Will* get into every corner of your house( Inner me, mind, etc), and kicking her out it's hard, painful and takes lots of time, wasting life. You don't  have to be rude, though, learn how to treat her, listening her words and advising her are the best way to help her and yourself. Letting her stay and being rude will start  a war between both of you, a nasty one, and in the beginning, she is always stronger than us.  Takes years to overpower her and acquire control.  Listen the echoes inside of you, the voice around you and read the words dedicated to you. It may be someone nice trying to be nice with themselves or he/she could be someone struggling too, trying to make you know that there's others with their own wars, some of em had lost some battles, others had won, but all of em are fighting back, see them and learn from them. A few others have lost the will to fight and this lady took their heart, alongside their last breath. I never forget them, it could have been me. There's stairs to heaven, highways to hell and the unlimited potential we all have to evolve, let me tell you my secret ;) :you seek outside the reasons, help, strength or anything you think you need to not give up. You NEED to go and look inside, think about  it. We are amazed by the wonders in the space, maybe because we already forget the beauty of the jewels in the deeps of the planet. That's the hint.  I'm fool and forget to mention another possibility: if the written words were made for your eyes, the voices for your eyes, or the cheers for your heart, it could be a type of people I admire, respect and decided to become one of them in the future: The friends beyond all the fight. Because you'll find a friend in almost every one of them. And they will be one (or both) of two things: and adviser/helper, like masters, to share with you where they did stumble in their path and suggest useful things. Or your friends, doing the same as the first, and even more, much more. They've learned to appreciate anything that shines in the darkness after living there for so long that they don't  want anybody to feel the same, and if you let me include myself with them, we will do such things because we like it, and we mean it.  I am or I am not. Always. I'm always Too much of anything or absolutely nothing,  There's no mid points to me, I pour my soul in every thing I've decide to do, always help to anyone I can, serve the others and do good recklessly. That's one thing or two I believe in. So, c'mon Bro, grab this hand I didn't had and take the strength I've lacked. Anytime you want, mate. That's why I'm here for."                                                                                                          The mind of Sun  That's a little thingy I wrote not so long ago, I've felt it would be nice posting it here,  it's  not the complete thing, it has some holes intentionally, but it's the first 80% of my own writings I've post ever. Hope it doesn't offend anyone, if it do not help you by any means, hopefully don't  hurt anyone either. I like to write, you know, my poison  of choice are poetry and philosophy  (damned poetry 😂), And if you catch even the tiniest bit of the deep meaning it also have, you already figured it wasn't a cute this half of my life. Lived in the bottom for years, pretended to be fine bc like we all do, I didn't want to worry not even one of my love ones, I was unable to have a treatment with a psychologist or psychoanalyst, and my whole list of sins didn't help much either. I've even tried to "end" myself  (sorry for this) four times. Obviously, fortunately, unsuccessfully.  After I've surpassed, the very first day after, for the first time in years, I've  woke up, happy. I don't  remembered the last time it happened. A couple of weeks after I've decided to believe in the things I've mentioned in my poor writing above, among others. And even more in those in the last two lines. I didn't had anybody to help me. Support me, freaking avoid I've tried those 4 things. I'm not fully recovered, I believe  this lady never really leave, it's always lurking but nice you won her, it's  more hard for her to regain full control. I've decided to always go beyond if I find myself a limit for anything, return anything good people do or give to me 10x  times better, if it was something bad, I'd return them something 100x better, don't  be cruel, don't lose yourself, do not treat people as bad as they are, treat them as good as you are.  Many people here would probably know what cost me to learn these things too.  That's why I wanna help and give my full disposition when I've reply something similar. Regardless I do like to know all kinds people. Although I don't think of myself like a hero or anything. I'm trying to save pain to people that haven't reach that point, help the ones there, and for all the people struggling I'm  saying: I'm here for you, if you want. Just say the word. I don't start a chat, perhaps because I would be acting for my own selfishness at first glance. It's  the way I respect people's desires.  Although, I know how hard it is.    THAT'S IT, I'VE EXTENDED MYSELF QUITE MUCH. MY APOLOGIES HOMIES. I ASK YOU ALL TO FORGIVE MY GRAMMAR, I'M NOT A NATIVE ENG SPEAKER, LEARNED IT BY MYSELF, STILL POLISHING IT, I'M DOING MY BEST.  THE WRITING IT'S OBVIOUSLY PHRASES I'VE READ AND LIKED, MIXED WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS. I USE THESE QUOTE TO SYNTHESIZE MY OWN THOUGHTS/WRITINGS. I'm still a bit embarrassed for it. Let me quote a hero: "Whenever you suffer pain, keep in mind that it’s nothing to be ashamed of and that it can’t degrade your guiding intelligence, nor keep it from acting rationally and for the common good"  "My relationship to them. That we came into the world for the sake of one another."       MARCUS AURELIUS   You are more than you think, stronger than you feel, loved than you believe and unique than you perceive. Seek something you like or care about, make it a hobby. And do it relentlessly.   Things like mindfulness, stoicism, a essay/book of a subject you like, even slightly interested in, are helpful too.  Learn more things, do more things. Once you realize what's stopping you, bringing you down, you'll gain power over it and it will get weaker and weaker.  You are far more than you think. I believe that, soon you'll  do it too.  Regardless the feedback you guys give me, I'm  here.  Keep that in mind. Why not? ;)  Good vibes homies ✌✌✌😎 I send you all a Bro hug.  You can.  Edit: I gave some format to this text, I'm on a mobile right now, you know Reddit don't care about formatting and stuff. 2. I'm respecting the rule of no offering pm or smh, this was a last time. It could be helpful too, hard to measure and globalize something too random as the human being. Just saying. I'll stick to the rule from now on.
I'm sorry I'm very late to this topic but I agree entirely.   I appreciate the intentions may be good, but from previous experiences there are times when the conversation reaches a natural end - but the other person simply won't stop responding. I've had three definite experiences of this in the past where after a few messages back and fourth, I just want to be left alone and continue. I don't want to remain in private contact but there's no polite way of putting this across to the other person.   Prior to my time on Reddit, there was one particular forum I was a member of who private messaged me for many months. Probably getting on for a year. In the end, I just had to stop replying and inevitably ended up blocking that person when they continued to message me for weeks afterwards - turning quite nasty.   As my own personal rule, I don't and haven't responded to any private messages for around a year. I don't mean to offend anyone by that but after several 'less than pleasant' experiences and then the expectation to remain in contact thereafter - I've just had to call it a day and say "*enough's enough*". I'll stick to responding to comments in the public domain.
As a (very) newcomer to this sub, I find this post to be sensible - I guess, but also extraordinarily sad.
That's really cool.
It sucks, but I 100% agree with this rule. Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.  The crux of the issue I found is, you don’t know who you are helping. You don’t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for. As well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don’t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don’t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived. As was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.  My own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.  I’m not saying don’t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!  But as I said, you don’t know who you are helping and they don’t know you. And if you aren’t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties. Accusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.  To all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.
Thank you very much, it makes alot of sense.
I just saw this now, ill read it
So precisely worded and explained, very well communicated.
How can we block someone who has repeatedly sent PMs?
Wow, Thank you. I always feel I wanna be the helper guy... and this post makes so much sense. Although you'd expect that people (helpers) know these things, when you have good intentions you do not notice the bad/side effects ... and yes you are making promises that you might not keep...  Thank you for this post
What if the person in question is in the verge of committing suicide?
I'm sad that this is discouraged😣I mean, I get it, but still. doctors wont help, or prescribe meds. Family and friends are incapable or unwilling to help. Anonymous redditors are probably my last hope.
Oh wow, I’ve totally accepted a few such requests, and I’ve always felt that I let the person down. Since I have so many issues of my own, and since I’m not a professional, I cannot always be there in the online way that people might expect.   My being on the autism spectrum may have something to do with it. I don’t have great judgement concerning social interactions.
Just commented on a user's post after trying to reach out on another sub a week or so ago then saw this sticky and wanted to apologize to the mods this makes a lot of sense. I'm not sure if my comment and previous post were deleted or if my phone is acting up, but wanted to thank the mods for the well thought out explanation
[deleted]
My bad. I did that shit. My apologies.
ahh i just did that, i apologize.  but im it really is hard to do nothing.  what was the saying?  evil thrives when good men do nothing. i understand the need for the rule, most here are not trained in last resort intervention me included. but can i call myself a good man if i just scroll by...
I'll apologize up front. Unwittingly guilty. Mine came about because an OP asked what had happened to make me suicidal at such a young age (6 yrs old). That was of concern to me as I felt the "whole truth" on an open platform might be triggering or too NSFW for a minor. My private message asked the inquire's age up front with the statement I'd not tell all the facts of my story to a minor. They were 14 so "apologized" for asking... From my history, NOT my intent to belittle or dismiss any child/young person who might be struggling with similar historical casual agents & stated that. Thereafter, I gave only a brief summary of just the initial harsh facts.  My end comment was that, honestly there was no way I could "fix" whatever they were dealing with, BUT that they had my ear as a safe place to vent. Mea Culpa.  Commentary/Feedback?
Thanks for sharing the insights. I am glad I came across it. Just one suggestion, can u please hyperlink some terms like compassion fatigue (maybe with wikipedia article??) and others.....  I was feeling many other things while reading this, but as the current state of things is with me, I am forgetting/losing track of feelings pretty quickly (idk, it may be flooding followed by my mind closing floodgates).... anyways, very nice post 👍👍
I just went through it, I did ask a couple of guys for direct chat, Apologies, It won't happen again. However, I have handled these kinds of cases in past and studied a bit about human psychology as I'm a survivor myself. Anyway, It won't happen again.
I always think about this story about a woman that was dead for two years in her apartment before her remains were found. This is how I imagine the end of my life will be. I’ll die alone, with no one missing a beat.

Point taken!! I have done this a few times so I'm glad I read this. Thanks for enlightening me.
This makes a lot of sense and I wish I would’ve read this years ago
I had no idea about that, this should be also fixed on suicidewatch, sometimes I ask people to pm not because I want to feel close to them, but because sometimes the person isn't using a thrwoaway and don't wanna give too much details in public. Anyway, this rule makes a lot of sense.
So disable comments completely? I don't understand how this can be avoided accurately.
[deleted]
I understand that it's why I talk with people and sometime,s people just want someone to listen . me I try to remain active as possible sometimes I am helping people else where . and  I understand abuse concerns . it's those who are down who can be pushed to the edge . one thing I learnt  when I was younger you can't always save everyone. but it doesn't mean you should give up on speaking words of love,compassion and support
n.b.  I'm not speaking just to you, /u/scorpiontank27), but to everyone who's been upvoting this comment.  In addition to what /u/circinia has so wisely pointed out, there's another reason why it's a sign that's something's seriously wrong if you have trouble remembering this rule.    If you're really thinking about others' experience, then knowing how getting them into a PM conversation is likely to turn out should make a huge impression on you.  If it hasn't, then maybe you need to ask yourself whether you're responding to others here for the right reasons.  Sometimes when "we want to help", what it means is that "we want to feel helpful".  "PM me any time" is an easy way to make ourselves feel helpful, but if you really think about what the other person's experience, it feels completely different.
Please refresh your memory as often as you need to - the rules are always posted right there in the sidebar ("community info" on mobile), and we'll ensure the wiki stays highly visible as well.  Edit: I'm also concerned that you might not have understood the post, actually, if the general idea of "offering private contact as a first resort here leaves many people with depression feeling worse or at higher risk for abuse and/or suicide, even when done with the best of intentions" is hard to remember. Please let us know if there's anything we can do to make the wiki page clearer.
I just had to learn about this. It's dangerous to take on too much all at once especially if you aren't a professional. We want to help and sometimes we think there's no potential for error if our intentions are good. Do a little good where you can and just help people to understand they aren't worthless and aren't alone. I appreciate the tact of the mods. This made me appreciate Reddit ten fold.
>  I feel like this subreddit may be a bit of an exception to the 1-9 part. If "creation" is making posts and starting discussion and "contributing" is replying to posts, then I think we have as much or even more creation as* contribution based on the low number of responses the majority of new posts get.   I think that part of it is that a lot of posts are actually kind of comments rather than creations.  A surprising number of posts here are title-only, and we're not super-happy about that.  We would like to see people who've reached out for support (and given the community meaningful information to respond to) get more quality responses and we're working on some things to help with that.
> I feel that forced positivity has a worse effect on me than sad posts.  You're not alone, and this topic is one of the info wikis we're working on.

> it’s better not to offer to PM and as it’s a rule now   It's been a rule for *seven years*.
<3
Same. I got sick of all the "follow my magic cure" dms hahaha.
Can someone teach me how to play something?  I don’t see options to create a post
Yeah I agree. I don’t mind when people at least try but when they immediately send you a PM and say "was upppp" I immediately decline because I don’t want to deal with someone who clearly doesn’t get it. Especially when they ask "what’s wrong, why are you depressed", then why the hell did you lurk around on here and send me a private message then? It’s so fucked up.
We made the wiki and this post to make people aware of the potential consequences of getting into private conversations because we know those consequences are hard to foresee.    We don't mean to "paint" anyone, but although there are definitely predators out there, most of the people who offer private contact have nothing but friendly good intentions, but they don't have the information needed to understand the risks and downsides of getting into private conversations too early.  That's not their fault.
Wow, thanks for sharing your cautionary tale. So sorry that happened to you.
Wow that's awful. I'm so sorry you went through that, there are truly some sick people out there! Those are the ones who should be made fun of us, not people like us
Thanks, but it would be better if you went back and removed them from your history.
Agree, it's mostly coming from misguided do-gooders who aren't really thinking about the experience they'd actually be giving to the people they're trying to help.
Yep.   The worst part is that most people who contact me directly are stupid bs advertisers or someone who’s just lurking and has no clue what depression is. I’ve made sure to report these people more, I don’t want to come of as a dick but they’re obviously breaking the rules.
That's a well-known network of PM spambots.  Please report any PMs of that nature to the reddit admins.  The more of these accounts that get flagged, the better dossier they can build.
Yep that has happened to me many times : (
Same! It sucks. When you’re just left all alone and they don’t respond back : (
>  Like were 5-10 replies deep and talked out the current issue?  At 10 replies deep it's fine to offer a PM.  That's why the rule includes "as a first resort".
Yep, especially the ones about selling me pseudoscience cures. Dont forget to always report them to the moderators, who knows maybe they'll give you a cookie, right SQLwitch?
> This is sort of counterproductive though. Most of the time, help isn't generalized, it's personalized by nature.   Uh, no it isn't.  We're not suggesting anything so superficial as lurkers happening to read exactly what they need to hear said to someone else.  Observing truly supportive exchanges is good for everyone's mental health, and a great learning experience for those who want to help but aren't sure how.    > Not everyone's depression look the same, some advice can trigger anxiety in others while it can be a wake-up call to some.    Which is why we explicitly discourage advice.    FYI chats have been tried here many, many times and all have ended in disaster.  We've been forced to conclude that it's not a fit for our population and can't support any further attempts.
It's always difficult (and worrying) when someone gets attached to a resource or individual that just isn't able to provide the right support.  It happens sometimes at my IRL crisis line, most often because they've never had a supportive conversation before they talked to us, so they kind of "imprint" on us (we literally call them "ducklings").  It can happen for other reasons too, and no mattter how it comes about, the end result is that they are convinced that "only X can help me" and also that "X has what I need", both of which are almost always untrue.  This happens all too often even when nobody creates unrealistic expectations or makes - or at least implies - impossible promises  - but "PM me anytime" does both those things.    >  There is one guy who suffers from depression n a slew of undiagnosed issues who always private messages me to respond to my issues which really annoys me. It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.  One of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people *not* in crisis.  We harm people by *not* disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly "I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment.
We also have a specific rule against "pep talks", i.e. general uplifting content.  That and "success stories" both generally work about as well as showing starving people pictures of food.    FYI neither of these rules are new, they're just widely ignored despite our efforts.
There's a lot more to it that that,but this is definitely a key concern.
Please help us by removing any rule-breaking responses. We catch as many as we can, but having any bad examples out there is a problem.
It looks like the technical glitch resolved itself - so sorry that was happening!   Just in case it's helpful in the future, the best thread for making a support request in the comments is the check-in thread at the top of the sub. We also welcome modmails (PM to /r/depression, that reaches the whole mod team at once) about problems on the sub.
Not sure why you put this here, but from reading your history, it sounds like your current therapist isn't handling your disclosure of thoughts of suicide in a way that's helping you.    This is, sadly, such a common problem that we have[this link](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2013/07/22/therapists-who-do-not-panic/) on our official resource list over at /r/SuicideWatch.
As the post explains, offering help in a PM that the OP didn't ask for carries serious risks (both for the person you're offering support to and for you) and can do a lot of harm no matter how well-intentioned; well-intentioned "helpers" using accidentally harmful strategies are actually the most common source of harm we see on this sub. So it's appropriate for people to be wary of offers of help that come this way.  I'm not totally certain if your concern is for people who might want to ask for support in private (which as the post says is always okay although it still carries some risks) or for people who want to offer help in PMs, though...? Again we're glad to clarify anything that doesn't make sense.
> These are people who have brought people back from the ledge on a 30 minute phonecall, but clearly would barely be able to handle a simple check in with a well known well behaved caller after their shift.  Let alone the 3-hour calls that *don't* end well, eh?  It's extremely rare for crisis-line responders to do 12-hours shifts for many reasons including compassion fatigue.  Ours are 4 hours for phone shifts and 5 for online chat.  Double shifts are *strongly* discouraged.
If someone is harassing you in PMs, please report that to the admins.  Exactly how to block and/or report someone depends on which app or client you're using.   In the official mobile apps, both are available by tapping the three dot menu in the top right corner of each message in your PM list.
Then it's even more important to avoid getting into a private conversation.
This rule doesn't mean you can get support here; that's really the only thing we do.
Sorry to hear you're having such a tough time, but an announcement post isn't the best place to talk about it.    Maybe put up a comment in the check-in, or feel free to make a post yourself.
>  it really is hard to do nothing  ... but can i call myself a good man if i just scroll by...  Your choices are **not** "do nothing or invite private contact"!  The wise choice for those offering support is to respond openly by replying to the posts of OPs you feel you can relate to.
If you link the thread in question I'll be happy to take a look.
You can report a PM to the sitewide admins by clicking "report" on it or going to https://www.reddit.com/report/ - don't post usernames of spammers, please!   I appreciate your wanting to report it - trying to proselytize to people when they're struggling with depression is not in any way okay or helpful, really sorry that happened.
We're sorry for what you're going through, but replying to an announcement post is not the best way to ask for support.  Please make your own post or reply to the check-in.  If you want to talk to the moderators,  use the "contact the moderators" function.
We have this rule on /r/SuicideWatch as well - did you receive the automatic welcome message pointing you towards the guidelines (which mentions the PM guideline specifically) after your first comment on someone else's post there?
> So disable comments completely?  No, making *comments* is what helpers should be doing.  What they shouldn't be doing is taking the conversation immediately to a private channel like reddit PMs or chat, etc.
> so can we chant on private in reddit or does it mean for every thing? Even reddit??  Sorry, I'm not sure exactly what this means.

There's no sidebar on mobile.  Edit: at least as far as I've seen.

> I don’t really pm people to force positivity  The point of the wiki and this post is that you shouldn't be PMing people from here, period.  it's not a matter of "offense", it's a matter of someone's mental health and sometimes even their survival.
Really? I could‘ve sworn I’ve seen tons of such comments here. Am I making this up or did I just see some comments just before they were removed or were you removing only some of them because a lot of people don’t know this rule?
I just keep to myself now, everyone has let me down, or more likely I've let everyone else down haha.
I find people switch to PM's when they've posted more than they thought they would. That's probably also one reason why people who haven't talked to anybody delete their posts.  For the people I've had experience with, I've found that this usually doesn't mean they want to talk indeterminately so much so as finish some topic without being abstract about it.  Now when you offer somebody the option of just chatting, that can be pretty indeterminate. You pretty much *can't* do both that and be an active member of this subreddit. You can, thankfully, be clear what you mean by chatting and that as a peer you have limitations yourself. This could be selection bias in who I can actually develop a rapport with.  Which is totally different from ending a thread by making sure somebody has talked about what they want to. Seriously, just advising anybody reading to clearly use the words 'reply' and 'in this thread' if they mean that, instead of a generic 'continue talking' offer. Even when starting to talk to somebody on the community threads, it might be best to specify that you're here to chat about this, rather than a generic 'to chat', now that I think about it.  I don't start PM's. I avoid accidentally encouraging PM's. I do reply to them. As far as I understand, this is within the rules since it's not a first resort.
>Observing truly supportive exchanges is good for everyone's mental health  this is not true, you're acting as if depression is the only mental health variable at play here. When you introduce other forms of mental health factors things gets complicated.  &#x200B;  > Which is why we explicitly discourage advice.   So what's the point of this sub? To circle jerk around depression?   &#x200B;  > FYI chats have been tried here many, many times and all have ended in disaster.    Makes sense.
Yes! I’ve called a crisis line three times in my life, all years apart. The one time when I genuinely felt understood and felt calmer at the end of the call was when the person opened by saying that there was only so much that they could do, agreed that others overpromising and underdelivering was a large contributing factor to why I was doing so poorly, and just listened to and validated my feelings without trying to “fix” them or tell me basically that I should “stop feeling that way.” I called while I was in the process of trying to access actual professional support and not finding it. And that’s what I needed in that moment, just another person to hear me out and tell me that I wasn’t crazy or overreacting by feeling the way I did, in order to help me maintain the level of calm that I needed so I could continue the search for more substantial long-term help.  “Ducklings” I like that. I know the type of person you are talking about. Yes, it’s true that their expectations are unrealistic, but it’s really nice that you’re not dismissive of the fact that they are in real pain and reaching out to the only source of comfort they may have found so far.
That’s good. Because that stuff generally comes off as braggadocio.   I’m aware, hence why I called it a great *reiterative* step! Though “emphasized” might’ve been a better term now that I think about it.
If I have broken the rule on asking people on this sub to PM me, which I probably have, I apologize.
Of course, I'll notify a mod if I see anything
People who like to offer help in PMs. *raise hand guiltily.  Haha i won't do that here.  Thank you for your effort. It put a literal smile in many people faces. :)   <-- that's mine btw. Sorry for cringe.
Staff shortages and holidays and the need for the agency to be staffed 24-7, and the fact that I'm in California makes 16 hour shifts a thing at my call center. No one is going to be asked to do a shift that long, but I am not kidding when I say that I've seen a few counselors do it.   They're reducing the volume. We've had to rerouting a lot of clients as the call volume is far too high right now.
Well I'm not finding it. Maybe I'm too far gone. It's been this way 33 years
Oh sorry, I thought this was the check in post.
your right ofcourse, i will follow the guidlines.  i apologize again.
How do I link the thread or link you to the messages exchanged?  Thanks.
The url link of the message exchange is  https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/mldzgl  Is that what you need?
I'll tag you in the comment/reply of the exchange.
Yeah, I did .... I read a lot of stuff on what not to say to people contemplating suicide but this rule I don't remember seeing. Could be my memory though.
Though will all the rules stating "Things you shouldn't be saying" what's the point of saying anything?  It's just odd 🤨
[deleted]
> i feel like sometimes its good to talk to someone and vent how you feel or what your situation is  Of course it is, but it's just better to get to know someone out in the sub first.  We know a lot of our OPs have privacy concerns, but we think that using a throwaway account (we have disabled all the settings that prevent new or low-karma accounts from posting) is a better option in that case.
On mobile, it's under "community info", "about this community", or a similarly-phrased link, depending on which mobile interface/app you're using.
>honestly helps no one but the person saying it.  After suffering for many years with pretty strong clinical depression and talking tons of folks who offer support, it's been rare that I come across someone who tries to abuse you like the OP says. Instead it's common to find those who only offer to listen and/or say cliche phrases to make themselves feel better for their "altruism". Their listening can give me an insincere vibe because they sometimes don't say something that would indicate they actually heard what you were talking about. Has irked me considerably.
So dont try to help cause we are too ignorant and that will make it worse? Alot of us reach out here because we have no one to turn to. Even medical professionals refuse some of us. I feel like I'd be safer in PM as opposed to on an open thread. Just my opinion.
> ? I could‘ve sworn I’ve seen tons of such comments here  That's exactly why we made this post and the wiki.  We have an automated rule that cleans up a tremendous number of them but some still leak through and people don't know to report them.  It causes us a huge amount of work and that slows down everything else we'd like to be working on.
> this is not true, you're acting as if depression is the only mental health variable at play here.  I'm saying that seeing how support can work is a viable treatment for every mental-health issue, but it is good for our general mental health.   And, don't forget that we are very clear that all we can offer here is peer support.    >> Which is why we explicitly discourage advice.  > So what's the point of this sub?   Support <> advice.
Exactly!  Why do people think parading around holding up a sign that says "look how well I'm doing" is supportive?
The best thing you can do is clean up your history for us.
Yikes, that's awful :-(
As you haven't made a post here, can you tell me a bit more about yourself and your situation?
We can't see your PMs even with a link.  I was asking about the public context that led to it.
So if you mean do reddit PMs count as "private contact" then absolutely yes.
The official reddit app. And thanks.
Please *do* try to help if you have the energy, but also please read our information resources.
Lol so many things mods do go unnoticed. Thank you for everything, especially as it’s such an important sub!
>I'm saying that seeing how support can work is a viable treatment for every mental-health issue  And i'm saying this is not true. OCD, and a lot of different types of neuropsychiatric disorders usually turns "support" from uneducated personnel, into support for destructive behaviors.     If I'm too be honest, we're not going to help even a minority of people reaching out here, and especially not the majority of suicidal people who just lurk and never reach out or post at all.      I do agree with you that advice won't help, but I don't agree that support does.

> And I dont believe in anything, least of all any goodness in humanity. But do you believe any of that?  Personally, I think that humans defy generalisation.  I don't think that people are basically good or bad.  I think we differ greatly under the surface.    There are plenty of psychopaths that basically have a predatory relationship with the rest of their own species, and only the least-successful of them end up in the penal system.    There are also plenty of people who will find a way to be decent and kind and useful, and to make the world a better place, no matter how badly the world has treated them.  But I think most people are somewhere in between, and whether they end up being a net negative or a net positive in the world depends on their experience.  And, right now, in the "developed" world, I don't think most of us have done a particularly good job at building a society that brings out the best in most of its citizens.    >  I'm the most negative person alot of people have ever met.  Are you truly "negative"?  Or do you just need to have your personal ugly truths heard and understood?
Seems to me you got yourself into trouble by alluding to things you weren't prepared to share in the thread.
If you are acting as a helper, you're not allowed to invite private contact **in any form**.  If you're here to get help, it's not recommended but not strictly against the rules.  That is the whole point of the wiki.  Please read it -- it answers all these questions in detail.
Your resource are encouraging people to not get involved.
We know and we're working hard to build additional resources that are specifically to help the helpers (and especially the people who want to help but don't well they have enough knowledge).
Stop wasting time and do your job!!!!1
As I'm definitely an eeyore person as well, what can we do as subs to help the mods?
>Can you give me an example?  Sure, if the person is suffering from say a mix of diagnoses and is getting support from reddit for depression for his/hers self described situation, that can very easily turn badly if the patient in question is actually suffering from different types of mental health disorders and is currently self harming, that support can turn into support for those destructive tendencies.  &#x200B;  Another example would be psychosis for example.
I'm truly negative. Doctors cant deal with me.
"Got myself into trouble"... Frankly, Take what you like & leave the rest: It's more an issue of discretion...  I can write, in EXPLICIT detail about the events of my past AND my present. Further, from my own experience, I'm fully aware that some minors unfortunately go through vile & reprehensible things. For this LATTER cause, knowing there's NO age filter on this platform, I won't give ALL of the salacious details of the abuse which led to my suicidal ideations prior to age 6. So, my private message stated as such & I asked the age of the enquirer. (14 yrs old). I then informed them because of that,  I'd give some of the details, but not all of them. Then I stated I remembered well from my experience how difficult the teen years are & that I couldn't fix anything or advise, however if they wanted a safe place to vent, they had my ear.  As a moderator are you counseling I openly speak of the sexual use & abuse which fostered my want of self destruction regardless of the possible (likely) presence of minors?
::slinks away with tail drooping::
Read the rules, report inappropriate content.  When someone seems well-meaning, kindly direct them to the rule they don't seem to be aware of.  For anything really flagrant, message our modmail.    Do *not* encourage people who are *not* asking for support about depression *the mental illness*  1. "achievement" or "milestone" posts and encouraging people who make them are all outside our mission  2.  Any kind of bad life experience or situation (e.g. social injustice, lousy birthdays, bad breakups, any grief and loss) is *not* a mental illness.  Feeling bad for good reason is perfectly healthy.  So, again, all that's outside our mission and should be discouraged.   Sort by new, look for people in distress who haven't received quality replies and empathise with them.    Nice jaunty bow you have on your tail there :-)
So, wouldn't that be a risk everywhere on the internet, no matter what?  Not sure that's in our power to prevent.  Nor how you're claiming it would be ameliorated by private conversation with untrained peers where there's no community scrutiny.    Didn't answer my question about depression versus suicidality, btw.
How do you mean?
> As a moderator are you counseling I openly speak of the sexual use & abuse which fostered my want of self destruction regardless of the possible (likely) presence of minors?  Absolutely yes.    First, that type of content is common here and we don't ask OPs in need of support to censor themselves.  Second, most of the minors who come here have experienced a fairly comparable level of trauma.
>So, wouldn't that be a risk everywhere on the internet, no matter what?  Yes, which was my point.   &#x200B;  > Nor how you're claiming it would be ameliorated by private conversation with untrained peers where there's no community scrutiny.   Oh I don't. I think they're equal in their possibility to affect badly. But PMs probably open a different sets of difficulty from bad actors as well as depressed people generally having a bad effect on each other.
.... Uhmmm. Wow. I'll have to ruminate on that one for awhile. 🤔😬

If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the "role model" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.  We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under "Community Info" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us.    ********  Please keep in mind that no activism, i.e.  advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues, is ever allowed here.  It's not that we're against activism.  We're strongly in favour of it.  But we've learned the hard way that it doesn't work within a dedicated support space, so with regret, we can't allow it any more.  Thanks for understanding.  Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.
one of the hardest things, for me, has been realizing that when people say “you can talk to me, I’m here for you,” they generally don’t mean it.  a friend I thought I was close to gave me that spiel… and when I opened up to her about how I was feeling, she immediately recoiled and said, “you need to talk to a professional, I’m not your therapist.” she said it as if I had talked to her against her will, when she was the one who repeatedly invited me to open up (and I declined at first because I didn’t want to bother her).  I know she’s not my therapist. I know that no one owes me anything. I wasn’t looking for her (or anyone else) to fix my problems or even offer advice. all I wanted was for someone to listen to me and maybe try to empathize. it would’ve meant the world to me just to express my feelings to someone and hear them say, “that sounds hard, I’m sorry you’re dealing with that,” instead of lecturing me. I thought she was willing to listen, in the same way that I listened to her in the past.  I don’t know what I keep doing wrong. I think the best option is never to open up to anyone.
When life gets worse showers become longer.
I showered, brushed my teeth and changed my clothes yesterday. I even managed to go grocery shopping and bought mostly healthy things. I haven't been productive beyond that but it made me smile.
I keep making comments and deleting them. It all just seems pointless. When I do get an upvote, it's hollow.   And I cringe when I read back on them. I'm just dumping toxic garbage out on here when people have real and tangible problems.   I feel bad for contributing to negativity when it doesn't feel authentic anyway.
Nothing matters. Im 24 and started working. This is the rest of my life until i die. Just work, live for the weekends and repeat. Nothing but stress and anxiety bundled up.
Can’t sleep because of depression, but I’m too tired and distracted to actually do something. It’s 4:30 am and I just keep tossing and turning.   I feel super lonely.
Today's my birthday and I hate it. I've been hating my birthdays for some years now, I don't know why should I celebrate the day I was born, I hate that I was born
today’s my first day off after an 18-day run without any. but i managed to drag myself out of bed and get ready in time to meet with the person i’m seeing this morning, he’s a sweet guy. we went to the history museum and got lunch afterwards (while distancing from others, ofc). we discussed our favorite things, and he listened as i babbled about music for a while. it felt nice, even though i came home and sank into bed right away. by some miracle i also have tomorrow off, and he said he’d love to hang out then too.   i’m glad i got a good day today.
I'm so fucking tired, just like the lot of you.   Had surgery two days ago, so I know that that is causing the inflammation worsening my depression but I also can't think myself out of it. I guess the only thing I can do is rest and accept where I'm at right now.
I just cleaned my bathroom for the first time in over a year, and I'm fucking proud of myself right now.  For 1-2 years now my apartment has gone downhill, no cleaning and boxes and whatever piling up everywhere.  I haven't been able to use the sinks in my bathroom and the kitchen for ages now because it's just a disaster. And I haven't had family or anyone else over here the past two years because I don't want them to find out how I live.  Last week I had a panic attack that was triggered by someone suddenly knocking on my door, I think it was some routine thing by my landlord.  I pretended I wasn't home all day by staying inside, being quiet and having lights off. I decided that night enough is enough.  The devil on my shoulder tells me that the only reason I was able to clean the bathroom today was because I recently continued getting access to my ADHD meds. And just because the meds are what gave me the energy and focus to do this means I didn't accomplish shit.  I don't care, I can't stop smiling.  The kitchen is next.
I just want someone to notice my existence and that I'm not okay.
I turn 54 today.  No cake, no party.  I stopped celebrating birthdays years ago.  Rather than pretending that others forgot, I’d rather ignore it.  COVID means that I don’t even get the strained, obligatory “happy birthday” from co-workers if they even remembered.  They don’t.  Tomorrow will be the same as today and will be the same as yesterday.  One day, I revel in knowing that I will fall asleep and not awaken.  No one will notice.  Nobodies life will be diminished.  My adult sons will gather and lament “not being more involved” and will feel bad for a couple days.  Then they will forget.  I was told when I was 20 that things will get better.  That there will be parties, and friends...and while nobody lied, they grossly exaggerated.  So people, especially the young, time flies quick.  There are no guarantees.  And before you know it, you’re 54, sitting on your porch, just waiting for the end.
I have this crush on someone, and I just *know* they would never go for someone like me. I'm just too odd and different (just look at my profile).  Makes me think that I'm seriously never gonna find a partner, or even good friends. I can't ever, ever not be alone. And it fucking sucks. I want to be loved and appreciated for my existence.  Edit: I should add, I'm an old school practicing Muslim that's also gay. So it's all just generally confusing really. I want to just jump into the liberal pond and maybe find a lover, but every time I try I feel so out of my element. Don't think people like me are supposed to exist.
Ache so badly for things I can't have.
I honestly don’t know how much longer I can hold onto this world. Both my physical and mental health deteriorated so much these days, but everyday life is still so draining.
I started cleaning up my room yesterday. I don't want to show photos in case someone IRL recognizes it but I threw out at least like 20 pizza boxes to give an idea of how messy it was.    Then I woke up late, wasted some time and headed out to cafe to apply for work and go through emails. And to sort out some finances. It's something. I hope I manage to clean up more.  Job applications are stressful. I keep having negative thoughts on how I'm not good enough. The job description asks for a few years in something I'm not familiar with for something I WANT to work as. I apply anyways. I know I'm not good enough. So then should I try to get better? How? What do I build? It's not like anything I make will make me money. And it's several hours of work for something that should help me. But it's just so slow and not an immediate reward. It can take hundreds of hours to get good enough. For roles I don't want to work in at industries I don't like I keep wondering if as a beggar I can be a chooser or if I should apply anyways.
I'm having a real crisis, feeling like I'm not wanted at all.. Like I'm being replaced slowly or outright ignored by my family.. If I try to speak up, I end up feeling like the bad guy, or interrupted three times.. i don't know what to do anymore.
Mental illness like hypothermia. If you stop moving just once you'll freeze to death.
You know that feeling when you're travelling somewhere and are just waiting for the destination? The seat is not comfortable and distractions aren't enjoyable anymore, so just sit there and wait.   That's my life right now. Except I'm not going anywhere.
How many more years? How long more do I have to endure? I’m so tired. So exhausted.

Nothing made me happy today either
For the past 3 months I’ve worked out at least 4 times a week. Really proud of myself for staying consistent with this despite struggling a lot recently. Gives me something to look forward to now
I'm tired of being tired the whole day...
Sadly, I survived 2020.
I want to feel normal
Does anyone else want to have hobbies but the act of setting up is too exhausting itself?  ETA: will decluttering help with this?
reasons I haven't killed myself yet  * my mom and a couple other relatives would probably be really devastated, I don't want anyone else feeling as low as I do * when I get the chance, I want to visit Japan on my own. That's maybe a year or two away          I'm just not fit for this world. I don't like the way it functions. There's nothing I want to do, so why keep living. I've lived alone for a couple of years now. Alone as in it's just me in the apartment but also I really haven't had a single person to talk to outside that apartment either. Don't talk with my parents. They're just workaholics and everyone in the family is doing their own things. I have a job and a steady income but nothing to do with the money. Nothing but maybe that Japan trip. I've cried my eyes out in front of a few professionals about myself, but they just chalk it off as mild depression or something. No, I really just don't want to live. Can you cure that disease? Or should I just off myself?
thinking about how, deep down, I've always held onto this sliver of hope that one day, the abuse I experienced would be recognized and the people who hurt me would be revealed for what they are.  it will never happen. the world doesn't work like that. I wish it did.  I know the key is acceptance. and I think I have accepted that it is what it is and can't change. but it still hurts.  I accept the world for what it is. I just don't want to live in a world like this one.
Left my abusive partner over the weekend:  I built the courage to stand up for myself and leave and not tolerate the treatment I was receiving and I left that night after telling her to her face that I’m leaving and finding someone new.  She smacked me in the face previously on the day that I walked away for good. I spoke my mind and said what I had to say and then left never looking back.
I just need a hug right now is all.
I have a psychiatrist appointment that I’m looking forward to next week. I’m having very bad thoughts, especially when going to bed and could use a med adjustment. On a good note I bought myself a teddy bear in the hopes it will bring some comfort.
I just finished the third issue of the comic I've been working on. It's fan fiction, but still. It's beautiful. I've poured hundreds of hours of work into it and seeing the results makes it worth it, but I can't help but wonder if I only do all this to escape what I'm going through right now. The more painful it gets, the more I immerse myself in the work. It's the only thing keeping me going these days. I have to rest now, so I can't hide from the pain right now.
112 days since I last posted here. (I searched my comments) Hmm. For the last two months I've been in a very happy place/content.   I think I may have conquered depression? I hope so.
My psychiatrist died unexpectedly.He was such a good doctor he really cared about me and my mental health. I’ve been seeing him for over 2 years, I feel like he really “got me”.
Any of you feel like you just want to sleep forever? When you sleep all the good things come true in your dreams. When you are awake, it’s just endless suffering with no benefits.
why am I self sabotaging...why am I up playing a game at 5 AM instead of getting a healthy sleep schedule  maybe because life only feels like "have to" and none of all the stress is for anything I really want?  sigh
I don't understand why nobody wants to text me, call me or simply inform me when they hangout with each other. I used to be very funny, I made a lot of people laugh when I was in college, I even used to help them with their issues and shit.   I guess being unemployed and poor is not very attractive to anybody. I'm way too lonely, seeing people I used to know hanging out with each other on instagram is messed up.  I'm no more funny, I'm grumpy, this is my default mood.
Back in this sub again after a very long time.
Fuck me I guess for trying to express my feelings to anyone. There's never any point trying to "reach out" to people. There's never even any sympathy or compassion, they just get angry.  Some would probably miss me if I was gone, but they still won't do anything to help me while I'm here.
Amazing how quick a day can go from ok to shit. At this point, I just can’t wait until it’s time to go to bed.
I haven't had a conversation in years. I wish I had someone to talk to. I enjoy talking to myself but it gets lonesome after a while.
I wasted another day.
I'm honestly glad I could help someone out last week. I was heading to Wally World after the gym and had a small lunch that I grabbed from work that morning on the front seat. As I pulled into the parking lot I noticed a homeless gentleman and his dog across the street. Now I have seen him there for the longest time and was always very curious about him and I don't know what complelled me this day, because this is *so* out of character for me but I grabbed the food, walked across the street and said that I didn't know if he had eaten at all that day but I figured he could use it a lot more than me.  Cue me sitting next to him and chatting away with him for a good 20 minutes. And honestly, it was probably the only time in days I was genuinely happy; I had been feeling really lonely and sad about everything and nothing simultaneously so it was quite an unexpected boost. I learned quite a bit about him and honest felt bad for him and the situation he was in. Soon a man pulled up and handed him a bag of food for his pup and I think a $10. He patted his pocket and mentioned how it was going to help him maybe get a hotel room and a place to shower that night.  I was getting up to leave and remembering that comment and the fact I still had some birthday money in my pocket, I handed him one of my $50's and said "I know this isn't much but I hope this gets you closer to your hotel room tonight." The smile on his face and his gratitude made it all worth it. I know I myself am struggling and don't have much but I felt it was my duty to help him. I told him in these absolutely crazy times we do need to look out for each other and help out when we can.  Of course the next day I ended up feeling like crud again but I'm at least glad I could make someone else's day brighter despite mine being perpetually overcast and swarming with flying murder hornets.
the catch-22 of getting a good job with health insurance, then finding out that the thing that was supposed to enable you to get help effectively disqualifies you, because medical professionals think people who are "really" depressed or suicidal can't hold a job like that, so they don't take you seriously

I saw an old friend yesterday, and it was great to see her. But it was also kind of surreal because she seems like she's doing really well now, which is obviously great, but it made me realize that I'm not doing so great by comparison.  I've been working on recording music lately, but I'm not getting too much feedback from posting it online. I miss playing shows and I'm sad that I can't do that until whenever the quarantine ends.  My parents' political views have been brought out by the protests recently. And I've come to see we aren't really on the same page. I've been talking to them, but it's very hard to get through to them. That makes me sad too.  On the positive side, I haven't hit my head/self-harmed in over three months now.
Please stop giving me shit for still living with you at 23.....apartments  aren't even cheap, its going to take a while for me to even get sufficient funds for rent, bills + food  Just please stop  Its not like i don't do anything. I wake up every day at 8am to help and clean. Just fucking stop acting like I'm a damn leech  I can't even do much when I have so little money to move out.

im so tired of everything
i’m so tired
So I’m going thru a breakup, my mom died, I lost my business, discovered I’m to dumb for construction and call center jobs, and smashed my finger under a rock...I think I was way depressed before any of that shit happened, then Covid hit, giving me another dozen issues...Thursday I just snapped, I couldn’t stop crying, wrote a suicide note and planned it out. I was am taking Wellbutrin and was going to start couples counseling Monday.  I had to chat with the suicide prevention hot line...I felt better by the afternoon and functioned, then Friday hit and I bought some razors and started cutting myself..I’m going to cut again after I finish writing this...the Saturday hit and I was bad...I couldn’t wait till Monday...I emailed a therapist I knew and told everything..she told me to call the local help line..I did.  Then somehow the sheriffs department went to my house so now my so knows how fucked up I am and we decided to use Monday’s session just for me....she doesn’t know I wrote a note and had a plan am cutting myself.  So I’m sitting here all alone waiting for Monday...tomorrow I’ll be sitting here all day waiting for Monday I don’t know what will happen. Now I feel stupid, embarrassed, weak minded and like I’m not really that sick. I don’t know what to say Monday. He doesn’t know I’m coming in for depression.  I forgot to buy sleeping pills.
Sometimes I just wanna play video games, eat and sleep for the rest it my life .
Im so tired... Im really really tired.
I wish I could take a remote and rewind my life and start again.
In the Marine Corps there is a huge stigma against depression. They say you should get help but that will just skyline you. They really don’t care about you personally and will not hesitate to burn you and ruin your life. It’s an easy trap they want you to walk into.   I’ve been in 4 years now out of a 5 year contract. I always feel so empty inside. I’m always hurting. Physically and mentally. But I grit my teeth and push.   I joined to get away from my toxic past. I always fear it will one day catch up with me. I have not talked to my family in almost 6 years now. When I get out soon I know they will ship me back to that hellhole unless I take action quickly.   I’m still young but my shoulders, back, and knees are all pretty much destroyed. I’m going blind without expensive meds and I am almost completely deaf in my right ear.   It is extremely hard to relate to normal everyday people now. I feel like I should have accomplished so much more at this point in my life. I wake up everyday and try to ignore the hell that is raging in my head.
I’m so done with life
I wish COVID had killed me
I feel so empty and miserable but I don’t want to accept that I’m depressed even though I probably am.
no one really knows how bad I am doing, for some reason around other people I am completely normal and they can’t tell how much I really need help, but I’m too afraid to tell anyone because I am not sure if I know how because I have always been like this
thinking about when I was a kid, happy and innocent, didn't give a shit at what people thought about me, had friends, etc  but I wanted to grow up so badly, now I just wish to be my younger self again, maybe i wouldn't be stressing so much
I totally forgot I was a college student. Can't even remember the last time I attended my virtual classes. Well, guess I'm getting a WI... again. I have zero motivation for school anymore, my mind is completely on other things. Don't even want to think about trying to "catch up". Maybe next semester will be better...
[deleted]
So does anyone else on here just feel numb inside?   I mean there is stuff in life around me that I should be happy about, and I got nothing!!  I can tell people I love them, because I know I should, but I don’t really feel anything.
it’s so bad I can only laugh
man. im kinda really fucked in school rn. im missing assignments, not paying attention, all that shit. i also have a test in like 12 hours which i have no clue what the fuck its on. i dunno if i want to blame it on depression just yet. but fuck dude im so fucked.  im also crazy fucking lonely. so lonely man. i sometimes just lay awake because it. idk im just rambling at this point
Idk man.  Sometimes I feel like it’s getting better, then I fall right back into the same old place.  It feels like the last time I mattered was years ago.  And god am I lonely as hell.  It keeps me up at night more often than not.  Idk why I post here every few months...  I guess it’s just because I don’t have anyone to trust irl and I can’t deny how nice it feels to lay things out like this.  Ah well
I hate myself, i feel like im in hell. I keep repeating the same mistakes over and over. I ruined my life along with my family’s. I don’t deserve to be alive. Am I even alive? This is the worst day of my whole entire life. I can’t talk to anyone. I feel hopeless because it’s hopeless. Im constantly afraid of myself. I feel like im intentionally dragging myself down
What’s even the point of all this shit? All I do is study and work. I hate college and I hate working. Why should I keep this up for another 40 years?
Sometimes I fear I won’t make it through this fight regardless how much I fight. I need peace. I when I close my eyes the only peace I can see is through death.
I just want to feel normal for one fucking moment
how do you guys keep up. this world is so fast and so bad at the same time, everytime I open the news it's just bad news after bad news. we're supposed to be the smartest species but I really don't feel that. how do you guys/gals go on without acknowledging that deep pit in front of you? I can't find the strength to go on right now
honestly would pay to see an outsider's  pov of me. What is it about my personality that makes people not value me as a friend? Becuz I'm always cracking jokes so people don't see me as "worthy"? Becuz I don't backstab and gossip about others to gain popularity points? WHY????? :(
Just tired, tank is on less than empty and the thought of doing anything just makes me feel even more tired.
My life is a waste. Trapped alone in a room. Trapped inside of my own head. I just feel so sad about it all.
very alone. this is my breaking point.
It was really difficult admitting that people were right in their observations about me. I'm trying to be a better person now but my anxiety is killing me.
I just don't know if I can be here anymore. 31 and a failure at life. I keep making the same mistakes. In this state of arrested development. I wake up every day and by the time I gather myself to do anything, it's night and the whole thing starts all over again.   I gave up any hope of having a career or artistic dreams or relationships. I gave up everything and replaced it with nothing.
I want to fucking die.
I can not be happy, no matter how much I try to be. Everytime something good happens, my brain starts thinking horrible things that I don’t even know if they are real or just something that exists only in my head. I’m pretty sure everyone around me can’t stand being with me anymore, not my boyfriend nor my friends. I want to be good enough for them, but I’m just a burden and I can’t help it most of the times. I am so tired, I just want a hug.
These two weeks have been bad. I'm stuck in a rut and my job search is going nowhere. No replies at all.  Currently lying on my bed feeling down. I've been on social media, mostly YouTube a lot. The days get repetitive and I'm trying to not lose my mind.  Edit: I put together a wishlist of work outfits that I would buy when I get a new job. That somehow cheered me up a bit. I'm not encouraging overconsumption tho, just that most of my wardrobe are old clothes and in need of an update
i have nothing to offer to people around me anyway, im ugly, socially inept, unintelligent, unmotivated, gross. whats the fucking point of me. i wish to die
19 days before anyone tried messaging me to see if I was alright. One person shared with mutuals how depressed and despondent I've been in some weird effort to find a way to contact me, which I guess explains all the people who deleted me yesterday. The other messaged and is back to ignoring me after I replied - stopped gaming with him due to net issues, I've since been written off by the looks of it.  Being there for the above and letting them vent at me about the stupidest things over the years never earned me the right to do same to them. I keep finding the shittiest people to try and be friends with. Or in these cases I should say they keep finding me.  Being lonely sucks, but I was happier coming on here for half a month and not having to talk to anyone. Anonymous Reddit is a better friend. Kind of pathetic.  But anyhoo, methinks it's time for a friend purge. Maybe one of these days the powers that be will let us disable friend invites on social and gaming platforms.
My hearing to determine if I'll get disability is tomorrow. I'm hella nervous.
Not meeting deadlines ahhhhhhhh Not being productive ahhhhhhhh Keeping avoiding tasks that I don't want to work on ahhhhhhhhhhh
The phrase "it'll never be okay" with an image of me blowing my brains out is commonly on loop inside my mind
my eyes hurt from crying.
I guess I had been fooled, once again, about trying to have any hope and optimism that things would change, however slightly. Just ended up being another weekend spent alone. I am trying to find a date online, and in short, one turned out to be an inappropriate jerk when we hardly even spoke other than texting and two others don't seem engaged or respond well when indicating that I want to talk if not meet up and get to know them better. I know, 'love' will not solve problems or escape my own hell called mental illness. But when you're used to the same thing for so long and have almost nobody, you'll do anything to try feeling like you are worth something to someone. Apparently with my brief back to attempt at online dating, shown the contrary.
It's my birthday today. I have a huge headache and I found a dead mousey who drowned in a water bowl I put out.. I'm depressed daily because my ex-wife left, and I can't stop thinking about how much I failed to be a good person back to her in our relationship. She was the kindest and smartest person I've ever met and I was so lucky to have her. I just hope more than anything that she's happy now but it kills me that I can't be in her life anymore without hurting her.  I'm struggling to not text her because I just know she'll be hurt no matter what I say. I made a promise to myself to not put her through that pain any more and I feel like that's the last and least thing I can do for her. She deserves to not be scared of me texting her or being worried that I'm watching her. I love and failed her so much that my heart literally aches.  I wish I had someone in my life to distract me from this pain but the world is just so gray it's hard for me to imagine it. It's been almost a year and I'm really scared this won't end even if I deserve it. I'm tired of thinking about myself and I'm tired of pretending to be happy around people but I know that everyone who's left in my life will leave me if I don't. Going to try cleaning today to feel better and then just sleep my birthday away. Thanks for reading.
I'm a 28 year old man crying in my room because I'm bad at video games. I have no other hobbies. I'm fat, I can't do much in the way of physical things anymore. I have no emotional highs anymore because my doctor has been upping my dosage of medication. My lows are far less frequent but they feel so much worse now. I have no passion for my job anymore. I used to love what I do. Now I dread Mondays and feel sick to my stomach on Sunday nights. My apartment has been a mess for months but I don't have the energy to clean it. My family is all dealing with their own bullshit and keep coming to me for help and I just can't do that anymore. I have nobody I feel I can talk to because all my friends and loved ones either have their own shit going on or don't understand and just say the same shit about them not understanding. It's been a long time since I had thoughts of suicide. I still haven't been thinking about it but I'm getting to the point where I just don't want to BE anymore. I seriously need to change everything in my life all at once or I'm scared I won't make it.
Sister texted me getting onto me because I posted suicidal adjacent stuff on twitter. The posts in question:  "What is the point of therapy if material conditions won't improve in order to maintain my mental health. I makes more sense to just kill myself already if I could but I'm too fucking weak to do that. And apparently it's just "all in my head" and dying is "irrational" fuck you"  and  "I don't fucking want coping mechanisms I want a life worth living"  I am so sick and tired of her being above it all. Not everyone gets a loving partner and a life thats your own like you do Meredith. Not everyone is just as "tough and naturally gifted" as you are. I get it. I'm the weakest link. You don't know how that feels and you never will understand how that feels. You will never feel as worthless as I have. You will never feel this indescribable alienation that I feel from everything and everyone. Maybe at one point in your life you understood that feeling but now you lost it. You aren't on my team anymore and nothing else shows it better than the shit you said to me on that day several years ago. I can't even remember how long ago it was because my brain is so profoundly fucked up. Could've been yesterday for all I fucking know. Nothing matters anymore. You don't love me you only love the idea of me. You'd best just move along or kill me yourself.
I’m just getting so tired...
Cant cry, cant sleep. I only need to finish my thesis to graduate but im so tired of it. I really am. Still depressed over my ex god knows why, its been months. Ig im just tired of life
Depression is hitting me really hard. I have no one to talk to. No one at school, at home, or at work. I have no one. I used to be so much happier before even when I barely had anyone. Now, I can't even stand being myself...
Many, many times during a day, I refer to myself in third person and say: "He hung himself".

I’ve never really used Reddit, but I’ve gotten to the point I wake up everyday with extreme existential dread and see no point in moving forward, so I’m desperate. I just need someplace to let this out where other people can understand. I had my depression under really good control the last 4 years thanks to medication and therapy! Last year I really felt like my life was on track, but when coronavirus hit and threw everything sideways, it’s been nothing but downhill, and I feel like I’m back at square 1. I haven’t felt this godawful since 2016, before I started my current medication. Not only lots of personal issues, but with the state of the world as well, I’m constantly stressed out and feel awful about it. I feel like I’m only ever sad or struggling whenever I talk to my mom (or even my friends) recently, who’s been my support system for years and seen me at my absolute worst. All the work she’s put into helping me and yet here I am again, wallowing in pity because my will to live has vanished once more. I’ve started telling myself I’m 23 and I can keep going, cause I never expected to make it past 20. But as soon as I say that I break down, almost like I wish I wasn’t here. I’m conflicted every single day. And it feels like, for the brief time I was happy, mainly the last half of last year, that was it. Brief. So is that how my life is gonna feel if I keep going? What’s the point if I’m miserable all the time? I have a loving family and friends who really care about my well being and I’ve relied on, but all I feel like anymore is a burden. I’m stuck between “shit happens” and “the slightest inconvenience makes me want to break down and disappear so I can finally escape the hell that is my brain”. I’m still going. I know it would rip my mom apart if anything happened to me, our family has experience more extreme loss in the last 3 years than anyone should go through. Yet she still remains strong and I can barely go to online classes.   Not to mention I live in America, so I worry about being able to even pay for my meds.   At this point, I wish Covid had taken me out. I even have asthma and a history of pneumonia so I’m an easy target. I’d trade places with someone who got it and actually had a life to live for in a heartbeat, knowing I helped someone would be nice.  Thanks for letting me vent here. If anyone is reading this, I wish you the best.
i dont want to go on with my life anymore. but i imagine the looks on my parents’ faces if they see me. im slowly isolating myself from my friends and family. the thought of not existing anymore is all i think about. that’s why i decided to do something about it and contacted a local psychiatric clinic. i hope it goes well.
I have no motivation anymore. I’m trying, but I don’t have motivation to leave the house. I don’t have motivation to complete schoolwork (I’m in college). I was s*xually *ssaulted twice in the past year and a half, and that was after an ab*sive relationship. I found out about a month ago that my male best friend was a serial r*pist and he admitted it to me. I’m not contemplating ending my life, but I genuinely find no joy in doing things anymore. I’ll be content sometimes, but only briefly. Then the numbness sets in. Every day is the same, and I’m angry at myself for enabling it. I know that things will get better. I hope that they will. But for now, I’m just trying to feel alive.
I skip school and just go for walks alone listening to music. It’s the only time I feel at peace.
Fuck work, fuck depression, fuck anxiety, fuck procrastination.
Repressi depressi. Days are just starting to blend in eachother. Just wasting my lige rn even tho im almost dome with my bachelors. Cant even get stupid drunk to forget everything
I haven’t slept more than 6 consecutive hours a night -typically about 4-5- in over two weeks. My 9 month old is going through a sleep regression and I’m starting to get major anxiety before trying to put her down for the night, as well as extremely bad intrusive thoughts in the middle of the night when she wakes back up screaming and I try for hours to get her to go back down... I can’t keep going on like this. I can’t do this. I’m a horrible mom and honestly I just want all the pain in the world because I feel like that’s what I deserve.
I don’t use reddit much but perhaps that will change in the future.  So here goes...  I’m 27, I live in Michigan and I’m gay.  I’ve spent most of my adulthood single and in the last few years it’s gotten quite lonely.  My dad passed away a few months ago and my sister and I are now in charge of everything (mom is physically and cognitively unable to be on her own).   I lost my job in May due to mostly office politics and I have been waiting on unemployment ever since. I’m past due on rent, multiple bills and I have no idea when the backpay will be paid out.  I currently work for a local restaurant delivering food but I’m quickly learning the job is incredibly dangerous as I have already had food stolen from me during a delivery and a co-worker was chased by some crazy guy.   I have been feeling very trapped, hopeless and lonely these past few days and my suicidal ideation has gotten pretty bad. I just want to feel secure financially and emotionally. I feel like I’m a good person and do the best I can to be a productive member of society but that still isn’t enough.   I feel useless, ashamed and alone in life and feel incredibly unloved and unworthy and I’m tired of feeling this way.  TLDR: Shit has blown up for me with covid, losing my job, death of my dad, finances, etc. and feeling trapped in working a job that’s unsafe. It has caused my anxiety and suicidal ideation to worsen.  If you read all this, thank you. It was good to get this all out.
I always feel like I’m not good enough for anything. I’m not good enough of a person, I’m not good enough at my job, I’m not good enough at what I studied, I’m not good enough of a friend, etc etc.    I really don’t think I deserve my grades or my job. I don’t think I deserve the friends I have. I don’t think I deserve my parents. I feel like I don’t deserve a place in society because I fail to see how it is better with me in it than without me.
overwhelmed. cried in the bathroom at work. there's no help and no relief. I'm tired of being a joke to everyone. I can't keep doing this.
I had my first job today and I screwed up pretty badly, I’m behind on school work, and I feel like an imposter in my own life and it feels like I’m clinging to an edge of a cliff with my fingernails as my only anchor.
I had a good day the other day. So why didn't it do anything to help me? I did all the things I wanted to, and I just couldn't enjoy it. I thought more about how nice it would be to get into a traffic accident on the way home. If even a perfect day can't change my mind, why bother?
I hate myself, I can't keep up with my coursework. I feel so stupid and lazy I don't know why i keep trying to get this degree. I just wish I didn't have to keep living like this.
I feel weird. I think I might have experienced mania the last few days. I haven't been sleeping much, and I didn't feel tired at all. I was not eating, and I didn't feel hungry. I felt so focused on I suppose these grandiose ideas of me becoming successful, like super successful. I'm thinking that if I start go back to university taking school seriously maybe I could really do something great.   Four years ago, I wanted to aim to get a doctorate in History or some other field I was interested. Since then, I've tried to kill myself many times, been hospitalized, and lost almost everyone in my life.   Ever since the US elections results, I actually feel ambitious. It feels crazy, but I don't know. I think after everything I have been through, maybe I have a lot to offer to the world. I've been thinking about volunteering. I'm not sure where or for what cause, but I think that would be a good start.   I actually kinda feel like I can do this.
There are 1.7K posts already so reality-based thinking says no one will ever see this.  So fucking down right now. Used to struggle with SI but that went away but today it keeps popping up. All I’ve done today is get dressed and walked the dog around the building twice. I have nobody. I want encouragement. A simple “you can do it” is all I need. But instead, my kids are too busy to bother with me. Don’t want to deal with my baggage. I have all day everyday and  still can’t do anything. Oh fuck, I can’t take this. I’ll just sleep.
Hiding in the bathroom from my parents cause it's the only room with a lock. Constant yelling. I'm falling apart from stress even without them.  Living in constant fear from my parents. Permanent attacks, no matter what I do. Cooking and baking for hours for them and afterwards getting yelled at.   Parents making suicidal thoughts worse and everyone is just like "aww, they just want to help, y'know?".  Whenever I drag myself to therapy I don't even expect anything anymore and therapy is just like "lol you're right. It was really stupid to expect anything from me, ever".  Therapist doesn't even answer any emails anymore.
I want to die I want to die I want to die  Things are not getting better no matter what I try
I am so lonely
I've finally reached that state where I don't give a damn about everything, which is an improvement.  I don't care about interview rejections anymore because I don't tie my self worth to my employment. I am fine with being average as long as I'm "normal". I don't want to bite off more than I could chew.   I recognize that I have a history of MDD so I need to manage my health more carefully. I am not an ambitious person to begin with so I really should not be trying to impress others all the time.
Never done this before...   I have a beautiful home and the best kids anyone could ever hope for.  I've been married for 20 years (albeit every last one of them was a struggle).  I have a relaxed job that I should love.  I have SO much to be appreciative of.    I know all of this but I'm sitting on my couch alone.  Sobbing my face off because even though I'm surrounded by blessings - I am utterly defeated and alone somehow.    I don't want......ANYTHING.  What the hell is wrong with me?
If I always come back to the pits of despair and suicidal thoughts, what’s the point of trying to be okay?
i fucking hate this pain that’s never ending. there is no solution, j don’t wanna wake up anymore
I never get to sleep and I'm stressed out of my mind. Even when I should be sleeping I lie awake and just can't relax. There's this constant gnawing sense of dread and worry in the back of my head.  I really wanted the new antidepressants to work but they're clearly not. I'm still a fucking wreck.

I thought I was okay with just being alone for the rest of my life. I thought I was starting to learn to accept it. That nobody will ever care about or love me and I should stop seeking it out, that I would just love myself and find peace and happiness in solitude. For a while I thought I could. But I feel so lonely I want to die. I'm stressed and sad and have no one to tell. Maybe it'll pass. Maybe I just have to keep thinking of everyone who abandoned me and let me down to remind myself it's not worth it in the end. I feel like I'm from another planet, I can't function in this world.
I’ve lost almost everyone important in my life.  Love is conditional, I have found.  People I thought who would be around forever have completely jumped ship.  The loneliness is engulfing.  I am disposable.
I need help. I can’t stop crying. I’m having panic attacks. I can’t sleep I can hardly eat. I’m having dark thoughts for the first time in my life. I don’t know what to do except that the walls feel like they are closing in and there’s no escape from this grief. I’m in a failing relationship. We had a miscarriage six months ago and I desperately want a child but he left and I haven’t been able to leave my bed since then
I want to give up. I have failed and nothing will change it.  Why keep going to be reminded of my failure. It isn't like I get any satisification by continuing to go. Rather all I will get is more stress.
All that anxiety from school. From college. Never, ever left. Do I have an appointment tomorrow. Is there something in my emails I didn't read in time. Do I have all my papers.   Worrying about this stuff isn't even my main diagnosis. Either way, therapy didn't change anything about it. A lot of it got worse. It's so much stress with every email, no matter how often you face it and what you try to think it doesn't get less.
I'm tired of having to lie to everyone, telling them I'm fine when they check in on me.
After a long dry streak, I had sex with a friend who is in an open relationship. While it was a good time, it *really* hammered home how much I miss an emotional connection with someone I can be intimate with. Can't really stay and cuddle with someone who has an SO to go home to.  My best friends are a couple and had their first foursome with another couple and while they were telling me about it, I hated how lonely I felt. Along with a mind-numbing job and having no motivation to do much else, things haven't been so hot.  I'm doing my best to keep my chin up but getting out of bed is difficult lately.  Hope you all find what you're looking for.
I just don't feel good.
My mind is splitting apart from my body. I lose more and more each day I'm further and further away from myself...  **Trigger Warning Suicide:** I don't think I can be here anymore. My jaw hurts and it feels like my mind is melting. There is a strange pain in my hands and my actions are scattered and clumsy. It's hard to stand up straight like there are chains in my body and chest. What is happening? How can I live? Maybe I'm permanently broken and need to end things...
Oh, the opportunities I wasted.
Nothing seems worth doing in life. I just want to lay in bed and fade away. Travelling, food, love, all of those things are alright but they’re not enough. Life isn’t enough, it isn’t worth the pain
I wish someone would kill me so I didn't have to do it myself
at least i showered today... still didn’t have the energy to brush my hair though... laid on the couch and was able to get up and put a frozen pizza in the oven around 4pm
I’m not doing well. Being alone for the holidays and having an unsupportive partner doesn’t help. Thank you for your time to any kind souls who read this.
Christmas night. It did not feel like Christmas at all. No tree, no presents, no company. When I went to buy some food on Christmas Eve I saw people with trollies full of food and snacks for Christmas lunch, and I felt my heart sink. I just carried on today like I normally did. Only difference was that I wasn’t as healthy. I haven’t had a proper meal since breakfast. Not even gluten free refined sugar free pancakes aren’t that nutritious. Maybe that’s why I feel so ‘meh’ today. I really don’t know why my family members didn’t ask me if I wanted to celebrate Christmas with them. Though we have restrictions they could still obey them and invite me to Christmas lunch or come over for a visit, to check I’m still alive. I feel abandoned by them. It’s my birthday after Boxing Day and if their silence still continues I don’t know how I’m going to deal with it.
Happy Holidays guys. Just going to be reading mostly.
Sorry if this triggers anyone but I can’t exactly tell people this. I tried to kill myself yesterday. It didn’t work out though, got too scared to go with it fully.  For all of my life I have never found people I’ve connected. I’ve been basically alone all my life. This quarantine has been hard as I’ve been reflective and realized that what I hoped for when I was young was never going to happen. I’ll never be loved. And that hurts a lot. I don’t really have an outside passion to convince myself to stay, but I’m not completely comfortable with dying yet. So I’ll just have to live through the pain
I'm looking for reasons to live and the list is honestly growing shorter ever single day. How the fuck do people do this? My friends and family are all that is keeping me alive right now.
I'm not sure if anyone else is going through this but I feel like this is something we don't talk about often. I'm a senior applying to colleges and my entire life has revolved around getting into a good college, and after multiple rejections and my mid-year grades being worse than any grades I've ever gotten, I genuinely feel so beaten up. I'm so guilty for making my parents pay for the 30+ colleges I've applied to, making them pay for college help when I can't seem to get in anywhere. I feel so bad for letting them down because at this rate I'm praying to get into a safety. I feel like everything I've cared about and done throughout high-school is useless and I have no motivation to try helping myself or re-gaining confidence. My parents have honestly given me everything and I can't even pass a class or get into college when that's all they've wanted from me. I can't even be happy. I've isolated myself from all my friend groups because I feel like I don't deserve to be happy,   I don't deserve to have fun. I hate myself. I hate myself so much. I don't know how to live with the guilt of being this useless.
I'm always needing a break from everything. I'm tired. And I'm tired of being tired.
I find myself envying people that have taken their lives recently. I envy the courage they had to be able to step into the next life without any idea what it holds. I often times want to move on myself, but I'm afraid of surviving. Im afraid of what people will think of me if I attempt and fail a suicide. Will they think I just did it for attention? Or will they finally realize I need help and reach out? Other times I'm scared to do it because what if it is true that life gets better and I miss out in all of it? I still have hope, it's just been diminishing over time and the struggles I'm gracing now sometimes don't feel worth it. What if nowhere every changes and I feel like this until I'm old and I die with this sadness? Lately my urge to end it has been increasing and the only thing that really stops me is the judgement I might get if I'm not successful at killing myself.
increasingly clear that my life is just a pendulum between anxiety and depression. when I have any kind of pressure on me at all (ie my work) I am barely able to cope and spend entire days totally frozen, unable to do anything. when I take time off or actually have a weekend to myself, my inability to feel joy or create a purpose for myself leaves me depressed. one constant: regardless of which of the two is taking center stage, I want to die so very badly.  a new experience: for the first time in quite a while, I've had to be responsible for someone else in a direct, immediate way--my semi-elderly mom, who I live with, is sick in a bad way. does this inspire me to get past my own problems and help her? does this make it easier to avoid the spiral of doom in my head? nope, instead my anxiety has ratcheted up and is 10 times worse. I'm totally unable to do my job because of the stress. I took a day off because of that, but naturally I had piled up work I still had to get done. And I was actually finally making a bit of progress, because my mom seemed to be doing better. and then four hours in my mom mentioned that it seems to be getting worse and boom, instant panic attack, productivity tone, etc etc. Doesn't help that she's high risk for covid so appointments are going to be extremely worrisome.   Anyways, real fun to discover I can't manage to take on even the most basic, minor life stresses. Why am I such a useless human being? Why can't I just want to fade out of existence, allowing all my problems to melt me into a little pool of nothing? I don't kill myself for personal philosophical reasons, or that's what I tell myself, but in reality I think if I was just a tad bit more disconnected from my family or if my mother were to pass away, I might go ahead and do it.  Or, more realistically, I'd just quit my job to avoid all the anxiety, and then live off savings while being a slacker until I couldn't do it anymore. Honestly, even now, I want to quit the stupid job even though I know it'd be terrible for me to do so. If only I could just be a shitty employee who didn't care, instead of being a shitty employee who desperately wants to do good and so is constantly panicking about work. Don't tell me I should look for another job. For one, that process is very difficult for me to pursue (and only ratchets up my anxiety). But for two, this job is actually great... It just that I'm a fuckup and anxious all the time so I can't do it right.   I know I need to seek out help. I've known it for literally years. I even successfully did it, 4 years ago, but before long it seemed the help stopped helping and now I'm so much worse that even the basic steps required to get help are so far beyond my capability. And on top of it, I know that even the slightest setbacks will throw me back all the way to 0. I don't have the motivation to get better. I'm just coasting along, slowly getting worse every day, hoping God takes things out of my hands, one way or another.
I finally told someone how bad it’s gotten and that I’ve debated suicide.
I feel so weak and tired all the time
Holy fk. Just want to scream into an abyss and leave this world. Currently feel super lonely and useless af. Really want to reach out to people. But i always feel so negative around those friends that reaching out to them makes me feel like I m bothering them (yay social anxiety). And then at work, I have to pretend to be happy and that life is really good when in reality it's just a complete mess. Like wtf am I suppose to do?  -end rant
It feels like everyone talks at me, but no one really talks to/with me
[deleted]
I feel so empty and alone but at the same time I'm overwhelmed. I am tired
I’m not doing great.
If things couldn’t go worse in my life, today at around 5 pm I started having vertigo. Now it’s almost 3 am and I still feel awful, both mentally and physically. I’ll have to go to the doctor, which is always a very unpleasant experience for me. Again, I could use a hug so much in this moment. I’m so tired.
no idea what the heck to do with my life. i was depressed before covid. then covid hit and i actually enjoyed staying home and hermitting. now i'm working full time from home and the wildfires make it so i can't go outside for a walk. my violent roommate is moving out by the end of september, hopefully. but until then i am trapped in my room and withering away.
I'm so pathetic. I just want to be told that I'm not, but I don't have anyone to honestly say that to me, because I am. So instead I daydream about somebody, literally anybody saying these things to me because I need to hear them and if I can't hear them from a real person at the very least I need it from a fake one. The heart of all my daydreams is always just that somebody is telling me that I'm not worthless, in some way or another. Somebody wanting me around, or close to them. I wish someone would, but nobody does. So pathetic.
why do i have to live.
I just wanted to share a victory that today I was laying on my couch sleeping feeling depressed and I started actively asking for help. From god, from friends. I feel motivated today to get help from others with my depression and stop isolating. That’s all. And I sought out this forum for the first time. Love you all hope you have a good day.
Though I don't feel the intense degree of dread I had with my last job, I still feel depressed with my new one. Maybe it's the constant yo-yoing between day and night shifts. Emphasis on night shifts, in shitty shady areas with shitty shady people  I don't think I'll ever heal regarding my feelings towards people in general; they now repulse me for the most part. Sucks considering that I have very little friends, and I'm feeling that they don't want to be bothered with me anymore. Oh well :(  EDIT: Caved and asked my friend if he still wanted to be friends. He told me he had no reason not to be, but then he says our conversations tend to steer into negative topics, or just plain awkward.  I'm aware of the negativity and I'm trying so hard, but the awkward part hurts so much. I just want to stab my heart into little itty bitty pieces, and hurt myself (more) emotionally, since I'm too cowardly to do actual self harm 🙃
Well, I guess I'm back here again after a passable run at life.  I...shit, I guess I don't even want to write. Or can't. Does it make much of a difference? Probably. Whatever. Idk. Let it stop or kill me. Please.  Thanks for being here
Why the f do I spend time thinking about something that happened 19 years ago?
[deleted]
I just don’t want to exist anymore. I don’t want to keep trying.
Wish I had the courage to kill myself without thinking of my family. I can't take this anymore
People always complain that nobody cares about their depression. How about having friends who are a bit *too* concerned about your depression?  I have a friend like this. I am not particularly close to her but she has been oddly enthusiastic in checking up with me time to time since finding out that I have depression, like I have an incurable terminal disease. Which makes me feel like I'm a pitiful being and that sucks.  We went thru the toxic positivity stage, where I felt angry because she kept telling me to travel and meditate. Istg if she ever tries to promote her mlm health products to me I will ghost her forever.  Edit: Maybe I am a very skeptical and negative person but sometimes I feel like she talks to me to make herself feel better about her life.
Not sure why but today is exceedingly hard. Can’t close my eyes to attempt sleep without crying so now I’m in an endless loop of cry myself to sleep or waste time feeling depressed/numb while playing on my phone until I either stay up all night or pass out from exhaustion
Has anyone been in a place of hoping your friends/family will ask if you’re ok... then when you do you get defensive and say nothing is wrong?
wish I had someone who gave a fuck about my existence
I feel so anxious rn. Idk what to do, feels like I can't do anything. I feel trapped. I feel like crying.
Sometimes I hate sleeping because when I wake up I feel so shitty.
Living with depression is constantly thinking of the end, feeling guilty that you have these thoughts, feeling no one around you to listen, and forever living in your fucking head. I’m tired of being drained and having to lie about myself. I’m tired of feeling unhappy. This is what existence is? I wish I wasn’t born. Started going to therapy but I don’t know if that can help me. I’m starting to feel like this is just who I am. I’m gonna break up with my girlfriend because I’m a burden and I don’t want to cause damage with her. And she says she gets depression but insists on trying to figure out why I keep calling out of work, or why I’m sleeping so much. I’m starting to feel my soul drift into nothing. I’ve had this flaw since I was a kid. But now it just gets worse as I age. I’m just so tired of hating life.
Going to residential treatment soon. No friends or family to help. Just wish I had someone to drop me off on the day I give away my personal freedom.
I'm shutting everyone down...I hate this feeling. I hate myself
I had not been comparing myself to others for a long time but today I saw a Story posted by a friend... He is now working as a manager and I couldn't help but to feel like a complete failure.   I'm still figuring out my career path. Currently unemployed because my previous job severely impacted my mental health. Some of my peers have been earning a lot abroad (I live in a third world country). It really makes me question my own ability. If I were invited to any gathering, I would totally turn down the invitation.
I've been feeling pretty crappy these days. I'm constantly wishing I never existed and trying to sleep the pain away. Like many of you have said before, I wish  I could be normal again. I wish I could socialize like I used to and be cheerful and happy to face the next day, but each day just seems more and more painful. I'm really trying to find things to do to make me feel better but all I really feel like doing is nothing.
I just want a hug. I'm so damn tired of everything.
Turtle nuts
It doesn't matter how well I'm doing, I always slump back into this pit of feeling sorry for myself...
Everyday, I need to give myself a reason to stay alive, to continue the struggle inspite of no reward.
I want to quit. There, I said it. Of course I won't, I would probably not find another job, or at least not a better one. But I'm so tired of so many aspects of it. Most importantly how it monopolizes my life. There's just not enough left for it to feel like *my* life.
Ahhh job search is so unrewarding. No feedback at all. Not even a "we have received your application". I sometimes wonder if the online platforms are working correctly. I hate HR, I hate everyone who's involved in the stupid hiring process
Me: _tries to eat healthy, exercise, have a healthy sleep routine to fix sleep cycles_  Also me: _wakes up two hours early and can't sleep again because the window is open and birds are singing outdoors_  Yeah, that's enough.
I wanna die. I can’t sleep, I haven’t slept well in over a month. I hate my job, I can’t go to school because of covid. I don’t know what to do anymore.
Haven’t eaten for a few days. Can’t sleep. I have mental breakdowns on a daily and anxiety attacks. I recently moved and I’m in a bad financial state. My new job sucks and all my money goes to bills. Found out my boyfriend was lying to me about talking to other girls a few weeks ago. All trust is gone but he’s trying to be supportive and prove that he only wants me so I stayed with him. Took a huge hit to my self esteem (if it wasn’t bad enough already). I feel like I can’t live with myself anymore. Living like this is driving me mad. I hate myself, I hate everything. All I want to do is lay in bed and stare at my blank wall. Had a bad childhood and was abused quite often. Had severe depression in my teens tried to commit suicide twice and thought it would be over. But here it is again.
i'm 2 years clean today and my scars have been fading. feeling pretty good about that =)
If I can go back, way back before this all started have a conversation with that young girl who was of yet this broken. I would speak with her and show her how to love and care for herself the way she would one day care for others. I would remind her how beautiful she is for when she looked up in the mirror to see that beauty that stood in front of her. She would know that every nasty words her family have ever spat at her was not who she was. And every punches her mother threw at her was never her fault. I would be her medic and bandage those opened wounds her mother left on her. I would remind her that she deserved the moon for the heart that she carries within her chest to never settle herself for anything less in this world. I would take her and hug her tightly until she understood that she would never be alone when the darkness came to visit her. I would be her friend and love her how she would one love others. Perhaps the outcome would be different for her. Perhaps a peace in this world would be reserved just for her. Perhaps she would want to continue living.
Seriously though, what's the bloody point.
Everyday I wake feeling nothing but dread and anxiety.  I spend all day looking forward to when the day is over. I have nothing to look forward I’m just constantly miserable.
I'm falling apart. I have several work projects that are incomplete and deadlines are slowly approaching. My future career (medicine) is dependent on my work ethic and production right now, and I am dropping the ball hard. I am working an 80 hour a week unpaid internship, and have to work UberEats on the side just to have some sort of income coming in and not look like a complete embarrassment to my family. I'm falling deeper and deeper into debt and I'm losing my willpower to keep going on. It's like I know what needs to be done, but I can't muster up the energy to do it. I feel useless, and like a failure.
Every time I think I've pinned down something definite to say about my feelings it fades into my brain static before I can articulate it.  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  I'm sad and incredibly lonely and I wish someone would genuinely care. There's a start. Someone hugged me once in high school because they thought I looked sad and I think about that a lot.
Everyday feels the same to me. It feels like an endless loop. Life is so mundane and I have nothing to look forward to.
I made a video for a class and my ta complimented it and said it gave off the feeling of tension in a home that isnt a home and reminded her of her trauma at her own home lmao. i just find it funny that my idea was so clear and im actually happy rn lolol
I hate it so much when people share their success with me. I know I'm a piece of garbage and I need no harassment.
Whenever I feel myself sinking into a depressive hole again I go play the fuck out of the piano until my fingers cramp up and I physically can't move my wrists anymore. I think, in a weird way, the pain helps makes me feel better.   In nicer news, after weeks of trying and failing, I can finally play *Una Mattina* by Ludovico Einaudi without any mistakes... I cried after finishing it, but still unsure whether those were sad emotional tears or happy tears of achievement or perhaps a mix of both
I've never been diagnosed with depression, but that's because I've always been too scared to reach out to anyone. During quarantine, things got really bad with my parents, and I stopped feeling happiness. It's been that way since April. It got bad enough that I reached out to one of my teachers from last year when I got back in school. I was not only frustrated with my parents for sending me back into school during Covid, but I was also feeling emotionally abused, especially from body shaming and complete invalidation of all feelings I expressed.   So I reached out to my teacher, and he was super supportive. I didn't tell him my main concerns about my parents because I was still too scared to do that, but I did express my concerns about politics and Covid-19. I was just really frustrated with everything going on, and that I had absolutely no control over what was happening in my own life. My teacher responded and offered some kind words, also offering to help me take my concerns to the school board (this is legally allowed btw).  Then this asshole kid who has bullied me for a while decided to report me for having suicidal thoughts—not true at the time. In fact, after I had talked to my teacher, I had felt genuinely happy for those couple of days. Like a weight had been lifted off of my shoulder. When the report came, I was called down to the principal's office and they read what I had sent my teacher right in front of me. Seeing as this was the most I had ever shared with anyone, and this random person was just *reading* it, I started crying. I couldn't get it together at all, and I was like that for the rest of the day.   Because of that Remind text and the fact that my teacher responded after school hours, they conducted an investigation. My teacher was suspended while this was going on, and I was convinced that he was going to get fired. Nothing "inappropriate" was found, and nothing was against the rules, but I was no longer allowed to reach out to this teacher. At all. Ever. He was the only adult I trusted to tell anything, and I lost that ability as soon as I had taken advantage of it.   That was at the beginning of September, the week of my birthday. It has been about a month since then, and I have felt suicidal ever since. Absolutely worthless. My counselor doesn't listen to what I'm concerned about and acts like I'm a lesser form of life just because I'm younger than he is. I don't trust him at all. And I don't trust my parents enough to tell them either. The only person I would trust enough to tell about this is my best friend, let's call her M.   I know that if I told M about what was going on, she would take me to the school social worker or someone similar (we both hate my counselor), but I don't want them to know about it. I don't trust them. I also know that if I told them about it, they would be required to let my parents know due to school policy, and I really, really don't want that to happen. Also, if it were to happen now, my parents would likely have to sit in on the conversation in the first place because I got moved to online learning, and they would have to talk to me through one of my parents' phones. I don't know what to do. I feel trapped and suicidal. I feel absolutely worthless and I don't want to live anymore. The only person I trusted enough to talk to as an outlet has been taken away from me. I am not allowed to contact him, even though they found that he did nothing wrong. My work ethic is gone, and as an A student, I am letting my grades slip, which is making me feel absolutely useless all over again.  I just want to die. The only reason I haven't tried anything yet is because I'm afraid that I won't apply lethal force, and I'll just turn myself into essentially a vegetable for the rest of my life. I want to die. I don't know what do to. My only outlet is gone, and things are only getting worse.   So I guess that means I'm doing pretty shitty.
Saturday I drove the city early in the morning. Didn't even know what to do, just wanted to get away from home. Had so severe anxiety, didn't want to talk with parents again. Even just postponing it was a relief.   Spent two hours sleeping in the car. Slept like a stone, really needing that. Small "safe space" where I don't have to listen for sounds and nobody disturbs me.  Not much else to do in the city cause it was also a holiday and most stuff was closed. At least found a museum as a way to spend time. When I came back in the evening parents thought I'd done something productive which is at least something.
Today sucks. I want to really really cut. I have never. I don't know why I want to.    I just want to. I feel unheard and bottled up.
i want affection, but at the same time i can't stand people or social interaction. I get so lonely at times its really getting to me lately, drawing / playing games / watching videos isn't distracting me from the stress as much as it did before
I just got diagnosed with bipolar 2.
I feel sad for absolutely no reason. I don’t know why. I have the essentials, I have access to food, safety, and housing. I know that someone else would love my life. But I don’t. I wish I was gone. Being a high achiever almost all my life, people expect a lot from me. Back then I knew I was empty but I wanted to live long enough to become successful in any career path I picked. Now I just don’t even care enough to see myself prosper. I wish I was dead. Has anyone ever felt this way before? Where you used to care but now you don’t? Does anyone have any advice?
work is killing me with stress

Keep thinking "What might have been" and I get wistful.
I wanna be good at something. I wanna go back to school. I wanna be an artist. And make that other kind of art too. I wanna start a business. I wanna get married. I wanna have kids. I wanna travel and be free. I want lots of money and a fancy lifestyle. I wanna live like a hippy in a commune. I wanna be smarter, prettier, more interesting. I wanna be organized. I wanna be admired. I wanna be alone.    I don't know what I want or how to decide. I have lofty, fleeting goals and the attention span of a goldfish. I have lots of reasons to say no to everything, but I want to say yes.   I don't use my time wisely, I don't have anything anyone wants because of it. I am the maker and destroyer of all my dreams.
I feel like crying but I can't

Last night I drank way to much. Broke down. Friends are sick of hearing my difficulty, starting to distance and make our chat group unwelcoming slowly over time.   I lost my dream job a little over two years ago. Working bullshit gigs and dead end stuff. Constantly fucking up.   But today I took a shower and made a frozen pizza. So I guess the little things. I hope all of you are staying healthy.
So today I felt myself hit bottom...I feel useless, and pathetic, nothing I do is good enough.  I try to get help , I went to the doctor their answer new meds....they set me up with a psychiatrist but they can’t get me in til next month.  Went to a walk in psych eval clinic they won’t see me because of covid!!!  I hit roadblocks even when I try to get help it’s like I’m not supposed to feel good.  What else is there to do???  I have no joy, the fake smile is getting old.  Why am I like this?  I just want to disappear
Another check-in comment. I have been doing okay, no more breakdowns since taking my meds but little incidents in life still trigger slight panic attacks. I am talking minor incidents, like I mistakenly sold a slightly defective preloved item online (which is resolved). Going through the job interview arrangements. The panic attacks come, and I try not to fall into a depressed mood.  I went for my doctor's appointment not long ago. She said she won't reduce my dosage although I am doing way better. She is concerned that my symptoms will worsen after I get into a stressful environment (such as a new job). Her advice is to take the pills and we will continue observing my development.  Edit: My recent battle is to beat my internet addiction. I don't use social media sites that much but YouTube and Reddit take up a lot of my time. I also feel that I become more emotional/angry when I surf too much. So far I haven't been very successful in my attempts but I will try again.
I hate how I constantly have to push myself to keep going, and my efforts are not being rewarded. I have no idea what I have to do to improve and it's testing my resiliency.  I'm a third year mature university student who spent the first two years struggling to keep a part/full time job and doing school. It was really hard and my grades suffered but I knew that was the cost of supporting oneself and financing their studies all on their own. When COVID hit I was laid off and took that as a blessing, because now I can finally focus on my studies 100% without the stress of working and commuting. Everything should have been perfect. With loans, EI and emergency savings I have enough to support myself to complete 4/5 semesters I have left, I live alone so a nice distraction-free environment to study, and I no longer worked at a job that killed my soul so I could mentally and emotionally invest myself in my studies and hobbies.  But of course I just can't have nice things can I? Despite all this free time and no other commitments I am still struggling in my courses and the worst part is I don't really know why. I organise and structure my days with study blocks, and give myself breaks so I don't fatigue myself. For all of September I made sure to do my morning workouts and stretches to compensate for me sitting down all the time. I make sure to pay attention in the lecture videos, go over slides, do to exercises...but for some reason it isn't enough.  The first round of evaluations just finished and I got my ass handed to me. At least in the past I could blame my job for my poor grades but now I have no excuse. The absolute kicker that prompted me to write this post, was a test that got returned where I got a whomping 32%. Now if I hadn't studied, and did everything last minute I would totally own up to deserving this grade. But honestly I'm at a loss...this is a course where I keep up with the lecture videos, re-watch sections I have difficulty with, do exercises, make sure I understand all key definitions, but none of my work has paid off.  I have no fucking clue what to do now because clearly what I am doing is not working. But now what? I have to keep going because the next round of evaluations are coming up, but it is so demotivating to even try when there is no correlation between the work you put in and the grades you get. I *want* to continue, keep pushing myself, learn from my mistakes and finally just be done with all of this. But it just seems like putting any amount of effort into anything does not reward me in any way.
Had a friend fly down to visit this past weekend. They left yesterday. While they were here I was concerned about them because they felt off. Texted to see if they were okay and apparently I said something over the weekend that really upset them. My anxiety is very high because they wont tell me what is up until they sort their own thoughts out. I cant help but feel this is just inevitable with anyone who gets close to me. My urge to abandon the relationship is strong. They didn't say anything while they were here so I must have screwed up really bad :( Maybe it is better for my mental health to not have friends for awhile
I don't particularly enjoy feeling incredible malice for talented people who have friends but what else can I do when I have neither and can have nothing
I remember posting here consistently after my breakup about 7 months ago. Since then I’ve been working relentlessly on self love.  For the longest time I didn’t know if what I’ve been doing this whole time “worked”. I saw no obvious results. Today, I had 3 friends in separate contexts tell how much they love me, appreciate the positivity I put out, and how I’m a great person to talk to.  I cried because it made me realize that all the time I spent talking myself through my feelings, reassuring myself, finding things to like about myself, and being patient with myself, no matter how extremely awkward it felt at times, have gotten me here. It just felt really good.
Last night I got depressed, and was sinking into some sad thoughts about myself and my life. But then I realized that there was something specific I was sad about: someone had sent me an email criticizing a poem I sent them, telling me I should rewrite it completely, when I hadn't asked for any criticism (the purpose of our talking was to share OCD-related experiences and coping strategies). So I sent back an email saying how I felt, and then I felt less depressed. I'm proud that I stuck up for myself.
My son is so depressed.   I love him so much but I can't seem to help him.   He won't take ssri meds.   I really think they could help.  He can't sleep or anything.   Just doesn't want to care about anything either.   Maybe someone here has advice?  Thanks for listening
Doing a graduate program now, and it’s frustrating how everyone else seems to be doing well and on top of things and I just wasted my entire day hating myself.  I’m not that intelligent, and this program is gonna prove it.
I've cried so much today that I have a migraine and I haven't felt this suicidal in years
It’s a struggle everyday but I wake up and try to move forward.
Finally signed up for therapy.

Restrictions keep getting extended over and over again. I am sick of staying home all the fucking time! It's hard enough having NO friends offline or in real life, the ONLY person I had as a friend online decides to ditch me for others. I have no distractions or hobbies or anything to  ease the pain (they never work anyway! I still END UP ALONE regardless).  I will just end my life or have a mental breakdown, one of the two. Nothing else I can fucking do.
The thought of dying is so appealing. How can I possibly live like this for the rest of my life. One day it will be too much.
I want to fucking scream. I’m such an idiot. Such a fucking idiot. God damn just let me fucking die.
Where did everything go wrong?
Spent the whole afternoon baking cakes for dad's birthday tomorrow. When I finally came back to my room I notice someone opened the window hours ago and left it that way. With 50 degree F outside and my room being difficult to heat as it is.   Oh, and heating was still on the entire time so I guess we just heat for outside.   All this tiny, minuscule crap is bothering me way more than it should be. You can adress this a hundred times and it means nothing. For me it's like a really obvious demonstration of "lol we don't care about any of your needs, at all. If you don't want your stuff ruined by us you should've protected it better, it's your own fault". I've got so many fucking examples for that. Therapist is like "hey why don't you allow your parents to hElP you in life, they really want to" and I have to deal with all this crap and somehow just swallow it all up every time. Fuck this shit.  Edit: selfharmed again. Because of this meaningless crap. Other people have actual problems in life and I just have an endless battle with parents over the smallest things. It's just so pathetic.
I feel so broken. Everyone should just get away from me. I should die. I'm sorry for existing
I’m still alive. I’ve been in a depressive episode since mid June. I’m starting to show some emotion again. I’ve been an empty husk with no real purpose or desire for life. I got a psychiatrist this year and continue to take my medication daily. I have a therapist I talk to once a week and I have a full time job. How I’ve managed to pull myself together daily is a miracle. The sheer strength of getting up out of bed and dressing myself has me in awe. I think about dying daily but no real plan. I’ve lost all passion for my hobbies and don’t shower as often anymore. I guess I still feel like a robot, just going through the daily motions. I envy normal people so much. There has to be a light at the end of this darkness right? That tiny bit of hope must be what keeps me going.
I wrote other posts here since today is bad, but I didn’t get even one upvote or comment. I realized I messed up big-time with one of my courses and just need a hug.
Please, please, somebody show me love and tenderness. I want a mother. I know I'm old enough to be a mother, but I'd do anything for someone to show me that care. I don't think I did anything wrong by being born. I didn't choose to be this burden. Please someone just hold me for a while and tell me what's in my head isn't going to destroy me inside out.
feeling so low
I needed one thing to go right. just one thing. but no such luck. I'm doing everything I can and it's not enough.
I had my first therapy session last week. It made me realize how much trauma I need to work through. I really liked my therapist though, which is a step in the right direction. Looking forward to my next appointment tomorrow.
I way too fucking sensitive. And I hate it. Every little slight or social embarrassment puts me to the edge. I feel like I've never grown up and that I never could even if I try.
i just noticed that i'm back to escaping from reality, i delay all my assignments, workouts, and doesn't even worry about it.  and i'm just stuck on how to reach out
lonely. that's all.
I'm tired of being a failure. I try not to think about it too much, but it is always there at the back of my mind. I want to run away, disappear and never want to be seen again. Sucks.
I feel like giving up on treatment. How many pills do I have to try? Nothing helps and I’m beyond sad.
I just want the pain to stop, I just want to feel peace again.
I feel internally homeless. I haven't felt at home anywhere since 2017. I used to feel completely relaxed when I still lived with my parents and had the house to myself. I had no idea that feeling would be taken away from me. My neighbours sons started bullying the sh\*t out of me everyday, so I moved out and got my own place. My neighbours do the same thing, they are a young couple and say horrible things, walk by the window and scream FU at me and call me gay slurs.
I feel myself going into my hole again. I’m sleeping more again. I’m getting headaches. I hate feeling like this.
Completely lost my sex drive *again*... I told my bf about it today. So far he's taking it with humor but I'm sure it's only a matter of time until he gets annoyed by it... Makes me feel useless and like I'm a bad girlfriend.
Trying out online therapy. First time seeking help in about 5 years or so. Last time it wasn't particularly helpful (irl therapy) so I'm cautious about this virtual therapy thing. But it's covered by my province for 12-weeks and I'm not going to stare a gift horse in the mouth.
I'm so fucking miserable. Lonely. I feel abandoned and betrayed. Let down. I'm bitter and resentful as fuck. I regret the stupid fucking choices I made, thinking things would be different. And now I fantasize about either dying or running away somehow. But it's too late. There's no escape.
I’m worried I’m faking it. Just being lazy. I’m in college, supposed to be in class right now but I just feel glued to my bed and the only thing that doesn’t make me want to throw up with anxiety is looking at a certain spot on the wall and shaking my foot. But I haven’t had any big trauma or sad backstory. My family is amazing. I’m just being lazy I feel like the boy who cried wolf and everyone around me is sick and tired of me pretending to be depressed to get out of things
[deleted]
Ah, the feeling of success when you've accomplished something just really easily washes away when you realize you have no one in your life that you could really share it with. Welp. I guess I'm stuck talking to old polaroids and photos then again.  Ugh. Another day, another pain.
Thanks for offering this. I just need to get something off my chest but I don't want to post.   My mother in law took her life about 2 weeks ago. I'm so fucking sad right now. And angry. And lost. And overwhelmed. I am so fucking overwhelmed.   My brother took his life 5 years ago so that brings up a lot. And my dad tried a year ago but failed and I got him into the hospital. I'm just tired of the people I love wanting to die.   I am so mad at mom. We worked so hard to get her the help she needed. We worked so fucking hard. I stayed on the phone with her for hours talking her through shit. She didn't fucking call me. She knew I would've been there why didn't she fucking call me. She texted her boyfriend, my husband and my sister in law good bye not me. I know that's selfish but I was fucking there. I was the one one the phone with her. Not my husband. I was the one who knew how to get her head straight and not feel down. My husband didn't even fucking know how to talk to her. I didn't get a good bye. I didn't get an I love you. I didn't get an I'm proud of you. Who's proud of me? Who loves me?   My mom??? Who keeps making everything about herself and her late son? I don't want to talk about my brother!!! I want to talk about mom. I want to talk to mom. I want her to say I'm proud of you and I love you and stay strong.   I want to be comforted! I want to be held. I want my tears wiped away. No one is doing that for me! I am so fucking alone and I want to talk to mom.   We could've helped you mom. I could've helped you. We could've gotten you actual rehab. You could've gotten the divorce and tied the knot with Gary and left the state. You could've had a good life with him. You could've seen your future grand babies. You fucking ended it before I could even help you.   Why didn't you call me? Why did you leave me with this pain?
Ive been In a really dark depression. Horrible sleep, but sleeping all day, in bed all day, no energy, crying, avoiding every one, I’ve pushed most people out of my life, just quit another job I just couldn’t keep up with any more, I’m on medication that enhances this depression so I’ve been feeling helpless, my anxiety is not great, etc. So, for sure, I thought I’d end Thanksgiving drunk and sad due to already being depressed and also alone. I’ve been trying to cut down on drinking, so, holiday or not, I knew it would be bad if I started to drink. I held off for most of the day and kept justifying why it would be ok if I got drunk. “It’s a holiday and you’re alone, just celebrate, be *happy*”  I tend to think I’m strong and can handle spending holidays alone, but Ive been so down , and on top of that, missing some people in my life.   I started crying towards the end of the day.   A friend sent a simple message wishing me a happy thanksgiving, and that... motivated me to not drink. That simple gesture. Idk. I poured some whiskey in a glass, took a sip, but didn’t finish it. Decided I didn’t want to get drunk. That I didn’t need it. That gave me so much strength. More than that person will ever know. I didn’t drink any more of it.  I think maybe I can survive this. I’m going to keep trying.
I made it a full day without having any alcohol. Trying to teach myself moderation. I’m struggling a bit, to be honest. I’m not really sure of my purpose in life.
I'm one paycheck away from being homeless. Feels great man.
My stomach hurts from loneliness. Why am I so alone? I’m considered attractive and likeable, I guess, but no one wants me. Other people are surrounded by friends.   I don’t have a single person to talk to day to day. When I have something to say there is no one there. I think that suicide is a good option but people that don’t even care tell me to stay..  I’m completely alone and I have been since I was young. I’m nice to everyone but the world doesn’t want me. What am I doing wrong?
I hate having to get up the morning. Especially now when there is no point.
I got rejected from a job position again. I feel like I'm a failure and I disappoint my parents even though they never said so. I'm just a fucking piece of shit that can't even get a job and live by itself. I just don't know what to do, I wake up and feel like the most useless person in this planet and I've started to have suicidal thoughts more often.  I don't know what to do with my life anymore but if it could end now, I would gladly accept it. I do not deserve what I've been given.
Job hunting is so fucking soul crushing. It sucks to know that I will never in my life be able to work a job that is actually interesting or helping anyone because I'm too fucking dumb to finish school.
I was watching a TikTok of a guy who just goes for walks with his dog in the woods for people to enjoy, and it made me realize... I can’t remember the last time anyone did anything intentionally to make me feel better, or to be nice to me. It caught me by surprise so badly that I have tears leaking, realizing no one cares enough to go out of their way for me. I see them do it for each other all the time... just... not for me.  But I can’t tell anyone, because I don’t want to guilt anyone into pretending to care. I’m so tired of feeling so alone. I’m not mad. I just wished I mattered.
I feel so empty and numb inside that I can't remember the last time I had a genuine moment of happiness. nothing I do brings me joy. my p***y is as dry as the sahara desert and I have so low an appetite I've lost 15lb in a month. I feel hollow. like I'm trapped in the space between worlds. I don't even exist right now

Hey everyone,   I’m 100% sure I’m depressed and have been for years (although it’s been getting worse this year even before Covid and certainly worse during it) but I’ve never sought a diagnosis or treatment. Any advice or experience to share about how one should approach first time treatment and what to expect?  I really don’t want to share my depression with my family which is why I never sought treatment before, but now with online treatment and the fact I live away from home I feel like I need to finally take this step.   P.S. if anyone enjoys reading I recently read the newest book of my favorite series The Stormlight Archives and its an awesome series with a main character who has depression that I highly recommend for anyone interested (sorry I just really like these books and needed to recommend.
I am so tired. Every second of every day I just wanna not exist. I am on Prazosin, Wellbutrin and Adderall and I still have no energy. My doctor upped my Wellbutrin and my depression is still kicking it's ass.      I am 28 fucking years old and I've wanted to be done with it all since I was 12. It's not getting better. I go to therapy with an actual shrink twice a week and see a psych once a month.      I don't care if I am happy or not. I just wanna not wanna die anymore. I have Severe Depression, G.A.D, C-PTSD and ADD. It all just seems like too much to fight against.
I’m going to hospital tomorrow. I want to get better.
I'm sick of being depressed. Whether or not my problems are real or worth worrying about, I'm super fucking sick of doing the same cycle of being really sad, doing and saying embarrassing things because I'm not in a healthy state of mind, then coming out of it like "from now on things are gonna be different" only for it all to happen again.  I JUST WANT A NORMAL HEALTHY BRAIN AAAAAAAAAAA
I just found this sub tonight. I am so sorry for everyone. I have my own issues as well an I thank you all just for being here, just having a sense of community eases me a bit but I hate my self for find comfort in you alls discomfort. I know as I write this I can't solve your problems or offer any valuable advice. But I can tell you that I hope you all make it to see another day. Or at least more than I do. I want to Thank you ALL earnestly an honestly.
I feel that my mother uses my kindness to manipulate me and control me.  I only have 1 friend. Today is my birthday, I am depressed and I feel so alone. I wish I was never born.
Crying every night. So tired of everything. This never ends.
Hard truths that my idiot self learned, but can't accept:  -People are cruel and disgusting by nature  -Kindness can get you _somewhere_ sometimes, but in the end evil always wins  -Life isn't fair  -Dreams aren't meant to come true for some people  -Some people aren't meant to have friends  -Life isn't fair  -Sometimes if a girl gets sexually harrassed, it _is_ her fault  -Did I mention life isn't fair  I wanted to cry myself to sleep, but I don't have the energy for that either. I'll just pass out and pretend I'm dead, though I'll probably end up dreaming about having the mental breakdowns I repress irl lol
Being my parents servant, cooking for them in the hope they'll leave me alone. But it never works.   And it gets worse when they invite relatives to dinner who are the worst. My brother's father-in-law is a homeopathic, anti-vax, snake oil selling "doctor" who can't stop spreading his bs during dinner. And the rest of my family are followers of his cult, "oh yeah, you're so right, everyone's lying but you". You can't imagine the conversations at this table about covid alone. It's so disgusting.   And those are the people I'm cooking for. I just feel extra bad if I'm doing it for people who in my eyes "don't deserve it".  Ofc this is just my fault in the end cause I'm too dysfunctional to simply move out. Same train of thoughts for years.

I'm so nervous to start working again tomorrow. My boss and co-workers are very understanding but it's so hard to keep a smile on my face all the time. I'm a teacher and I have to stay positive for my students. I'm forever torn between "my students deserve the best so I need to be happy" and "my students deserve much better than what I can give". I skipped  socialising and exercising with my friends today because I just wanted to be alone, but in hindsight I should've just gone to distract myself. I might go to the shopping centre soon just to walk around and be around other people.
I'm gonna sound like a total asshole, but if I'm honest, I'm jealous of all the people getting weeks and weeks of additional paid time off due to the lockdowns. My brother is a kindergartener and has had months of time just for himself. I'm stuck in the same grind I've been in for years.
Man being lonely wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't so fucking unlikable
ive been so lonely the past few months.. i fill my time with just gaming and taking my mind away into a different world. nobody really cares about me irl and i have few to no friends. yesterday i was afk to take a bath so i left my character looking like a snowman in front of my guild's house. when i came back i saw my guild friends also posing as snow people around my character. like a little family. ive never known these people irl, but that made me feel a little less sad yesterday.
Broke up with my gf last night but it was mutual
I'm such a fucking man child. I need to stop.    Eat some food. Send an email to my lawyer.  God how do I tell my parents I don't have a job because I don't apply for work because I'm depressed?
So weird how fickle moods are, how you want to kill yourself a minute ago then ate some chocolate crakers and somehow not that suicidal anymore.
I tell myself that not having a successful career is no biggie. But boy, does it hurt at times.
Nothing like waking up at 5am and crying to start the day. I’m determined to turn it around though. I’ve got a lot of good things coming up and I can’t let my insecurities distract me from those.
Feeling increasingly irritated at small things...and so tired of everyone. I want to be alone but I am so lonely. Crying away more nights than not. I don't even know why I am leaving a comment, I doubt anyone sees it. But I don't have anywhere else to say these things. Feeling really hollow and unhappy just.
I can’t bring myself to workout. I don’t have any energy and I’m too down to move. I just don’t feel like I can keep going. I really want myself out of here. Finding out that my depression is worse than I thought made me realize how shit this life really is. I feel so helpless
I have this pit in my stomach it hurts so much. And I could cry everyday. I just want someone to be there for me..
I'm sorry I hurt you, and I miss you so much. I still think about you literally every day, I really hope you're happy and healthy and I wish I could be there to support you. I'm trying my best to fight this depression but it's hard to see myself for anything more than what I did. I just can't forgive myself and it hurts a lot. I hate that what I'm writing is centered around me, when it's you who had to go through several years of neglect and depression. I'm so sorry I couldn't see that, or wouldn't see that. I know that the person you're with now does, and I'm so glad you have someone like him to support and be supported by. I know that you won't read this, but I miss and love you so much and I hope you have a merry christmas.
The lockdown is killing me. Applying for jobs, but my mental health has been steadily declining.
I'm crying so badly.
I wanna die. Fuck this life.
I become a better person when I'm drunk. Like seriously, alcohol makes me a better person. It's fucked up I guess but if it makes everyone happy, what can I say?  Also fuck Christmas.
My wife and I lost our baby girl (stillborn) last week. I’m really struggling to find the good in life atm. Christmas is usually my favorite time of year and now I feel like it’ll never be the same again.
my old friend told me he wanted to do a group call with all our highschool friends on christmas.. well that didnt happen. i already mentally prepared myself to socialize and its all a waste in the end. why do i even try
If I'd played my cards right, I'd be so much more successful. Ah, f#$k it. I'll be like Diogenes.
Good luck out there today y’all. Hopefully liquor helps the smiles.
None of this really seems to be worth it, huh
I'm going to survive 2020, but I'm never going to recover from it.
Being massively unhappy who I am -> but also being extremely afraid of any change whatsoever -> I talk to therapist about all this -> she isn't able to tell me anything -> I have a total breakdown  _insert Gru meme_
Idk why but I’m feeling empty tonight.
Let's hope 2021 is the year for me right? At least I can laugh bitterly at things. I'm fucking tired of holding it all in, but to be honest it's pretty much all I've got providing me any semblance of emotion left and I'd rather keep it there.
I keep a journal. Idk, it's good for getting thoughts out sometimes, but after four years all it has is my depressed thoughts. Still I open it sometimes and see how the things that made me so unhappy and wretched don't matter anymore. I hope one day the things currently making me depressed will go away as well.
Still here, only I haven't posted before. Always worried that someone would know who I am or snoop my profile, but I honestly don't have to worry about that because I am more and more realizing how little I mean to anyone. I am having a very tough time, wherein I am considering living with my girlfriend, who I can't trust fully and who is constantly upset or disappointed with me, or staying at home with my angry and abusive parents. I don't know what to do and it's all moving so fast. I feel worse than ever now, even though my partner is supposed to not tear me down
I wonder how old everyone is here. I'm 21, I've been around on this subreddit since I was 17 or so. I remember reading posts and comments from older people and thinking I'd never reach that age (had plans to kill myself.) Here I am though all grown up. Sigh.
In general i'm not doing good. Don't have the energy to list why that is
I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired.  I finally fixed my sleep schedule just to stay up until 7am again and fuck it all up once again. I wake up at 4pm every single day wishing I could just never wake up again. I woke up at 4pm today just to fall asleep playing pokemon at 7pm. Why am I so tired all the time for no reason.  I bought a game I wanted to play for a while after my laptop broke and I had no access to my steam account. I scraped out $15 for it and I watched it download in anticipation, just to stare at my switch and not play a single game. I bought a game to not play it. My switch is right next to me. I'm just staring at my computer screen.  I want to scream. I want to tell people that I am depressed and get the help I need. But my whole fucking family is depressed. I can't make this about me when everyone else is going through issues of their own and I don't want anyone to worry about me killing myself. I wish death was easier to achieve. I wish people could forget me at the snap of my fingers so I can finally die and not worry about my family and friends mourning my death. How do I even die without traumatizing someone in the process??? I fucking hate living, I did not ask to be born. Take back my life you fucking coward god. Let me die.
I don't really talk to any friends. I just let out my thoughts here on reddit since that's socialization in a way. Just reading tonight. There's a manga I've been meaning to finish. After that there's 1 more I knda want to finish.  Feeling apathetic today.  Tired like everyone else. Maybe I didn't sleep enough. No coffee today. I'll try to sleep at midnight, not too early so I don't wake up in the middle of the night again.
Every time I post here, I end up deleting my comment...  "Life is a gift." I stand outside smoking, tasting the salt on my tongue, noticing I'm an embodiment of fear, memories, nostalgia, and anger. I shield myself from the world, waiting for someone to notice my pain, but they can't see through my calm demeanour. I get a little happier and a little angrier, drifting through the motions until my death. To acknowledge the problem is to suffer. I hope life goes by quick because, at 22, I'm already tired.
16+ years of constant depression in varying degrees and I'm still having weekly breakdowns ugly crying wondering if this is permanent and wondering if I should just neck myself. I guess one day I'll decide to but for the mean time I'll continue deluding myself into thinking theres a light at the end of the tunnel like a fucking retard
I’m not really a religious person but is it weird to feel like you’re being punished by god? I feel like I’ve had nothing but problems for the last year and when something good does happen it quickly turns around and becomes bad. It got so bad today I started crying randomly.
I spend so much time thinking about things that happened in the distant past. Thinking about them is completely pointless now. I wish I could put the same amount of thought into things that could actually help me.
I'm off my meds because reasons  Trying to hard to get a therapy appointment but I was off therapy for a bit and after 3 emails back and forth trying to find a time slot that works for me my therapist stopped replying  I'm scared this means I have to find a new therapist  And will lose my 3 year history and backstory and will have to rehash my shit with a new therapist and will bring back bad things and I am refreshing my email like crazy and its been over 24 hours since I last sent a summary of the days and times that could possibly work for me and im losing my mind and just god please I dont want to get worse   I just want to exist without not wanting to exist y'know  I just don't want to be back at rock bottom again but I need help but the universe isn't making it easy right now and fuck
I relearned the lesson that wearing eye makeup is pointless. It always gets cried away (waterproof varieties are laughable to someone who cries as hard as me) and leaves me spending so much time wiping it off in the nearest bathroom.  But I was having a great time the past few weeks at work, and felt good about myself, and eye makeup makes me feel pretty, and more confident. I was able to wear it for a few weeks with no worry. Now, once again, after an embarrassing cry in the work bathroom, I don't have the confidence in my happiness lasting to wear it without worrying about crying it off.  I can't go into the details about why, but my job that made me so happy has been ruined by my bosses.
I was clinically diagnosed with depression about 8 years ago, and escaped it about 5 years ago. I feel the same things surfacing again now for a couple of weeks and I'm terrified.
I'm shaking for no reason, sad for no reason. I hate this body so much. I'm so fucking tired of it.
Closing in on two hours of work out of 8, and I'm still trying not to break down (completely) in my booth  If only I had the courage to end it all already
Who here fantasizes about being dying on the way to work in some crash? Just something where it’s over in an instant than bam you don’t exist anymore
I eventually stopped crying. I finally got up. I ate a bit. I cleaned up the house a bit. I washed the dishes. Somehow I feel a bit better. Somehow I feel a bit in control. I still feel anxious and hopeless, though. I'm broke and I don't even know if I'll have anything to eat tomorrow. But I guess I'll have to try again. Idk how to off myself anyway. I guess that's good. Somehow.
Haaa having a long-distance contact with someone, only seeing each other a few times a year even before covid. I'm still living at my parent's place, sending her glamorized photos of the landscape I live in and the food I make and whatelse but only because she wants to see those (it's like watching foodporn for her).   Yesterday did something like that again and she was like "you're living a good life!" and I was just thinking "are you serious?".   So far we talked about her problems but I only implied or joked about my ones. I replied with a meme that the rest of my life might not be that cozy beside those pictures and she said one day she'd like to know why exactly I were unhappy.   It's absolutely surreal for me that she can't even imagine what those reasons might be. That just means how well I've been able to hide it. I've been living a triple life for years and even though we know each other for years as well she only knows a carefully created fake personality of me. I don't do that to exploit anyone, I'm just too dysfunctional to actually leave the house and talk to people.  What she don't know is that I've been unemployed for years. My life is a total mess but my parent's place is still producing nice pictures! So it's like an iceberg where you only see the small top. Still I'm living in eternal fear of my parents and emotional abuse. I'm super dysfunctional and it took me years learning how to even use public transport or sit in one room with other people. Still able to hide all that _when_ I'm actually meeting someone else, it's kinda catch22.   Suicidal thoughts for years. Running away from mental hospital for years, the one therapist suggested. Doing super irrational things and not even having plans for tomorrow.  Haaa really not talking with her about my problems. I see no point in this, it won't make me feel better and I already lost two other social contacts because they asked me about my problems and I thought I could trust them and it only ended in arguments. She's also not really the right person because she can be very hurtful and my emotional skin is made from paper hahaha when someone's looking at me the wrong way I get a new trauma. I can't deal with the loss of control when "sharing".
It’s been awhile since I post on here.   Last night was the hardest for me but I got through it. I haven’t showered for two days nor have I eaten for two days. But you know what today I’m gonna force myself up and get things going. There are sick people waiting for me and I can’t fail them. I must continue fighting because I am stronger beyond any pain I feel. Today I will go on a quick jog and take that shower I need to take and eat something. I will play a song on my piano and put on my waist trainer then I will get ready for work. At work I will go to the chapel and make a small prayer let all my tears out then prepare to help those who need me with a clear mind a smile on my face and a still bruise but warm heart. This is my goal for today. I am stronger then how I feel. I can do this. You all can do this. I love you all take care💜
I’m having one of those days where I feel empty. I feel like I only exist in others lives out of convenience and that those I do try to communicate with - I just annoy them.   I just want to stop feeling so alone.
Have an illness where you're scared to death anyone will reject you + Be fucking boring without any interests = Recipe for disaster
I have so much to do and no energy to do it. The more I look at my bf, the sadder I get. It feels like I am alone, but with someone living parallel to me out of pity and financial necessity. If we don't live together though I am essentially homeless while disabled.   I just don't know what to do with life, so I read and maldaptive daydream my way out of it for 90% of the day, sleeping for the other 10%.
So today one of my only three friends that live in the same continent as i do let his friend just tell me that he doesnt want to be friends with me anymore while he just sat there and i have known him for eight years and her for two months and just hhhh
Been stuck at home for almost a full six months now. I’ve only left the house once. Since I came back home since the lockdown, I’ve been slowly reverting back to my teenage days aka not knowing how to deal with the fighting matches at home( after trials of trying to break them up, fight back or straight up ignoring them).  Mentally, yo-yoing from ahahah shit I’m in a not so good place to hmm maybe it’s not so bad.  Have successfully isolated myself from everybody.   Read and watched some of the most depressing things I could find and literally couldn’t even bring myself to cry lol.  Given up on trying to talk it out with people because it feels kinda useless( I’ve tried but I guess I just suck at articulating?).  Haven’t been productive and while I’m completely guilt stricken I also cannot being myself to do anything.  Since I can’t be self destructive at home, guess I’ll just not exist lol
I have no trust in my future and can't imagine things getting better. I hope I have the heart to talk about this the next time I see my therapist.
Happy 10th anniversary to me and crippling depression and anxiety. Til death do we part.
I just started taking medication a week ago. I don’t think it’s related but I’ve been feeling pretty ok this week. I’m struggling to figure out what’s going on with me since I have many breaks in my downswings. I guess many people would consider that lucky but honestly sometimes it makes everything feel that much harder. Knowing and remembering what life can be like without a complete lack of motivation and what life can be like when a smile comes naturally. Trying to get the right diagnosis while constantly doubting everything that happens internally and externally... depression is such a fucking mind game. Sometimes I feel like it has an intent. It decided to crush me in the most sinister way possible... by first systematically taking away every connection I have with reality and then making me feel guilty about it. Making me hate myself for something I didn’t even fucking do... like I said this week has been pretty ok, I even had the pleasure of sitting with a friend on a bench and feeling a deep rooted happiness. The fucking fucked up thing is though that even in that happiness there is a void staring back at me. Even in my brightest moments I must be reminded that I am not free.
I felt like before the pandemic and lockdown, I was stable enough on my 50mg of Zoloft to stay on that dose and do alright. Things have drastically turned for the worst and due to the situation this country is in I am incredibly hopeless and sad. It doesn’t feel like a full depression relapse yet, but it could be headed in that direction. I’m reluctant to raise my Zoloft dosage due to the side effects. I want to feel better and am doing extra things to feel better - getting enough sleep, eating well, light exercise, and CBT techniques but it’s not doing to be enough.
I’m doing horrible
I've had panic attacks 2 nights in a row, currently having one now. I went to urgent care last night and they diagnosed me with a bacterial throat infection and said "come back if you need to." Problem is with my fucked up brain I have no clue what the difference between painful but harmless and literally dying RIGHT NOW. I'm up at 2am fighting every minute to not go back to urgent care and I can't keep my mind off death. This is the worst
hurting a lot and can't tell anyone. I come here and say that a lot. it's pathetic.  talked to an old friend recently for the first time in a long while, to catch up on what's been happening in our lives. he told me that he was seeking therapy for his eating disorder. I was glad for him, and we talked about that for a while and I tried to be supportive and let him know I'm around if he ever needs anything. I really meant it.  but there was an awful, selfish part of me that felt sad, because I knew instantly that I can't open up to him about what I'm feeling. I can't tell him about my grandpa's cancer, or the horrible things I read at work, or how I want to die but I'm struggling to get treatment. because he's got his own problems and he doesn't need to hear about mine.  and that's the thing - at this point, everyone has their own problems, and those problems are much more serious than mine. I feel ashamed just thinking about it. I have no justification for feeling the way I do. I just want to go away forever and stop bothering everyone.
I have lost control over my life
Yet another Sunday night where I have my mind going with anxiety for the fact that it's yet another work week to which I hope passes by quickly. By the time Friday rolls around and off the clock, it suddenly becomes Sunday night with the onset of the dread all over again. I feel tempted to just call out. I have an older cat who very likely has cancer and may have to take a day off for an appointment to affirm on it. By then I'm not sure what will go down since it's very likely that she will have to be put to sleep because of it. I'm second guessing with my job search since I want something concrete but nothing in my desired field will be offered until at least the beginning of next year. If I didn't have loans to pay off then I would risk being unemployed for a few months. I should also stop reading news trends since it doesn't help with my mind racing.  Don't mind me. Just another narcissistic rant while I think of it and have no other outlet to express this on. I'm just tired of this.
The emptiness is scary.
I'm not in a good mental space right now  going through the 3rd divorce within 3 years, first my mom and dad that really hurt me and 2nd my step dad I hated and my mom and 3rd and right now my grandma and grandpa I had to live through lots of my parents fighting and yelling and I have depression as a consequence I've struggled even when I didn't have depression with self esteem and I've done self harm and it hurt my friends and I feel like I betrayed them 1 friend especially we've all ways liked each other she helps a lot but since COVID I can't see her and I don't have that help any more but I'm trying to do something and it made my moral sky rocket down so yay...
Birthday in a few days. It's probably going to be the loneliest. Oh welp.
yup im getting worse every day
well i know for sure, my future's fucked
[deleted]
not very excited for therapy, don’t think I’ll open up 😐
Today I stayed connected with people and socialised. I have to become functional again.
Things are getting worse. Have been.  I think I need hospitalization but that makes me feel like even more of a failure.  I don’t think I’ll make it to 28.  The only thing that keeps me here is the thought of my child going through this alone herself. But lately that thought hasn’t been holding me on like it used to.  Will anyone remember me when I’m gone? Or am I just that insignificant? I guess I’ll never really know.
I'm just so over all of this atm. I hate my job. Im going to school for a job I have no interest in. And the main reason I'm going to school is because my boyfriend is, and I figure once that fails like everything else, then I can say I at least tried, and maybe will even finally just end it all. But I don't even want to talk to him about it, because I know he'll get upset, tell me not to talk about things like that, etc. I just don't know if I can really really do this. I'm so  tired.
Ive been in a positive mood as of late, call it the upswing. Gonna try and maximize this, hopefully I can minimize the crash when it comes  Been good but my sleep cycle is all fucked up and maybe got 8 hours in 4 days? Really starting to feel that.  My dreams are back, though, a bit wierd. Why the hell would Green Bay trade Aaron Rodgers to the Bears, and why would I tell everyone in my family as if I just found some lost treasure? Dreams are friggin wierd, man. But at least they're not nightmares, yet.
One of my good friends got arrested today. If I had been smarter I could’ve avoided her getting arrested. I think my mental state had been declining almost everyday I think about suicide daily and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been smoking weed when I get really stressed but I’ve just been wanting to die/forget everything by taking bars.
I feel so unhappy and lost. Life is just suffering
So much anger against my father. And graduate advisor. Both the father figures in my life.
Do you ever feel like you feel tired and drained because you feel like you're chasing something but nothing is even happening????
i'm depressed inside, dead on the outside
I'm going to die someday, either of my own hand or not. In the meantime, I'm going to surrender to little pleasures programming, math, science and chocolate.
Finally had my hearing to get disability. It did not go well. Fuck I'm scared about the future.  I'm just killing time until I die.
I continue to feel the extremes of deep depression, high anxiety, or just the complete feelings of emptiness and numbness.  I just don't feel like I feel joy anymore.  I rarely even daydream happy thoughts.  Rather my daydreams just have me suddenly disappearing off the face of the Earth.
The anniversary of my father's suicide is coming up. I found old letters from him today, mostly apologizing for disappointing me. I was an asshole kid who never got to apologize to him and I feel responsible for his death. Reading those letters makes the wound feel fresh. I was a horrible, mean daughter and I should have killed myself when I was a teenager, before he did, and maybe things would've been different for my family.
the world is an evil place and I don't want to live in it anymore.
What a tough week last week. My self esteem is zero. I haven’t felt this badly in a long time. I’m hoping I can pull myself out Of it the next few days to weeks but I know I’m just going to keep falling back in until my situation is resolved.
My mom called today. I ignored it and kept gaming. I'm not in a good relationship with her.  Gonna eat now and I'll keep this comment updated hopefully with what I do next. Hopefully something good.    I'm gonna eat the pizza I got and check out some video game mechanics then catch up on 2.5 days of shows.
Cymbalta stopped working for me. I've been spiraling really hard the last couple of weeks but I have a doc appt this Friday to talk meds so hopefully he's willing to kick it up a notch to something more potent.
I told my Mom about my friend's sister's recent suicide and the first thing she did is to blame the deceased, who btw was a diagnosed bipolar. I just find it really fucked up.
Sometimes I'm doing pretty okay, and it just swoops in to nail me without warning. Wtf. How can I go from almost enjoying myself to wanting to die within twenty seconds?  I can't keep doing this.
I haven't hurt myself in a few days so that's good, but every day I struggle with wanting to.  I'm also realizing that I've used self harm as a coping mechanism on and off for my whole life so that's fucked I guess
I cried for three hours today. Straight. At least I got a little productive after that
First off good evening to anyone reading and thank you kind people for this subreddit (and this open space).  I am 24 years old, employed for around 4 years and live with my brother (we rent an apartment).  Even if that sounds like some good accomplishments, I feel like a loser without energy (or with just some) every day...  The fact that.. I am still a virgin, makes me hate myself, my lack of social skill and confidence. Had online girls on Tinder "wanting" me but never happened. I just feel like a straight up loser that can't enter nor make a relationship work  Another thing that makes me hate myself is I want to invest my money a bit riskier but I never commit. Idk, I really don't know what is wrong with me.. I am so sorry to bother you guys but thank you
I hate people sometimes. Had a friend who totally screwed me up emotionally today with toxic positivity. After I made it clear that I didn't like it, friend apologized. She then proceeded to invite me to her mlm product event.   Biatch... I can't even. How could you do this to your friend? It feels like a combo of manipulation, pity and self-centeredness. You wanted to invite me to this event so that I'd feel better? Quit lying. Also did you just assume that my life is horrible just because I have depression? (I'm feeling better nowadays... If she had bothered to ask)
Haven’t been here in a while. Things have been going a lot better as of late. I’ve been going to the gym and following a diet very well. My body issues remain to be a large concern for me but I’m really hoping I can begin to get on the right track.   I would say my next area to focus on is self worth. I’m trying to allow myself to realize that I’m doing well for myself and there are people that are proud of me, but there’s the endless battle with the voice inside my head.   I want to matter.
Idk why I'm so cranky these few days. The same friend kept bugging me with texts and giving me advice and suggestions. I'm so tired of feeling like... being pitied?
So much anger, so much resentment.
"The younger generation cannot survive without their parents!" - my parents, today in a conversation with a friend  It's not my fault that I cannot earn enough to sustain myself (I can, I just can't own a house...). It's not my fault that I'm getting the degrees and work experience I should be getting only to be underemployed/unemployed.  I wish someone could make the older generation goes thru a simulation of life of a 24 year old in 2020, maybe that would open their eyes. My parents seemed smug when they talked about how youngsters rely too much on their parents and can hardly be financially stable.
Here's hoping I at least get an interview for the full-time position at work. I've been waiting YEARS for something like this to open up and even if I never move beyond this, if I get it I'll be happier than a pig in shit! And maybe, just maybe, I'll finally be able to somewhat survive.
Maybe my "depression" is just an excuse so I can justify my patheticness. "It's not my fault, it's the depression," right? Feel bad for me, pity me, care about me. Maybe I'm mixing up the two, pity and care. Doubt anyone feels either for me. Doubt anyone feels anything for me but hate.  Why am I such a shitty person? I have no excuses. My childhood wasn't awful or traumatizing, it was sucky at times but everyone's is sucky at times. So what? Why am I so shitty? I don't even have depression, I'm just a shitty healthy person. If life's shitty it should at least be shitty to the max. Moderately shitty, big deal. Who cares. Nobody.  I keep flip-flopping between imagining scenarios where I'm a fantastic person and everyone cares about me, and scenarios where everyone despises me and I try to kill myself. I've noticed the former borrows from media: movies, books, anime. The latter borrows from my actual life. Guess that's saying something.
I'm less sure I can do this than I used to be. Running off hope, resilience, and general grit without a payout? It's been so long man. I dunno how long someone can keep doing that, but I'm worried it's not going to be enough for me.  Enough? Enough for what, anyway? To get old and have my body and mind start failing on me while the world changes faster than I could dream of keeping up with hoping I get enough to scrape by? To watch anything I manage to care about fade away or die? Yippee fucking skippy. Why would I even care? I dunno, I dunno.  Looking in from outside, I know this is “bad”, but why I can't quite pin point. Funny phrase that. Huh. Even writing this something in me is desperately clinging to ... wholesomeness? I dunno. Something. It's that same part that keeps saving me. Why? Why does it even bother? Idk. This sucks. Hope you're doing good, sorry about the bad rant.
After weeks of no response from all the job applications, I received interview requests from two of my ideal companies. Although I'm tired to have to go through the entire interview process, at least I'm a little closer to going back to work and not feeling like I'm doing nothing.   Working in a toxic job, quitting and job searching have been tiring. I don't like the idea of working 40++ hours a week. But sitting on my a** is depressing too. Idk how to reconcile this, gonna take it a day at a time.
Is anyone else a NEET who rejects education, work, and everything else required to survive these days? I know I have potential, but my ability and will to work has been sapped over the years. At least I am getting treatment.
I feel like I’m getting worse with no end in sight. Lately I’m feeling lower than I have on my worst days, and I’m beginning to have physical responses to my stress and depression. I’m scared because I think I might hurt myself and I don’t even want to. I just can’t get out of my own head.
I'm just totally fucked in the head. I've spent so long trying to distract myself from my thoughts and emotions that I've forgotten how to actually know what I'm feeling. Any time I try to focus on the causes, my brain just jumps to awful intrusive thoughts. Chronic depression's a bitch, and I'm afraid I'll be like this my whole life.   God I need fucking therapy, but the last time I went to therapy it wasn't much help cus I can't even really describe what I'm feeling, or why.  Just that I feel like shit.
I feel awful, it's everything all over again. I feel stuck in an horrible place.
Tonight I feel numb.
Life feels like it’s just one long day
loneliness is genuinely eating away at my soul. Every night i imagine all sorts of interactions with people i never talked to. i imagine the scenario, dialogue, and everything. and then i realize that this would never happen. its so pathetic. i am so lonely man
Today well technically yesterday (since it’s early in the morning now) was not the best day if I’m being honest. Idk I’ve just been feeling really lonely and empty, It’s just been an endless cycle of getting up and wasting the day procrastinating and not being productive at all and then hoping for nighttime when I can be alone with my thoughts in peace. The only time I’m at peace is when I’m sleeping tbh. I want to stop this cycle but it’s hard when you can’t think optimistically about life and feel like giving up all the time:((
It's hard to move, every movement... every breath feels so heavy. I feel unwanted and useless. The only thing I've done that's productive is get out of bed... but then I found my way to the couch... I hate feeling like this. I hate crying.
It’s unbelievable how much I fuck things up  At some point all this stress is going to have serious repercussions on my physical health
feeling like shit for who knows how many days or months in a row. not in the worst headspace of my life but geez this sucks.
I called a suicide hotline today and gave a fake name. Apparently I sounded distressed enough that a half an hour later some cops showed up at my house. I managed to lie to them to make them go away but now it’s 3 in the morning and I want nothing more than to kill myself. My housemates hid all the pills and knives. I don’t know what to do other than sit here and feel numb. I wish I could just die.
Feeling absolute shit right now.  I don't feel like I'm in control.  Why can't I just fucking do the things that I should be doing??
I just feel like I can't cope, that I'm barely in control of my life and the things I am in control of I don't have the energy or mental ability to do anything about.
I just want to feel normal.
Parents are back from holidays, something I was feating the whole time. Made a cake hoping they'd leave me alone but it never works. It's like there's no escape, no safe spot. I'm so afraid of them and I hate it so much. But also too dysfunctional to move out or do any other big changes.
I wish I could give up on stupid and impossible hopes like being successful or not lonely. It wasn't that hard for me to give up on being happy because that's quite honestly never going to happen but somehow this hurts worse.  I can't have even one aspect of my life that isn't shitty?? What the fuck did I do to deserve this
So extremely scared of tomorrow. Parents are back and want to raise the pressure, demanding to know what I did while they were gone. Have to make up lies on the spot. Just want to run away from everything.  Also, pretty much everything is closed. Libraries etc because of covid. Feeling like I'm constantly under attack at home but can't go anywhere else either which sucks especially since now it gets cold. Feeling like a trapped animal.
I just dont know how long i can take this. I can bear this feeling of hollowness, nothingness anymore. Nothing makes me happy anymore, i cant focus at anything. i dont want to eat anything, i dont want to do anything, i have lost all motivation i dont want to exist anymore
I just want to die already
I just dont want to tomorrow. im tired. i feel so shit. I just got triggered recently about being a virgin i guess. idk why I care so much about that. i just feel like a failure socially and because of covid and my previous jobs where I was super awkward and nervous I feel like a failure in work as well. I don't really mind having very little friends. idk I just wish I could make another one or get a gf. I just want that one person who I cant talk to about anything. mostly my depression and what weighs me down. i feel I cant talk to me friends very well about that stuff. they're not great to talk to about depression. i don't think they understand. im just so tired of doing interviews and applications and getting rejected. im tired of doing uni as well. i feel like whats the point if Im not getting a job and not getting what i want which is a gf. i cant really meet people because of covid and online dating sucks. im just finding it hard to do anything. im so alone. i don't want to do tomorrow. its so hard being a person. its so dumb. you just look for that next hit of endorphins to make you feel good for no reason. always suffering. why do anything? i hate everyone. idk ahh. i really don't know anymore what to think. im just tired of trying, failing and being alone. i feel i dont like socialising that much its pretty boring a lot of the time idk. need to meet more people but still hard to meet people who you actually like. zz
feeling like i will never be enough in my current relationship. i always feel like i’m lacking in one way or another and it really eats away at me. sometimes i feel like my s/o would be better without me in the picture
everything is so difficult
Already had an awful day. Took a two hour walk to get away from parents. Got so much anxiety and stress.  Later that day I saw my ex in the local newspaper. She's writing her doctor thesis. I guess you can do a lot in life if you have a healthy brain.  That was eight years ago. I suffered so much back then, can't describe how brain-dead I handled all this, tons of dysfunctional lines of thinking. But hey at least it got _so much worse_ since then. Bad internships, bad therapy, bad job, unemployment. Running up the walls rn. I'm suffering for the last two decades, there hasn't been a good year since I was ten. It's just "pick a bad year to think about". All the crap back then and then a constant like to the even worse things today.
Can I please please please stop worrying do much about the future. Why do I have to be so convinced that I'm going to be an absolute failure in life? Why can't I just be okay with who I am? I get in such a bad place when I'm alone and I'm gonna be all alone after college and everything is just gonna be so bad. College is awful right now and idk if the online garbage will be ever by the time I graduate. It's like the last few years of my life are being ripped away from me. I just wanna stop worrying but I can't. I wish I could know what I wanted to do for a career. I wish I knew I wouldn't be alone. I wish I had any reason to loom forward to life after college. God I'm already somehow super lonely and I live with four people. I'm not going to be able to live a life on my own.
If only someone I trust asked me if I'm okay instead of laughing at my suicide jokes. And why the fuck do they keep making jokes about that I'm  lil fa tjust shut the fuck up. They are my friends but please just shut the fuck up and when I try to say that they just make fun of it. I cannot be alone again and for like 75% of the time they are great friends I had houseplants to replace the oxygen I waste and even they died. I even fail at keeping a plant alive. I fail at everything. I really don't believe that it gets better so should I just end it when the next chance comes.
Parents backing me in a corner. I can't do what they want me to do. So instead today I managed to write my former therapist again and also one of my former employer. Asking both for a talk. That's the most I could do, tried to do it for years. Had huge obstacles, but today I _just_ pretended I was someone else (not the first time) and that I'd feel happier afterwards!  Tomorrow I'll probably have 100% pure panic about "omfg what have I done" (also not the first time). But whatever.   Idk where this leads me. Especially since I usually have huge problems with any change whatsoever. Maybe tomorrow I'll crawl under the couch again unable to move.
Had a horrible interview and can't sleep well ever since it ended. Not sure why hiring managers have to be so rude and  condescending, especially during a time like this.
Pretty much flunked a graduate assignment and it has been the only assignment graded, which means I have received an F. Trying to stay numb and hope that the professor does give another chance, but it's leaning towards that maybe I'm not cut out for all of this. Not to mention it's a class that is not in my comfort zone and yet if I try to drop it then I would really look like an idiot. I knew that getting A's during my undergraduate was a sham. Why am I even bothering to try?
I want to feel things again, I want to be alive.
When someone choses to leave you, because you are what you are, that's the worst; i just don't know what to do, i fuck up everything
I don't feel anything anymore. I hope this lasts longer than usual. It's better than being miserable. I don't think things will change in my life especially since i self-sabotage  and have a negative outlook. I'm pretty sure I have some mental illness, but I don't seek therapy or help because I am embarassed and avoidant. It feels like every year just gets worse and I'm becoming more and more detached. I haven't been to any doctor in years and my mental and physical state are deteriorating. I guess people have tried to reach out but I always push them away or they get frustrated and abandon me. I'm not worth it. I wish I could just die already. I don't have any passions or goals or dreams. I no longer am upset over my inability to keep relationships. I think I've accepted that it is something not for me. I feel bad for disappointing my mom but I'm doing the best i can pretending I dont want to die everyday.  My family is the only reason why I'm still here. I dont want my death to hurt them. I wish my existence would end quietly.
I fucking hate myself
[deleted]
I have no one to talk to right now. Asked the guy I like, who very much knows how I feel if you wanted to stay over. He is currently sleeping on my couch while I cry in bed. Fun times
I've never hated myself so much in my entire life
I hate how easily I feel rejected. I cry over the dumbest shit because someone will talk to me in a slightly pointed tone and it makes me feel like they hate me
I feel very precarious. I spent the past two days deep-cleaning my room because I thought I had bedbugs, but they turned out to just be carpet beetles. I should be happy that I don't have bedbugs and that my room is so much cleaner now, and I did feel that way last night, but today I feel anxious and just...frightened.
I’m just sitting alone all the time hiding the pain that i feel because no one seems to care too much about what I feel. They don’t have the time to talk or just spend a little time with me. In a home where your parents claim to love you but their still to busy to question their child about what’s going on in their life sucks...sometimes i just wanna go somewhere on my own and think....
fuck i wish i was smarter, it'd make everything easier. and have energy. I have no agency or ideas. Don't know what it is, but i don't have it. Resigned to mediocrity and survival and stress. Will be criticized by people who do have agency for whatever reason about doing x or y, and i'll understand it and be unable to communicate why i can't do it. My uncle is a successful self made potter. Why is he that and im a small anxious skill less cog in the machine. Gene enviornment relationship. I cant think past the immediate future and yet always preparing for the worst.
I hate the word “I”, don’t think I deserve it. Yet, I’ve already used it twice. It feels impossible to not use it, but I’ve come to the realization over the past decade that my well-being is no more or less significant than any one else’s. It feels incredibly selfish for me to talk about my issues with depression when there’s people with equal and much worse symptoms. Further, my time is worth no more or less than anyone else’s. It is arrogant and ignorant of me talk in general, the space for me is nonexistent in this universe. There’s no reason for me to exist, a creator put me into this world with no intentions of success. Thus, I’m only hurting others with my existence. One could argue against this with simple logic, saying that anyone could feel this way, but I assure you, I am hurting the world as much as it is hurting me. This is not the case for others, I am a selfish individual for existing. It is impossible not to be one with the universe, consciousness is all you know, yet, it’s insignificant. I beg to no longer exist, I don’t want to be perceived at all by anyone who has met me, it is only selfish of me, and difficult for them.
I’m in this “rut” of feeling like I don’t want to do another day.
I don’t even have the words to describe how I feel anymore. I’m going through some health issues and back and forth with my doctors right now, which I absolutely know is contributing to my mental state, but I almost feel like I can’t keep it together right now. At work, I feel like I can’t concentrate and I’m really irritable. Short tempered. I’m better at home but I know it’s not going to last. I was managing really well for a long time without medication or therapy but I’ve been bouncing the idea of going back. Now that I’ve made up my mind to do it, trying to squeeze yet another dr appt into my schedule is making it worse. I have a high stress job and my direct supervisor is a stickler for attendance. This post is kind of all over the place but I just needed to let it out. Some days are better and others I literally get out of bed just so I don’t worry my husband. I feel like I’m being ridiculous.
I keep realizing there are people who've never had to deal with depression daily. How is that even possible? It's so surreal to me, why am I like this?
i feel trapped.
I’ve been struggling hardcore. Lately I’ve been so down my partner can’t even be around me. And I can’t even blame him
i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die i want to die  i want to die i want to die
Can someone tell me that I deserve to exist and that things are going to be okay? I really need to hear that right now.
I washed and even conditioned  my hair today! It still feels weird to be proud of something that basic.
If my parents had spent as much time talking to me with concern, as they do praying, maybe I wouldn't have ended with lifelong insecurity, anxiety and depression
I feel like depression has made me so stupid.
When I entered college I thought with this degree I could have a job where I could help my family economically and still be able to live decently. Fast forward 4 years, graduated in the middle of a fucking pandemic, jobless. I feel like a fucking failure and a burden to my family. It seems like I will never find someone that will love me no matter what. Sometimes I wanna fucking kill myself and the only thing that keeps me here is literally my mother. I promised her I would be the one to bury her but everyday that goes by it's more difficult. I don't even fucking know if I'm depressed or just constantly on a down-ish mood and I feel one day I'm gonna explode. I don't want anybody to know about this so everyday I put my clown mask because that's the only thing I can do. This is how I feel right now.   I'm sorry if this isn't meant to be here, I'm just so mentally exhausted I wanted to vent. If this doesn't comply with the rules I'll delete it.
So much resentment towards my graduate advisor and my father.
I’m pretty sure school and schoolwork in general  makes me depressed... I’m just so lazy and after failing over and over i just feel horrible
I feel so lost, I’m tired of feeling like a burden to those that say they love me. I wish I didn’t feel unwanted. I want to climb out of this hole but I think I keep digging it deeper.
Sleeping all day and crying all night is the norm now. I’m tired of reality.
I guess today was an ok day. I cooked for my family (I haven't eaten though bc no appetite). I exercised (a little) for the first time in months (whoa since July...didn't realize so much time had passively passed). I also showered, which I haven't done in days... At least I feel like I actually did something today. I know I should be kind to myself and be content with what I've managed to do, but it just makes me sad that this is my mental bandwidth. I want the old me back...  I'm still not motivated enough to work on my grad school apps...it just makes me cry thinking about it...about how I'm such a fucking failure and this is all just a waste of time and energy. Guess I'll just go back to mindlessly watching gbbo and let myself get further behind.
Man, I didnt know there was an entire forum filled with people who are depressed.   Ive been feeling anxious and depressed for a long while now. I want to get better so i decided to go to a therapist. It's helping little by little, but there are just some days where im tormented by thoughts of past scenarios. I catch myself talking to the people in my head and making a conversation out of it. It isnt driving me insane, but these things clearly affect me to the point where its constantly on my mind.
My eyesight legitimately got worse because im on my phone all waking hours trying to escape my responsibilities
Hello I am depressed
I’m not doing okay today. I missed a deadline for a project and didn’t realize until a day after (today). The person waiting for my submission emailed and I sat, staring at their email.  I was trying to think how/why I missed the deadline and I don’t know what came over me but I started crying. I haven’t cried in a long time and I realized I have reached some sort of a breaking point.  There seems to be just so many things going wrong for me recently and I’m having a hard time. I have trouble telling my friends and family any of this because I don’t think anyone wants to hear this and I don’t want to be the “Debbie Downer”. My mediation app and breathing exercises only help so much.  I’m writing here because I hope someone will read this. I don’t need acknowledgement but thank you for being here. I’m trying too.
I feel so incapable of the simplest fucking tasks. I’m falling very behind in school and yet still spend hours sitting around staring at walls, listening to podcasts or doing chores around the house to give myself a semblance of productivity. I lost all my running progress and am regaining all the weight I had lost from running through the summer. I have no friends and am starting to feel disconnected and angry at my boyfriend for no reason in particular- he deserves better then that.
Thinking of giving up everything and just go live in the woods. Maybe I can suffer the same fate as Grizzly Man.

I'm like a month behind in the sole "college" course I'm taking: a remedial math class. It's finally caught up to me and there's just no way I can complete the exam that's due in a little less than 2hrs. I'm not even upset, I'm more apathetic than anything, but I still can't believe I did this to myself. I can still salvage this class, I just have to start over immediately and act like the semester begins tomorrow (I'm gonna start studying/reviewing tonight though). I really really hope I can hold myself to this; hopefully the thought of having to admit in 6 weeks that I failed this class, again (I took this class in the spring but dropped it), will be enough to get me to power through my apathy.
I'm spedning so much time thinking about things that happened 17-19 years ago. It just doesn't go away. And what happened wasn't egregious at all. Wish it would go away, and stop occupying space in my head.
There's nothing more fun than having your shitty ass brain loop twisted thoughts and uncomfortable truths in your head all day long :')  I have one more workday to go and it's in the shitty area I hate _again,_ I'm so fucking done rn
Didnt eat or drink today.   Gonna try to be hygenic when i wake up, and go outside
I was ghosted two weeks ago. I haven't showered in a week. I rushed back to my apartment this morning after I unlocking my neighbor's door because I was too embarrassed about my BO, and I slipped and fell on ice as a result. My knee hurts, and I want to binge eat. Hi.
i feel so embarrassed. yesterday i left a comment for the first time on someones page that ive been following for years. this person shares a lot about their life, i dont know who they are but they have a community on instagram. they often make posts about them feeling unhappy or angry so today under her new post i asked her a question about whether shes heard a song from a group i know she follows. today i wokeup and checked the comments, someone commented after me mocking my question because it seemed insensitive to the post, and over 20 people liked their comment.  i saw how they must have seen it, it seemed as if i just ignored her post and thought about myself. as a long time lurker of her page, she often ignores lots of the messages in her comment section but replies to questions especially music related, in my head i thought she’d feel better if i asked her something not related to mental health. it never crossed my mind that she’d be offended by it. i honestly had good intentions and it feel so shot down as it was the only comment ive ever left and it is now deleted.   can i get anyones opinion on this?
uh oh, getting bad again. i'm so fucking tired of being a failure in just about every part of my life. i feel like i have to try so much harder than everyone else and i still fail no matter what, i guess i'm just inherently incompetent and worthless. what's the point when i will never have success or happiness.
I reached out to someone who said they would be there if I needed them  for comfort and support and I ended up feeling like an idiot. They said they were sorry and then it shifted only to their issue before they completely disappeared. I tried to play it off like I was okay and I tried to comfort them for the short period they spoke with me, but  I was crying, feeling alone and stupid and not knowing how to approach this person going forward.
Well that's it. Govt cut my benefits, no hope of appeal. Won't be able to afford to stay where i am by next year.  Can't hold down a job, can't hold down a coherent thought. Moving here was supposed to turn things around. Therapy is useless, friends barely reply to me. Wish i'd died years ago, i've achieved nothing.
Wish i could reroll life is get a restart at least.
Watching people who have done nothing but down you get blessed by god really takes the wind out of your sails, especially when youve tried against the odds to no avail your whole life.    Im not feeling good today.
I want to die please I don't want to live anymore. Everything is so hard I'm unable to do anything properly

I've been taking Vitamin D for a few days and my mood is immensely lifted. I have the same focus and energy I had before. I'm still lonely, I still have no friends or future, but at least I can get out of bed now. Hopefully it doesn't end ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  I put off taking Vitamin D because I thought it was my shitty life situation that was causing my stress and depression, but it does still help. From time to time I have depressive episodes, but they don't last. I recommend giving it a shot. Granted it won't help everyone, but it's worth trying anything that might help
I have, so far, successfully  removed myself from 95% of my support network and am in the middle of fracturing the last 5%. There is no will or desire to improve, no sense of self value. I thought promises I made to myself would hold but those goals are becoming more unattainable and uninteresting by the day. Things aren't going well and I'm tired of struggling. The only thing keeping me here is an imagined fictional universe and not wanting to cause harm to that last 5% by finding my corpse.  I've been in this fight for longer than I've known the name if it. It's been so very long and I am so beyond tired. I want to rest. I want to be at peace.
I just don’t want to get out of bed, I just ate brunch with my roommate and her boyfriend. But now I am in my room with the lights off, and I know that I have people and if I talked to them some of my feelings my clear up but I don’t want to be a burden to them. Sometimes I wish I could just disappear without a trace and just have people not remember me.
I want to be happy
I spent 30 minutes being insanely destroyed by something that triggered me, and feeling like I was worth nothing.   That's better than being destroyed by it for an hour. A part of me rose up after 30 minutes and decided that I had done enough suffering, and that I was worth more than just feeling like I deserved to die.   This would not have been the case 4 years ago. And it is now, and I have no idea when it happened or why. It's not consistent, but it's just often enough that I'm noticing it now. That it can be really bad, that it can be just as bad as the other things that hurled me into the pit before, and kept me there for a while. But this time I did not let myself sit there.
In addition to my ever-present depression, I now have Covid. Just when my depression was getting better.
I feel so bleh and low. My critical inner voice is getting louder and louder. Can't wait for this quarantine to be over and I can be around other people safely again.
Nothing’s objectively wrong. But I wouldn’t complain if I died in my sleep.
Hope everyone's staying sane during the election day! I'm not even American but my dad kept mentioning the race, China and Russia that it's driving me crazy.   I have developed some sleep issues lately as well. Having a diffuser in my room didn't help much. I think the main problem is my over-consumption of internet content that fried my brain. Gonna attempt to draw and read more this week.   The job search is ongoing but I'm also investing some time in my part time gig for now. Tbh life is the most balanced for me now; too bad that I am forced to get a full-time job for societal expectations.
I can't believe you left like that
its the kind of tired sleep doesnt fix
Talked to a friend whos in a bad place today. I tackle depression with a lot of weird concepts that make sense and help me, but i dont think they can do the same to them. Everything they said just sounded so ...empty. Can anyone help me be a better friend lol and tell me how to talk to people like this?
My birthday is this weekend and I have no plans as usual because I have no friends. I don’t think I would mind so much if I didn’t have work on Monday. My coworkers are going to ask me what I did for my birthday and I’ll have to lie that I had dinner with friends or something. People expect you to do fun things on your birthday and I feel like that’s just another expectation that I don’t live up to.
Procrastinating. Did nothing all day. Will have to work weekend to compensate, but i just want to desapear.
I can't concentrate on anything I'm so weak I just want to kill myself
my cat died unexpectedly tonight. please god let me die in my sleep. there's nothing good in life for me.
I have the second episode of depression this year and my boss confronted me about not being super productive "again". I tried to explain that I suffer from depressive episodes and that I feel overwhelmed with my workload then, but I was very emotional about it and felt really stupid and ashamed afterwards. He just said that I am being illogical in my arguments and wanted me to think about it again and talk to him tomorrow. I am dying from anxiety over here.
i am so embarrassed to be alive. i don't know where to go for help. i'm too scared to kill myself and too scared to be alive
Every fucking day it feels like my life is falling apart. I can’t make it through a single day without feeling so hopeless. I’ll wake up and be happy, but by 2-3 I’m so hopelessly depressed. I’ve been on anti-depressants for years now and it just doesn’t feel like they work anymore. I’ve called over 2 dozen psychologists and therapists in the area and they don’t even call/email me back. I’d broaden my search, but I can’t afford anything beyond free or heavily discounted and I’m out of places to look. My mood brings my SO down so much I can tell she feels like it’s her fault. Fuck I just want someone to tell me what to do...
I have a computer science degree but it's been hard for me to get a job because I don't have any impressive portfolios because I just constantly depressed through college. Recently a private company in my area invited me for a written test. I applied for IT support position. In the advertisement, the technical requirements only stated that candidate must be able to do database administration, which I am able to do. But turns out the test was about full-stack web development, which I am sucks at. I thought I already get over it but now I find myself crying while watching John Mulaney. I feel so useless and my degree means nothing.
I can feel that today isn’t going to be a good day for me. It’s already off to a bad start. I feel just unimportant to everyone around me.  The people that say they care about me, I just don’t believe them.
First time posting, so please forgive if I screw up something. I just need to get this off my chest and don't have anyone I can really turn to. I've been dealing with severe depression for the last twenty years, and normally I have my shit together enough to not break down, but today hit it hard for some reason. I've been extremely lonely. I'm not attractive, even to myself, and I haven't had an honest relationship since my divorce.     I've recently been blocked by someone I've followed on Twitter for over two years, and today she said she was closing her account because she's retired from her industry. I had known that she was in a relationship with another influencer before the tweet, but I didn't know that they had broke up. I don't follow people on Twitter or Facebook that often tbh. I rarely check either. But I figured I'd be nice and say congrats and happy belated anniversary.     Turned out they went through a pretty public and bad breakup that I wasn't aware of.     Obviously the first thing I did was tweet an apology and explain that I didn't know. I felt horrible about it because I had been through traumatic divorce. It's the worst feeling in the world losing the one you love most in the world. But she immediately blocked me. I know in my head that I'm taking this way too seriously, but it hit me hard. It reminded me that I'm no one and I feel like I got thrown out like garbage. No thought of humanity, no thought of emotion, just refuse to be discarded. It reinforces how I see myself and how the world sees me.     I'm so very tired of being alone. Tired of not being able to make friends. Tired of being a nameless nobody that's passed on the street or not talked to by anyone unless it's for business. I just want some form of genuine acknowledgement that I matter to someone. You know how people fantasize about getting a relationship? I get rejected in my own dreams. I'm not making a joke about that either. I legitimately can't see anyone wanting me not even in my own dreams. It's pathetic.     I want a hug, a kind word that's given in sincerity, anything. And I know that deep down I'll never get that. I'll always be seen as "that creepy guy" or "that loser", and it's the worst isolating feeling ever. I break down and cry nearly every week. I smoke to take the edge off of my nerves to keep my from screaming into an uncaring void. And I long for a day where I no longer feel this pain, but I'm too terrified of death to do anything.     I can't take it anymore today, and I just had to get it off my chest.     I'm sorry I took up your time, but I appreciate it if you did get this far before scrolling off.     Thank you.
im sorry if im posting a lot but i really needed a space to vent and i have no one to talk to.  i dont think this is what a mentally healthy adult does but lately ive been living in my life escaping reality. ive been playing an online game out of boredom and sometimes i wish i can just escape my life and stay that universe for some time. it feels like living in a fantasy dream where i am a person in my own right. i dont have to live up anyone's expectations. i dont have to worry about the fact that im expected to marry a man by 30. i dont have a narcissistic family that ridicules the things i love. i can do whatever and know that i wont ever be less of a person than anyone else. i dont have to always be the mature adult im always expected to be.   i just feel so tired of life. i wish i had the courage to just say fuck it to everything and live only for myself. it sounds so selfish but i cant see how i can be happy juggling everyones expectations of me.
I had to take a stupid fucking test today but I though it eas tomorrow and I didn’t catch it so now I’m out $112. I hate my life. That test was super important and I don’t think I can get my money back and now it’s 2:30am and I think i’m a fucking failure and I don’t deserve to live on this earth because i’m stupid
On the bright side, I've reached the blessed valley of 'too depressed to eat' so at least I'll lose weight.
I keep thinking about how completely useless I am
I don't know what's my goal in life anymore.  Everyday is just tiring. I can't concentrate on like something for even 30 minutes.  Even lying in bed gets tiring.  I don't know what I want in life anymore. Left job, supposed to be looking for a new one but I'm feeling so out of it and worried I'll screw up the new job.  Applied for psychotherapy but haven't gotten a reply or notice yet. Don't know if that's going to even happen at this point.
I think the hardest part is that I'm still doing everything I'm "supposed" to be doing; eating right, exercising frequently, taking part in my hobbies, doing martial arts, talking with others as much as possible.  I'm just tired? I'm hitting 40 soon, have very little family, all of which is out of the country and I cannot legally visit. I have a handful of friends, but they all have families and spend most of their time with them (understandably). What little social life I had was torpedoed by betrayal, and further torpedoed by covid. Any time I've expressed my concern at just wanting to be able to go on a date before I die, I've been called selfish, disgusting, and (my personal favorite) a murderer.     I've spent nearly all of my 40 years quietly reading and writing by myself; I'm kinda burned out on reading endlessly and playing D&D on weekends.  I destroyed my leg in the military which makes weightlifting and martial arts (and sleeping) far more difficult every day. I just don't want to spend the next 4 months, much less 40 years, going to work, lifting weights in my garage, and reading a book, and then silently going to bed alone; never able to date or travel or have a party again.  I wake up every day wondering if I should just cut my loses.
I don't know what is going on anymore. I don't want to die, but things just get harder each day that goes by.
I recently got an art commission request and I haven't made any art since the last commission I had in September. I've doodled a lot, but these drawing commissions are the only things that give me the drive to actually finish something. It has been a really unproductive year for me, I've not made any of my own completed original drawings this year really, just a lot of unfinished stuff or rough doodles. It feels really unnatural for me. I've been perpetually exhausted and lacking in the motivation. It's very different from last year, last year I was so much more enthusiastic. But I love the saying "its okay to not be your most productive during a f\*cking pandemic."
I’m high-functioning, so I’m kinda moving through life. But the moment I’m not distracted, I just want to disappear and fade away so badly. I’m lonely, sad, and tired. I don’t know why but I feel it in my bones at this point, and I wouldn’t fight it if I just went to sleep and never woke up again.
I wish I could just have a day off. One day where I don't have to think about work or school. Yet, that isn't possible.
This week's highlight:  "Friend" talked me to condescendingly. Offered opinion on my MDD. Made the decision to cut off the relationship cuz I have a feeling that she's in touch with me to promote her MLM business. I'm done w this shit  Another old Facebook friend posted publicly about his mental health struggles which I support and welcome but that guy's an ass. His posts usually go "I'm depressed but I did this project and won that award" or "what good is a dean's excellence award if you're depressed all the time?"
I say I’m lonely but I don’t have the will or courage to keep up with relationships. Maybe I’m meant to be forever alone. Idk, not a fun feeling
My husband told me he doesn't think I should be sad everyday. I dont even know how to respond to that. I decided not to respond at all. I'm grieving and its winter and I just cant seem to find anything to be happy about. I cant enjoy anything. I'm not going to waste what little energy I have in reserve defending my feelings.
feeling anxious for no reason I'm tired of crying all the day
Feeling numb, my head went crazy, cant touch reality, lying in my bed with no point 4 living
feels like nothing at all is making me happy anymore. i keep opening games just to get bored and close them five minutes later. i don't even know what to do with any of my time anymore besides just sit here. i don't understand what's wrong with me
no matter what choice I make I always end up angry/dissapointed in myself
I’m not doing good. At all. My life is completely fucked for the time being. Currently without work, unemployment bennefits, backlog on rent from no income, failing all my classes for school, I can’t do anything and am sick of being like this.
It’s almost 4 in the morning over here and I can’t sleep. I’ve been in bed for hours and experiencing an anxiety attack. I’m not okay and I don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I feel like I’m only good at messing things up the good things in my life and making bad situations even worse. I keep reminding myself every single day that one day things will be ok... But it feels like I’m just lying to myself and that I don’t expect any better from myself.  I just feel like shit... I’m 25 years old, haven’t graduated yet and oh, I have a huge student debt. That’s a bright future to look at, huh? No. Because I know I’m capable of finding ways to make it even worse (if that’s even possible).  Let me just say this... I’m tired and ashamed of myself. I’m a disappointment.

Currently sitting in bed with my gun debating on whether or not I should just fucking do it already. Dunno why I commented this tho cause it'll probably get deleted ✌️
I cant seem to move on past an asshole ex. Its been a year now he is still in a relationship with the girl he left me for and I cant seem to move on. I dont want to be with him. I just want him to get his bad karma for what he put me through. But they seem happy while i'm depressed and suicidal from the trauma they caused. I dont trust people anymore. I feel like everyone is out to get me. I prefer to be by myself now. Its lonely and depressing but at lesst I dont get hurt. I just cry now. Also my grandma recently died she was one of the few people in my life who I knew loved me. I feel so alone and I cant stop crying. I wish I had the strength to make the pain and tears stop.
I’m just really tired of life
Part of me is hoping I don't wake up in the morning, because all I'm expecting is loneliness and pain.
Can depression please just fuck off and leave my mother alone. She doesn't deserve this. She's the best mom anyone can ask for. I can't stand to hear her cry anymore I can't take it anymore it hurts too much. Why do things have to be like this why can't she just be okay. Depression can keep fucking me over for all I care but please can it just leave my mother alone.
Idk what to say.      Haven't had proper sleep for quite some time.      Going back to work from tomorrow for the company I despise these days. (Not easy for be to switch).      Doing things for people just because I offered help, they need it but I can't refuse because I have to maintain that "nice person" image. The help in offering is making me do a lot of things I'd not do. They'll stop needing my help in a few days, I'm thinking of limiting contact post that. Anyways I'm a disappointment to others how does one more person matter.      I'm broke, don't have money to gift family things they need but won't buy (family have money to buy it themselves but i like gifting things).        I'm useless, not living upto the expectations of anyone, not even mine, unable to study, exercise, work. Have constant thoughts of meeting ab accident which would kill me no matter how horrible the death be but not dragged. I don't want to be incapacitated and become a bigger burden.
Feeling lonely and guilty. I really am an awful person with very few redeeming qualities. I don't really have people to talk to so sometimes I look for help online but if someone who knows me doesn't like me or care about what I have to say, why would a stranger?   I'm not good at anything. I'm not likeable, and I've made terrible decisions. I really don't know how to feel any type of good about myself. I'm lucky for the little bit that I have. I can usually do things day by day but I had such a rough time at work yesterday that I'm dreading going back and I'm starting to spiral.
no one will read this and even if they do no one will care and even if they care they wont help so there is no point of sharing my thoughs :) :D
I can feel myself slipping back into a bad headspace again for no reason, it feels like I’m spiraling and idk what to do. I can barely even help myself, how can I even begin to start helping the people around me. I feel like such a burden.
My partner was exposed to covid on the day he was supposed to finally see me after a month of us being too busy to see eachother so its killing me because I'm so lonely without him I miss the affection and human contact I started a new stressful job but I have to quarantine because I'm getting really sick and i gotta test to make sure I don't have covid I've been so isolated this year and all I want is to feel normal and okay again my Ptsd isn't getting any better either its all so much to deal with alone
My mom stressed me out to tears again bringing up that damn orchestra again. She refuses to accept that I don’t want to do it and it is impossible for me to do it because I’m a theatre major and I literally have no time for it. The music majors already have no time to sleep, I will like kill myself if I start it. At least she agreed during the summer. She makes me regret ever starting violin. Last semester is my last time taking lessons. It’s not fun anymore all it brings is stress
I hurt myself today after learning I would be hired for a tenured track position after being a visiting assist prof as it was hinted to me earlier this year though Uni will be hiring TWO tenure-track professors next year.   My friends mom died from covid two days ago and her family was like my second family for many years.  Im mentally exhausted. I feel like I’m not heard and that I can’t express what’s on my mind, as if there’s something preventing me from uttering the words.   Im really tired. I’m afraid of sleeping so I can’t have a good night sleep. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just don’t know what to do
I feel so disgusted when someone uses my bed or my blanket or my pillow. My house is so dirty and disgusting, I feel repulsed by the floor, the carpets, the table, the chairs. I don't want to touch anything. My room, my bed, at least, feels like the only clean place. At last I can be comfortable. My parents used my blanket and now I don't even want to touch it anymore, I can't bring myself to go to bed and even the thought fills me with anger and disgust and I feel so frustrated. I feel like I've been waiting all day for this chance to recharge and now I have to spend it losing more and more battery in my anguish. It's such a pathetic thing too. So why do I feel so sickened by it?

I have no plans or anything. But man don’t I feel calm when I think about dying. Either by my own hand or God’s. It’s gonna happen, it might happen soon. I don’t know.   This life I was born into just wasn’t meant for me. And that’s okay. I don’t have to be here.
Not a day has passed since as long i can remember where i didn't felt like killing myself, but knowing i'm to much of a pussy to actually do it seen by how i already try to do it 3 times just this last year and failed to take the final leap which makes me hate myself even more. I simply cannot recall what it is like to feel like life isn't miserable and not wanting to just spend all my time either having dreamless sleep or getting blacked-out drunk.  Edit: I wrote it weird. I think it is better now.
My memory is getting worse and it's scaring me. Is this a symptom of depression or something else?
Whole day super exhausted, depressive thoughts, back pain. Cooking for my family, afterwards making food for my brother's family as well since parents will visit them tomorrow.   Afterwards just want to take a small nap. Will help with exhaustion, back pain and depressive thoughts. Setting timer to 20 minutes. Can't even sleep that long, mother comes back and wakes me for no reason cause I'm supposed to "go for a walk".   Someone waking me makes everything worse again. I'm constantly on guard anyways, I can't be "vulnerable" in any way, can't talk about any problems. I need so much energy just to defend myself all day. Even if I'm productive it doesn't protect me from being yelled at. And it fucks me up if parents are like "we make your life worse for no reason, we don't allow you a small break". Same for all the verbal stabs while they pass me.   The "help" of my parents is making me so much worse and last therapist didn't seem to believe me. This is such a psychopath thing. Imagine your school bully would show at your home and say "I _really_ care about you, you know?". And you just think "don't say anything that makes him angry".  Hiding in the bathroom again because it's the only room with a lock. Sometimes I actually went for a walk just to get away from things but rly no energy today. It isn't "selfcare" if you just do it to avoid more yelling.
I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but I really just wanna share my experience in the hope that it gives you guys some hope that things will be better.  Two months ago, I was constantly depressed, unmotivated, apathetic, and considered suicide.  Today, I am happy, motivated, and afraid of dying early because I want to live so much. I actually have to order some books to help me deal with my mortality haha  &#x200B;  P.S. This is absolutely not intended to flex on anyone. I know this sub is intended for those currently struggling with depression, but my intention to let you guys know that, **there is hope, there will be the light at the end of the dark, seemingly endless tunnel. Please give yourself a chance at living a happy life, by holding on right now.** I can definitely say that I am so grateful that my past self who was struggling with depression and finding the will to live, has managed to hold on long enough, so that I can find the light and come out of the rut, to start a happier life. It totally makes it worth it.
I thought I was doing pretty good, until this morning when I realized my roof is leaking and dripping into my kitchen and I just completely lost it. I’m tired and overwhelmed. I lost my dad when I was 26, I’m currently 31 single female and I pride myself on being strong and independent. I lost the only person that mattered most to me in the entire world. I took over the house, made necessary repairs, work hard to pay all my bills and take care of myself but this year has been tough and it seems I can’t catch a break and I realized that as water dripped down onto my head. I’m overwhelmed and exhausted. I try to beat back when life starts hammering but today I just feel like waving the white flag.
Basically being drug addicted and chasing all the distractions I can get because I cant deal with my life and when I talk to a therapist they cant deal with it either
Another holiday season shaping up. My work life which was at least tolerable has gone down the complete shitter. Personal life what the hell is that, the few friends I did have, haven’t heard from all of them in months. The only people that ever call or text is either work or family. I can’t remember the last time someone showed even an ounce of concern for me. Things ever so bad that you just get the point of numbness? Like if you acknowledge your feelings it’s like ripping open your chest
I dont want to keep going anymore. Everything just seems like a waiting room for the awful moments. I feel so alone with no one to talk to and no actual loved ones. I feel like such a weak fuck for not being able to go through this or to end it. I cant do anything right and straight up hate myself.i hate my appeareance, i hate my sexuality i hate who i am and If i had the option to be someone else i wouldnt think twice
I'm so fucking done with life. I feel like shit 24/7 with no relief
i'm so tired, i have nobody and my family is falling apart. my roommates want nothing to do with me, i spend every day too anxious to eat, too anxious to leave my room. im trying so fucking hard to keep going but depression is taking it all from me and i can't do anything about it. i don't enjoy anything anymore, I can't force myself to work anymore. i want it all to end
I tell myself that career success is not everything, that having a job and earning money is not everything, that it doesn't matter if I am not a success in the eyes of the world, that it doesn't matter if I die alone begging on the streets. But sometimes it is so hard to continue with this attitude that nothing matters.
At what point does it get better? I'm on meds. I've been through therapy. I had ECT as recently as two weeks ago. Why isn't anything working?
Online school has been killing me. I'm I'm 2nd year of uni and I don't know what the hell I'm doing with my life. I barely get myself out of bed, I have several assignments that are overdue and barely even started. I've tried talking to my profs. Some are understanding and give extensions and some don't really care. I can't do this. I've been crying my fucking eyes out in bed every couple nights. I'm scared.
I made my bed and I am sleeping on clean sheets.
Therapist when it's about improving your life: "think about what 'could be' in life...  ... but don't think about what _could be_ in life"  Me: _screaming starts again_
Anyone else at that point where they aren't even really sad anymore, or stressed, or angry, but just completely devoid of literally all emotion? I just don't even really feel anymore.
New member here. I was hospitalized with major depression for ten and a half days. My principal diagnosis upon discharge was depressive-type schizoaffective disorder, which sits just between full-blown schizophrenia and a mood disorder. I'm taking Risperdal for the bipolar symptoms, and Zoloft and Remeron for the depression.
Life fucking sucks, hoping some of you guys find a second light.
I feel broken. My mom died just before Covid hit the US. COPD took her. I haven’t cried more than a tear for the loss. I was addicted to oxy back then and was swiping them from her. I’ve since been clean of them but I’m not feeling much else. Except maybe anger. Not at my mom, just in general and maybe most towards my wife. 21 years with her and things just keep going more and more down the drain. Just started working again but am completely broke. Almost lost my home the other day and my kids will be getting NO Christmas this yeah at all. I’m to the point where it’s hard to not just leave and disappear. Not die but just go away and live in the streets.  I’d feel bad for my kids but I don’t know if I’m even any good for them to have around.   Yeah that’s where I’m at and it really only scratches the surface.
I’m new here. My depression has been all consuming recently. I cry a lot when I’m driving alone with out my kids in the car.   I’m a small business owner, and this last year my business has grown in a direction that I am not happy with. I live in constant panic, which is destroying my already fragile health. Everyone always tells me how amazing I’m doing and how successful I am, but I don’t feel that way. I view myself as a failure. I’m struggling, a lot.  I have formed a plan to shift my business into a direction I can be happier with. I have many loyal customers which helps give me the confidence that switching things up won’t end up with financial ruin for my family - something I didn’t see possible 6 months ago.  Second item I need to work on is my physical health. I have hypothyroidism and have been trying to ignore it. But this year has forced me to make some changes. I can feel that if don’t reduce stress and become more active, eat healthy and have a better mind set I will have a heart attack and dementia by the time I’m 60. My body hurts so much every day and the brain fog is debilitating. I’m starting to make small changes already - like not devouring half a tub of ice cream in bed to find some sort of comfort after an extremely hard and draining day, this is literally the only thing I look forward to some days. But I am hoping once my business shifts, I’ll have the time to focus on myself a little more and actually have the time to find a physical activity I can enjoy.  I’ve realized all the money in the world isn’t worth it if my stress and depression are out of control. Something needs to change, I can’t keep living like this. Every day is painful, physically and mentally.   At least I have a plan though. Wish me luck!
Just grabbing some food. Have not been taking good care of myself.
Keep replaying an incident which happened 18 years ago in my head. I feel I was manipulated and taken advantage of, and I can never let it go. I know that there is no light at the end of this tunnel.
I don't think anyone wants me around. It hurts a lot.
They said depression is about loneliness but mine isn’t.  Mine is like a big gaping wound in my chest. A void that doesn’t fill. It doesn’t get better when I’m socialising, being around friends and family. If my depression isn’t about loneliness then what’s the cause of it?   My therapist has been telling me that the cause doesn’t matter but I feel that finding the root cause could help me get better. What should I do if nothing helps and I feel so hopeless?
TW: suicidal ideation    My depression has returned with a vengeance. My doctor upped my meds but says we may have to change them if need be.   I feel like I’m starting all over again and it almost killed me last time. I don’t want to do this again. I’ve started obsessing about suicide again and feel so useless.  Trying so hard to take the advice of the doctor but he says stuff like “you don’t have to fix everything. Maybe just worry about this one thing.” I can’t stop worrying about “everything” and have absolutely no motivation to fix this “one thing.”  I know I should be happy for all the things I have but that’s what makes it worse. I just feel guilty. I’m lonely but don’t want ppl to feel sorry for me. Just useless to everyone.
I am just so tired of everything. I feel nothing and I want to keep it that way because it's too painful when I do feel. I don't want to think anymore.
As sad as this sounds my mom is the only family I have here. Even if she manipulates me for money I have no one else I will take whatever love I can get. Plus in a weird way I think she loves me. I just want to be loved and for someone to genuienly care for me. That is the main source of my depression. I feel so alone like I have so much responsibilities on my shoulders.
Need some help every day is the new worst day of my life.    Dogs don't even help anymore.
My sister has cancer. It doesn't feel real. Nothing about this year feels year. I feel like I'm experiencing extreme dissociation because it feels like I'm dead. I know all of this sounds crazy, and I'm not sure if anyone can understand. I've lost too many people this year, and I'm can't handle it.   Erika, I fucking love you. I care about you so much. I hope you're ok, but you're probably not.   Considering my sister, she's always been there. I can't imagine life without her.   Fuck this.
To lie awake late with fictional scenarios running through my head in an attempt to feel some happiness, or to let myself fall asleep so I can wake up on time and get stuff done tomorrow?
All I do is cry and breakdown. I just want to run away from everything. I sleep or avoid everything, I just want to be alone all the time.. I'm so tired of trying to get my life together. It's like something just always weighs me down. I try to pick up the pieces and build myself again and again but something always knocks it down. Sometimes the smallest of things.  I have been constantly failing in exams, my financial situation is not good at all, parents are always fighting.. I have become obese.. I try so hard to change but everytime something upsets the delicate balance and I tip to the wrong side.  From acing exams and playing nationals for squash to failing exams. My grades and game have brought me so much happiness even during hardest of times have been robbed from me. Everyday I wake up is a different battle I didn't sign up for. I'm exhausted and I feel like a failure. I'm so confused and I don't know how to fix it anymore. I'm surrounded by stubborn people who won't just relax a little and empathetic.  I just wish some miracle happens but do they? I am supposed to be able to change but I don't have energy left to constantly try and do better and I hate what I have become to let go and just relax.  What can I do?
Treating myself today to buying the new call of duty Cold War game
Anyone on here free to send me a message to talk please, feeling very lost and could do with advice
Finally hit me that I won’t be at my brothers wedding tomorrow because of things that are beyond my control. I can’t stop crying. Crying is an understatement for the flood that has been flowing from my eyes lately. Had someone who hardly knows me anymore more tell me I was depressed today... not that it’s not true... but hearing it out loud hurt me deeply. This year has been the worst of my life. Last week I couldn’t get out of bed for 4 days. Lately even breathing has been a hard decision. Hoping for better days is the only thing keeping my feet on the ground.
Treated myself to a holiday espresso drink at Starbucks
I did pretty poorly with Christmas gifts last year, dealing with uni and near the peak of my depression. This year I've graduated and my meds are working so I actually got a lot of gifts, some my family knows about since I had to ask for suggestions and also some surprises I was able to think of. I started wrapping early and it all looks really pretty and I'm proud of it. I left my family Christmas last year crying because I felt like I did so little while they did so much and I'm glad I'm not piling on the guilt anymore for something that was out of my control at the time. Really excited to exchange gifts tomorrow.
Have a happy holidays guys. Or at least as good of one as you can.    I'm home now for the first time in I guess 4 years. With my parents. They want me to move back in. It'd help with my inability to deal with stuff on my own.    It's always cold though. I feel tired. I guess I should go get some coffee.
I feel alone. My parents didn’t even try to act like a family and have us all sit in the same room together. They forget about me. Just like everyone else does. I feel very alien. I don’t know where I belong but somehow I feel uncomfortable being with my own parents. I wasn’t made for this world. I wish I was never brought into it.
No interest in Christmas anymore. Forced cheeriness, extra stress, facing family when I feel like shit, spending extra money...I could go on.
Nothing like spending Christmas Eve and Christmas in dangerous neighborhoods all night with a upset stomach, while everyone gets to stay home :') Merry fucking Christmas to me I guess
Sitting here, randomly scrolling Reddit, pondering spending all day tomorrow fighting a clogged sink. Finding out what few friends I have all lied about being up for gaming tonight because they had a match set up with others and decided to hide it from me (idk why, don't play that game). Awkward calls from relatives earlier. Watched some dude 360 his F150 into a snowbank down the block. Weird night.
I think I ruined Christmas. My mom always makes us sing these Christian songs with our relatives. We did it over a zoom call this year and I just couldn’t deal with it this time and stormed off and locked myself in my room. She started crying. Also I’m 23 and still live at home and feel like a failure. Many times when my feelings come to the surface like this bad things happen. You know how when you’re a kid and you cry no one takes it seriously and they just tell you to stop? I feel like that’s still happening.
On Jan 1, 2020, I deactivated my FB, and felt better, even though I lost touch with a lot of friends and classmates as a result, since some of them were only contactable via FB and Messenger. This coming NY, another app will go for the exact opposite reason. But I hope to be brave and stick with it and not get separation anxiety like I did when I tried to delete it before. I’ve also been working on something for about two weeks now that’s saddening but necessary. Come Jan 1, 2021, things will change.
im thinking of whats the point of me staying around.. i know no one who would miss me anyway. and if theyre hurt im gone then so be it. maybe they should have tried harder. all they do is just talk to me only when they need something from me
I came here often on my old account but I can't recall the password nor do I have the energy to figure it out. I am feeling so depressed. I don't know what to do. I am going to be 30 next month and haven't accomplished much. I have depression, anxiety, add, and I have to have some other learning disability because I take an eternity to learn everything. Nothing bas ever come easily. And here I am going from job to job working trying and failing. I have been the live in girlfriend with my husband since he was 22 and I was 19. We married 3 years ago and some of his family doesn't hate me. I'm childfree because I am so poor that I can't afford to get a house for myself let alone put a roof over my own head. Some days I want a baby and other days I know that I should never have them. I am so easily angered and I fear that I will hit my kids like my mother hit me. I am just so sad. My husband and I got shoved to a new state and I am sad here. I mean I got used to it but I hate the desert so much. I miss the green of plants and rain. Everything seems so dead here. The sunlight is nice when it isn't 120 F° out but I miss my medical insurance. I finally had an adult job in an office where I was barely getting much done compared to the one other person on my team but at least I got stuff done. I miss my old job. I miss going to college and bettering myself. There are no legitimate degrees out here under $5000. I was trying to go to school, a friend gave me the $4000 to go to school but my husband was bad with money and I never paid attention because I am so absent-minded all the time that I wound up having to use that money for bills. That was three years ago. I miss believing that I would make it somewhere in life. I feel like I will never make it that I will always just barely be getting by. I want to pay that friend back.
I never knew my family could become heartless... They laugh and made a joke about it...wow
Was miserably depressed. Then my *real* problems started. Who the f@uck suddenly loses knee function at 33 years young. What kind of luck is that. I feel so defeated. Not sure how I'm gonna handle this. Before this I'd been desperately researching ketamine/ECT/TMS, now I don't even know how I'd get to the appointments. fml
I forgive my mom and we have a stronger close mother daughter relationship now.
Today I was asked if I was paranoid or a schizophreniac.. it was the icing on the cake of a generally horrendous last few days.  One of my friends was being attacked online by a bunch of rude idiots all because I shared a post and they responded to it.  I should’ve defended their position but felt unable.. helpless even. My relatives are hounding me about my depressions and offering me their input on what I should be doing and what I’m doing wrong.  “No, don’t stay inside, you have to go outside to the park.. or the store.. or the mall.  It’ll make you feel 1000% better immediately.”  I suffer from depression and anxiety, even tonight on New Year’s Eve I couldn’t be in the room with my friends because they made me super anxious with the loudness.. how am I supposed to surround myself with strangers.. oh and you know.. the Covid-19 issue.  Lost two people this last week and a third one is in critical care right now because of it and I’m being told “just go outside!”    And then to top it off I get attacked by a stranger on the internet for mentioning that I have expierenced paranormal things.  It was my first time in a long time letting something about myself be known.. but it was met with ridicule... it made me feel shitty and that person will never know.. I’m feeling so tired and.. well, I’m just going to hit this button and hope tomorrow comes soon or never does
why do I feel like crying all the time I  can't stop this I feel like I'm always on the verge of breaking down. I feel nothing just anxious all the time. I'm unable to motivate myself to do something. I'm getting constant urges to hurt myself. I don't know what to do I'm too scared to get professional help I know I need it but i dont trust anyone. Please god just give me the courage to get the help I need. I'm getting suicidal dreams, cant even sleep properly man fuck everything. Wish I had someone to talk to I pushed away everyone I have no one to hear me wish I was a good friend to others wish i could be better I'm so pathetic
I know everyone is looking at 2021 like it's going to be a big turnaround... even I had that feeling a little, but I mostly just feel too broken to move forward. 2020 was by far the worst year of my life and I don't know if I even have the energy to try and fix it. I'm fucking exhausted.
Just tired. Tired of not being good enough. Tired of people telling me to do what makes happy, when all of the things that made me happy no longer do.  Tired of being a shell of the person I used to be.
I almost called him. But then I realized I don’t have anything to say to him. I just wanted to see if he would pick up...
I cried hard today. Sudden sadness hit me. I don’t understand why antidepressants don’t prevent me from crying or being sad. The hit makes me feel life is meaningless but I hanged in there although no one was there for me. I cried for half an hour and I passed out for an hour. Now I am going to shower and get ready for tomorrow’s work, although I still feel life is meaningless. Maybe tomorrow will be better
I've been doing so much better over the last couple weeks (even though I spent Christmas alone!), but of course whenever I start feeling \*too\* good I get worried and feel like it won't stick around... I know a huge part of the reason I felt so good is that I wasn't working, and now I'm back to work.  I can also feel myself getting sucked into a "wellness spiral"... I'm not sure what else to call it, but I've done this plenty of times before, where I finally start taking care of myself a little and then I feel so good about it that I start getting obsessive and carried away, and then I burn myself out, and then I'm back to square 1. REALLY need to figure out how to avoid that because I can already feel myself heading in that direction. I just want to be able to stick with a good habit for longer than a month or two!  But at least in the meantime, even if it's temporary, it feels really good. I bought a Peloton and have actually been using it and enjoying it. I cried at the end of a class yesterday and it felt amazing.
I am becoming depressed again, pandemic and new lockdown is only exacerbating my desire to remain in my PJ's and in bed, preferably asleep. I don't feel I am of any benefit to anyone, and I am scared to apply for new jobs for fear I won't be able to actually do them and I'll further disappoint people and myself. I hate how antidepressants make me feel and know that the only ones that work are terrible to come off. My usual coping mechanisms are limited due to lockdown.
Just had the realization that at some point recently, I'd unconsciously given up on making new friends. I don't have any close friends or people I'd be comfortable hanging out with recreationally, and for years I was really insecure about that, but sometime recently I stopped caring and stopped trying (not that younger me necessarily made a huge effort to begin with, but it was still something). I don't know how to feel about this. Part of me feels bad about it, but another part of me has just accepted that me ever really having friends seems unlikely
I remember describing the darkness to someone who I thought would sympathize and understand. I remember they told me never to bring it up again to anyone. For some reason that thought is paramount in my head tonight. I can't help but feel betrayed
I was born into a reasonably privileged family. Somewhere between middle class and upper middle class. Never lacked for anything. Even so, I had issues with my parents. Even so, I was not able to make anything out of myself. I did get a PhD and worked for almost 7 years after that, but after it all went kaput, I have been severely underemployed to unemployed. Makes me depressed, this lack of career.
i really regret how i handled my ex. i wish i was more empathetic and more communicative. i never really initiated contact with her. though it felt like she was trying to make me feel bad about everything.
Ok, where I'm at. Well w holidays it's a little tough. I uh neglected cleaning my house for a month maybe...possibly less. It's cluttered. Not like smelly or disgusting. Just empty toy boxes from Xmas. Grocery bags everywhere. Toys scattered. A mess really. I know I should clean but I don't have the motivation to. Also been sleeping in more. Till like 11am/12pm. Which angers my fiance since he works 12 hour shift and works hard only to come home to a messy house and me still sleeping. But I can't sleep at night. I stay up till, let's see what time is it now 12:15am. Ok so till midnight or later. I know when I'm in a slump but I cnt seem to get out if it w/o angering him. So it ends up him yelling and me crying my eyes out. All while wishing I was dead them feeling ashamed since I would NEVER leave my son w/o his mommy. So I cry harder and he doesn't care. So when he's leaving for work he says " I love you" I reply "ok" cuz I don't believe him. Well that angered him more. "If you push me away I'll push away as well." No I didn't want you to say that. Why would you say that. I cry harder again. Then he leaves. This happened yesterday. So that's where I am guys. Been together for 12 years... yep. I'm fine... not really. But I'll end up submitting like usual and just swallow my tongue. Well goodnight everyone.
I need to check into somewhere and talk to someone. I need some help.
Ever since my freshman year of Highschool I gave up, now being a freshman in college I realize that I can’t keep trying to better my life. I keep trying to be the perfect student, daughter, sister, whatever & it’s not working. One of my wishes this year was not to cry, & I just broke it. I’m tired. I’ve only lived because of my family. Now though, I don’t see a point. I don’t want to keep smiling & act like everything’s okay when it’s not. I’m studying as a pre-med student, but how the hell am I supposed to support others in the future if I can’t even do that for myself. I’m really at my breaking point this time & im scared lol.
I’m having a really shit day and I have no one with whom I can talk about it to without getting a million questions and unwanted advice. I just wanted to come here and say it’s shit, I feel shit and I don’t want to talk about it. Just acknowledge to someone other than myself that I hate this and I feel shit and don’t think I deserve it.
Been alright, but it's hard to deal with being a failure. I try not to care, but there's no denying it hurts from time to time.
Had a shitty entitled customer _climb over_ the locked gates of the _closed_ station 30 minutes ago, just to use the bank. Then acted like it was no big deal and that I was a stick in the fucking mud, because how _dare_ I do my job!  And now there's gunshots firing while I'm typing this. I fucking hate it here. I hate the ghetto. I'm hating the negative feelings I'm developing for a certain demographic, I hate how I have to live for fucking nasty ass green paper, I hate myself, I just want to go home or die
I wish someone loved me.
Ive been trying to find low cost therapy options, but the only services available in my area have a minimum 12 week wait list.   Im feeling very desperate and I dont know how I'm supposed to cope for 12 weeks on my own
I just tried to hang myself in my basement. I got it around my neck and tied to the rafters. Couldn't go through with it. I couldn't fucking do it.   Why, when I want to die so badly, can I not finish it?
I feel very disregarded.. it makes me want to cry
I took a shower today.
New. I'm looking for a space where I can post how I'm doing and (especially) whatever tiny good/productive things I've gotten done a few times a day. I want to try to support people as well, but I'm worried I won't make a good 'accountability partner' because I tend to flake on things a lot.   Is this sub good for that kind of thing? Or could anyone suggest other subs/websites/groups they've found helpful for doing this?
today i sat in bed for 5 hours, but when i finally had to get out of bed to help my mom make dinner i had a decent night. lots of things feel really overwhelming and the whole idea of living a life as an adult and all of my choices having an impact on my future is really scary esp bc it feels like depression is making so many of those decisions for me
Most of my waking hours are spent trying to distract myself from my feelings with games or drugs or food, but every now and then I imagine a little glimpse of what it's like to be a functional person; to feel loved and to reciprocate, to have friends, to have a shred of confidence in oneself. Those moments feel like being stabbed in the gut. I need harder drugs.
I feel in love with my best friend who's made it clear she never had and never will have romantic feelings for me. she claims we would be horrible for each other anyways, but I think I'm just blinded to it ig. all ik is I guess I love her (or something cuz wtf is love anyways) but have to endure never being with her romantically
I hate myself so much
First check-in. Starting college for the first time in a while on Wednesday, I am really nervous and anxious about it, even though it's just online courses- I've let depression and anxiety rule over my life for years, but I'm trying to take my life back. I'm scared that I won't try hard enough and fail, like I did in high school because of being suicidal back then. I'm doing much better these days, but I'm still far from being okay.

Having difficulty being productive. Just going to read my emails and get back to this comment later.  Alright for the next 2 hours if I procrastinate it's going to be on writing code. At least I'll say I did something today.  Fuck I hate myself. Why am I still awake? I'm not a kid. Staying up this late is dumb.
i fucking hate not being high. marijuana makes everything more bearable. even just a little. it gives reality this extra sheen. this extra spark. this ability to just experience and enjoy life in all it's forms down to even the most mundane. life becomes not just bearable, but fun. but it only lasts so long, and plummeting back to earth i go. back to the lonliness and misery and isolation.   when high i can just be alone and be totally 100% content with only having myself around as my own company. and why not! i'm fun when i'm high! everything is fun when i'm high! but then it ends and that warmth and safety that was there is gone now. i can't have those moments back. and the substance that i do get is from the generosity of others. i can't get more myself. even if i had the ability to it would be irresponsible of me to go on a multi-day weed bender since the longer it lasts the worse it will feel to come back to earth.  i'm back on earth after my first two-day bender and i feel awful. not in a "hangover" sort of way. weed doesn't do that to me. i feel awful in a way that i'm all too familiar with. i've always been like this. i've never not been like this. the only difference is that for a few days i got to experience a world worth living in. and now that i'm not back in that world anymore, and I can't go back for who knows how long, everything looks ever more bleaker. what even is the point if i can't live in that world permanently?
I can't work. Work defines a man. I am not a man, certainly not one a women would have sex with
I think I might be legitimately dying and I wonder if I care enough to do anything about it. Since the end of November I've been having a lot of trouble breathing. Family doctor and ER doctor couldn't figure it out. Next week I have an appointment with a pulmonologist. Maybe she can figure it out. Today I looked at multiple website's symptoms for emphysema. I have a lot of the symptoms but not all. As a pack a day smoker for 20+ years I won't be surprised.  If I'm diagnosed I wonder if I'll even care. If I'll even do anything about it. What's the point? Christ, I can barely stand life as it is. More living with depression and not seeing a way out.
Feels like life never give me any break. Anxiety back at it again. My head feels like about to explode. heaviness in my chest. I’m crying with no more tears I’m screaming without voices . . . And nobody cares.
Working up the motivation to finally try tms/ketamine/ect.. I know the insurance company is gonna fight me tooth and nail because our healthcare system is psychotic and inhumane, but I’m at least gonna give it a shot
Im just tired of the time and have no reason to get out of bed. Every day feels the same and i dont feel like a person. This doesnt feel like my regular depression this just feels like im stuck in a groundhog day scenario where i wake up and do nothing then repeat.
An ex-friend who always crowed about mental health awareness and treating neurodivergents like people said I was too depressed to be her friend : ( I've been trying the "Fake it till you make it" tactic of acting happier to feel happier, but that statement really just kinda shook me.
Went for a walk for the first time in two weeks. It felt good and I'm glad to have enough energy to do that. I've been dealing with exhaustion everyday and it often feels like I'm trapped in this body. On a good day when I'm not emotionally depressed, my body will just not have energy to respond and simple tasks feel monumental. When I try to do art I find myself struggling to keep my eyes open most of the time and can only get a little bit done. It's unbelievably frustrating. I've thought about consulting with the doctor but I hate the idea of the doctor telling me I need to get my sht together and I have no one to blame but myself for this exhaustion.
Fuck this suffering shit. I want to just have enough energy to have relationships, to have fun, and be happy. But no, I have to sit here in this dying world and bear through the storm of thoughts of suicide even if deep down I know none of this is fucking worth it. I don’t even care about being happy. I just want the suffering to end. By any means.
Another dull day on this shithole planet, thank god there are pizza and video games to justify existence.  /s
I don't know who to talk to. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. Recently I realized I may have a condition that effects my sex life... I haven't been properly diagnosed but the thought of getting that diagnosis and doing the treatment scares me... something so many people do and enjoy hurts me and it's killing my relationship. My boyfriend has been patient but lately it feels like he's becoming hopeless.   I'm so sick of this. Being depressed, being anxious, feeling unmotivated and wondering if I should just die because all I want to do is sleep. Wanting to do better and treat myself better but feeling like I don't deserve it.   I keep having thoughts about suicide- where I should do it, how I should do it. I'm just so tired. I don't want to deal with life anymore, I just want to sleep.
My wife left me in August. We’re wrapping up amicable divorce where we split our things and asked nothing if each other financially. Considering the state of marriage you could say I got out of it with little to no lasting damage financially and materially, but I’ve fallen into a massive depression.   More so due to the bigger concepts rather than the loss of my partner. “Will I ever get to start a family now?”, “this was hard enough to earn her love, can I ever do it again?”, “one more rejection and I’m throwing in the towel”; you get the idea.   I’ve been seeing an MD for over ten years so I am being monitored and we talk weekly now, but nothing he’s trying prescription wise had made a dent and other then showing up for work and doing my job well I have no desire to do anything I love. It’s emotionally painful just to do sometime I enjoy and I feel no better for it.  Anyway, long time lurker, I’m sorry I haven’t participated in the past, but I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest.
22 and living in Norway. I can't pinpoint exactly when this started to happen but im pretty sure it was right before summer last year. It was as if the fire i had about life inside me just suddenly vanished. I think most of it comes from constant realization that the privileged and well protected bubble i live in does not mirror the disheartening situations and problems we are surrounded by around the globe which will inevitabely impact us all in some shape or form. Climate change, divide, inequality, preventable deaths from covid and just a foul stench of greed and individualism that I witness through the web on a daily basis has completely thrown my mind and heart in a state of emptiness. Constantly tired, unconscious, unfulfilled and just longing for some sort of reasoning behind why to continue trying to live. I have everything one could ask for from money, lover, friends, family but yet i still feel no emotional attachment to the world and its content. Its as if with this virus and the constant exposure to the outcries about the worlds problems on social media have just dismantled my ability to live. The worst is that my insecurities have grown with the inclusion of being forgetful about the simplest of things, such as what day it is, struggling to solve everyday tasks and work related problems and the worst is the growing inability to express myself. I want to believe there is light at the end of the tunnel, but as i keep on learning and reflecting about the direction we as human beings are heading towards with our growing life-threatning problems, I just cant be heartless enough to leave my children and the after to continue living in such a cruel world. I just want to erase my knowledge so i can live care-free and in ignorance again. Now im just a doomer.
They say you ought to be thankful. Today I am thankful for the heated bathroom floor I've collapsed on.
My mum's fiancee seems to have cut me out after I told my mum how I felt about my childhood and its impact on my depression. Not that her fiancee was even present then but I guess she took offence to me opening up to my mum. I spent two years saving up to fund their honeymoon so they can travel to the country I live in together. I never told them, but I know they planned to come here and I wanted to surprise them... my mum seems normal when I text her but I don't feel like I will be truly welcome at "home" again.
[One of my first posts here, but I did things. Im wore out but feel a little better ](https://i.imgur.com/XyxHbW5.jpg)
I’m tired all the time and I can’t sleep enough when I do sleep.  I’m scared my SAD is coming back full-send this year, after already going through enough I can feel the hormonal imbalances taking control of me.
Got laid off yesterday from a company I loved. Hurts a lot, feels like I just got dumped. Life just likes to go up and then back down.
Being shown kindness or disdain hurt in the same way right now. I don't know why I just can't stop crying
The only reason I can't seriously consider ending my life right now is because my apartment is  a disaster and I really need to clean it...I'd be embarrassed to be discovered in this pig sty.
I made a big fucking mistake at work and now I’m stuck being even more miserable. I’m such an asshole and ruin what few decent things I do have.
I want to step off this ride. I'm ready to be "normal". Whatever that is anymore. But my head never shuts up. There's always something wrong. How am I supposed to get it to stop? I want off.
My spouse told me they think I'll be struggling forever. That I'm not strong enough to convince myself to be ok.
I feel like my existence is nothing but obstacles. Having depression, anxiety, and ADHD, I feel like I'm just nothing but mental illness. Every single aspect of my life is affected by at least one if not all of them. Every aspect of who I am and what I do comes from them too. I just don't feel like a person, just like some sort of glitch trying to function properly despite that fact that that'll never be possible because I'm defective beyond repair. And my skin gets so dry and I get super hot so easily and my hands shake so much, it's like I'm nothing but problems. I don't even know who or what I am at this point, I feel like nothing. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore. I hate life so much. I hate everything so much. I just want to be okay with who I am but I'm just not.
God please help me it’s nights like these where I’m alone listening to my thoughts and music I worry until I can’t take it anymore and think about how better it would be to be dead and not have to deal with life what do I do
Life has been really hard during the past few weeks, and especially the past few days. My anxiety has been really impacting me, to the point of missing sleep for a number of days I even lost track of.  I came to realize the hard way (again) that I just am not cut out for friendship as most people intend it. I continue to make this mistake to try, only to find myself in the same dark place every time.   I am forever going to consider myself extremely lucky to have a significant other and one single friend (though I can't talk about everything with them), considering how impossible it seems for me to connect with other human beings without getting hurt, otherwise.  I am back to picking up the pieces. It feels so familiar, by now. I feel so alone and I feel terribly guilty for feeling it given I do have two people who genuinely care about me. It's complicated.
Why is everything so hard for me ? Why am I so weak ? Why cant i do anything properly ? i hate myself so much
When I told my therapist I wasn't sure what the things I want to do or my goals are - my therapist said I am a "parentified child". She is right 😥 I have been taking care of so many responsibilities for my parents since I was a kid and continue to.. So much I don't have time to think of my own goals or motivations for anything. Sometimes I struggle knowing what to do most days other than knowing I have to eat at some point. Is it normal to know what you want to do? I've struggled with this for a long time. Often I would just throw myself into things in order to find feeling or passion.
Why is it that people love me when they meet me and I can feel them liking me less and less as they get to know me? I’m on vacation and haven’t talked to anyone in 8 days now. I have no friends. Everyone gave up on me. It hurts so much and the worst part is I’m trying so hard but nothing works. I don’t want to try anymore. I don’t want to keep getting hurt. I don’t want to exist.
I don’t sleep at normal hours anymore. It is currently 4:21am where I am and I’m yet to sleep. I don’t think I will, to be honest. Too much stuff in my head. Honestly though, apart from the sleep thing, I’m coasting along just fine.

I'm losing it right now. im not ok, im not coping. i feel like im building a sandcastle on the waters edge. it's all for nothing.o dont have anyone to talj to and even if i did i dont know what to say. I'm just so tired
Wave of depression hit so hard this weekend. Don’t want to go to work tmrw but would feel bad bc we’re busy and that would put us behind. But i just don’t feel the energy to do anything anymore.
I don't know what's happening I just cant stop  crying i want to cry and scream so bad right  now. I cant explain what im feeling
I feel so bad. Everyone here has actual problems. I’m privileged but lazy and unmotivated. I’m doing poorly in college. What is wrong with me
I think I'm wrecking my livelihood permanently. I know I should do something about it. But I don't even really want to... I'm not even sure I can. It's so hard to "do" anything at all. I'm like a barely functioning human being, not willing to shut off the engine by killing myself but also not willing to fix anything, instead just coasting slowly along as everything breaks down inside me and around me. I know the basic steps that would probably solve this: see a psychiatrist, see a therapist, start taking anti-depressants, talk to a psychiatrist about taking ADHD meds. But those steps seem impossible... I can barely do anything outside the very basics needed to survive (and barely even that). I just want to fade away peacefully. I want to have never existed in the first place.  I hurt myself intentionally for the first time today. In an extremely minor way--so minor you wouldn't call it "hurting yourself" if I described it to you, and you'd never see it physically. Still felt like a bad step. I don't even know why I did it... I guess I'm frustrated at my combination of apathy and unwillingness to die? Or maybe I want to prove to myself that I have a real problem even though I'm not attempting suicide? Who fucking knows.  EDIT: Also, I really love being told I'm doing "unquestionably better" by people who bullshit with me for like 20 min every other week. You definitely know enough about the inside of my brain to say that, yep. I'm definitely telling you all the things I'm feeling or everything going on in my life, there's no way there are any gaps in your knowledge. Or maybe I just know you wouldn't be able to deal with the full burden, so I don't go about trying to prove that I am absolutely miserable every time you say this dumbass shit. Few things make me mad nowadays because I know I'm the one to blame for all my problems, but hearing that "you're feeling better even though you think you feel worse" shit definitely gets me angry.
Running up the walls. All this manipulation by my family and all this "programming" inside me I can't rip out. Hey but they only mean so well!   Having reached levels of being pathetic other people can't imagine. It's so laughable when professionals say "oh people with anxiety/depression may retreat from society" well maybe it's just that nobody wants to have anything to do with me.
It's not like I dont want to do anything...I really want to do things i like i want to get better.  i want to feel better. But I just cant man whats wrong with me.
I'm a shitty person. I work a job I dread most of the time but there's no other job that won't be like that. I need a break in between jobs which risks being unemployed for months, a year, especially now. Just being tired and stressed all time, sedentary and alone until I die in middle age. I don't have the energy to work 10+ hours a day, cook healthy meals, work out, all that shit, be positive all day, etc.
I'm fucking done. The only way people will understand is if they suffer from this too (and I hope they will) . People should shut the fuck up if they don't have any idea about something (in this case, mental illness).
I moved back to my hometown and i lie to everybody that i have alot of friends here. In reality they are Tinder hookups (we have no restrictions here) because i need just  someone to touch me but im so numb so i dont need anything serious because whats the point i can't even feel emotions.   I don't go to therapy anymore because at my last town they messed up and couldnt send one paper so i could have gotten benefits. Now i have just been barely eating because they messed my finances.   So i dont care anymore and havent contacted a therapist here in my hometown.  I just literally dont care anymore about anything

A research paper I helped write was just published, I'm a week ahead on my homework, and it's my birthday on Monday. I should be ecstatic but all I've done this afternoon is bummed on my bed and now I'm bumming on the couch with a beer and a distinct lack of attention to the TV with hockey on. I wish I could just feel good about my accomplishments...   I want to talk to someone about this but I always end up feeling like I'm wasting my psychiatrist's time because I inevitably end up having a good day on the day of my appointment and I'm not introspective enough to remember and talk about the times I'm not well.
I am having a tough time tonight. I think my boyfriend of 3 years has fallen out of love with me. I am disappointed in who I am. I don’t feel like I’m contributing to society much. I’m not in physical or mental harm. I value life. I just feel very selfish and unable to be anyone but the qualities he sees in me.
I don't think I will ever be happy.
Almost all I feel is fear and anxiety
I'm feeling very annoyed, angry at myself today. Weight pushing down on my chest. It’s getting hard to breathe. Letting out deep sighs.
Was ok in the morning but that has changed to sadness because of triggers.Hope everyone else doing better then I am.
First time in my life I don't even want to be awake.
I eat and am lazy and get drunk because I hate myself. And I hate myself because i eat and am lazy and get drunk.   When do I just get to die?
I'm a fucking pussy cant even cut my self properly i hate myself so much I want to kill myself please I don't want to live anymore
Is being young an age or a mindset? Both?  What if you're young but don't feel that way? What if you can't relate to other young people? What if you worry too much? What if you're missing out all the key experiences, all the milestones? What if you're so much behind in emotional development?  Just feels like I've never been young.
I suck at art no matter how hard I try. I can’t do it. I’m such a pussy for crying. I hate it I want to die fuck fuck fuck
I'm not doing anything today. Just need to be consciously writing down my thoughts.
I don’t understand why no one wants to hang out with me. I’ve been texting friends and my boyfriend telling them to do something, just watch a movie or talk, but they always end up rejecting or canceling. I know people are busy, but then I see them posting pictures with other friends and it just breaks my heart. It happens every single time. Why no one wants to hang out with me? I always try my best to plan something nice and funny, buy food that they like and stuff like that, and still they always have something more important to do. I’m so tired, I really want to be around people and have fun for a while.
still no access to actual therapy but still trying to do CBT worksheets and things because it's what everyone recommends and apparently it's the only kind of therapy that actually helps depression (or so I've been told).  and I know it's like a miracle for some people. I wish it could be the same for me. I'm honestly trying but getting nowhere. CBT honestly just feels like gaslighting myself into believing that nothing I experience is real, that nothing harmful has ever happened to me, that all my thoughts and impressions are delusional, that I made it all up.  which of course is what I've been told all my life by the people who hurt me or covered for the people who hurt me - "you're too sensitive," "it wasn't that bad," "they didn't mean it that way," etc. never in my life has anyone believed me. which I guess means I probably really am crazy.  there's just no point. I have a bad brain and I can't fix it. I just want to go away forever.
I basically gave myself serious depression by going against my doctor's advice and Its entirely my fault.  I knew it was risky. My doctor had warned me. I played guinea pig with my brain and he warned me not to. I'm manic depressive and he warned me treating ADHD with stimulants is dangerous. I went around and him and found another doctor and convinced him to prescribe to me. I ended up having a 2.5 hour long panic attack after my last dose and after quitting, I felt awful and now I feel really depressed. I don't know how long I'll be depressed, but it may last a while since I was on a stimulant for 5 whole days.   But what gets me the most was my hubris in disregarding my psych's advice and doing what I wanted. I feel like such a fool. Before this, my meds worked so well I didn't have any symptoms. I'd forgotten how bad depression and anxiety can be. Now I'm depressed and get random anxiety. I'm worried I've permanantly made my condition worse. I need this brain for the rest of my life. I brought this upon myself and I feel so dumb.
Will have to sort of host a meeting at work tomorrow, very nervous. Hate this so much. The older I get I don't get any more comfortable or less anxious about these sorts of things. It's almost like I'm still in highschool.
I never really lived without depression, it just became less over the past few years, but right now I'm back at rock bottom and WOW I totally forgot how bad it used to be.
embarrassing, petty vent: tomorrow is my birthday. which I know isn't a big deal, because I'm an adult. I've never made a big deal out of it and never wanted to (I had one birthday party when I turned 5 and never again after that) - I just always kind of hoped someone would remember and wish me a happy one.  anyway. I was planning to have dinner with my family tomorrow night. nothing fancy, just dinner at home. and I guess I was kind of looking forward to it. but today, my mom told me I have to reschedule so it would be more convenient for my sister (who works part time during the day) and her fiancé (who is currently unemployed, through no fault of his own) to attend.  two years ago, the only birthday gift I received was a card that my mom bought 20 minutes before she gave it to me, using my debit card. last year, my family canceled our plans together at the last minute and made separate plans that did not include me because they were punishing me for moving out 6 months before. and this year, I have to reschedule my "birthday dinner" so it's more convenient for my sister.  at this point, I'd rather not have dinner together at all. but that seems petty. I don't know. I'm too old to care about this stuff, but it still hurts. I want to move past it all.
I haven't given up fighting it, but I ran out of hope for living a decent life a long time ago. Still see my therapist and psychiatrist, I guess because I hate the thought of giving up. I don't put any effort into getting better though... I don't want to die, but I don't see a future for myself that doesn't end in suicide.
part of me hoped today would be different. a good day. I tried. honestly I'm trying as hard as I can. so much is out of my control. beyond my ability to fix or change. which I know sounds like I'm making excuses. but I'm doing as much as I can on my own. it just isn't enough. nothing I do is ever good enough.
There was a point in my life where I decided I would end my life after my parents died and that thought hasn’t really gone away for about 2 years now. I have some good friends, but talking about it doesn’t seem to help, and when I think about my life being over I honestly just feel better.
Last night, I wrote a to-do list for things I need to do at work today—things I should have done ages ago and are now catching up to me and biting me in the butt. Not everything is on it, and I can’t seem to push myself to even start on the first item. I’ve just been sitting here staring at the clock, my head completely void of any thoughts other than “why can’t I think?” and “why can’t I just do it?” The last item on my list that I wrote is “sink into the floor and evaporate.” And that’s just as unlikely to happen as everything else on the list it seems...
I'm technically on vacation this week, but I've been working remotely every day, because the work has to get done and there's no one to cover for me. this is work I won't be compensated for and time I won't get back.  and things keep going wrong. like they always do. I've been having nightmares about work. last night I dreamed that someone euthanized me like an animal because of a mistake I made, and in the dream, I felt like I deserved it. still feel that way.  I don't understand why I can't have one thing - just one thing in the world - go the way it's supposed to. it's just disaster after disaster, with no help and no relief. I'm so tired.
I have intense sadness over the fact that my ex-wife (who left me over a year ago) did something to her self which resulted in permanent damage/disability. I am beside myself with sadness for her. I can almost physically feel her pain and I am heartsick over it. I still love her, see.
I feel so sad deep inside. I’m so scared . I keep thinking to myself I lost everybody . My whole family stopped talking to me . My best friends stopped talking to me. I feel as if I can’t take it anymore . I’m getting evicted . Everything has been so hard on me lately and going downhill that I’m so scared to tell anyone in the fear of pushing them away. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. Is everyone giving up on me . I know I have to hide my sadness From everyone. I can’t eat. I feel like ive been losing so much weight . I feel like I can’t do normal things anymore. I laugh to take the pain away , I’m always on the verge of tears. I isolate and suffer myself in silence .
I have cried myself to sleep for six straight days, with many more in counting... the pain in my heart is beyond unbearable.
I'm quite concerned about what will happen after my parents die. Will I be able to manage my life? How will I deal with the emotions that will arise after their passing? I'm single with no kids and no SO so I need to deal with this alone.
Hi strangers, I feel lost 😔 I have a job and is not bad regular job and just started a new career on IT but I do not know why I feel this way 😔I have lost all motivation, I try to concentrate to study even tried one of those apps to regulate the use of your phone since I get distracted easily but I just get lost on my mind, I feel alone and sad and pathetic.
I can feel myself starting to spiral. My heart beats too fast for my lungs to breathe.
When I told my friend I was depressed, he kept asking what my problem was, and I couldnt say because I dont know.
Up late at night fighting hard not to spiral. I can feel it slipping through tho and can only refresh Twitter so many times before there’s no new tweets to distract you...
I never thought I would miss college but goddamn things are sucking for me right now two months after graduation. Turns out I was just using school as a distraction from what a fucking loser I am and how shit my life is this whole time. I hate this, I hate me.
I really feel awful, my life is getting worse each day, and I dont know what to do about it  Every decision I make is bad, and I dont have the energy to deal with the consequences, I'm an adult and everything but I just wish I wasn't here with responsiblities and tasks and being a burden to everyone  I wish the things I did were meaningful, leading a way forward, out of this despair but everything I do is messed up. I wish I could apologize for existing, I wish I could at least be of help.
I am not doing well. I feel empty and without happiness. I feel flawed at my very core. Most of all I am confused to why I feel this way. It scares me that I feel so bad without any reason. can’t I just be normal? Why can’t I just be content? I wish I could take better care of myself.
Whenever someone talks to me, all I can hear in my head how every single shit they say is a lie. Nothing they say and do is real. They're just stupid enough to believe it is.  I can't wait to disappear from everyone else I knew in my life. I had enough of these illusions.
Once again, another Sunday night which I have anxiety because of the workweek ahead. What's the point of having a weekend if it will only go by fast? Even if it doesn't seem it at a given moment, overall it's too brief. I wish I can have a job where it's freelance and I can do my own hours at my own time. No, I have to work for crappy bosses and management for little pay. Why should I see myself as exceptional in that way?  Also second guessing my graduate program, which has been at the back of my mind but becoming a bit more inevitable. It doesn't seem like what I had thought I signed up for, which still doesn't say too much. Plus I might not be cut out for it anyway. The thing is that my undergrad doesn't really mount much unless I have good connections, which is another thing that I dread and not cut out for to try 'networking'. Even if I did and sort of had, I still get looked down and rejected in some form either way. I'm used to being looked down on. One of the consistent things that has ever went on throughout my life.  I went from being somewhat outgoing to now depressed and trying not to go into a 'dark place'. Things go wrong but I do the same thing to just merely exist and somehow expect a different result. What else can I do?
Therapy is fucking wrecking me. When they act like "ooh, you're such a nice young person who just feels kinda uncomfortable in some situations".  And I don't know how to do physical contact. Or look other people in the eyes. Or have actual conversations. Or not be exhausted for days after every social interactions.   I have more in common with some autistic people than with healthy people, and I don't mean that as an insult but that's just how it is.
hey everyone. i never know where else to go when i feel like this so i guess im here.   it even feels hard to open up on reddit. i dont think i can type whats been going on so i guess ill just say i hope everyone feels better than they did yesterday. im struggling to find the strength to take a shower, im so tired. but i hope you guys make some achievements today
It is so peaceful at night...all alone  by myself, just some music playing.
I feel like I come to work just to cry everyday in office. Good thing I'm alone.Thought yesterday was a sort of productive (just cause I did like 2 productive thing) but end of the day realising I'm still letting things slip.  Took a week off previously but evidently it didn't made much of a difference. I'm still doing disappointing things. Times like this are when I really hate that I can still function on a daily basis. Fuck everything.
Today I contemplated suicide again. Today I’ve hurt a person whom I’ve claimed to admire all because of my pain I’m feeling. This time my thoughts hit harder then most times. I’m afraid. Current Sitting in the small Chaplin at my local hospital before the start of my shift. It’s hard not to cry. I promised myself I wouldn’t cry at work. I have a fake smile to keep up once on the floor it won’t be believable if it’s accompanied with puffy red eyes. Tonight I am afraid that I won’t be successful to help another heal due to my own pain. I’m afraid.
I hurt somebody I love. Simply.
Been struggling hard all day today at work, would rather just have sat in the dark and quite. Got home and don't waste to see or do anything, taken a sleeping pill and hopefully ill go to sleep listening to some true crime audiobook. Atleats when I wake up tomorrow another day is over and another begins.
Every once in a while. A freind from work will say he needs a ride home. So, me and him will go on a London drive before I drop him off. Me and him talk back and forth about how we both have pretty crappy lifes. The other day, he told me his sister went to a therapist and was diagnosed with depression. Although, when he asked if he could go, his parent told him no and acted like he couldnt be depressed. My depression is only getting worse. Out of nowhere I decided that i wanted to watch who use to be my favorite youtuber. I chose to watch "Doki Doki literature club" by pewdiepie. Spoilers for that game by the way. You've been warned. In the game the main character best freind is severely depressed. In the end, she kills herself. Its unstoppable unless you mod the game. Not sure why, but ever since I saw that, I cant get it off my mind. It's so horrible how it happens she hangs herself, but you can tell she changed her mind in the middle of it, cause she has blood under her nails and on her neck. Indicating that she tried to escape. When I see all of that, I can only think that I'm so similar to her. I dont think I could hang my self, but i do have a variety of guns and weapons. I know I'm not going to do anything, but I honestly cant stop myself from pondering. Anyway, sorry for the long post. I hope everyone's day is getting better.
So i really just have no one to talk to so i figured id make a post ive been struggling so badly as of late when i was 11 i started staying at a ski area in my hometown turns out the owner was a pedophile and raped me for years the sad part is there were so many times i felt bad for him when i was younger i would want to go hangout with a friend and he would guilt trip me and say how he wanted to have dinner and coffee or shit like that and would put this look on his face that would make me feel bad and most of the time i would end up staying, this went on until i was 17 and he finally went to jail because a guy who went through the same thing i did, at the time was in his mid twenties saw me with him at dunken donuts and started the process of pressing charges a year later he was in jail im 29 and until 2 years ago i couldnt even talk about this at all, i did drugs for most of my teens and mid twenties because i think i blame myself for not saying something to someone or stopping him from raping me but he was like a 8th degree black belt in martial arts i believe moi tia and others and he was in his 50s so obviously there wasnt much i could have done in the terms of stopping him so i just laid there staring at the wall wishing it would end and now i have this depression that never ends its like im living in hell i hate myself and if i didnt have a mother who loved me and a son who it would destroy if i was dead tomorrow i would hang myself right now gladly i was doing better when i started dating my ex 3.5 years ago and then i relapsed and started using again and fucked the entire relationship up because thats what happens when you do drugs you become miserable and iritable the depression also causes those things so it got worse and she started hating me i guess she was my bestfriend for 8 years before we started dating and then we were together 2 years i had decided i was getting clean because i could tell it was taking a tole on her so i started going to the clinic and got clean i thought things were getting better i truly did and the next thing i knew she said she was going to her dads and never came back here we are a year and a half later and she wont even talk to me at all so now i have no friends because either they were drug addicts and fucked me over or they fucked me over or they are drug addicts so i dont talk to them so i can stay clean im not sure why i have even stayed clean though because whats the point if i just sit here everyday sitting here in a living hell depressed and then at night its twice as bad and all i can think about is how much better off i would be if i was dead litterally i hate myself for destroying my sons childhood because now hes living with my mom because i cant function the girl he was calling mommy is gone after telling him she would never go anywhere because i fucked that up to im sitting here with tears just pouring down my face as i write this pitiful story that is this hell i used to call a life idk what to do anymore i just want to die i loved her to death im supposed to be pressing charges on the guy who destroyed my entire life but i thought my ex was going to be here for support and now shes gone and every day it gets closer to when the detectives or district attorney may call and say we are ready to prosecute him you need to come to court my anxiety and depression just gets worse i have no one to talk to anymore my ex was my bestfriend i thought she was my soulmate i thought we were going to get married and have kids and a family and now im just all alone with this weight that feels like the entire world on my shoulders i feel lost and alone constantly but even when im around people i still just feel all alone my mother is on me about getting a job and getting my son back and i cant even take care of myself she has no clue how lucky she is that im not dead right now and i try to tell her how depressed i am and she doesnt get it she says i understand life kicked you while you were down already but you need to get up and keep going little does she know how badly i would love to never feel this way again and magically be better but i cant do that i barely shower i barely eat or get out of bed because i cant function right because im so depressed i used to like playing video games and i cant even get myself to do that half the time because i just cant make myself want to i know it would probably help alittle but i just cant make myself do it idk if any of this makes sense to any of you at all but im just lost i dont know what to do and i feel like i have the weight of the whole world on my shoulders just crushing me into the ground everyday i just want the pain to end i wish i could look in the mirror and like what i see but as of today i dont like myself at all in fact i hate myself for ruining my entire life my family my sons childhood idk what to do anymore i would hang myself right now if it wouldnt kill my mom son and brother idk what to do anymore... im beyond lost and i feel so alone😭😭💔
This morning as I am getting off of work the thoughts are back to haunt me. I’ll get over him I tell myself. Like all who left and abandon me when I needed them the most. I’ll get over him. I created the being I fell for. I don’t like it when I am force to compare myself to the lady he moved on to. Perhaps she is better then me. Perhaps she is kinder then I can ever be to him. She is prettier then me. Who stops to ever look at me as beautiful. No one. Maybe that’s what he likes about her. He defended her without hesitation but I understand I was nothing to him to begin with. I was a passing enjoyment. I have to accept the pain I’ve created. None of my feelings for him was his doing. After all he was only doing what guys does best flirt and move on. I’m the stupid one created this perfect being. I’m the stupid one who fell. When will I learn? When will I protect my heart better from this world? When will I value myself as someone who is important?    To you; thank you for abandoning me when I needed you most. You left me in tears broken and scared to love another but I understand I said some mean things that I wish I never said. I hurt you with my words because I was in pain. Baby you abandoned me several time when I needed you the most. You didn’t have to love me I just wanted you to know that I was there. I wasn’t invisible. I wanted you to know that I was gonna love you regardless if you didn’t return it back. It hurt me knowing u had many girls to choose from. You made me feel invisible.  and now you left me cold and abandon. I understand I’m not important I have never been important in anyone’s eyes. My feelings were real. It was all real. I’ve lost you I only have myself to blame.

So many times during a day, I think: what might have been? I think of the opportunities I wasted and I shake my head.
I’m losing so much hair to stress
Just checking in. Every day I promise I'll do better the next. But I never do.   I think I'll just brush my teeth for now and pee. Wasted another day.
Today was worse than yesterday and tomorrow won’t be better.
I am needy and I want validation from someone else.   So of course that’s something nobody finds attractive.   It’s a loop.
I am watching way too many asmr facial videos to calm myself down. I've been job searching and interviewing. The entire process sucks. I've probably posted the same comment here before. Trying to cheer myself up
10 months ago we started a new decade. Many of us loudly proclaimed it would be better. A great year! Maybe a great 10 years! A fresh start!   This year sucked. I failed everything. I put in effort but the constant rejection is too much.   I want to turn it around for October but my motivation is fleeting. Im not well disclplined. Everything is so hard.
Well, today was the day, my favorite jidol Nijika graduated. I expected but it’s a lie if I said it didn’t hurt. I want to cry but I have class today so I’ll wait until tonight to let it out. I just have to power through it. It might be stupid to others but she really got me through tough days, idk, I just wish her the best
People get tired of me, everyone is leaving, They forget so easily, why can't I?
I did bad on my presentation, my professor stopped me before I could finish, I was so embarrassed, he thought I didn’t understand it, I did, the class tried to distract him, I almost started crying in class, I did as soon as I left though, fml
Growing up like "Displaying emotions is not allowed. Having interests is not allowed. Don't consume any resources. Don't bother anyone with your existence."
It hurts to be in pain. I wanna be dead to stop the pain. Gaping hole in my chest, eating through my soul. I’ve been having visions of myself jumping from a high rise building.  Anyone here with really bad suicidal ideation? I don’t know what to do when the urge to die consumes me. I’ve been sleeping a lot to escape from these feelings.
I wish i could work on myself and work on my looks as im constantly depressed by how i look and then ill be too lazy to not even buy a new pair of shoes which i need so badly ....sometimes i just dont care how i look bcz i dnt think anything matters in this world we are all gonna die ....but i really want to be better ...ill work on it really
Next month will be officially a year of choking through whatever I call this pathetic life. And soon after that it’ll be a year of meds and therapy.  Therapy and meds help but at the same time I feel I haven’t moved. A year of money spent on therapy and it feels like as soon as I stop I’m just going to be exactly where I started. Thank god I’m in a country where I don’t need to pay for my meds or I’d be really fucked.  What a waste of money. As if throwing money at the problem is going to solve anything.
I should not exist.

I feel like I'm living a life I wasn't cut out for. Like I've been plonked in this massive network of people but I have never felt so alone. Had thoughts today that maybe my kids would be better off without me and it scared me
I had a breakdown yesterday. But now I'm feeling better. But before, whenever I had a breakdown, my mind would be really bad for days, even weeks. It's actually nice to be in a better place. And it's nice to acknowledge that.
i feel sick i feel really sick  sometimes i really can't believe that there is a way out of this  sometimes i really can't believe that i don't deserve to suffer  i can't stop feeling hopeless i can't stop panicking
I’m cold, I’m alone I want a hug, but I truly have no one. God I want out this hurts so bad. I feel gross and unlovable and I just want to crawl in my mamas bed and let her rub my back and tell me everything will be ok.
House is so insane. Parents yell at me all the time. I'm super dysfunctional while trying to hide it the best I can, because they thought me all my life if you show any sign of weakness they will use that against you, now you got two problems instead of one. They say "it's just an offer!1" but if you don't do what they will hate you for days.   I'm so in fucking shambles. Two of the worst things for me are 1, making phone calls and 2, "lol parents did it for you and signed you up for something without asking, hf". Feeling super stressed because of the second one, having so many bad memories about it. Was especially fun in the past when I couldn't leave the house without throwing up and carefuly and to monitor my body 24/7 so someone dragging me somewhere was a total loss of control for me and so much pain and stress. Happy memories.   Being super dysfunctional and everyone is like "what do you say, you're not able to do that? You're 22, you're supposed to do that by now lol". Oh you need an internship for college? No worries, how about parents pick out a phone number of the biggest and most important cultural institution around and you just call them. Me trying to deal with fear of parents and fear of everyone else doing that cause it's. expected. of. me. Only to have the person o nthe other end telling me wtf I want, this isn't the right number to call them, how do I fucking dare to, if you want an internship you have to sign up for one six months in advance don't I fucking know that.   Fun, fun memories. I can't stand my parents doing the smallest thing in my life, I wasted so much energy pushing them away all my life fighting for the smallest bits of indepency and control. Spiraling again and selfharming.
I feel more anxious than depressed, but depression still randomly hits me when I make a mistake or try to envision my future 5 years from now. I feel so bored at work that it gives me time to think and be alone with my thoughts.   Also the overall state of the world is ruining my mental health. So there’s that. My therapist had been flakey and forgetful a lot these past few months (I gave leniency at first because I know this is a stressful time for everyone) but it got to the point where you could tell she just didn’t give a fuck so I quit talking to her.
I’ve been off work for 6 months and it hasn’t gotten me anywhere. I don’t want to go back to work. I’m 26 and living off my parents. 5 small tasks that I need to get done in a day feels like 50 and I barely get one done.
Not doing so good lately. I’ve been depressed for years, off and on medication but been on for over a year and a half now. My wife always has more issues and bad luck going on so I feel guilty that compared to her my issues aren’t as bad. She was in the hospital and the time away I definitely felt better but as soon as she comes back I’m feeling bad again. I have a good job but I hate it. Two teenagers one of which likes to drive me crazy, a dog who drives everyone crazy, and a marriage that probably should be over but I can’t seem to be able to leave, especially since she’s dealing with serious stuff. My psychiatrist suggests therapy but I’ve been to three and they all want to focus on fixing my marriage which I don’t really want to talk about because I don’t want to fix it. So I mope through every day and occasionally smoke medicinal marijuana to feel better temporarily. I don’t want to kill myself because of my kids but I definitely don’t want to live feeling like this for the next 40 to 50 years.
Not enjoying my work or anything else for that matter... got into a fight with a rude coworker today too. DEPRESSED.
I always go really quickly from motivated to fix my life to realizing how fucked everything actually is and how nothing ever really changes.   After 3 years of therapy, school, and self improvement I have nothing to show for it. My life is the exact same and my depression hasn't improved one bit so what the fuck is the point??? Why even try anymore???
No one will see this or care but everyday feels like nothing I can act happy but I don’t feel it I can’t sleep eat properly and I’m losing friends I can’t talk to anyone about how I feel because I’ve tried and all I’ve gotten is “man up” it’s hard to keep my head high when I’m insulted on a daily basis saying my hairs terrible or I’m annoying at this point I just wish I’m not afraid of death. No one understands I can’t talk and my parents are divorcing at the same time just wanna stop hurting. I don’t wanna call myself depressed because it’s such a hard subject and I don’t wanna assume my struggles are as bad as everyone else but I just can’t deal with anything anymore
Goddamn I hate my job. Itd be fine if it was normal working hours. But it's like all day most days. And too scared to quit because I have no skills and all the covid stuff. I can't do this sitting on the computer twelve hours a day, it's not healthy. It's not even helping my job standing in the slightest.
does anyone know if it would be possible for me to go about acquiring an anti-anxiety script online? 29yo american, unemployed, no health insurance. will probably have health insurance around November via ACA.  everything that is going on right now is just very overwhelming and I keep having panic attacks sometimes more than once per day... I just really feel like I need help to get through the next few months and this seems like a responsible thing to do.
Had an initial assessment with a therapist yesterday. Hope this works out.
Parents (on their own) contacted a friend of theirs who works for the job center. They organized pretty much everything already, told me phone numbers to call for new job etc. I'm supposed to call them and say I'm unemployed, would like to talk to someone and have "psychological counseling". Which is with a psychologist but not therapy, they more just ask what's the reason behind you being unemployed for a long time.   There are so many reasons I can't do this. Having so many problems with emails, phone calls, talking to people, any change whatsoever, feelings of embarrassment, etc. I can't be honest, if I'd talk to them it would be a super sugarcoated, superficial discussion. And I can't sign up for unemployment because I'm feeling so confined and so embarrassed. Any pressure is killing me.   Having tons of anxiety during the last days. Can't cope. No one to talk to.
Long story short, I displayed some 'minor' symptoms (which I knew were allergies) and had to be out for two days from work. Then after having my doctor's appointment they referred me to take the test which happened today and of course it came out negative. I go back tomorrow and honestly I am not looking forward to the fact that I'll be questioned by other coworkers as to why I've been out. I'm pretty sure they know by now since the managers also like to partake in the whole gossip trend, as that has happened before when I had to be out for other reasons.   I've also taken the depression test while at the initial doctor's appointment and scored a 6. Of course the doctor pointed that out briefly and I disclosed that I am taking medications for it. When it said about losing motivation with life and thoughts about no longer being here, I circled a zero for each. Then times like now I am reminded that it has been something occurring a bit more so than usual. I'm not happy with my job, my graduate program is pretty much a dead end to which I'll have to pay back and they couldn't give two sh\*\*s about. I don't see any way out from my current situation even though I know that it can get worse. If I were to die tomorrow, none of this would matter. I have just about nobody now since my 'friend' doesn't even want to talk to me as much anymore and I realize that I can't tell her everything. Not that I should expect her to be my psychologist but she's helped me quite a bit in the past when she could have just walked away then.  I'm just...alone. Wondering where all the time I have wasted has gone. I'll be alone and there comes a day I know I won't be able to fend for myself. I can't get close to anyone since I know they will walk away anyway. Maybe I am better off dead.

I felt especially low last night, because my best friend made a comment about me “bailing on plans”. I don’t leave anyone hanging, but if I know I won’t be up to it, I say no. She sees this as me being rude or selfish. It fucking hurts that she can’t understand the emotional toll and absolute drain on your energy a social situation or event can bring on. I just want to be understood and respected by someone who has been in my live for 20 years now. It cuts deep.   My last partner saw how often I was sleeping during an episode and called it a “lack of motivation and accountability”. I’m already down, but go ahead and kick me anyway. He said “I’ve been trying to be patient”. I just wonder if I will ever find someone who can truly empathize and not judge me.
Hi reddit, I'm feeling stressed out recently from the job hunt. My sleep and appetite are both affected. I will be meeting my psychiatrist soon for a follow-up evaluation whereby the doc will decide whether to reduce my dosage or not. I want to but I'm not sure if that would mess me up.  I have been doing fine on the meds, wonder if that's a sign that I need to start weaning off or continue.   Anyway, hope everyone's doing fine. Stay safe :'(
So tired with everything lately. Couldn't seem to focus and falling behind
I only feel like myself when I am alone in the dark...I feel like it is just me and I often end up crying to myself. If I look out of the window I can see the night city glittering with lights and I feel like I want to drive away forever and get out of everything.
I tried to talk to my family about being depressed and hitting myself for some support and basically get dismissed or get steamrolled out of the conversation about their baggage before i can actually say anything. Or I'll get the standard, everybody feels down sometimes and 'be positive' speech. I guess I dont really know where to start seeking help or what route to take
I'm crying over something stupid again. I wish my emotions weren't like this, but I also don't want to invalidate my own feelings. It's so conflicting
Hope everyone’s quarantine situation is okay. My abusive mother just said “we’re all traumatized” as if that excuses the trauma I went through last night. Jesus Christ. My depression has peaked staying at home with a narcissist sibling and toxic parents. Nobody cares about my mental health until I’m physically broke and I have to deal with this emotional shit at home. And my parents are doctors!! They still don’t give a shit!!

I had been doing better for a long time. It felt like a punch in the gut the way it hit me. The feeling of loneliness is truly one of the biggest drivers of depression. My soul felt like it was being ripped out. I’m just so very tired.
I am late for work by at least 2 hours EVERY day, for the past 2 years. I cannot wake up. Alarm clocks do absolutely nothing for me, and even if I do end up hearing them I end up laying in bed for hours before I even move. I'll be on way to work some days and just cry while in traffick. Earlier this year I was contemplating just ramming my car head on, in to a median or wall on the express way. I believe I'm a nuisance; hard to deal with if you will. I try to be easy going but my anxiety fucks my world up nearly every day.  Quite frankly, in a world where so many people have lost their jobs this year it baffles me that someone like me still has one. I feel guilty about that as well.
I want to die. I can't do this anymore. I'm tired of hurting.
Nothing like spiraling into depression in a dangerous neighborhood at night because someone at the office told you one area to work, only to find out that no, that person lied, and if you don't get to the right location ASAP despite _every_ fucking train being delayed, you'll get a miss and you'll potentially lose the job you only had for a month  I🙃 fucking🙃 love🙃 it🙃 here🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
Well this has been a shitty week. My whole house has COVID now, my mom is doing better but I'm still worried. I was/am sick which wasn't fun. I developed some weird leg/back pain. I can't taste food which is the best part of eating food. And I don't have much of an appetite. A huge branch fell in my yard and I'll have to deal with it soon and I'll have to mow the lawn soon. I had a "job" over the summer taking care of my neighbor's yard and such but now that we're all diseased, I have no income. It wasn't much but it was enough. And now my mom's job is at risk because she's missing too many days even though they won't let her back at work without a negative test.   And because of all this today I found out we might have to get rid some or all of our cats.   I'm so bored nothing is fun anymore. Video games, drawing, movies. Not interested.   Important Career Shit that I should have been doing all summer? I just can't be motivated   Politics suck but that's not really new.  The past few months have just been a big blur of suck/meh and this week in particular was extra suck.
I feel like I'm constantly looking at the people around me do all of the things I can't do. Even when they're not bragging it feels like bragging. Look at me I'm cooking meals and working out and having a fun time with friends! Meanwhile I'm just dragging myself through life and I feel so heavy.  I'm trying to stay away from social media to help with this, but I still know it's happening and everyone in the world is growing and moving and laughing and enjoying life while I stay stagnant.
Haven't been on here for a while. Have been feeling mostly good for the last, however long, I can't really remember time well enough anymore to know. But I've been good with exception of a few kinda bad nights. Tonight was a good night until just a bit ago. I feel so very lonely. My best friend won't talk to me. We got into a fight like a week ago, and ended up making up a few nights ago, went to her place two nights in a row and then we immediately got into a fight again yesterday. Both fights were kind of centered around the same issue, I wasn't there for her when she wanted to vent about our friend she's apparently into leading her on. I'm usually there for her when she's down but I sometimes struggle when it's about guys to have much to say to her, especially since I know this guy. The reason for this is honestly because I'm in love with her.   I always have been. Ever since I met her. I guess it's been a bit on and off. When she had a boyfriend I wasn't really into her, because it felt wrong, like I was invading. When I almost started dating her friend she introduced me to, I didn't feel that way for her because I thought I actually found something. But now she's single, and I am alone, like always, and I can't stop feeling this way about her. I try to find other girls to start something with, and it works to get me to stop feeling this way about her, if I'm interested in the other girl, but I'm too boring for any girls to ever be interested in.  I feel so alone. I have never had a girlfriend, I want to feel like I deserve to be loved. I want to tell my best friend how I really feel, but I know she doesn't feel the same way, she's made that very clear in the past. She has also had some kinda recent problems with other guy friends admitting they're into her and starting drama, and now with this thing with the other friend, I don't want to add more trouble onto what she is already dealing with. But at the same time I feel she deserves to know. I feel I'm lying to her everytime we hang out and I pretend we're just friends, like that's all I want. Like I'm not dying to just hold her the entire time. I don't know what to do. She snapped me back today, and with how our fights usually go, that means we'll probably be back on good terms tomorrow. I already apologized to her, but didn't explain myself. I suppose tomorrow I might have to decide if I do that. I'm terrified.
I have depression and anxiety and the two tend to take turns with eachother. Currently my depression is in the driver seat. I’m 32 and feel very behind in terms of not being married, owning a home, being an adult. I have stopped working out in the past couple of weeks and have just been laying in bed. Doing everything is hard and knowing the facts that I have so much going for me won’t help me. What do I do?
I haven't done anything meaningful in the past 5 years. I used to love to do art. Drawing, sewing, sculpting, any craft really. Ive always been depressed but I used to manage and force myself to do the things I loved. But I haven't done anything creative or even attempted in the last 5 years. I watch so many art videos and look at a lot of peoples stuff they make and feel inspired but never take any action towards doing stuff. I'm 26 almost 27 and these are supposed to be my good years right? Idk. I just want to sleep and cry. Sorry if the wording/writing is awful on this but I can't be bothered to try harder.
I'm sad. But at least I know I'm not alone. Thank you for this group. ❤️
Waiting to most likely fail a big test tomorrow, and on top of that things with my girlfriend have gotten more rocky and i just don’t know how to express how I’ve been feeling, so tired of everything in my life and don’t even care about class anymore. It feels so painful to lose interest in my major which used to fill me with hope
I pretended to be sick to get out of work. I dont want to do anything, just lay in bed all day
Please let me die, I'm so damn useless, life is just getting worse and I contribute nothing.
Still no progress finding something to do with my life. Everything feels like work, like not worth doing unless I'm paid. No passion or any such thing. I can't give up but am very discouraged. Taking time off or leaving work early feels awful when you have nothing better to do. Like at least my job keeps me occupied. Everything makes me feel sad.
My work exacerbates my depression. It’s really hard to describe how I feel when I’m there, so I’ll just say... alone. I have no one to talk to about it, besides my folks (who have heard my moaning and groaning a thousand times) and I have a hard time articulating how I feel because it’s all just so much.
In feeling so shitty right now. I cant keep it together I feel like crying all the day. I don't know what to do. Loneliness, anxiety, headaches everything is making it so hard for me to survive a single day. I try to study but I cant study more than half an hour. I just cant concentrate on anything. I want to fucking kill my self that's the best thing I can do for my self.
My mind is racing like crazy. I'm losing my mind and going insane. It's hard to breathe. I also somehow believe that I'm going blind.
I can't hold down friendships. I get tired and bored easily. There are nice people who try to befriend me but I am not a fan of listening to other people's life stories and rants. Would rather go around on my own and with my best friend (my partner)
I don't understand why I am a secret for people who say they care. I don't get why people say they care and they want to be around me or talk to me and then hide my existence,  hide what I am to them, or lie about what I am. There is such a double standard and it kills me. I beg for it to stop and I asked nicely, with anger, with tears to stop it and they say they will but they don't. Am I just good as a secret? Am I good as just an object that can be tucked away and remembered only when required? Why is respecting my wishes to just be acknowledged properly such an incredibly hard act?
wrote in here a few days ago because I was feeling hopeless. I'd finally found a therapist willing to do a consult, after months of searching, but she had no appointments for a month  after waiting almost the full month, her office called to push the appointment back. I was just feeling terrible about it.  well... the office called again today. they needed to push the appointment back for the second time.  "getting help" has become like a joke at this point. it feels like the entire system is designed to keep you bouncing from place to place, each one shifting you off onto someone else, never receiving any kind of treatment, until you finally give up and go away forever.

I feel like a reject. My "friends" are all meeting up tomorrow, but I was told I couldn't come because it was too many people... I already didn't want to go because it's a pandemic and it's irresponsible, but pretty much being told I'm the odd one out hurts. I already feel so worthless that it feels like a knife stabbed me in the stomach.
Why do I have to be lonely. Why do I have to be alone. I don't want to be alone anymore but I'm unbearable to be alone with. People have friends that love them but I have no one and nothing. I have no attachments. Besides, im unremarkable and easily replaceable by someone better. No one ever stays with me. Nobody wants me. I am wrong and supposed to die.
Social media is weird. A lot of the time is just makes me realize how lonely I am, as I see people interacting in communities or talk about their lives (even if they're open about the really bad bits) that shows they're a lot more socially active, liked, and just more of a functioning, respectable adult than I am. It hurts more when I follow accounts of similar backgrounds to me.   So sometimes I get off of social media. Delete my accounts. But then I'm just reminded about how lonely and pathetic I am in real life too. So I get back on here so I can get some kind of response from somebody.   God I'm really pathetic...
I just want to stay in bed and sleep all day. Just be in blankets and wait for the next day to come. Just want all the days to pass by. Tomorrow is going to be the same damn thing anyway, so there is no difference. Man my fiancé is really worried about me. He really deserves someone much better then some shell of a human
Everything I try seems to go nowhere. I feel like no one supports me with what I do and my friends I was close with continued their lives without me. I feel like I’m drowning and I’m watching everyone swim to the surface. And there’s no way out. I don’t even want to be associated with them I just want to feel free.
I have a psychiatric appointment in two months and I can't help myself from preparing what to say and running through the conversation in my head. It's driving me nuts. I liked it better when I could just ignore my problems.
If you want my favorite songs about depression [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4zrNL1rezdtuzlTE0AX8ac?si=380SMYP3SVi1Zx2mttuYNA](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4zrNL1rezdtuzlTE0AX8ac?si=380SMYP3SVi1Zx2mttuYNA)
I feel like killing my self every moment no one will ever understand what I go through every day.
My depression makes me lose the ability to feel. In addition, I seem not to care about anything anymore. I have a hard time working and have clothes piled up that I would normally clean up. Instead, it's "....Too tired, i'll get to it..." Then I forget about it and the rest of my day is a blur and then i realized the day ended. Sometimes I forget to eat the whole day and I don't have much of an appetite so I only eat once a day.
I am scared and I fear what will come. I returned to a self destructive behaviour. I can barely care  and the same thought is running through my head: "does it really matter in the end ?"
I'm making an escape plan to get away from my mom and brother. They are both extremely abusive, and I don't want to be around them anymore. I would like to go no contact in the future. I might keep in contact with my sister. She seems to be the most sane out of all my family members.   I'm really scared. I don't do well with confrontation. I always try to appease them, so I don't have to deal with their anger.
I hate existing.
I’ve been really worried for my close friends recently. One of my friends has been going MIA on social media because of her mental health and I miss hanging out with her so much. Knowing that she’s not doing well mentally makes me really sad. My other two friends aren’t doing well either and it just pains me to see them all struggling mentally and idk how to help them. I feel stuck and I’m scared of losing any of them because if I lost them idk what I’d do. They made me wanna keep living everyday. Because of that I’m very grateful to have them in my life but I’m more worried for them now(Ｔ＿Ｔ)
Trying to hang in there.  The next few weeks will likely be difficult.  Having thoughts of self harm and suicide.   Went to google "reddit depression" and misspelled it to "reddit derpression" and thought about what an idiot clown I am.   Finding it difficult to concentrate on my telework even, it all seems pointless.  I don't know if I'll ever find love, I'm such a loser.  Thanks for any replies.
Some days are the fuckin best, then most are today like damn wtf, I can't even enjoy those days cause I wait for shit to hit the fan
I dont have anywhere to be or anyone to go see so I just stay at home and lay on my bed all day. I feel disgusting laying around in my filth all day but I dont feel like showering. I always start the mornings convinced that I dont need to shower If Im just going to get dirty later and I could just shower at night.
I just want to sleep until my life improves, but I can never manage too because mind can’t be strayed away from the depressive state of my life. I cussed God today. A video from August 24th I watched and I was doing the same. No life improvement since then. I had a journal I was reading a month or two back. There was a July 2018 entry where I was doing the same- cussing God. God is useless, look at the ever echoing chaos of the world.
I’m such a sad, pathetic and stupid person. Just did bad in two assignments, and I just know that it’s a matter of time till I get kicked out of this program (two C+’s and that’s it).   I wasn’t cut out for this life. Even modest success isn’t something I can have. I have no one, and nothing to go for me.
I’m sad. I suck at drawing, I don’t feel like doing anything
OCD combined with depression is the worst. The OCD makes me more depressed and I have intrusive sad thoughts. At least I have a diagnosis now, that makes it a bit easier to deal with.
I found a YouTuber that makes me happy when I watch him
I'm too old to do anything
I’ve been quite depressed. I can’t find the motivation to do my schoolwork and often feel like a lazy dumbass who can’t get anything right. I feel like such an impostor when people say I’m smart because Ive lost all motivation to do my work without significant help from the internet
I haven't had friends in idk 7 years (25 now). Wasted my youth. I promise myself I'll experience EVERYTHING I missed later in life. But... I'm 25 and I been saying this since forever. Not sure when I'm gonna start experiencing life. I've literally just been living a lonely existence. When I mean I haven't done anything in life, I mean that. Didn't have a coming of age stage, didn't do anything with family. Didn't learn to be social earlier in life.  I just want to leave my home + go away to start a new life. Whilst also doing therapy because I need help, need someone to walk me through life.  Wish I had a gf, a relationship, at least knew what it felt like to be hugged.   I don't want to have a family of my own until I get to experience everything I missed out on.   I say I feel like I changed as a person but it's pretty small amount , I'm still the scared little boy who doesn't do anything + overthinks + spends ages doing something.
So much anger
Today I said a prayer to no one in particular. I've never wished so desperately to just be able to live my life.  My wife and I are expecting a daughter in April. If anything could lift my spirits it's this, what we've wanted for so long. But all I can think about is how horrible our world is now, how much worse it's going to get, how gleefully stupid, selfish, arrogant, reckless, cruel, greedy, and self-absorbed Americans are (myself included) and how selfish I've been for chosing to bring a new life into this vile world I'm too weak to protect her from. If I were her I'd never forgive me for my failures.  People need me but I'm just so god-damned tired all the fucking time. Everything and everybody wants something from me that I feel incapable of providing. There is nothing left of me to give to anyone anymore.  I am an empty rotting husk hollowed out by guilt and shame.  I don't even have the decency or energy to kill myself.  If anyone is listening, heaven help me, I am beyond help or hope. Please end me. Let my daughter not have to see what an awful shitbag her father is. Let her grow up in the blissful ignorance of wondering and projecting whatever sort of person she wants me to be over what I really am.  I can't live like this any longer.
I have no idea why I insist on over complicating everything
Tried to do something for myself but my family had to come in and ruin it. Sports in general has basically been ruined for me. My family are loud and obnoxious, they don’t care to give space and are constantly judging. I just wanted to do something nice for myself, but I can’t even get that without them joining with the same terrible attitudes.   It makes me tired of living.
Should be grateful I’m functioning like everyone else  I’m melting on my bed rn It’s tiring, why? Why am I not good enough
It's supposed to snow on Tuesday when I'm supposed to have my second therapist appointment and just the thought of potentially having to cancel it is making me fucking miserable. It's gotten so dreary and cold I just dont think I can go on like this. I'll be lucky if I survive this winter. Then again I'll be lucky if I somehow end up dead considering the fact that I already tried suicide and I couldnt go through with it for some goddamn reason. Just hell punishing me for daring to breathe by making me feel torment for 40+ more years.
How do you guys learn to not take things personally? I got into a stupid fight with some friends of my partner’s about politics and misinterpreted a comment that I thought was derogatory but wasn’t intended that way. It also seems like they’re indirectly insulting me by saying I ‘took the comments too personally’ but that in and of itself is me taking it personally.  Honestly I just feel like a POS and kinda wanna die because now my partners friends probably hate me and I don’t know what to do to amend shit.
I am suffering general spike of anxiety this weekend. I still feel like I am just spinning my wheels and wishing I could do better.  I wish there were a way to check out and just disappear for a while.
I’ve had a relatively good day today. Hope I will stay the same tomorrow.
I genuinely  might give up. There's so much weight on my shoulders. Nobody listens to me. My mom thinks i'm faking my depression. I want help. I'm missing 65 assignments in school right now because I can't get out of bed.
I AM STILL HOLDING ON TO IT everything is under good control, but not my system 2. I’m barely living, days passing by like it’s, it’s, not mine.
I’m having a shitty day. I’m scared and I’m shaking and I don’t know what to do. I want to talk to someone but I’m too scared too. I want a hug so bad and I want to wake up from this nightmare. I want someone I can hold and tell me it’s all gonna be fine, but that’s not happening anytime soon so I’m just gonna vent here.
I’m feeling ok right now. My depression is far from the worst out there and I can function normally and be happy most of the time. I have a few very close friends and even more acquaintance friends, and they all help me stay grounded. Whenever I start to think about what will happen once my senior year ends and we all go our separate ways I get that awful pulling feeling in my chest. I’m without a doubt going to follow my best friend to college. Reading all of these posts from others who have it much worse than me makes me feel terrible about myself and I start to think that maybe I’m just faking the depression and that I’m really just a lazy high school kid. I know that I should be all thankful for what I have and stuff but everything I see here just makes me feel so hollow. I guess I just need to fake it? It’s been working well so far. If you read all of this word vomit, thanks. I don’t know how bad it is for you but I hope it gets better.
Life isn’t going well, I’m thinking of killing myself.
I don’t feel good about myself, I feel like I’m the best I can be and it still isn’t anywhere near the person I want to be. I feel like a loser. I used to go out and hang with friends with no worries at all. Now I find myself sitting in my bed in my messy room and not doing anything productive. I wake up and do my school work and then just go back to bed. I don’t have anything to look forward to. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to be here. I don’t feel like I’ll ever be the person I want myself to be.

I want to, I don't know, start over or something else.
I’ve been trying to keep a diary. Get the bad thoughts out of my head and onto the pages. I have lots of homework to do and I’m doing it! But very slowly and I don’t feel happy or less stressed when I complete it or make any progress on it. I try to make deadlines for myself and if I can get out of bed to meet it I’ll be fine, if not then I’ll wallow until I finally brush my teeth and shower at 10:00am. I’m starting to feel numb, nothing feels worth anything and I’m starting to forget what I actually like and dislike.
I'm seeing a therapist for the first time in my life after being some level of depressed for probably the past 5 years or so. This summer it got pretty severe so I finally reached out.  I have to say, I'm certainly not magically cured or anything, but I honestly had really low expectations for this, but so far my therapist seems really cool and is actually going a good job of gently identifying where my depression changes how I think about things in ways I didn't even notice. She calls it "gently observing" and tells me not to worry about it or try to change anything or get upset about it for now, just to try to observe some of my own thoughts so we can talk about it and work on fixing it later.  It's nice so far and I just wanted to share.
Keep thinking about decisions and incidents that happened ages ago. Just can't move past them. Keep thinking about my miserable failure in my career, and an empty future. Wouldn't mind if I die; wouldn't have to suffer through it all.
My Body Dysmorphia is getting worse. My therapist is having me record my meals because I've been severely undereating.  I recovered from an eating disorder years ago, and gotten to the point where looks/appearance/weight didn't rule my life. I saw the inner beauty in myself and others.  Now I browse looks-focused forums and subs and even though I know it's just feeding the toxic thoughts I find it so hard to look away - I keep going back to it.  My body is changing and I don't like it. I don't want to be sexualised again, like I was as a teenager and young person.
Bascially using internet as a drug just to escape for one moment. Can have a somewhat stable mood most of the day but the moment I'm turning the pc off and going to bed I'm screaming so hard.
I feel completely alone here on this planet. I feel as if im nothing and that i cant be nothing. Alla my dreams have been failed and im just nobody, fitting in nowhere. What can i even live for?
I don't want to exist.
Ever since I started working, I feel way less depressed than I used to, but I don't feel happy either.   It's hard to snap out of putting all my hours into my job. The moment I do, I just enter some negative spiral of thoughts, or end up not interested in anything. I can't seem to get myself to get in or out of bed, and my eating pattern is all over the place.  It feels like I just want to be sad again, because at least that's familiar.   I'm not sure what's going on.
I am a complete fuck up. I wish I was brave enough to stand up for myself. I was wish I was smarter so I could just succeed. Instead, everything is just a struggle or I feel like I am going no where. I wish I would just disappear from existence.
Was feeling hopeful for once in a long time, but now I showed up for work... At the wrong station. And now I'm gonna be late getting to my actual destination, my whole work schedule for the day is fucked up, and I'm likely gonna get written up for it.  I'm trying so hard not to burst into tears in public, why did I ever think things would change or go right
My therapist said that depression is caused by a failure of growth, but doesn’t depression itself cause this “failure?”   It all seems convoluted.
I'm not doing well. Life is lonely and going downhill quicker than I'd like it to. Not sure how much longer I can deal with that.
Lol got nothing clever or interesting to say but I sure do wish I was dead right now
Life situation is deterioating.   Fake friends doing anything to get to me ("oh hey, ill say ill buy something for you, then say i cant and when i tell you im buying a car im actually buying two OLD COD games lol")   When i try to be alone people come around, snd when i try to be social people are non receptive/assholes.   I should just fucking burn this place down and become a homeless serial arsonist.   Id hate to be taking out my anger on others, but the whole world takes out its anger on me and does it more so because i dont hurt people.             My only solice in all this is one of the people involved doesnt know how much their girlfriend secretly is using them.   Im sitting right next to him.   Think imma keep it a secret, slight for slight
I feel overwhelmed just texting parents and putting away clothes and getting groceries and depositing some money.  Talking to roommate since I missed depositing his cheque.
I cleaned up my depression nest today. Still feel like shit, but at least I'm not sleeping in it tonight
I just need to write this down so I hopefully gain some new perspective. To start, I feel depressed, long hours where I know I matter and all but am just down and sad. I think I want to live but the thoughts are there about maybe ending my story as I don’t really care about the end of my book. Some perspective about me, Iused to play college basketball but now just go to school and try to keep a positive attitude but sometimes it’s slips and I feel seething rage and I feel like in a wrong situation I really could hurt someone. The only person I think it is okay to hurt is yourself as you are you and the only one capable of making decisions for yourself. I get the slippery slope here and am not a backer of suicide but I do have a hard time grasping why it’s not a legitimate choice you should be able to make. I know I’m not able to see the future or say it’s the right decision but I really don’t feel like wasting away, waiting for the day when I’m 65+ to die. I’m relatively young still, just turned 22 but I’ve had a fair bit of life experience from abuse as a kid, used a lot of different drugs(am 100% sober writing this), to being stabbed and getting 10 stitches. I know life has ups and downs but I don’t really believe that the highs are worth the lows tbh, and the main reason I haven’t already committed to my plan are 2 of my family members but 1 is my drunk of a mother whom I love but have lost a ton of respect for when I get drunkenly reemed, reminding me of when I used to get beat then have my father verbally abuse my and my brother and I’ve kinda just stopped feeling tbh it just hurts too much.
I'm an awful mother and I am ruining my life daughter's life  A six year old shouldn't be saying things like "I'm the worst kid ever" or "it's okay, mom, it's my fault"  I am fucking her up and she would be better off with a dead mother than what she has
Made the mistake of lurking the ex online friend's Tumblr. They're happy with their new fandom friends and forgetting about me it seems. What is worse is that their birthday was the day before mine (it's this month) and I was sending them presents. I always got a thank you. Last thing I sent them before COVID was an Easter card and I heard nothing, not a peek since then. Then months later I found their 'new' Facebook that they didn't even bother adding me on. I constantly worry what I did that was so wrong.   I wish I could move on and find others, but being a boring loser that does not belong anywhere, does not connect well with others does not go down too well. Loneliness is unbearable and seeing others around with me with their friends just makes it worse.
Can chocolate help??  I've gotten a lot of candy from trick or treating and I heard chocolate can increase your dopamine and help u feel a bit better. Hopefully, some sugar can bring me out of this feeling for at least a little while
This is my 3rd time crying my eyes out before bed. Just thinking of all the mistakes I’ve made and how lost I feel in this world. I crave the peace and happiness it seems so many people in this world have. Feeling like I’ll never get it right. This hole in my heart has left a void within me. I paint my smile on before work everyday and live within a hollow shell of what used to be me.
I'm tired I've been crying.
Some people fucking suck.   Every argument has to make you look smart or its a fight, and you always gotta have the spotlight on you even when people dont care?   Coercing people to get attention is so fake, i guess that's why the fake love it, even worst is after they sit there and try to attack you for 3 hours, they wonder why you dont sit with a group of empathyless subhumans   Pray for me while i sit and listen to someone try to explain how an adola link is similar to a stand arrow and would produce the same powers while calling Dio the goddamnded dod, and then trying to be annoying when i dont give a fuck about a CRAPPY DELUSIONAL EXPLANATIONS.   I wish i had better friends.   And thank you to anyone who reads this.
My eyes are so tired but I still can't sleep. Everything is so terrible
Second big heartbreak of the year just happened today and I am really fucking tired of never being anyone’s first choice, never being anyone’s person, never good enough.
I wake up screaming every single morning. Only person I can still talk to despite extreme anxiety, my former therapist, can't tell me a word. And in my head if she can't tell me anything anyone else can't either. Torn apart between selfhatred, apathy, despair, escapism and being irrational.
Sooo I have been experiencing sleeping problems lately. For the first time, I put on a diffuser last night, limited my screen time and meditated before bed. It worked really well and I was knocked out not long after.   I need to work more on limiting the screen time. I newly installed a screentime tracker app and found out that I spent 1/7 of my week on my phone. If I include my time spent on my desktop, I would have spent a significant amount of my time awake in the digital world.
My therapist told me she is raising her rates. Been $50 and after January she is going to $175 with no negotiation room since I’ve been getting sliding scale and she is no longer offering that option. I don’t have health insurance and am gonna have to find someone new and who can accommodate no insurance and decent rates. I’ve been seeing her on and off since 2014. I understand she needs to raise her rates so she feels like she is compensated fairly, but it feels like she’s closing the book on our relationship, because she certainly knows I can’t afford that.
Staving off depressions and loneliness by drinking my days away.    Starting to think I should give up on being happy, and just become desperate to survive like everyone else.   Gonna try online dating, lets hope i dont get my head chopped off
i just feel really awful today. and i dont know how to cope with it :( i feel alone
Damn i wish i had friends that weren't assholes because they threw their lives away.    Shouldnt expect much for a person who cant even find a stable place with a kid and hangs out with someone she says is bad for her.   Oh well, here's hopping talking to people online pans out
I’m tired to living. Just tired.
Just drink some water, get some rest! I get so irritated when I hear this advice.
I’m so alone. I just want this one person to love me and give me affection. That’s all I want. It’ll never happen.
i opened up to someone and they laughed. that’s about it
I don’t enjoy being alive, I just don’t want to die yet. Everyone says shit about potential but if I haven’t been able to find much joy in two decades, attention seeking, and medication, I dont know how I’m going to survive a lifetime. I already hate it.
Also its weird watching two peolle ave a conversation with each other that neither are invested in.
I don’t even want days off anymore. I have next to nothing. Barely see friends anymore, so many things I can’t do because of covid, just try to exercise when I dont feel like shit. I’m sober so I can’t just numb myself with drinking. I think I’d rather work every day.
Reddit always pisses me off. I don’t know why I bother interacting on this hive mind site
physically can not cry anymore
I got Covid 12 days ago. Thankfully the symptoms have been extremely mild, but it has robbed me of my desire to work. I've been working on a project diligently for the last 5 months. Suddenly it has started to seem like a mountain.
I didn't do a single thing today and it's already afternoon. I feel that another slump is coming because I have been slacking in self care, which is a major symptom. So I took a quick shower (didn't bother to wash my hair) and brushed my teeth. Gonna have a cup of chilled coffee later. I'm tired all the time for no reason; I do nothing much.
Really wanna disconnect from life for a bit. People starting rumours and bullying, even my own family participates in that. I can't deal with it anymore. I've been way too fucking fragile lately.
Iam always on the verge of crying but cant shed more than a couple tears. I just want to break down and let a good fucking cry out. I feel anxious all time, I mentally beat my self over small shitty things nothing gives me the sense of satisfaction even if i do something productive or complete my goals i feel like a fucking trash. I just dont know what to do, my mind is filled with negative thoughts i just cant get my shit together i try so hard but i just cant. I feel like giving up everything sucks man.
Things are at the point where it feels easier to become nothing rather than invest in decades more dishes, laundry, and doing things when you have no energy or interest. There are so many limitations on my body and my mind that it's hard to see a future that isn't steady decline.
I just want to stop suffering so much
Have an interview later. Uninterested and wish to hide in a hole. Currently in bed feeling a bit suicidal.
Went a few weeks feeling not the best but pretty decent. Unfortunately this week I fell into a massive depression it’s completely taken over and I’ve experienced new things I never had before. For one, the newest feeling last night was that I wanted to feel pain. I wanted to be beaten. I’ve never felt that before so it was weird and I kinda just mentally noted it, and it was a pretty strong feeling to like I would have paid a group to jump me. So idk what that’s all about. And this morning I woke up super hot and wanted to die. The first thought when I opened my eyes was I wish I was dead. That isn’t new to me but the extreme want was. Now I’m at work and feeling a little better but just no energy, the usual. Anyone else experience the wanting to be hurt thoughts? This is new to me.
Finding everything rather draining at the moment. Definitely been having depressive episodes for most of the year but I also have SAD, so I'm feeling a lot worse now. Trying to self medicate on a cocktail of vitamins and try to get out when it's day time, although it's hard when im pretty much working from home full time. Also I have nothing to look forward to outside of working, so everything feels like a drag.   I'm finding every little thing so stressful as well, even things that would normally motivate me, I'm just not feeling it at all. Hardly seen anyone at all outside of my household for months, not because of covid, just because I'm self isolating due to feeling so crap. Its becoming too hard to hold a conversation with anyone so I try and avoid situations where I actually need to talk/listen to anyone. Also, I'm usually too physically unwell, getting bad headaches most days.   I'm supposed to be looking for my first house and honestly, it's just too much. The alternative is to stay in a flat that's falling apart and I pay too much rent for. I can't move in with anyone else in meantime because I need my office space.  Just want the winter to gooo awaaayy!
"Allow others to help you"  _me, drags myself to therapist, one more time_  _therapist doesnt say anything_  "Well that was helpful. Apparently there just isn't anything to say! I'm worse than before haha"
Really could use some support, or someone to vent to

I have to move again in a week. I need to socialize, I need to feel human. I don't feel human. I don't feel like a person, I feel like a shell of a thing that's just meant to keep pushing forward. I keep reminding myself of what I might get to do. The idea of that is all I have right now.  I wish I could've had a partner or romance, but I don't get to do that because the world is fucking ending.   I don't want to move. I don't want to stay. I wish I could drink but I can't my hands on any booze. I keep thinking about walking to the store to get NyQuil.
I feel so far behind everyone in my age group (26-30). I don’t feel as mature as other women.  I’m always anxious and scared. I feel stupid when I try to make simple conversation with people. Especially men I’m interested in. I cry all the time.  I just really need a hug. I haven’t had real, significant human contact since February.
Existential crisis time, why am I majoring in theatre, oh yeah I remember why now. Fuck college though
I feel like such a failure, I keep missing due dates and my profs don't take late assignments. It's so demoralizing to see myself fuck up time and time again.
TW: weight They weighed me at the clinic today. I have lost 22 lbs in less than two weeks. That's 50 lbs since June. It's not like I'm starving myself on purpose, I just can't keep my appetite up. Not only does everything taste like cardboard, but just the smell of food makes me sick. They give me these meal replacement drinks. They're not bad, but one is my limit. The doctor says it's better than nothing and to take small steps. Which is a good thing, because at this point I can barely walk.
My biggest fantasy at this point is to suffer some kind of head injury and become an amnesiac. I'd still be a worthless piece of shit but at least I wouldn't have any idea of who I am or remember all the reasons why I suck.   I just want to be a different person. Fixing my problems didn't seem to make me happy so that means that it's me who is the problem.
