*clutches her pearls* When have I ever referenced anything about sexytimes? 😂
I feel like my #5 top thread poster may be skewed from modding
Shout out to all my frands on here!
16k gifted items! 😯 As a newbie, this is such an awesome display of the love humans are capable of. 💌 It's really a wonderful group.
Can I put master of filters and angles on my resume now??
I’m making this list for this year!!!!   What are these secret threads???? 👀
yay! 8th activity poster! yall love puzzles lol
phew... managed to skate by again without being cool or popular XD
u/FictionEf you made a list twice! u/lbarnes76 you made a list!!
Oh my I made quite a few,yup mamna is a jibber jabber jaw🙃😅 interesting stats,great job everyone!!
40 selfies?! aw hell
Aww, people liked my face last year! ❤️
Wow I’ve been busy
Most sarahah and selfies?? I can dig that. 😎🕺
Second most welcoming I am cool with, but second most referencing sexy time? Whaaa?? 😂 I think I responded to one, *maaaaybe* two NSFW-type contests when I first joined, but that's about it. I'm in shock. lol
Thank you /u/Hsks23 for adopting us noobs!!
I’ll thread your karma if you know what I mean 👀
Omg this is so cool to see a sub broken down like this!
I love that I'm on the messed-up sleeping pattern list. 😆
I feel like some challenges have been laid. Lol!!
waoh cool! 🌸
I feel famous welcoming so many people :D
These stats indicate that I only missed one day in the sub and only two selfie Sundays. Guess that means I have goals for this year.
some of those stats are preeeeeetty cute
I *do* enjoy some Sarahah
Oh no........ now you know how bad I am at sleeping lol
It's fun to see lists like this. 😊 And I love the variety of subjects!!
That was a fun read... but what's a secret thread?
Sad, I made the no sleep list last year, but not this year.  I'll have to try harder in 2021
This was awesome! Can I add a category for most amazing event? What the mystery Redditor did gifting so many people so many awesome things!
This is a fun read! So many unique categories!!
hahaha what sleeping pattern?! that is superb.
Wow, for being pretty inactive the last couple months... I still ended up on a few lists. 😳
I skimmed over this without paying a lot of attention when it was first posted. I see I was here talking the most about sexy times. I am guessing that if most references to tacos was one of the categories, I would have been close to the top of that list!
Love seeing these every year!
Tasteecake never sleeepssd
This is really neat to see, I love the different categories. ♥
I'm surprised I made it on some of the lists I did (ie. selfie karma... I rarely post), but not really surprised with the secrets replies and being a potty mouth 😬😝
🤣
I don't see any other mods on that list pal
Possibly
You are the best summoner!
I'm curious about that too!  I'm also looking forward to try to make the list this year. 😊
I really enjoy when I'm able to catch one of your puzzle posts!
oh cool!! I must not ever sleep 😂
Well, that’s accurate. I don’t sleep... much. 🤭🤦🏻‍♀️🤣
and each of them a gift
Uhm, but how can we not?
I like your face all the time. 💜
I'm in shock too. I LOLed when I saw you got 2nd. I'm 9th and wondering what the heck I said.
Totally. I apparently missed two selfie Sundays. Gotta do better this year.
I'm right with ya!
Oh yikes, it's posted a few times per year, and you can vent anonymously to a bot that then posts it for everyone.    It tends to be a drama-filled popcorn event
I think it may have been my first year on this sub when I fell near the top of that  lack of sleeping pattern category. I was on night shift and hardly slept.  Now I am on day shift, guess what category I landed in?  middle of most sexytimes talk..... I am getting less of that right now too.. wtf?
Hahaha
No you don’t.
Haha you are very sweet!
Aww. ❤️
Right back atcha! ❤️
I loled when I saw you got 9th too. I was like, "Whaa?" 🤣
🤣
I love popcorn!
🤣🤣🤣 if life has taught me anything it's that sexy time talk can come at any time.
But i want to!!!! 🤭
🤦🏻‍♀️🤣
> at any time.  At all times!
I want you to, too!! Lol. Another reason I’d be a crap parent, I sleep A LOT!
Oh stop! Not all kids require the sleepless parent, like mine do... pretty sure most don’t, so you shouldn’t hold yourself to my standard 😝💜
I will always hold myself to your standard lol. Just kidding. I’m in a silly mood. What are you and kiddos up to today?
Omg! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣 silly is fun! ☺️🤣 We’re just prepping for the arrival of our Spring chicks 🐣 and waiting for warmer weather to set-up pool.
Oh fun!!! Little cutie chicken babies. Fuzz balls. That’s fun!
Yeah. I can’t wait!!! It’s been a while since we’ve had any. 🐣

Welcome to todays thread! If you haven't been around before, here is a quick explanation for you to enjoy!  The Daily/Nightly thread is a place for you to enjoy the company of your fellow RAOAers in one place! This thread is for many awesome things such as:  * Sleeping well * Waking up late * Getting brain probed * Tacos  Plus many more fun things!  So come on in, grab a blanket, and enjoy the company.  **QOTD: What was your favorite cartoon growing up?**
Pssssst. You. Yeah, you! Remember you are awesome at being you. No one else in the whole world can do that like you can. I'm proud of you for getting through another day even when it is hard.  My inbox is always open if you need a friendly ear, place to vent, virtual hug, or just some silly conversation
-takes anxiety pill with iced coffee-  *im so healthy*
QotD: not cartoon, but Fraggle Rock. I loved that show.   Hey, hi. How is everyone? I've been a little mia lately. Trying to focus on mental, emotional, and physical well being. Hoping to get back into chatting more. Tell me something good!
Good morning everyone! Woke up way earlier than usual today. Which was ok cos I checked my email and I won a book giveaway from good reads today. It’s wild women and the blues. So now I must wait to read it then review it. I can’t wait! I have 1 week left to do for my bullet journal for February then I start March. Hoping next pay period I can get a new bujo. I noticed Walmart is way cheaper than amazon for them. Plus I can get my seed start for the end of February to start my seedlings. I also sense possibly bored baking is going to happen to make some keto/gluten-free snacks for the house. Good thing I have Pinterest!  Dinner is slow cooking making pot roast which with this chilly weather is perfect!  QoTD: voltron
I'm around, I'm alive, working on some stuff.   QotD: Pepper Ann
How is everyone's day going? Everyone doing well!?    I have a lot of work for today and then going home to cook a large dinner for the fam lol. I cant wait for the weekend though! Lots of fun activities planned with the kiddies
Hi guys. Long time no visit! The end of last year was rocky, to say the least, but so far 2021 is going well and I have the emotional energy for things I used to enjoy. Definitely including this, and planning a contest for this week. I’ve missed having contests ha.   Favorite cartoon was Gummi Bears. I still want the bounce juice!
My dog wouldn't eat his breakfast until I got up from bed. As soon as I left my bedroom, he ran over to it and inhaled the kibble in his bowl.   QOTD: Spongebob Squarepants.
Man I love tacos 🌮   Busy busy week ahead! Whoo! I’m so hungry.
QOTD: What was your favorite cartoon growing up?  Code Lyoko and Totally Spies!
How's everyone's day going? I've never commented on one of the hangouts before.   My day could definitely be going better, but one step at a time, ya know?  QOTD: Tom and Jerry!
QOTD: It varied, as I got older obviously. I loved Scooby Doo, TMNT, Arthur, Rugrats, and Pokemon though (and probably some others I'm forgetting).  I mentioned a couple of weeks ago that I applied for a promotion at my job. I found out on Friday that I landed myself an interview, which is really exciting! If I pass that stage there's another interview but I'm trying not to get ahead of myself haha.
Good morning you amazing people!!!! Hope everyone's Tuesday turns out to be an amazing one. I must of not slept well last night, I am really tired today.  QOTD: Darkwing Duck or Recess. And Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[Taco Tuesday! ](http://imgur.com/gallery/CwZ7DXC)  How is everyone's morning? I'm still on the happy high of seeing my best friend on Sunday! Not seeing them for almost two weeks was just painful, especially since he's basically my roommate lol.  I tried a new method of making eggs this morning and I'm so disappointed I didn't get any photos.
good morning everyone! 🌸 feeling a little guilty for making a difficult choice between my health and a specific career path, didn't realise that the career (medical) i was trying to go after was going to interfere with my health that badly.  on the bright side, i get to focus on my true passion which is design and arts and can work safely at home so that is something to look forward to! 💗 hope that you all have a lovely day, don't forget to stay hydrated and remember that someone loves you! 🌸
I turned 20 today ~~and feel kinda old lol~~ It's nice that today's class didn't start super early though since I stayed up late last night \^\^;  Dyed my hair yesterday, glad I didn't waste time with the red since it doesn't exist unless you look *very* closely, the blonde showed up though so that's good since the ones I already had were fading  QOTD: so many, it's hard to pick ;; some would be Sonic X, Pokemon, Naruto (why was I watching this when I was little lol), and Rugrats?
Was in a terrible mood yesterday feeling like I'm not doing enough not good enough just exhausted trying to have a better day today
Hey everyone, How is everyone? I hope you’re all having a great day!!  I started a new thing, again, haha. I started bartending/mixology school, so it’s a good step for me as I want to have my own cocktail bar some day. I’m now anxiously awaiting my stuff to come in the mail so u can start, it was back ordered but it finally sent!  I’ve had to call in sick, even though I work from home, feel like crap. Not sure what it is though, could be the horribleness itself, could be an infected wound that’s making me a bit ill. Have to wait and see the results unfortunately. Hopefully I’m well enough to work again tomorrow (fully working from home, so no matter what it is I can’t spread it to someone else). It’s awful though as I don’t go anywhere, not even the supermarket, I just walk the dog in a spot where there’s nobody else, I don’t even go on an elevator when there’s someone else. So I don’t even know where this came from.
Glad Tuesday's over to be honest, always one of the worst days at work for the week.  QOTD: Depending on what stage of my "growing up" (I'd say getting older, not growing up) would probably give you a different answer.  TMNT (Original Cartoon), Rugrats, Ahh! Real Monsters, progressing all the way through to Family Guy & South Park.
QOTD: Had to be Teen Titans. That was my jam when I was younger, loved everything about it. I want to say Batman: TAS but I don't actually know if I saw that before Teen Titans or not because I don't remember if they were still showing it on TV when I was watching cartoons regularly. But both of those pushed a lot of my geek interests!
My favorite cartoon growing up is a toss up between Jem and the Holograms and the Gummi Bears :D  How's everybody doing this morning? I woke up to get my wife off to work early this morning and decided to throw some  tamales I made and froze last month in the instant pot. They are pretty yummy, no filling as I just made them with leftover masa back in December, and topped them with chili and cheese for my breakfast..
Good morning!  I'm working from home today and trying to call insurance representatives.  After getting transferred around and put in hold for 30 minutes, they hung up......how's your morning going?  QOTD: Courage the Cowardly Dog, it was terrifying and I loved it.
Just got my second covid shot. Now I'm waiting for my counseling check in. Then I get to go back to baby girl. Good day!!  My favorite cartoon was Dragon Tales.
Good morning everyone! Wish I could have woken up late today but it was back my early schedule. On the plus side, that meant I had some time for writing and gentle morning yoga. Sending you all positive vibes for your day :D   QOTD: I really loved non-cartoon shows, actually, like Mister Rogers, Barney, and Full House. I did like Pokemon and Digimon though, and Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball Z when I got a little older.
It's been a good morning. My students, almost all of them, got better on their tests today.   QOTD: I liked Doug.
Mmm breakfast tacos 🤤. My plans for today are to do more resin molds and clean my room. Lets see if it happens. My favorite cartoon growing up is adventure time.
Yay! 3 user(s) grew one year older today! Happy Birthday to:  * /u/RAOAutomation * /u/forgiven_obscenity * /u/doobadedo  Since their last birthday, 50,767 threads and 1,536,091 comments were posted on RAOA!  Make sure you have your own birthday correctly entered [here](https://raoa.tech/settings).
QOTD: oh man, talk about a tough choice. The Smurfs, JEM, Garfield and Friends, Muppet Babies. It's too hard to pick just one.  Have a groovy day everyone <3
QotD: Pokemon and Sailor moon! I taped over my dads South Park vhs tape with pokemon episodes and he was mad forever 🤣
Hi friends! Hope you all are amazing!! Have a great tuesday!  QOTD: Powerpuff girls for sure!!
Ahhh I loved so many. Scooby Doo, Powerpuff girls, Ben 10, Pokémon, Digimon and Sakura!
QOTD- I loved David the Gnome although I don’t remember a ton about it.
Hi and good morning everyone! How are you doing today? What's your goal for the week?  QOTD: I loved Ed, Edd, and Eddy growing up.
Gooood morning everyone! I’ve missed you all while I was away with this weekend!   A little update, I had a WONDERFUL time with that awesome man and I think we’re gonna give this thing a real shot. We pretty much fell right back into being best friends that are just crazy about each other like we were in high school. Considering how awful my anxiety can get, it was surprisingly comfortable so soon even though we were both so nervous. 😂 I’m pretty excited, you guys! 🖤  QotD: omg, I loved so many! Rugrats, Hey Arnold, Rocko’s Modern Life, Ed Edd and Eddy, Ren & Stimpy, animated Beetlejuice, Pokemon, Teen Titans! I could go on forever!
SAILOR MOON.  Ask me a question about it. I’ll know the answer.
My favorite day of the week taco Tuesday  QOTD: Rugrats
QOTD: Hey Arnold! Also Speed Racer, Wacky Races, Space Ghost, Scooby Doo, Powerpuff Girls, Doug, Rugrats.... I could go on lol I loved everything
QOTD: courage the cowardly dog! Or avatar the last air bender (still my favorite show)
Morning all! Time to catch up on a little work from having Monday off, but I'm gonna put a contest up soon for you Nintendo Switch owners. Keep an eye out.  QOTD: so hard to pick just one while growing up in peak 90s Nick, Disney, Cartoon Network, and even WB Kids. I might give the edge to Hey Arnold! though. u/brendaishere knows what I'm saying
Good morning everyone, I hope y’all are having a good day!   Currently at the VA with my dad. So his memory had been slipping and it’s progressively getting worse. I feel like such an asshole for bringing it up to the dr/talking about it. With him sitting right there. Ugh why do parents/grandparents have to get old.   QOTD: oh my lanta I lived for the old school nickelodeon cartoons! Catdog, angry beavers, the wild thornberries, as told by ginger, hey Arnold, rocket power, rugrats, ahh real monster, invader zim, rockos’ modern life, Doug, jimmy neutron, Danny phantom, avatar, ren & stimpy, the fairly oddparenta  Non- cartoon: drake and Josh, all that and the Amanda show, Kena & Kel, Sabrina the teenage witch.
Hey everyone!! I’m off to work in a few minutes but it might be my last scheduled day this week, so i can focus on school and relax after this mornin!! I’m rly anxious for tomorrow tho so Im glad I dont work tomorrow. I woke up after horrible dreams and restless sleep, a headache, and cramps to top it all off. So wish me luck, I get off at 3 (i live is WA). I hope everyone else has an amazing morning 🥰 AOTD? A bit more older like jr high but Gravity Falls was easily my fav cartoon growing up. It still is such a guilty pleasure show
hi everyone!! i hope you all had a well rest!  QOTD: basic- The Simpsons! That’s the only cartoon I grew up watching with my dad. I always remember the good memories we had with each other when watching the show now. :)
I slept until almost 1030 today. The kids had a virtual half day and they let me sleep in. I’m still tired somehow.  But on a better note, I have an appointment today to get a lash lift and facial. And I made a bunch of taco meat for lunches this week so it’s gonna be taco Tuesday all week 😊 QOTD - any Nickelodeon show from the 90s
QOTD; probably Ulysses 31 or the Mysterious Cities of Gold. And Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors. And He Man. And She Ra. God I miss 80s telly!
An hour to midnight over here, hope you all have a great day. QOTD We hardly had any cartoons to watch on tv while growing up, though I did a lot of catching up with my daughter was born ☺️. But I did read a lot and my favourite ones were Tom and Jerry & the Flintstones
😴😴so sleepy. Kiddo decided he wanted to be awake at 3:15 and wasn't pleased when I said no. Took what seemed like forever to get him back to sleep..then had to get myself back to sleep and then he was ready to be up at 7 😫 I'm sipping some coffee now until I feel awake. Then it's time for cleaning. Some days I wish I had a maid. I'm wishing you all a great and lovely day!    QoTD: SpongeBob or The Powerpuff Girls
Hi everyone! I thought I’d pop in because I’ve been a bit MIA. I’m moving, working two jobs, and my 4 year old has been with me just about 24/7 for almost a year, [this is fine right?](https://media4.giphy.com/media/XHxBu4bStsmRYeVgnP/giphy.gif?cid=4d1e4f29kd0im6c10qwmal72o0whsiniumod33ndeu47dj1t&rid=giphy.gif) Once I’m moved I can at least get back to the status quo!   QOTD: I really liked Care Bears and The Snorks.
I'll probably have Tacos for dinner tonight! But I feel groggy and a migrane is headed my way 😭 I got my new dining table set up last night and I am FINALLY done assembling furniture after the move. I definitely paid someone to deal with the living room furniture because I am over it. Anyone need an Allen wrench? Or 12? 😅  QOTD: Dexter's Lab came before anything else!  Later in life SpongeBob came along and I still love me some Spongebob.  Edit to add, does anyone remember the show Art Attack? I was obsessed and only just remembered it.
Hello frenz.  I haven’t been here in ages. Thought I would swing by and say hello there.
QoTD: There are so many of them. Tom and Jerry, Mickey Mouse, Phineas and Ferb, Recess, Shin Chan, Oggy and the Cockroaches, Kiteretsu, to name a few.  I still watch Shin Chan!
hello, friends! rainy day here today. I think I'll run some errands, do some lab work, and maybe read. I hope everyone has a good day!
QOTD: I loved Looney Tunes and Tom&Jerry. My day would be whole if I saw at least one of them. I do wish I got more sleep and I’m pretty hungry lol
Morning everyone! I wish it was still the weekend lol
QOTD Scooby Doo 😀
Good morning everyone! I just woke up, and I'm clothes shopping for the kids of some friends. Are there any sites anyone recommends in particular for a 5 year old boy and 7-9 year old girls?      I'm just doing some light browsing then it's off to DD for hashbrowns and an iced coffee before work. It's a pretty easy day. I'm also super excited because I have a Shein package coming in that I ordered when I first got my Stimulus and there are socks in it!! That sums up my train of thought for the morning. I'm blanket up and ready for a good day. I hope everyone else is doing swell as well.   ♥️  c:
Hellooooo  qotd: Rugrats. I watched that until it was well past "normal" and loved All Grown Up and tbh I will still sometimes put it on for a comfort show lol   after 2 weeks of not being that busy i'm now TOO busy at work. peaks and valleys man.   I also just wish i could read all the books i want to read and do very little else lol sadly no one will pay me enough to just read my books :(
Today was a bit dull, I didn't do much, but I did start playing sort the court on my laptop again, which is a pretty cool game!  We'll be eating Spaghetti Tacos soon if anyone wants to join!  QOTD: Amazing world of Gumball I think, I watched a lot lmao
Good morning, everyone! I hope you're having a good day!      Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need a friend.
Just woke up...last day off before my work week starts 😭 Not looking forward to only having Sunday off next week, but oh well...
The valentines gift I bought for my partner arrived today and it's so cute I'm kinda want to keep it for myself!  QOTD: Probably Sailor Moon or My Little Pony! I still watch both to this day!
My favorite cartoon growing up would be Gundam Wing.
QotD: Smurfs. One gal surrounded by all sorts of men? Yep, that's my style.
I reinstalled Stardew Valley yesterday and played so long I cramped up my hand and it's still sore today. Ooooops.
Good morning everyone!!!  QOTD: Spider-Man, it used to be at 11am, so I couldnt watch it since I was at school, my solution I programmed the VCR to start recording at 10:45 and stop at 11:45 (just to be sure I didnt miss anyhting). It was great since I could fast foward commercials XD
I did not eat a taco for breakfast. But I did eat a taco-shaped omelet. I suppose that’s institutional cooking for you.   But that’s the last of that because I’m actually on my way out the door!  That’s right, me and my “strikingly abnormal” cortisol levels are GTFO.  All I have to do is add another pill to my med list and follow up with an endocrinologist. I kind of wish I had thought to go to the hospital a Week ago.
QOTD: When I was little I really liked David the Gnome, and there was a Grimm's fairy tale cartoon.  When I got a little older I liked Pepper Ann.
Good morning! Slept well thankfully since I had to wake up at 6 am for work.   QOTD: Hmm I liked Crash Box!
Tom and Key and Doremom
Good morning everyone! I have no plans for the day, although I guess I should do some of my college work lol. Yesterday I made a lovely dinner of pan fried salmon, onigiri, and garlic soy glazed green beans!  QOTD: I really liked Total Drama Island growing up, along with 6teen. I also liked Fosters Home For Imaginary Friends when I was young
I stripped a itsy bitsy bolt yesterday tinkering around with my printer. After work I get to operate on it, emergency drill surgery :D.   QOTD: Dragonball! I woke up at probably 0500 each weekday to watch that before elementary school.
Qotd: The Herculoids
QOTD: I watched many cartoons on cartoon network. I liked Kim possible, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Pokémon, Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon.
Didn't sleep well.. dreamt I was being held captive by a cult. At least it's a quiet morning at work. QOTD: TaleSpin
Morning, I got a good sleep for the first time in ages now that all the stuff I had to do had been handed in (essay for Monday and a self-evaluation/plan thing for today) and had a fun virtual dance class so feel extra healthy today.   I have a meeting at 4pm with my tutor, but then in the evening I'll be able to relax and do whatever I want without feeling like I should be doing something else. Can't wait to get cosy with my Kindle!
Good morning. Got my errands done and some housework,  now to sit and watch TV lol I miss working.  I hope everyone has a wonderful day💜
good morning! back at work from a long weekend and i'm already thinking of next month's long weekend.   qotd: sooo many haha. tom and jerry and pokemon come to mind first but i also enjoyed a lot of the cartoons from nick and cartoon network as well as arthur
Tom and jerry  Hi y'all!  How's it going?  It's going fine here just taking it easy.  There's lots of snow here.  There wasn't back home 4 hours away it's crazy.  I feel the need to stay inside and remain cozy lol. I cannot get my coffee right up here it annoys me.
Good morning 🌞. I miss you all. I just suck at staying involved. Therefore too much going on IRL.
hmm Growing up it was probably Pinky and the Brain or Tiny Tunes. My favorite show wasnt a cartoon though, it was Are you afraid of the dark!!!   &#x200B;  Hope everyone has a great Tuesday!!! <3 💜
QOTD:  I think it depends upon my age at the time... when I was small I think it may have been just about whatever cartoons were on...maybe Hanna Barberra and old school Warner Bros.  I remember woody woodpecker, Tom and Jerry, Bugs Bunny, the Flintstones, the Jetsons, Chilly Willie, etc. Then I remember Dungeons and Dragons.   Next came the Disney afternoons and that had to be the original Duck Tales, Chip & Dales Rescue Rangers, and even some Talespin. Oh, and I can’t forget Disney’s Gargoyles (I have that series on dvd).
finally the Tuesday of Tacos! maybe I'll have them for lunch *cronch cronch*  Queue of the Day : definitely have to line up for tacos on a Tuesday, I try to get some and skip it for the empty fast food drive thru next door
Anxiety is getting the better of me today. Wish people would fuck the fuck off~
Bit of a rant with some TMI:  I am so stressed out today already. Everyone and everything seems to just be adding to it lol. My daughter was doing so good without wetting the bed but the past couple nights it has happened again. I have no problem with her wearing pull ups to sleep because her bladder just can't always make it through the night BUT she has a fear of pooping on the toilet so she will hold it in until she has a pull up on. I have tried EVERYTHING and I don't know what to do anymore. Anyone else have potty training issues like this? She is 4... she will always pee on the toilet but for some reason is scared to poop on there?   Thats my mini rant and what I'm trying to deal with today lol.   Hope everyone has a good day💕  QOTD- this is such a hard question because there are SO many good ones. I loved Sailor Moon (actually re watching it lately), Powerpuff Girls, Pokemon, Recess. I could list so many more and are probably missing some really good ones.😅
You’re awesome! 👏💕
thank you for this 💗
I needed this. Thank you!
Reminds me I need to take mine today 😂🙏❤️
felt this 😹🌸
Literal story of my life hahahah
It's on HBO Max! I have watched a bit of it with Arya and it's still great. :P
Wow, congrats!   What are you growing with the seedlings?
Congrats!   I really need to start some seeds as well for the spring and thin out my carrots
Oh cool! No matter how many times I enter, I never win those giveaways LOL. Congrats on winning :D
How did the launch go? I'm sorry missed a few days of reading.
My day is going well! How is yours going???
I hope your week goes well!!!
Hi there! 👋 these hangouts are fun 😊 hope your day gets a little better... it’s my day off so I’m chillin haha
Mine is going well so far, just a normal work day.
Congrats!  Good luck!
Woohoo!! Good luck on the interview! Be prepared for anything. At a former job, when conducting interviews, I always asked candidates "What would you do if it turned out that you left this interview and it was the zombie apocalypse?" LOL they looked at me like I had three heads but you could learn a lot from those answers
Happy cake day
I resonate with this so much, I feel like I just could not get to sleep and stay asleep.  It's gonna be a loooong Tuesday.
I see cake! r/cakeday
Happy cake day!!
Hooray for Taco Tuesday and best friends! 🎉

Oh no, it gets better 🤗
Omg Gummi Bears. I watched that too.

So happy for you, I got my second one a little over ten days ago!!  Have you experienced any symptoms?
Omg I loved dragon tales
Glad you were able to get the vaccine yay! I won't be eligible for a while but hoping my husband can get his soon.
What's for breakfast? Asking for a friend 😂😋
I loved Pokémon, DBZ, and Sailor Moon too.
I love all those cartoons and I actually started re watching Sailor Moon again!
Creating resin molds is your hobby? Would love to see snaps of them, if possible

Good morning, hope you have an amazing day today!!
Morning! Powerpuff girls was so good!
owwww i was a powder puff girls fan too! my favorite was buttercup for sure lol
Yes! Which was your favorite Powerpuff?
I watched all of those except Ben 10 lol.
Omg I forgot about scooby doo! I loved scooby doo! The theme songs were the best too
That show was fun.
My brother used to like that show too! Hope you have a great day. :D
Congrats on on the date! That is like the most exciting stage of a relationship, so so fun to be in it.
Teen titans is good! I didn't know there was a Beetlejuice show!
Aww I'm happy for you, that's so sweet 💕
AWWWWW!!! 🖤🖤🖤🖤
So glad to hear your weekend was wonderful! That's so great <3 SO happy for you yay!
What color was the background in episode 16 at 6:52
Where is she now
Who's your favorite Sailor?
You got me some cravings for tomorrow, its 9pm here, does Taco Wednesday happen?
OMG how could I forget Speed Racer and Wacky Races especially? Loved that show.
Courage was fun! Have a great day :D
It's really fun seeing Avatar make a comeback. I watched it for the first time about 5 years ago and surprised it took me that long!
Hope you have a great day!
Dude yes. I’ve been rewatching all of these on Hulu and HBO Max and they still hold up!   I haven’t been able to find Dexter’s Laboratory or Johnny Bravo yet, but I’m optimistic
My kids are finally to ages where I feel comfortable giving them chores and I don't have to hover. Even then it feels like once you clean something it's only clean for the 5 minutes you take to appreciate it and then it's back to where it was before. I get to points where I just want to throw the whole house away and start over😅  I hope you can get a nap in today at least!
Oh I used to love Powerpuff Girls! Forgot about that one. Which was your fave?
Bubbles is a cutie. Which Powerpuff girl did you like?
Oh man I do not miss those days at all
It sounds like you've got quite the handful going on right now.  Are you moving far?
Oh yes! Neil later formed a heavy metal band after art attack I discovered ( from the YouTuber Jazza).
Hellooo
Shin Chan felt to lewd back then and now I can enjoy it even more lol
Such a good show.
QOTD: My favorite cartoon growing up was probably Pokemon or Digimon! Haha.
dunkin!?! that’s the best way to start your day!
Rugrats was my jam. That show hit me at the right time growing up as a '90s kid.  And I feel similar to you about reading, only with video games 😅 life just keeps getting busier and busier.
I'd love to get paid to read books that would be awesome!
Spaghetti Tacos? Never tried that
Spaghetti tacos always makes me think of iCarly!
Have a great day!
Spaghetti tacos? Are they like what they sound like?
Same to you, friend!
Aw man enjoy your day off!! Can you eat again??
Love Sailor Moon! Who's your favourite Sailor scout?
I love Stardew valley~!!!! What land did you start on?
Institutional cooking 😄  How are you now?
I remember a grimm’s fairy tale cartoon on Nickelodeon and was kinda anime style
I watched that with my son. Ten seconds lol
Doreamon is fun to watch.
So many days rushing home from school to watch Dragon Ball 😳
A good sleep does wonders! What are you reading?
What are you watching?
Ooo, are you doing anything fun on your long weekend?
I'm also thinking about next month's long weekend 😂
Tom&Jerry oh yeah!
Ahh that sucks. Sending positive vibes your way, we'll get through it🤗
Sorry you're feeling anxious :( sending good vibes your way
Hugs
My 5yo isn’t overnight potty trained at all. Her pediatrician says it’s normal to take until they’re 6-7-8 it just depends. We try to limit to just a little water before bed and we were told we could wake her about an hour after she’s fallen asleep to use the potty but that hasn’t worked so well. I’m sorry I don’t have better answers for you. It’ll happen eventually. If you’re concerned about the poo fear maybe talk to her pediatrician or even her in a non accusatory way. Ask her why she is afraid and see how it can be remedied. Best of luck. I know it’s hard.
The Little REFUSED to have a BM on the toilet FOREVER. I figured they'd go off to kindergarten still in diapers. Somewhere between 4 and 5 they figured it out. Your little one will get there eventually too. It's frustrating, but don't stress it. Stop buying the pull ups and take away that crutch. You might have to do a lot of laundry initially but it'll be worth it in the long run. The Little always said "why use the potty when the diaper works just fine?" Hard to argue kid logic. If you let her soil undies it'll probably make her uncomfortable because they're not designed to hold waste like diapers and pull ups are. Let her discomfort guider her to the toilet.
<3
<3
Ooooooooh. I don't have HBO max. May need to get it...
Radishes, sweet peppers, Swiss chard, green beans, squash, zucchini, spinach, lettuce mix, eggplant, snow peas
Ty
Ty
Not too bad! About to get food but no idea what lmao
What do you do?
Thank you! ♥
Thank you! I already got told that I'll need to prepare for a question on leadership and change management because the place I work for is going through *a lot* right now. I'm in healthcare, but we became a new organisation in April 2020 and obviously got punted right into covid work so I can see why they'd want to know how I'd manage that!  I also discuss zombie apocalypses relatively often with my boyfriend because he's fascinated by the topic haha so I'm sure I could manage something :P
Thank you!!!
That's usually typical for me. I'll toss and turn for a good hour before I finally fall asleep.
😁😁😁
Thank you!!!!
thank you! 😄
Not gonna lie, I feel like it could still spook me a bit as an adult.
How did yours go? I got the pfizer one. So far no symptoms but I've heard from other healthcare people that it takes a few hours for anything to start!
What's your favorite Pokemon?
Nice! I've been wanting to do that actually but just can't find the time! Who's your favorite Sailor?
Thank you Coffee!!!!! 🥰🥳😇
Thanks hungupon!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Thanks!
Awe I appreciate you 🥰
Thank you!
Thank you shazie!! 🥳💙
thank you!
Oooh what a difficult question. 🤔 I wanna say Jupiter/Mars/Pluto/Saturn were favorites of mine. how about you?
You too friend!!
I had a whole Powerpuff girls bday party!!
I love buttercup and I have a soft spot for bubbles 💙
It’s a toss up between buttercup and bubbles!! What about you??
I watched all the episodes of Ben10 I even watched the show when Ben and Gwen grew up.
Absolutely!
Thank you so much! ☺️ I haven’t dated in years so it’s very exciting and a little scary at the same time! Lol
Yes, it was great! I’m sure there are some clips on YouTube!
Thank you so much! 😊
😁😁😁🖤🖤🖤
Thank you soooo much!! 😊😊😊
Which episode 16? Are we talking about the Japanese, the original English dub, or Sailor Moon Crystal? And if we’re talking about the Japanese or the OG dub, which set of DVDs or fanrips are we using, since that can affect the timing by up to six seconds? If it’s Sailor Moon Crystal, are we talking about the webseries release, the Blu-Ray reanimation, or the television syndication?  Invalid question, comrade, too many variables.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  The original American VA, Terri Hawkes, completed her most recent role in 2016 and is now mostly doing anime conventions.  The 2014 redub American VA, Stephanie Sheh, worked on five projects in 2020 and continues her role as Usagi/Sailor Moon in Sailor Moon Crystal. She’s currently awaiting the Japanese release of Sailor Moon Crystal: Eternal, which was pushed back due to COVID.  The Japanese seiyuu, Kotono Mitsuishi, is currently reprising her role as Usagi/Sailor Moon in Sailor Moon Crystal: Eternal.  The original manga-ka, Naoko Takeuchi, is raising her kids and running Princess Naoko Productions, which is in charge of managing the Sailor Moon franchise and properties.
For sheer love: Mercury   For “you saved me when I couldn’t save myself”: Uranus  For “you deserved so much better than your original canon and rewriting you is DELIGHTFUL”: Chibi-Moon  You?
Yes taco Wednesday can totally happen lol
Haha right? So silly and colorful and I loved it
And you as well sweet friend!
Checkout HBO Max for Dexter's Lab too! They have them on there. Best place to see the Infraggable Krunk in action.
For sure. I'm not hopeful that it'll stay clean for long, but I need a moment of clean.
Buttercup!
Agreed, but Buttercup was always my favorite!
I mean I'll be back to it again in about 2 and a half months, but he's been doing pretty good.
Aww thank you, luckily just up the street, so at least it’s my same, familiar neighborhood! I hope you have a great day! 😊
WHAT!? I need to see this NOW!! Lol
Helloooo cabbage.  How are you.  Tuesday working out for ya?
🥰the best
I love cozy socks!
Who's your favorite pokemon?
Right! I'm going to keep pumped up for the day and the wind down with some video games, cleaning, and journaling when I get home. c:
Oh I’d also love to be paid to play video games 🥰 truly anything relaxing.   Rugrats is just so wholesome. My favorite episode (which is not a great episode overall) was when tommy gets like baby napped from the grocery store because Lou was incompetent as always. And the people who stole him named him Bostwick. Which was my last name and I thought it was so cool
Right?!    I spend enough time on YouTube to know that even if I could carve out a good following I probably couldn’t comfortably make it my full time job though. If only I could win the lottery by not playing.....
I don't know why but my brother really likes it, so when my little sister and I hust eat spaghetti, he eats it in taco shells 😂
I know right! (But mine are definitely better😜 )
You too!
Definitely! Spaghetti in a Taco! 😁
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I will...I don't wanna go back to woooork 😭😭😭 I'm still avoiding some foods, but for the most part I'm back to eating normally! I just have to take small bites and chew carefully
Sailor Mercury! She's so cute! Yours?
Picked the four corners farm this time around. My old save file was on year 10 but it was so heavily modded I couldn’t safely get back into it with how much the game had changed in two years.
Just getting ready to take a shower and start my day. Already following up with my regular doc this afternoon. Have a specialist scheduled for next week. Might nap later, otherwise it should be a pretty normal day.
Which character do you like from Dragon Ball/ DBZ?
I haven't decided yet! I'm a huge mood reader so I don't know what I'll be reading until I sit down to read as if I pick a book now then I'll change my mind by the time I actually want to read. I am in the middle of reading a non-fiction book about China (24 Hours in Ancient China) and a couple short story collections but I'll probably start a new one from the library as I have a bunch that are due back soon.
I'm binging elementary
will probably drive up and spend the weekend with my boyfriend again but this time i will see if i can drive instead of taking the train.  i'm still trying to do more research on this though bc i already know i'll have to pay a little more for being under 25  do you have anything to look forward to? :D
hahah right? i love the end of nov to the beginning of jan because there are 3 back to back long weekends to look forward to
♥️♥️♥️
Thank you 💕 I'm fine with the overnight thing and have no problem with her having to wear pull ups because it's something she cannot control obviously while she is sleeping. It's mainly just the pooping that I have no idea what to do anymore because I feel like I have tried EVERYTHING lol. I have no idea what she is scared of and I try to make it like fun and rewarding for her but nothing works lol. I'm going to talk to her doctor about it and see if he can give me some help.
That was exactly my problem. She only wore the pull ups at night but I have taken them away because it was exactly that, she would wait until she had one on to go. I just feel bad that she holds it in for days sometimes. I wish she would tell me what she is so scared of lol but I don't think she even knows 😂 It does make me feel better that she isn't the only kid her age that had this problem. Thank you!💕
It's got a lot of good throwbacks and movies. I need to dive back into Fresh Prince, but I always start a new year with a Friends binge for the feel goods. 🤣
Ooooh nice!!!
I work in IT, you?
Oh that's good that they gave you a heads up! You'll do great :D
Yw
Ain't that the truth!  Sometime I'll even take melatonin and it still doesn't knock me out.
I actually re-watched it and it's not that freaky.  I didn't notice when I was young,  that there isn't much dialogue.
I got the Pfizer one too!  My arm was really sore after my first shot, not as sore after the second one.  The only thing I noticed after both shots was that I was extremely tired.  At first I thought I was tired because I had a long work day and did some grocery shopping, but a lot of my coworkers said they felt very fatigued after theirs as well.  But that's the only symptom I had, which I'm grateful for.  I hope it's the same for you!
I can't choose! I like Charmander, Eevee, Pichu, Vulpix. What about You?
I love Sailor Mars!❤ Who's yours?
Yw
You're welcome.
It is hard to choose. I always felt I was most like a mix of Jupiter and Mercury though, so I guess those two!
As much as I wanted to be Buttercup, I had to admit I was Bubbles LOL. She was always my fave because she had that octopus stuffed plush and that definitely reminded me of me with all my stuffed animals.
Oh nice. I should check it out.
Yeah! Teen Titans Go isn't as good in my opinion.
I was wondering where you ran off to ;-)
Let’s go with the original English dub, first dvd set.
Damn, you know your shit 🔥
Mercury is definitely underrated. I like Mars. I like fire themed characters in general and she's super cool.
Thank you!!
😮 I missed it! Now I know what I’m watching this week
So fierce!!
Interesting choice! I feel like she's the least popular one.
I’m sorry
So jealous!  I'm looking to move to a different state this Summer so that'll be a pretty big move for me.  I hope yours goes smoothly!  Hope you have a good day as well :)
You should!!!!!! He is awesome.
I am fine! Wbu?   Its 10pm here, so I just had my dinner, the original plan was pasta but my mom made curry instead, so I had lot of broccoli  What's your plan today?
I liked a Pup Named Scooby-Doo too. The characters are so cute there.
Honestly, I'm pretty sure I've become a sock fanatic. They're just so warm and cozy and full of happiness.  ♥️
Togepi! Although I do also love Snorlax. What's yours? c:
because i saw this post [i had to grab one too](https://imgur.com/a/kwV3b2K) hahahaha
Ohhh yeahhh! That one had the creepy older ladies in it I think. I always enjoyed the one with Stu as a baby where he was trying to watch his favorite black and white tv show. I want to say it was like Rocky & Bullwinkle or something.
Don't we all wish that... I'd share
I am gonna try that, my sisters gets mad at me when she sees me eat things alone, like just boiled rice, plain bread, broccoli, peanut butter  I tell her its survival mode lol   This should really make her give me looks^
I've never actually had them before but they sound really good!
That's good yay! Glad to hear you're healing up well :D
She is cute! I love Sailor Mars❤
Fresh start is always good though!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Oh okay, all the best with everything
Jeez another tough one. 🤔 gotta go with me grumpy pants Vegeta. He was the very first anime character I learned how to draw back in like 6th grade. 🤣I also remember being really shook during the Cell games ark when Gohan went SS after Cell killed his dad.
What do you like along with your reading? I get distracted even if I were to eat snacks lol
Aw I love that idea.  Do you and your boyfriend not live close?  Are we talking Valentine's weekend?    The only thing I'm looking forward to is in the distant future.  I'm hoping to move this summer.
Right?! And good food!
I love it! I've been rewatching Rules of Engagement.
Chemistry, I do quality control at a pharmaceutical company.
Thank you 😊
I have gotten a lot better since I started on a vitamin regiment though or maybe it's just a placebo affect Idk.
And now you've got me interested!  I'll have to give some episodes a watch soon and see how I feel about it.
I'm going to keep my fingers crossed!!
Aw yeah those are all cute. I think I'd have to go with Munchlax, Jigglypuff, or Turtwig :D
I'm going with Mercury and Jupiter because I always felt like I was most like them.
Lol I have a million stuffed animals maybe I am more bubbles 😂😂
Yes you could! :)
Which DVD/fanrip version? Does this timing include the theme song? What about the pre-theme song bumper? Are we using the original version of the theme song or the reworked one from after Cloverway/Pioneer took over? Still too many variables, friend.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was supposed to do work today... but maybe it can just play in the background while I'm working from home 😅
THE THUNDER OF GUNS
Possible, but I love the sass XD
Oh it's okay. Tonight should be better. 💕
That could be pretty exciting! Thank you!
9 am here.  Just ate breakfast.  I plan to catch up with flash on Netflix today
Aww yeah him as a puppy was super cute💛
I have an obsession with bombas socks it's pretty bad
Togepi is cute! I can't pick. I like Charmander, Eevee, Vulpix.
Those two are also my favorite!!! :-)
Omg. Your setup. Lmao. I actually added your keyboard to my WL when I saw it. 😅  I’m glad we’re twinning with the DD though! What’d you get?
Blocky and Oxwinkle! It was a direct rip off of Rocky and bullwinkle though lol.    There is also one where I forget the kids plot I think Angelica thinks she’s a rhinoceros or something. But the adults are doing taxes. And drew is helping Stu and he’s looking through his receipts and saying “deductible, deductible, not deductible. Deductible, oh definitely not deductible “ and I didn’t know what it meant as a kid but the scene always made me laugh and my sister and I to this day still quote it
Id be such a philanthropic millionaire but no one wants to just give me the money to prove it 🥴
Nice plan!
Thank you 💙
I love her too!
Thanks!
That's cool. I like Goku.
Never watched that one!
Haha, go for it. Rel-live your childhood.
Jigglypuff is such a troll lol.
They are awesome too :)
Ooo what are some of your favorites that you have? I have SO many too. Literally so many that I have to keep half of them in bags and bring out different ones during different seasons otherwise I wouldn't have enough space for all of them. LOL
Will do!
DVD, yes, yes, original!
Haha. She's a badass.
Fingers crossed that it is
So cute.
Ooooh, those look super comfy but also are a bit pricey. I bet they're well worth the price seeing how cute and comfy they look. Haha.
Oooh great choices! I actually love Eevee as well, Charmander is my starter choice, and Vulpix is my S/O's favorite. Haha.
YAYYYYYY that means we’re matching c:
this keyboard was the first pink thing i purchased and then everything around it started to turn pink too, thanks to a cheap can of pink spray paint and items from the dollar store/and other stuff i had lying around. [here some of the process ](https://imgur.com/a/YlLYdrQ)  And i ordered iced decaf with extra cream and two sugars. i’m boring hahaha.
Hahaha, that's totally something I would have missed as a kid too! I really should go back and watch through it. Now that I have a kid myself I feel I'll resonate with Stu and Drew a whole lot more.
I have the same problem
LOL right?!
I really Love my first build a bear her name is Cindy, her and I cuddle every night! I also sleep with two beanie babies, a whale shark, and a tiger squishmallow and a hamster squishmallow! I really Love my boba squishie as well! And I got about 10 more build a bears in my room!
Oh I also watched Beyblade! I still watched the recent episodes last year. Did you watch Beyblade?
Trick question. The bumpers weren’t on the DVDs.
They are I get them once a year when taxes come back lol
Haha, nice! Charmander is my starter too.
They're just so cute 💙 Growing up my brother had [this Burger King Togepi plush](https://www.trollandtoad.com/pokemon/6-in-and-under/pokemon-burger-king-2-5-togepi-nintendo-plush-9287-/1668892) and I was sooo sad and jealous that I didn't have one. My mom scoured the town looking for one for me, but never managed to find one 😢 He's sooooo cute!
Awww I love the process! I miss how neat my setup used to be but I’ve got to replaced a lot of things in my setup. :c
YES! especially this moment! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIR68SbPg-U  while the show really does provide context for that moment it really works well with no context as well
Yep lol. Don't fall asleep near one.
Oh that show. I saw bits of it. It didn't catch my attention. How is it?
Then no!
Wooo, that means we're the best!
I liked it! The one I watched last year was Beyblade Burst!  I own like 5-6 beyblades and a beyblade stadium! Lol.
Woo!
Nice! Lol. Ok, I'll check it out.
WOOOOOOO! (lol I’m being super hyped)
Woo-hoo! Great minds think alike.

I did say I'd be running my first contest soon. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.  &#x200B;  1) Each Tuesday, I'll post a trivia question. You can expect this to appear between 1 and 4am Arizona time, and it may come from any category. The contest will run for 24 hours.   2) Answer the question. Make sure your answer is spelled correctly, because the correct answer will be the word or phrase for the randomizer!   3) Have something on your wishlist for $20 or under. (This amount may change from week to week.)  4) ?????  5) PROFIT!  &#x200B;  THIS WEEK'S QUESTION:   &#x200B;  In what year did the first Sherlock Holmes film appear, and what was its title? (The title will be the randomizer answer, so be sure it's spelled correctly!)  &#x200B;  Aaaaaaaand . . . GO!
I mean everyone is saying baffled which is probably the answer you're looking for from 1900 but baffled wasn't really a sherlock Holmes film it just used his name in order to sell rotoscope uses, the first actual sherlock Holmes film was adventures of sherlock Holmes, also called held for ransom, which was released in 1905 again for the rotoscope      I've had this question in a pub quiz before so I'm delighted my knowledge has become useful again 😂
Sherlock Holmes Baffled (1900)  Such a fun contest. I like learning some new trivia. Thanks 💜🙏 and congrats on first contest ☺️🎉
1900   Sherlock Holmes Baffled
Sherlock holmes baffled   In the year 1990!
Sherlock holmes baffled 1900.
Sherlock Holmes Baffled   And it came out in 1900!
1900 Sherlock Holmes Baffled  [Link to film](https://youtu.be/KmffCrlgY-c) if anyone wants to watch it. It's amazing how much can happen in a minute.
Well now I’m just... baffled. Probably because I’m hung up on the word film.   Sherlock Holmes Baffled was created in 1900, using a mutoscope. This used cards, didn’t project on a screen and only one person at a time could view it.   I’m being difficult, but technically it wouldn’t be considered ‘film’ because no film was involved. It was more like stop action photography from what I gather.   The first made on actual film (1 reel) was in 1905 - Adventures of Sherlock Holmes; or, Held for Ransom
Sherlock Holmes Baffled, released in the year 1900.
The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939)

1900, Sherlock Holmes Baffled.  I’ve been loving Sherlock Holmes lately!
Sherlock Holmes Baffled, in 1900.   I love Sherlock Holmes!  Filmwise I really like the Jeremy Brett adaptations. He even looks like exactly what I pictured Holmes to look like when I was reading the books. Of course, I also enjoyed Sherlock, and the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes movies. Were they all true to the book? No, but so what, its a vision of it, not a copy and it was still fun.   What about you, what are your favotire adaptations?
Title: Sherlock Holmes Baffled   Year: 1900   I love Sherlock Holmes, thank you for hosting this fun contest!
Sherlock Holmes Baffled in 1900   Thanks for a fun contest
The first Sherlock Holmes film appears to be a silent self titled film *Sherlock Holmes* from 1916.  Edit: misspelled word :)
I had to look this up! Very interesting trivia. But no one has solved the mystery of 1900’s Sherlock Holmes Baffled, above, the very first filmed entertainment to feature the character. The director and cinematographer was Arthur W. Marvin, who went on to serve as cameraman for D. W. Griffith’s early silent films. The identity of his starring actor has unfortunately been lost to the ages.  The film itself was believed lost, too, until Michael Pointer, a historian specializing in Sherlock Holmesiana, unearthed a paper copy in a Library of Congress archive. A series of individual cards, it was intended to be viewed by Mutoscope, a single viewer, crank-operated peep show device, common in turn-of-the-century arcades. Thank you for the contest!
Sherlock Holmes  (1916)
This is a cool kind of contest, sooo fun!   The answer is Sherlock Holmes Baffled in the year of 1900.     Looking forward to the next of ur contests! Cheers!
Sherlock Holmes Baffled (1900)! “Assumed to be lost for many years, the film was rediscovered in 1968 as a paper print in the Library of Congress.” -Wikipedia   I want to see this now.[Here!](https://youtu.be/KmffCrlgY-c)

The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939)
This contest sent me down a rabbit hole of Wikipedia/internet pages. That was fun reading! Thank you!  I got to read about Sherlock Holmes 1916 silent film and the Sherlock Holmes film series from 1939. There was also Sherlock Holmes Baffled in 1900 and also Adventures of Sherlock Holmes ( or Held for Ransom ) in 1905  So many Sherlock Holmes films.   Tho I prefer Jonny Lee Miller as my Sherlock lol  https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000501/trivia?tab=tr&item=tr2043625

Happy cake day!
Thank you ❤️
It really is ☺️
You're very welcome!
Thank you <3 I hope to share many random things with you all!
I must know where and what this exhibition is. I ADORE Holmes.
I look forward to sharing a plethora of useless facts with you all! (And maybe not so useless facts. My first thought for today's question had to do with the periodic table.)
I’ve always been partial to the Rathbone radio plays! There’s something delightful about enjoying Holmes in a format he himself could have enjoyed, assuming him to have actually existed and had a regular lifespan.
My pleasure!
Thank you for joining in!
You’re very welcome!
You're welcome! I am, as Stephen King so wonderfully put it, an artisan well of useless information. I might as well put it to good use!
It's my pleasure!
You misspelled Holmes 😅 Don't forget to fix it :)
I use it!
Thank you!
♥️ I hope your day is going well. Keep doing great things~~~
It makes me want to do team trivia like we used to at my local bar. 🥲
Thats a very good point! I also like to think he would have enjoyed reading stories in The Strand haha
thank you! my auto correct was not liking that too much lol
Oh, without question. I’m trying to actually purchase a copy of one of the originals.
Oh t hat would be really cool! I have a book that's a collection of the stories in the format they appeared in the magazine, with the original illustrations placed in where they were. But it's a collected reprint really.   Where have you found originals? That is so cool
eBay, believe it or not.

Contest will run until I get out of the office or until correct answer is given.  Rules:  1) Everyone welcome,   2) have something around $15 or under on your wishlist (those outside of US please have gift card around $15 USD on wishlist),  3) one guess per person,   4) use the word needles for randomizer in case of a tie, and  5) DBAD.

Omg ill say 26 needles but good lord I hope not
Thanks for hosting a contest and needles.  13
I think the acupuncturist will use 64 needles on you . I have no clue how many are typically used 😆 Enjoy your sweet relief and thanks for the contest!
I'm going to go with 10 needles
My guess is 16 needles
32 needles

Glad I wasn’t right hahaha 88 is overkill
u/DebStone  u/chloroform_girl  you both guessed correctly.  Today the number of needles used was 17.  Rather than use the randomizer, you both win!
Aww shucks I went with 16!!! So close!
How sweet of you!!
Honestly, I don't think 88 would bother me :)  I find it totally relaxing!
So close!!  Maybe I'll do this one again.  The number he uses always changes, but I have noticed it's always an odd number.....at least so far.  I don't know why I always count!
Ooh better luck next time for me! Btw does it hurt?

Honestly, it sounds like a lot of fun to do a small like Valentine's Day postcard or something, but Lunar New Year actually starts on February 13th (and I'm a sucker for things are sooner haha).  What this giveaway entails is...  1. I'll make you a special curated box full of things I hope you'll like. 2. You'll get a potentially cute letter from me with some stickers! 3. I'll send you all the positive vibes!  If you want to join in, just do the following...  \- DBAD  \- Be okay with giving me your address  \- US only (if you're international, I can totes give you the positive vibes still though!)  I'm going to pick staggered winners-- the number will be dependent on how many people enter. I feel like if I do it this way, I can have more money to spend on each of the winner. Sooooo I'll ship out gifts once a week in the next three weeks is what I mean by staggered basically. c:  &#x200B;  Edit: Oh and tell me what animal you are! For example, I was born in the year of the rat and this year is the year of the ox!
I don't celebrate lunar new years as much as I used to when I was younger so thank you for hosting this 🥰 I miss the festivities! I'm born in the year of the rabbit 🐇

I am an oddity. I was born on February 5 1989 which was the new year that year. So depending in my time of birth I am either a snake or a dragon. Unfortunately I don’t know what time I was born lol
This sounds like fun! I was born in the year of the Horse. Not sure of what it means but I think it’s cool.
This is an awesome idea! I was born in the year of the goat.
This is a great idea!  I’m an ox so this is my year!  Yay!
Ooooh I love this idea!!!! I was a Monkey!
This is so fun! I’m 1989 so Year of the Snake! 🐍 which is perfect, because I’m in Slytherin house! 😁
I was born in the year of the pig. Pigs are pretty smart, so I guess I've got that going for me lol
This is such a cool giveaway. Do you celebrate lunar new year? I'm a sheep.
Sounds like an awesome giveaway! I'm a dragon, which is appropriate because I also love fantasy and dragons are a big part of that. I also think the qualities of a dragon really describe me. Thanks for this! :D
I was born in the year of the OX!
Oh my god, a specially curated box?  I'm swooning, what a sweet giveaway idea.    Okay so, I feel like I'm a dog.  More specifically, I feel like that [dog from Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zfJvTXKdsg) who doesn't shut up and who's mind is all jumbled and all over the place.  Yeah, that's me.  But if we're doing it in terms of the Chinese zodiac.....I'm a rooster >\_<!
i was born in the year of the dragon  this is so cool
I was born on the year of the rabbit! (Which is fitting as I have two pet rabbits! Lmao)💜💜
I was born in the year of the rat.   Happy almost New Year!
I was born in the year of the tiger! This is such an exciting and interesting giveaway. Thanks for hosting!!
I can't enter because I'm in the UK. But I just wanted to wish you a happy lunar new year!
Ohh this is so neat! I’m actually kinda surprised that I didn’t know it was the year of the ox as that is the animal that I am. 🐂♉️ my husbands is the rat. Thank you for the giveaway and I like the way you’re planning it...gives me some ideas for a giveaway. 💛
I was born year of the horse! :) This is such a sweet idea! I would love to be considered. Thanks for hosting! :)

Oh, this is very cool!  :)  I love all the snacks that come out around the time of Lunar New Year.  I was born in the year of the tiger.  :D
What a cool giveaway, thank you from a fellow rat!
I feel the same. I miss the festivities and games.
Hey, me too!!!! 🐇🐇🐇
Lol, that's pretty unique. Kind of like a cusp! XD
Here's what I found!     "People born in a year of the Horse are extremely **animated, active and energetic**. Horses love to be in a crowd, and they can usually be seen on such occasions as concerts, theater performances, meetings, sporting events, and parties.  With a deft sense of humor, Horses are **masters of repartee**. They love to take center stage and delight audiences everywhere."
I do! I’m Vietnamese so when I’m at my parent’s, I go to the temple and we do all the things. 🥰
Aw you’re the sweetest. I wish international shipping wasn’t so expensive because I totally would open it up if it wasn’t. :c  How are you though? Making plenty of new friends, I hope?! 🥰
Oooh my dad is also year of the dragon so I know from personal experience that dragons are so lovely. 😊
Pigs are my favorite 😘😊
AYYYY bunny buds :D
That’s how I treat it.
Lol I’m sorta the opposite but I do enjoy art museums and theater performances though
My husband is Vietnamese. This year we’re going to his sisters to celebrate with some yummy Vietnamese food!  I’m excited!
Wow that's cool! My parents just burns the incense and the fake money in the back yard. Going to the temple kinda scares me a bit.
Yeah, thats totally understandable, no worries!  I'm good thanks for asking! I'm absolutely loving it on the sub everyone is so lovely and welcoming and I feel like I've settled in really well! I hope you're having a good week! <3
Well oink oink BFF 😂🥰❤️

I work in IT and my hobby is to play around with setting up and using new software and systems. I find it mentally engaging and rewarding. I am currently playing with Ghost CMS. Avocado
Avocado!      My favorite hobby is painting my nails. I'm horrible at it, but I love it so much! It's my self care through all this!!!
Avocado   I guess my favorite hobby is painting/artsy stuff. I like this hobby because i like creating things and showing others what i create. My family is pretty artsy but we don’t do any artsy stuff together. It’s pretty fun, i don’t really do like original stuff though. Like Usually I’ll paint a person or a pet but nothing that i like made up in my head. Thank you! And idk how to put a gift card on my list so if I’m chosen can someone please show me!
Avocado  I really enjoy creating things with Perler Beads. I'm excited to have given my first creations away in a Giveaway. I use my partner's Pinterest account to find cool designs, even cross stitch patterns. I enjoy creating cute little knickknacks.
Reading is my favorite hobby I like to go into different worlds and read all in my own... and I love Avocados
Avocado I play d&d and it paint minis as well
It's Baking for me, I used to make it with my friend and then paused for a few years, but recently picked it up again, staying at home and it's suprisingly just as enjoyable! I made some banana muffins yesterday and those were the best ones so far, recipe from Peppry Kitchen on YouTube, I also make some oat muffins, Banoffee Pie, Cinnamon roll   I love it because I can really get in touch with each aspect of all the sweet and savoury I will be eating, also makes others happy   Avocado
Congratulations on your first contest! ✨🎉  My favorite hobby is gaming!  I love gaming because it’s essentially my happy place; it’s an escape from the problems in the real world and that’s why I adore it.  I do this hobby with my friends!  Avocado 🥑   I am from US!  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
My favorite hobby is reading! I just love how you Can escape from reality into a new world with every book!! Thanks for hosting this contest, so kind! Avocado!
My favourite hobby has to be reading right now. I love loosing myself in a book, especially if it's quite a thought provoking one. I love to read on my kindle but I do buy books too, and then I share them on. The more people that read books the better. Both of my kids are huge readers too which is brilliant!  Avocado 🥑
Hi! So my hobby is woodworking! I don’t have a ton of time or space to do it right now but it’s fun to do here and there! I just made a bath caddy for my wife and now I’m finishing up a knife handle (a project I started almost ten years ago lol). There is nobody in my life that I know of who does it, which is unfortunate, but I am hoping my brother or father in law gets into it!  Avocado!!
My hobby is learning languages (especially japanese, korean and spanish). I don't actually study them using textbooks anymore since it's boring but I just like to pick up new words from tv shows or music that I listen to! Also talking to people in the language is a fun way to make new friends from different countries :)   Thanks for the contest! Avocado
My hobby is multiple hobbies, but I don't like avacado infact I think it's taking over the world, you can't get a burger just a regular old burger anymore without 🥑, so I paint mostly acrylics, I am getting into wood work mostly stain and engraving filling with resin and also getting into resin casting or I want to! I'm going to redo a table my mom. Hand painted by her I'm going to engrave her painting fill it with resin so it's always there forever and then restain the top with unicorn spit wood stain in purple green blue and pink when I can afford it all. I play violin kinda I have to relearn and I read. But not any book ALL the books, text books and real education. I crave knowledge I love it. I paint with my daughter who is an amazing artist. How about you?
My favorite hobby is listening to music. I'm really into K-pop and k-dramas. I have some friends who are also into K-pop. I like how people connect through music and different Fandoms. Thanks for hosting.
Woo congrats on your first contest! I love avocado!   I was torn because reading and playing board games but I'm going to go with reading only because I've been doing it longer. I love it because it takes me to so many new places and gets me out of my own head. I also feel like as a writer, I can learn a lot from reading many different kinds of books. I usually do it on my own but I've just recently joined the RAOA book club so now I can talk with others about the book we're reading, which is fun! I just finished reading All the Ugly and Wonderful Things, gifted to me by the lovely u/hauntedcoffeecup, and highly recommend it. Another favorite book is The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien or The Death Gate Cycle for something fantasy.   Thanks for the contest :D
Hi, thanks for the competition.  My hobby at the moment is writing, i love writing things down for people. I am completing journals and even have one that i share with a pen friend and we swap it every month.   I love writing letters, writing lists, generally writing in all weird and wonderful ways.  I love seeing things too, so seeing it written down in front of me 1) helps with mental health and getting things out of my mind and 2) helps me see the colourful world that we have and can create.   There is so much i can tell you about as this is technically writing but I could go overboard and take over the question :-)
I really love needle felting! Nothing like stabbing things into artwork![Here](https://imgur.com/a/obm44zR) are some of my recent creations!  Thank you for the contest! What are hobbies you enjoy?
Crochet! I’ve gotten more into it over the last few months. I make amigurumis, so far I’ve done a mushroom, a jellyfish, a snake, and a succulent/cactus garden. I also make scarves, beanies, sweaters for my dogs, and am about to try a human sweater for my sister. It’s honestly one of the most relaxing hobbies and really helps anxiety. [Here are a few completed projects.](https://imgur.com/gallery/GFrFk8m)  Avocado on everything please, it’s the best.
Avocado! 🥑 Yay for your first contest! And thanks for hosting!   My hobby is cross stitch! But I do it for nerdy loves of mine, or the occasional snarky word. 😉 My Nan actually taught me when I was younger, but I now find myself to be the only stitcher in the family as my Nan's getting too old for the fiddly bits. She actually started a cross stitch project for my Aunt of her old cottage (she used to live in rural Dorset but has since moved to Barbados!) but couldn't carry on. I've offered to take over, but she now can't find the project as she herself moved not too long ago.   [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/0ETX6OD) are some of my projects past and present, but a couple are NSFW (bad language).  I have a gazzilion patterns and an expanding list of future buys on Etsy... 🙃 I'm desperately in need on a printer so I can print off all my patterns and make a project book! I've tried reading patterns on screen but my eyes are fed up after a day at work.
It won’t let me put an egift card on my list, but if I win, I can DM you my email?  Avocado  My favorite hobby is cooking and baking. I usually do it alone but share the results with friends and family.
Avocado on toast was my first lockdown obsession, haha   My favourite hobby is running. I love the feeling after a run and that I can push myself further each time. I have asthma so its pretty challenging most days but it gives me a lot to grow into! I am running with my partner at the moment who's on week 5 of C25K and its been so nice! I think I'm gonna try to join a running club when all this is over. Not very bizarre though I'm afraid haha. If you don't count my obsessive stats tracking...  What about you u/leiawoozle ?
Hey congrats on your first contest! One of my favorite hobby is playing board games! I love playing with family and friends, it's a great way to bond and show your friendly competitive side. I also love love board games with beautiful art style. I love figuring out the works of a new game, even though it might be difficult at first.   Thanks for hosting! Avocado
Avocado!  My favourite hobby at the moment is cross stitch! It’s super relaxing to me, and not too difficult to create something beautiful!
Avocado  I love bullet Journaling. It's fun, keeps me organized, helps me track my mood. I find it very relaxing.
Avocado!!  I’m getting into water coloring. My 6yo daughter and I have been learning together. It’s been a fun stress relief activity for us to do together.
Congrats on the first contest! I have a bunch of different hobbies (I feel like I rotate to a new one every month), but my tried and true always come back to my love for video games. I love playing them, analyzing them, reviewing them, collecting them, and sharing them with others. Being able to escape into a whole new world and pretend to be something else is a fundamental part of the human imagination, and games can take that to a whole new level while letting you live out crazy fantasies, or telling a beautiful story through it. There's a few friends I really enjoy playing games with, and we can chat for hours about them.  I also enjoy the extra challenges in Playstation games called Trophies, and keep track of all of the games I'm playing and challenges I'm trying to complete [here](https://psnprofiles.com/MisterMagellan). There's even a subreddit devoted specifically to trophy hunting :)  Avocado!
Avocado   Congratulations on you first contest! I warn you it can become additive 😂. I have just moved into my new home so have been looking to start a new hobby now I feel a bit more settled and we are in another lockdown. I’ve been looking into 5D Diamond Art Kits that I think will be enjoyable to do as they are therapeutic as well as something you can make for your home :). I have a couple Of these on my WL with the view to give them a try.   Thanks for the contest! <3
Avocado  I love watching movies with my partner. I like getting to "escape" from my life for a while and watching a good story. Sometimes there's a great soundtrack.
If you haven't already, you should look up cross stitch patterns as well as they work the same way! You might get more inspo as well ☺
I love getting lost in a book!
Woah! That sounds so cool!
Woah! You have so many cool hobbies! I love diamond painting, DnD and playing computer games! Most recently I've been obsessed with Stardew Valley its so cute!!!
Aww they're so cute
I love diamond painting, playing DnD with my mates and playing computer games! I've been playing a lot of Stardew valley recently now that the UK has been put back into lockdown!
Oh my goodness! Those cacti are so cute!
I love them all!!!
Of course!
I love avo toast too! I'm not a runner my self, but my brother is and he also is an obsessive stats tracker XD My main hobbies are diamond painting and other arts, playing DnD and playing computer games!
I love board games too! Me and my family recently got 'Terraforming Mars; for Christmas and its really fun, defo recomend! I also love games with lovely art styles, one of faves is Azul! I agree, figuring out the works of a new game is so much fun! What is your most favourite game?
I keep a digital bullet journal, and I agree its very relaxing!
That's so sweet that you do it with your daughter!
Thanks:) I really just can’t wait until I have a space for a shop and some fun tools to fill it with!
Were working on doing dnd here too
Thanks! A friend lost some of her plants to plant bugs so I decided to make some the bugs wouldn’t want to eat, lol.
Thank you! ☺
Yassss!!!
Aww that's so sweet! A fabulous idea!

u/ZeeSeeQueEs thank you so much! I just arrived home after leaving my grandmother with paramedics after a bad fall in town - really cheered me up to arrive home and find these treats waiting for me ❤️
Yum!!!
Yummy! Enjoy!
Oh no, I hope your grandmother is okay??   No worries, I hope you enjoy all the snacks!!
I hope so! She seems to have dislocated and broken her shoulder and possibly also her humorous in her left arm. We waited 1.5 hours for a rapid response paramedic to arrive, and a further half an hour for an ambulance. Luckily it wasn’t too far from where I live so my mother phoned for me to go to her while she drove the 35 minutes to get here. She’s with her now and it happened almost 3 hours ago but I can still see the ambulance from my window now.   She’s a tough cookie though, she’ll be okay. I’ve never seen her cry before though, that was the hardest part.   Thank you for cheering me up though! ❤️

Hi there, friends! I've never really paid Reddit much attention in the past because... well, I didn't think I really need this site. But I finally caved and made a Reddit account last week in search of pen pals and other friends to talk to during this pandemic -- and boy, do I love it! Everyone here is so nice, friendly, and helpful, and I love being a new member of this community. Just wanted to say thank you to everyone I've interacted with so far, and hello to new friends!

Welcome!! Favorite Disney movie?
Welcome to the both of us!
Hiya!
Hello!
Totally agree!
Hello! I’ve been quite busy studying and spending time with family, but in my free time, I love to write letters to my pen pals, collect stickers, and reread old favorite books as well as discover new ones. What about you?
Thank you!
YES! I am obsessed with collecting stationery and had nothing to do with it until recently when I discovered penpalling!
Thank you!
Thank you! I agree!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Hi Amanda, thank you so much!
Thank you so much!
Thank you so much for the warm welcome! Looking forward to being here!
I totally agree! There’s something about letters that feels so much more personal than a text or an email, haha!
Happy new year to you too, friend! My favorite holiday would definitely have to be Christmas. Although I don’t particularly enjoy cold weather, I love snuggling with my dog and loved ones in warm blankets and sipping hot drinks. Nature? I love flowers (although I’m allergic to them) and just basking in the sun!   That’s awesome! I’ve been working with kiddos with special needs for about 15 years, and I absolutely love it. They bring so much joy into my life! I have a 4 year old yorkie, and he is the light of my life as well :) Mr. JJ is such a cute name!    Thank you so much for the warm welcome!
Hi there! Thank you so much! My current favorite song? Ahhh, it’s so hard to pick just one... but I absolutely love country music, and any one of Thomas Rhett’s songs are amazing!
Thank you! Wow, great question... it’s so hard to choose just one, but I’ve always been a big fan of The Little Mermaid. What about you?
All great things! I have been trying to try new recipes and woodwork a little more often:)
I know it’s such a tough question 😂😂
Oh that’s a good one! I’d have to say The Lion King!
That’s awesome! I wish I could cook... I don’t know how, but I seem to always mess up dishes, even when I follow the recipe 😅
Agreed! What’s your current favorite?
That one always makes me bawl like a baby... 😭
I’m ALWAYS enjoying Mac Miller or Lil Peep! Thanks for asking :)
Of course! Great music choices!
Thank you You’re so sweet!

Yummy!! How sweet!
Thank you so much 💖 you have no idea how much that has improved my day- you are so generous 🥰 I’ve not tried these yet but really looking forward to it... salted caramel is a real weakness for me!
I've never seen them before! They look good. Sorry it's only something small but I hope they're yummy non the less

You’ve spent your own, hard earned money on me- I am so grateful for anything you decide to send! Plus I’m running very low on snacks so this is perfect timing! You’re the best, thank you so much!

Hey RAOA family,  I have a downloadable game code for [Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8zQxSWaotc&ab_channel=Nintendo) for the Nintendo Switch, and I would like to give it away to one lucky user here. This is one of my favorite Switch games and I'm hoping to share it with others. The code will give you:  * Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker (full game) * Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker Special Episode (the DLC) * 230 Gold Coins for your Nintendo Account (equal to $2.30 of free money!)  &#x200B;  This isn't going to be a complicated giveaway, and I'd like to choose someone at random. In order to qualify, you gotta:  * Have a Switch account in US or Canada (sorry international friends, code is only good for North America) * Have gifted someone within the last 2 months (if you haven't gifted someone yet, you can do it while I'm running this giveaway and I'll still count your entry!) * Be active in the community more than just contests and giveaways. * Give this post an upvote (for visibility to others)  And here's what I want you to say in your comment:  * Tell me in your post **who** will be playing this game (yourself, your kids, your spouse, etc) * Tell me a Switch game you love (or a game your family member loves if you don't play games) * Use the phrase "Captain Toad" somewhere in your comment (for randomizer).  I'll choose a winner in roughly 24 hours and send the code out over a Reddit message (or email if you're more comfortable with that). Much love all!
**All Giveaway posts must provide proof of completion to the mods or on a [Gifted] thread.** Failure to provide proof (in the form of a receipt, tracking, a DM for non-physical items, etc) can result in a ban from the Subreddit. You may make a total of one (1) **[Gifted]** post per **[Giveaway]**.           *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon) if you have any questions or concerns.*
This is so incredibly kind! Thank you so much for gifting this wonderful community!! I would be playing this game by myself unfortunately because none of my friends have a switch! My fav switch game is animal crossing for sure! I’ve been playing it since the GameCube days!! Thank you so so much woo Captain Toad !
Captain Toad! I'll be the one playing it, if I win! And if I can convince my dad to try it out, that'd be nice too lol! One game I loveee is the Spyro Reignited Trilogy! Spyro and Mario got me through my childhood, so I love them a lot <3 Thanks for the contest!
I've wanted to try Captain Toad! I'm really the only one in my household that plays the switch - my husband is more interested in PC gaming. I really loved playing Animal Crossing when it first came out. I stopped around Halloween, I should really get back into it!
Captain Road! I'd be the one playing it. Would be something new to keep me busy while my girlfriend is away camping for a few days in a month or so. My favourite switch game right now is Animal Crossing. Been having fun building up my own little island the last several months 😁☺️
Captain Toad!   This would be for my son. He has the Pokémon game and enjoys it a lot.
Captain Toad!  I would be the one playing the game! Another switch game that I love is Ring Fit Adventure! I’m playing it now and it’s a fun way to exercise :)
Captain Toad 🌸  this game looks so so adorable! i would be the one to play it, i love toad! 💗 my current favourite switch games are animal crossing and ssbu! 🌸 thank you so so much for hosting!
What an awesome giveaway! Captain Toad 🍄  I love playing my switch so it would probably mostly be me playing the game! I'm sure my kids would also love to play it with me sometimes 💕   Lately I've been playing Story of Season: Friends of Mineral Town. It is a remake of the game boy advanced game and used to be my favourite game as a kid!
captain toad !   i’ve never heard of this game before so I’m excited to try it! i’ll be playing it and i’m sure my brother will want to play occasionally :’)   my favorite switch game would definitely have to be mario kart. love playing it with my friends!

Hey everyone!! I’m back at work after a long weekend and of course could use some motivation getting through my day!   So my friends and I used to play a game when we were bored and gave each other silly drawing prompts. Some examples are “draw a monkey smoking a hookah while hanging upside down from an umbrella” or “personify a toilet paper roll who’s had a long day at work”    I’m looking to do that with you guys! Leave a drawing prompt here and I will do my best to doodle it for you! Or if you see a drawing prompt here and you want to try your hand at it - give it a shot and share the picture!   I’m not a grade A artist, I am mostly a doodler, but I want to have some fun! Give me and your fellow doodlers something to do! I’ll leave some ideas in the comments too!   Have a happy Tuesday and remember to be kind!! :)
A pirate pineapple with swagger on fire
My first prompt is   Draw a sassy taco!!    (Whatever that means to you. I’m starving and want a taco haha)
Okay...do a toilet that is happy! Now give me one!🥰
A happy plant pot!
Draw a black cat walking on a fence☺️
A seductive octopus.
A sleepy cactus 🌵
A baby in a business suit!
https://imgur.com/a/1AAeFoG  This was pretty funny to figure out! I hope he’s got enough swag!
Same!!!
I’m working on the happy toilet now! Will you doodle me an angry leaf?
https://imgur.com/a/Ve8Owdz   Here’s my happy toilet! She’s overjoyed about her new job
I personally love it!
It must be because it’s Tuesday! Taco Tuesday has be engrained into our minds!
Yesss I'd love to!
I've done it! [angry leaf](https://imgur.com/a/1WXLElv) 🥰 i made it cartooney
Omg i love it! I may have tried too hard for mine😂
Yeah and I am gonna go get tacos and bring em home for dinner...it’s my mission today. 🌮😂

Oh how disgusting it is pulling 3.5ft long strands of hair clumps mottled with 47632 shades of slimy soap scum from the drain. This will be a life changer for you :)!   Also... i love the round keys on that keyboard!
Yessss! I have one of these and it’s amazing!!!
u/burntheships22 thank a bunch!!
Seriously! I have very long hair. Its attached to my head. But for some reason, wet shower hair grosses me out beyond reason.   and thanks! Its the logitech K780 Multi-Device Wireless Keyboard. Its amazing! Wirelessly connects to 3 different devices and you can set custom shortcuts for several of the  buttons up top, and its dual mac/pc so I can use it with my work pc, then my personal mac, and also my iphone. We also have the connecting mouse which is great as well!
I can't wait to try it out!
You are very welcome!

I'm waiting for something to be grateful for, it's only Tuesday and it's been a WEEK.  I'm excited to see everyone's else's answers though, fully prepared to have a big smile on my face when I come back to this thread.
I am grateful that for the first time in my life, I am not stressed about money when it comes to getting my car's oil changed/check up.   Every single time it comes up I have been strapped for cash, at a rough point, or just it really isn't in the cards. I've had to borrow and scrimp to keep my car healthy because dammit she's important.  And let's be honest...even though it is something I can plan for, being poor is rough. When she needed new tires I had to borrow the money.  But this time, for the first time, I'm picking her up a noon and she'll be so fresh and healthy...and I have enough in the bank to not worry about if I can eat after. I may hate my job but I am starting to feel the effects of the stability this week and for that I am grateful.
I'm grateful to my family who are my source of strength and their belief in me is what keeps me motivated in my job search.
I’m grateful for good doctors that still care, because I can only imagine how exhausted they are and how easy it would be for some of em to throw their hands up. ☺️
I'm grateful to have my wife making progress regarding her health conditions and for my son getting smarter every single day 💜 I hope your day turns around soon
I'm grateful for my family, they have been so supportive recently, while I struggle through online school XD
I'm so sorry for your bad day. I really hope it gets better! I understand the roller coaster completely. I am really grateful for my local library. Getting out and picking up my books on hold even though it's curbside has been a lifesaver. In fact I treated the librarians to coffee and bagels the other day, because I am just SO dang grateful that they are there. Books with beautiful pictures, or stories to escape into with my kids has kept me afloat with heartfelt gratitude during this difficult time.
My family!
My kitties! Even after puking in my shoes lol  They're so warm and comforting and I really need some of that this week.
Today is rough. I'm sitting here with my feet together knees bent to try and mitigate the pain in my lower back. Yeah it's a rough day I can't even fake it.    I do however hope that you have have a simply marvelous day. This group is amazing and I'm glad I found it.
I'm grateful to still have a job, a roof over my head, and food to eat.  I'm also grateful for my boyfriend and my friends.
I'm grateful for stuffed animals. They give me much needed cuddles.
Grateful for a short work week. I'm sorry you're having a rough day. I hope it turns around!
It absolutely has been a long week, hasn't it? Sending so much good vibes!!
I hope your bad day gets better u/space_noodlers. You're the bees knees <3
That's amazing!!! Go you!!!!!!!
Yes! This!!!
That's awesome!! Go your family!! (:
It sounds like you have a good family!!!
Thank you! I took advantage of the library curbside at the beginning of the pandemic, and I haven't since. Thank you for reminding me that I need to get back into it!!!
Sending you all my love and good vibes! I hope today gets better for you!! I'm here if you need a friend!
What's your favorite stuffed animal?  I've only got one and it's a stuffed dalmation I've had since I was a kid.  It's been through a lot, my real dog chewed out it's eye at one point.
[my stuffed animal](https://imgur.com/a/2nljQQW)  I love birds of prey so this is my baby.
God, yes!  Sending good vibes your way too!!  Thank you <3
Thank youuu! You are toooooo!
Yes! I love them so much <3
Yay! I'm glad. Sometimes I get stuck in a mental loop, and looking at something new helps shake me loose! Hang in there!
I don't usually have days like this. It started last night. Just mopey. Then this morning I can barely flipping walk and of course the kitties need food. It would help if they all actually ate the same damn thing at the same damn time. But they got fed. Then I managed to get coffee. But that's it. Can't do more. Sounds fine, right? Nope because then my oldest cat (7) decides to stink the whole downstairs up by using the litter box. Never mind that he was just outside!!shoot me?
Oh!! I love that!! I don't have any from when I was a kid, but I have a unicorn and an elephant that I cuddle with all the time!!
I love!!!!!!!!!
Sending so much hugs!
He’s well loved/hugged. 💛

Hey! I'm new to this sub but not to Reddit. I'd normally not do intro posts like this necessarily but I'd like to make a contest post tomorrow. I'm not sure if the rules preclude me from doing so just out of nowhere without having introduced myself at least so here we are.  I'm 33m from NY but the ol' rona's had me stuck overseas for work for quite some time now. I've done too much boredom shopping online for myself over the course of this extended work-trip so I thought I'd have a little fun in this sub with you fine folks. I guess ama?

Hello!
Welcome to the sub! Where overseas have you been? I might prefer to be overseas right now rather than here in NY haha.
Hello and welcome! What's your favorite place you've traveled and what was your favorite food from there?
Warm welcome!!!! This sub will def ease your boredom away! 😄
Hi! 'rona ruined more than one trip for me. I hope you aren't stuck much longer! What is your favorite thing you have seen/done/experienced in your travels?

Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Sorry, I hate to be super vague but I'm just going to answer the Middle East. But thanks for asking and for welcoming me! :-)
Thank you! I've been to Australia, Sri Lanka, Austria, the UK, Italy, the UAE, and a few more countries in the Middle East that I won't specify. Also Canada which isn't "overseas" but still another country.  That said, you probably don't want to be where I am currently lol but I don't mind it. Have you been outside the US much yourself? If so where, if not where would you want to go first if given the opportunity?
Oops sorry. Didn’t mean to be creepy 😆. That is a fantastic answer I was just curious about generalish area so that I can ask my next question. What’s the best food you’ve had there so far
Wow! Which was your favorite? Australia is high on my bucket list. I have been to Italy, Hungary, Austria (but only for one day), Spain, France, Canada, and Mexico (though only to a resort so I don't really count it).
Haha no you're not creepy at all!   That's a toss up for me and it depends on how you'd define "best" I suppose.  Best in terms of its just delicious and cheap that I could eat every day? Shawarma from a family owned or street vendor type place. So good.  Best in terms of cultural experience though is Biryani. It's a spiced rice and meat dish but any time I've had it, it's been served on an enormous platter which we all sit around (on the floor) and eat together. Definitely not the type of food or experience I'd ever see at home and I love to partake in those kinds of cultural activities and traditions etc.
Australia was awesome because I spent three weeks there and got to see and do a lot. I hope you get to visit!  I'd have to say my favorite was Sri Lanka though! I went for the stupidest reason on a complete whim when I was in the UAE... The UAE didn't have Taco Bell and well, after like 8 months I wanted Taco Bell lol. The closest country that had one that I could travel to and get a visa on arrival was Sri Lanka. So a few days later my co-worker and I were on a plane lmao. Obviously not to travel to a foreign country for a weekend JUST for sub-par tacos, we contacted a travel guide who chauffeured us around his nation and took us to what he thought were the most significant and interesting sites to see. It was amazing and he had so much valuable information to pass to us and took us to see things I'd never have found on Google. The first morning when he picked us up from the airport, he took us to his favorite hotel/restaurant for breakfast and we basically just had him order for us lol. We ended up with a great curry dish which seems weird for breakfast but isn't, and a great spread of fruit and breads. And tea of course because Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon, has some of the best tea in the world ❤️  Our guide there and everyone else we came across were some of the most hospitable I'd ever met. Truly good people. It was heartbreaking that a few months afterwards were the Easter bombings where terrorists killed over 100 people... 😢
Mmmmmmmmmmm.  And sweets?
Oh that sounds great. That's definitely the trip I'd like to make. Enough time to see a good swath of the country.   LOL that's so funny that that's why you ended up going to Sri Lanka and yet it was your favorite. That sounds like such a cool trip and it's great that you got to see the country from a local's perspective. I love that. Though ugh yeah that is really sad :(
Oh boy that's even harder lol. I can't spell half of it but many desserts here are similar in flavor profile to baklava - heavy on honey (or date honey) for sweetness and I love them all! And just dates in general I guess are prolific around here so if you like dates, which I do, you'll have a good time!  Have you travelled outside your home country much? If so what's your favorite international cuisine you've experienced?
I’ve only been out of the US once to Mexico. But I’m from New Mexico. So foods and such are similar. So my experience is very limited. That said I would love to tour the world in food.
Personally I prefer knaffe over baklawa, if you haven't tried it yet I really recommend you to try it (some kind of sour cheese with a layer of kadaif on top of it, usually sprinkled with crushed pistachios and covered with sugar syrup.  You probably seen it around, that's the flat orange thingy, really my favorite out of the arab sweets.  Usually my dad brings home a platter of knaffe from nazareth every Christmas due to visiting there for work, best knaffe in israel in my opinion ☺️
Yes, I had to Google it but I HAVE had that and it's also fantastic. Only once and I didn't know what it was called so thank you!
No problem!  Happy that someone else got to taste the food in our area of the world 😉  I guess you don't have places that sell sabich where you are, but if you do I recommend it too, not that pretty looking of a food, but so many flavours, really good!
I Googled that as well and I'm guessing probably not, you're right. Wikipedia says "Its ingredients are based on a traditional Shabbat breakfast..." so as far as flavor goes, I might be familiar but not exactly. I bet it's great though!
It's a traditional jewish-iraqi food. But in israel there are many places making sabich, so keep that in mind if you'll ever come here 😉

I too can’t stop collecting sewing tins
Have you checked that there aren’t sewing supplies in there instead of cookies?
u/integralmom87 Thanks so much for the delicious cookies! I am absolutely obsessed with these things, lol. Sooo good!! Thank you so much!! I hope you have a great day! :)
these are delicious!!! hope you enjoy!!
So good!!
Is there really sewing supplies in there!?!
It's a very nice sewing tin indeed
Haha. Can confirm, there are cookies. Though in about 72 hours, that will probably be a different story! 😜😆
Thank you!! :)
Thanks! I love these! :)
Haha, no. The tins are just known for being used for sewing supplies and things like that, lol. Like a lot of people grandparents would have one of these tins around the house filled with sewing supplies! I do use a few of the tins for crafty supplies, but I eat them so often now that I can’t save anymore tins! Haha. XD

u/SmallGingerLady surprised me with the BEAUTIFUL bathtub tray which comes at the perfect time...because mine broke.  But I so wanted to make a nicely set-up photo but I just can't seem to get time to myself for a bath! I WANT TO USE IT SO MUCH!  Thank you so much for this gift. It is giving me something hella sweet to look forward too!
I hope you find time for your bath soon! Can you show us what the tray looks like in general? :)
Ahh you’re welcome!! I saw it and was like, “Yes 2021: the year of relaxing.”
Like...it is still in the box in my living room with a bath bomb and a cider picked out on top of it.   I'm gonna drink a Summit Cider Chocolate Cherry and have an Intergalactic Lush bathbomb! Gonna listen to the new book u/Nazetel bought me (: maybe this weekend?   My old one (that didn't break during bathtime but rather during a bathroom cleaning lol) is now by the door to take to the dump. So long old friend. You've served me well these 7 years!
Gosh it took FOREVER to find which one it was!  [The Beautiful Tray!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RZKDKXX/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_CwXbGbBGNN4RK)  I'm gonna try an do a selfie post or something when I can set it up. It is actually much bigger than I thought which is why it is still in the box. Much more durable than my old one! Which...lasted 7 years so holy crap.
Well 19 days in and I haven't had a chance to take that relaxing bath but dammit if I ain't determined to RELAX.   And with your help it WILL happen. Lol Thank you thank you thank you! This tray is gorgeous!
Wow it's so pretty!!!
I know! It comes with a holder for soap AND this great nail cleaner. I was floored when I realized what it was!
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/l0opnj/discussion_who_made_2020_better_for_you_here_and/

My grandkids were lifelines via Skype and Zoom. I talked with a couple of them more frequently because they were home which is in contrast to friends who I’ve felt isolated from during this stay at home time. Several people have been really generous and welcoming here and I’m grateful for this née-to-me community.
On here I can say without hesitation u/PsychologicalPenguin absolutely made my year! She’s such a sweet and wonderful person and has become one of my close friends (and my brownie wife but that’s another story). Special mentions also to u/JohnWoods1023 who is also an amazing human and someone I enjoy hanging out with a lot!   IRL... I don’t know... my students always make my life better but being online a lot did not bring me the joy in person teaching does. But for the few months we were in person then definitely them 😊
Anyone who ever chatted with me here or asked how my day was going in this sub made my day significantly better. Sometimes just remembering my name and asking how I am can be the highlight of my day.   As for irl, my friends and family, although my family is also often a big cause of my stress. Just being honest.
I would have definitely been lost without u/zx7319 ♥️ she's my angel
I wasn't in this sub during 2020, but reddit Secret Santa really cheered me up.  It was lovely to be able to gift someone!  IRL, my husband and kiddo, and of course the pups.  Miraculously, we had a pretty good year, all things considered.  Sure, it was tough - lots of trips canceled, isolation and a little boredom, but we were able to have food in our bellies and a roof over our heads.  We cannot complain.
Here would be u/Zeunicorn of course! :-) She gives me something to look forward to every day and I just absolutely adore her. We have a lifelong contract requiring us to be friends, that's how much we don't want to lose each other 👀  IRL is the boyfriend and the best boi Zeus. I can always count on them to be there when I need them most and to help calm me down from the clutches of anxiety
My friends definitely, they kept me sane and while I went through some rather dark times, they always listened to me 😊 i don't know what I would do without them, they were and still are my superheroes 😁
😍😍😍😍 I love yyooooouuu
Lifelong contract friendships are the best!! I love you sooooo much! 💜💜
Love youuuuuuu toooooooooo 💜💜💜💜

Hello and welcome!
I married an Indian guy and we decided to move here. Hoping to move to Mexico in the coming years.
Thank you!
Hello! I like it, life is good here but there is no place like home. I miss my family, the food, and driving! Lol
Hey! I couldn’t find where/how to add my wishlist. Any help? I am housewife- my visa doesn’t allow me to work. I am more of a dog person. 🙃
Thank you!! 😊
Thank you! 😊
Thank you! I am from Puebla. Have you been?
I miss it terribly... but I guess I miss my family the most... and tacos... real tacos! 😊😅
Thanks! 😊
Thank you!
Thank you!
Hello! Thank you! I enjoy painting with acrylics, trying to go into watercolors but itms taking time. I love baking! Also, I’m working hard on making a habit of updating my bujo/agenda. How about you?
Hello and thank you! Yes, I love India! Although it’s been challenging and adding pandemic it’s extra challenging in terms of meeting new people. Bless technology for keeping us close to our people!
How are you liking your new country?
Read the comment by AutoModerator on this post. It has all the information you need!   Do you currently have any dogs? Or any other pets?
Not to Puebla but I love Mexico City! Mi abuelita es de Guanajuato
Family and food! Lol I get that so much.
I love resin and crocheting! :D and so many other crafts like embroidery and diamondpaintings! :D
Yeah, it’s not bacd, but definitely has been difficult, specially to make friends. But overall is a good place to be.
Will do, thanks! I don’t have a dog unfortunately... I want a dachshund but have not been lucky. Do you have pets?
I get that. I live on a military base and have no friends
I’ll be your friend! Also because I love coffee 😄
Coffee is always a good thing next to food
Agree 100%

Just finished PIB Science Fair.  It was a page turner!  Haha!  No sarcasm intended.  I actually enjoyed this one the most out of the five we have.  My daughter likes to dress up as her own version,  Princess in Capes (where she wears every cape she and her brother own).
That’s so adorable!

I think it’s time I return, given all of the time I have on my hands resulting from the pandemic 😷.   Here’s a little about me:   My name is Abby, but you can call me Arose/AroseRisen. I am an artist, I do digital drawings and acrylic paintings in my free time! I hope to one day profit off of my work, but right now I just post my digital art publically on my [art page](https://instagram.com/arosedoodles?igshid=t4y2mkkq2bte). I also love to garden, hang out with my cat and puppy, and I really enjoy doing home improvement projects!  I’m excited to be back here, and look forward to making new friends! ✨
Hii! You've got a beautiful color scheme for your art, what inspires you the most?
WELCOME BACK DUDE
Hello Arose, welcome back! I love your life is ruff art piece. What's your favorite hot beverage?
Hey! Welcome back, you sounds like a really creative soul! I love gardening too
Welcome back!
welcome back! I hope I can profit off of my embroidery some day too. Mostly to offset the costs of fabric and materials for when I sew something. All the fabric, lining fabric, buttons etc I got for my next sewing project added up to over $100 (crying). This is why hand made stuff is expensive...I have yet to make it too. I put all my embroidery up too, on my account on imgur!  [Embroidery- a newly learned (and still learning) hobby  - art post - Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/ceqIM0t)   &#x200B;  I really like the colors you use in your art. do you do it digitally?
Hello! Welcome to RAOA! 👋 I’m Lily, it’s so nice to meet you! I hope that we can be friends! Being a newbie can be pretty tricky, so if you need help with anything - or just want to chat - feel free to PM me and I will assist you to the best of my ability! ✨💛
Hi! Rewelcome back! Enjoy!! What is your favorite song right now!!
Welcome back Arose! I love your art style. Do you have any major influencers?    I'd love to talk about art anytime! I mainly doodle for a fun side hobby, but I'm always open to talk about anything. I watch a lot of DIY videos but I'm pretty hopeless when it comes to home improvement projects personally. Do you have any fun projects planned? c:

Thank you!! I usually just draw based on my emotions or things that I’ve been thinking or dwelling on. I take inspiration from my internal workings lol
Thaaanks :)
Thank you! And I love hot chocolate
Thank you!! And yes gardening is the best. I’m growing a few batches of veggies right now and my green beans are close to being ready to pick :)
Oh cool I love embroidery! And yeah I use a drawing tablet to draw my artwork
Hey lily! Thanks For being so welcoming :)
My favorite song right now.... that’s a difficult question lol. I like machine gun kelly and rod wave atm though
I would love to see some of your doodles! And I recently redid my kitchen floor and applied adhesive backwash to the sink wall, aside from that no major projects planned atm
That's cool, I used to do oil paintings but it's been a while, I tried my hands on digital work but I am not so patient now lol
I feel Yah! I’m on a big Mgk and lil peep kick right now!
We should have a doodle day activity and do themes! I don't have a portfolio or I'd send you some. :'c  Oooh, I love seeing people add backwash to their kitchen wall. I bet it looks so great!

Yummy!!
Thank you so much!! I can't wait to try these
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/l0a7ha/contest_because_math_is_hard/
[contest closed] thank you for participating! It was so fun to see what everyone’s goals are!! Congrats u/fictionEF !   I just finished a math quiz and feel like putting some positivity into the universe, rather than dwelling on my poor math skills.   Comment a realistic goal you are working on this year.   U.S. only, or gift card on your wishlist.   Aaaaaaand go!  Edit: I will pick a winner by 9am pacific time tomorrow.
Math is tough! 😭  My goal is to do yoga atleast 3 times a week
I’m trying to get more steps than u/ricctp6   u/huntfishcamp looks bro it’s math
Math is the WORST. I totally feel for you. Thanks for hosting!! :)  A goal I’m working on this new year is being better at talking on the phone. If a call is important I usually write myself out a script beforehand, so I’m trying to work on that and take more calls without over-stressing what I’m going to say!
I’m working on getting a new life started after getting sole custody of my oldest son that I’d fought for since 2007. I want a new home, a fresh coat of paint, anything that will make him settle in and know he’s loved.
I’m learning all the lyrics to Gangster’s paradise! I got about half of it
I am aiming to walk, run, cycle, move 40km a month until July. If I walk a km a day it’s so achievable. Just need to do that little extra.   Thanks for this one. I like seeing other people’s aims
Hope you did well on your quiz!   I’m hoping to read more, at least 30 books this year.
im sure you did great on your math quiz!   i’m hoping to stop being scared of applying to internships/jobs. i’ve always put aside working on my resume and applying to those. this year, i’m hoping to apply to 5 or so internships/jobs for the summer.
Doing yoga 3 times a week and meditation 3 times a week. It's hard to stay active and realistically I'm not gunna do it everyday. So I figured 3 times a week wasnt bad!!
I’m going to drink more water. Super realistic lol
I’m working on getting healthier. I’m exercising more and eating better. Woohoo!
I'm working on my mental health. I'm trying to fix all the broken and heal all the not so broken.
muscles! i need to be more ***consistent*** with my strength training 🏋🏻‍♀️
Math is so hard.   This year I am learning a new hobby, quilting! I just got my sewing machine on Saturday and should be able to start making my quilt top tomorrow! Before this I hadn’t touched a sewing machine since 9th grade which was about 12 years ago! I made a pillow. 😂
I’m working on working out more consistently... I’m always good for short periods at a time but I need to make it a habit! I’m aiming for 3-4 times a week
This year I am hoping to be able to replace our water heater and insulate the attic! We're hiring professionals for both, but are excited to have hot water and a hot house! :D     Also as a teacher as long as you tried your best you should be proud no matter what grade you get. In the long run it's hard work that will take you far in life.
I am currently taking a graduate stats class.   Good god is all I can say. I hate math. Khan Academy and Youtube are wonderful tools, though!    Goal: lose my baby fat from grad school, lmao
My goal this year is to treat myself the way I treat others. I am incredibly hard on myself and generally very critical of anything I do. I'm the opposite when it comes to others. I want to talk to myself like I do everyone else.
I'd really love to finish my book and put in some illustrations >u< So far I've got a bit of it done, but I'm just worried it'll feel like a chore instead of fun.   Math skillz can't measure your intelligence, or your attitude, or you big heart. I wish you luck in your class <3
Thanks for the contest!   I lost 100 pounds over the last two years only to gain 10 back during COVID. My realistic goal is to lose 23 pounds this year to reach my goal weight.  Math teacher here 😬😀 ... don’t give up ... you will get through it. Just do your best. Sending good math vibes your way! 😀😃
My goal for this year is to be debt free. I only have a little bit left to go and i am so excited to get my life back together.  I hope you passed your quiz!!
I have abysmally bad math skills too. I have nightmares of high school math 16 years later. Ugh! Anyway, onto a more positive note!  My goal is to read 30 books this year. I have read 4 so far. I think I'll be able to do it and maybe read even more.
My realistic goal for this year is to try and make some sort of content, wether that's starting and following through with streaming, making more digital art, making paintings or something that I can sell as an income. Maybe all of that of my daughter lets me have a few hours a day to myself haha
My goal for this year is finally graduating! It’s been stressful four years, and I can’t wait to be done with school for a little while!!
My goal for this year is to read (at least) 20 books :)
I’m really trying hard to get back into a good routine in life. And oh yea, get a job! lol   P.s. totally agree that math is hard!
My goal for this year is to get back into college
Taking a multivitamin! I know that sounds super lame, but every year I start out strong and then two weeks in I stop. I’m determined to make this year different lol. Also, math was my enemy in school and I always dreaded it so I’m sending positive vibes your way! ✨✨✨
Realistic goal...I’m going to teach my son how to bake a cake from scratch. He’s 8. I’m going to finish teaching my 5 year old her numbers for kindergarten
Okay math is absolutely awful and was always the one subject to make me want to rip my hair out of my head.‘I just didn’t understand it, ever. 😭 But I’m sure you did fine on your math test, sending good luck! 🤞🏼  A goal I’m trying to work on this year is drinking more water. And honestly, I’m not doing all that great. I just... forget to drink water ugh! (Also any tips on helping me drink more are greatly appreciated lol).   Thanks for hosting!
Hope your quiz went well!  My goal is to have a better attitude about my job.   I tutor math, and sometimes, I get frustrated with the public education system. Today, I had a 5th grader who told me that half of 10 was 11. It bothers me that this kid isn’t getting the attention they deserve.
Losing 50 pounds
This year I am working to try to find a job that I love, hopefully that can be done from home.  Thank you for the contest!
Hope you did well on your quiz.   I'm trying to obtain tenure and to also move out.
I'm working this year on moving more and writing more 💖 I plan to work my way back up to a 5k a day by the summer time and then train for longer runs. Writing is a bit more fluid, but I've set aside a set amount of time each day to write and I'll see what comes of it 😃  On a non contest note, I'm a math teacher with degrees in mathematics and statistical analysis. If you'd ever like to ask questions/get some tutoring before a math quiz or test, hit me up. I'm one of those weirdos who loves math and enjoys helping others understand it.
Find a job that I love.   If you ever need help with math, let me know!
I want to get my A1C under 7 🤩
I want to lose weight my goal is altogether 120 lbs I did a chest day today and ate one double cheese burger lol my bad but I will continue to work on my goal I do small exercises currently cause I fractured my right rib but yes my goal is 120lbs by middle of next year.
I want to see my abs before the age of 30 (Jan 16 next year. I have less than 346 days to go
I’m working on saving money! Me and my bf of eight years are hopefully moving in together at the end of next year and i want to save up for that goal :) thanks for hosting this contest and math sucks
Depending on how long it takes my hand and hip to heal, get a job as a zookeeper in another state, move, and finally get an apartment (I currently live with my grandparents as I have my whole life and I got a taste of living on my own this summer and now I crave it, lol)
I would like to get at least two A’s this semester. Thank you!
i am currently working on recycling more and picking more eco friendly options! 💗🌸
My goal is to find more ways to successfully silence my anxious thoughts
Dry January. So far, so good!  Thanks for hosting a contest.
Thanks for hosting. I am trying to get more fit. So I’ve been working out more.
I'm working on my creativity this year! I started the year by saying I wanted to learn embroidery, but I've broadened by horizons a bit! Instead, I want to be more creative!  I want to try to learn cross-stitch, get back into scrapbooking, and I reallyyyy want to get a pen pal and make pretty letters with paper and stickers lol! Overall, I want to make beautiful things and focus on skills that I truly enjoy! <3  And I want to read more, I guess lmao
Oof, math.  That was never my strong suit.  Here's to hoping you scored better than I ever did in school.  Goals?  I'm working on getting healthy this year......again.  I was doing really well on my fittness journey for awhile.  I had this really great situation where I could use the gym at my work.  I would go on my breaks and after work.  I lost over 25 pounds, which was huge for me.  All of this changed when COVID hit and the gyms closed.  I think some gyms have started opening up, but my work gym has remained closed.  I've finally decided to stop waiting for it to open again, which may never happen, and take my destiny into my own hands.  I've started working out at home using YouTube videos.  It's been tough, but I've been pushing through!
I’m learning spanish
I want to read 75 books by the end of the year. So far, I'm on-track.
Hope the quiz went better than you are expecting!  This year, I am focussing on my weight loss journey again. Past 6 months, I lost 50ish. I keep slipping and going on a binge which leads to weeklong binges. So, ive been spending the past several months gaining and losing the same weight.   Today was my first day back on track. Gotta keep it up. I have so much to lose, but just eating decently makes me feel in a different world.
I'm working on losing more weight! I lost 50 pounds last year and would love to lose 20-30 more!
I hope your math quiz went well!  I want to publish the sequel to my children's picture book. So this might sound unrealistic but I did publish a book last year on amazon so I want to do that again this year.
I'm working on getting confident enough speaking spanish that I can schedule an appointment for a patient who doesn't speak English without having to ask for help
Working on waking up early everyday for my new job! Waking up at 6 am is super super hard for me right now.
Working on getting my room and especially my closet properly organised to save some space and also in preparation for a big move (I feel like packing will be a lot easier if things are neat and organised before going in boxes 😂).
I feel you, math is super hard! Math was never my subject growing up.  My realistic goal for 2021 is eating healthier meals. I’ve always been a picky eater, so I struggle to get a variety of foods on my plate. Because of this, I fail to get enough protein and other nutrients my body needs. This year, I want to start eating smarter for my health.  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
God I hate math.   I’m quitting pop/soda/whatever you call it.  So far so good....
My super realistic goal is to hang up our art and photos in our new place. We’ve just started and it is sloooowwww going!
I want to work on getting a job and just being happier and less bitter. I feel like I shouldn't rush things and worry about everything as well.
Math was the only subject in school that made me cry and almost gave panic attacks. Math and I are not friends.  One of my goals this year (when the weather permits) is to swim several time per week.
I would like to have two surgeries in time to let me go to college in the fall. All I have to do is convince two surgeons..... Should be doable.
I am going to convert the loft from an office to a nursery, complete with new half walls to replace the bar railing
My goal is to practice self care more this year. I really suck at it.
I'm trying to finish a few classes that I put off.
My goal this year is to grow a 9 ft tall sunflower! Last summer I got up to 8ft. It was great!  Also. I enjoyed math until geometry. I'm great at algebra
I feel you on the poor math skills. I'm trying to work on weight loss and improving my overall health this year. I realize that may sound very generic, but this is the first year I've given enough shits to actually make it a goal of mine- so I'm feeling inspired ❣️
I have been working on writing a book for the past 5 years. I want to finally finish it this year. It's a collection of short stories about mental health. I want it to help people know they're not alone. It's a lot of work, but I know I can do it! <3
My goal is to talk to more people and make new friends!
I have been working really hard on losing weight. I started really going all out in November working with a trainer and tracking my food intake, lifting weights, and tracking my steps to get 10K a day. Today was day 60! My goal this year is to lose 50lbs. That’s quite a bit of weight but I’m working to ensure it happens
One of my bigger, but I believe still realistic, goals for 2021 is to work on voice acting. Nothing crazy, but I would like to read a book or two, watch lessons, practice my voices and characters, create a notebook full of different voices and characters I can reliably do, and record portions of an audiobook (at least for fun).  My smaller, also fun goal is to record video games that I play and write up mini reviews for them! I love making lists of games I beat, enjoyed, top 10, and sharing that list with friends and fellow redditors.
A goal I met already this year was starting a retirement fund. Another one was learning how to knit stuffed animals for my son. Actually had to learn crochet for that, so now I have to get better at crochet.  A long time goal I have yet to reach is learning how to knit a sweater. I also want to go tubing down the river near my house at least once this summer.  I started on a weight loss goal last year, lost 20 pounds in two months, then had surgery. So I guess my new goal is to lose 30 pounds by next year. The ultimate reason for this is to be able to wear a corset my partner bought for me our first summer together. And to instill good eating habits in my son.
One of my short term goals is putting $1000 in to my savings. My long term goal is to finish up my associates degree and look to pursue a higher paying job or start my own business.  I hate math too /:  Thanks for being so kind, good luck to everyone :)
I have been working in a research lab for several years, the conference I wanted to submit my work for was cancelled due to covid, but 2021 may be different. As such, I’m writing up my work and hoping to submit in April!
I’m going to try to log 150 meditation sessions this year!
I'm working on losing weight. Down 11 pounds in 12 days so far! Also working on getting enough money saved up to go to South Korea to teach and live my dream this year!
Learn to water color.
Congrats! Math is no easy thing:)   I am trying to pass my end of year exam! Fingers crossed 🤞
Hope you did well on your quiz!!! Math can be hard. i was really slow at math until i took a kaplan sat prep workshop that taught some easy shortcuts 😉  my goal: Potty train two toddlers, one with special needs. Realistic goal vs. headstrong little boys. 👀🤣🎉
Which math are you taking? Maybe I can help
I’m working on *s l o w I n g d o w n*. I need a year of self care and maybe eat some fruit off the tree.
Math was so close to being my downfall in college. I had to change my major concentration to reduce the math credits I needed for my degree. But, if I could do it, so can you. Ask for help when you need it and YouTube is amazing.   My goal this year is to get my ankle working properly again after I messed it up so that I can get back to hiking and also going on more hikes than before my injury.
I want to become someone who is clean and organized. I was heavily depressed at our old place. Our dishes were stacked high and moldy. Trash all over the counters. We live in a much nicer space now and it's not that bad anymore but it's still VERY messy by any normal persons standards. I want my home to be clean and maintain it.
My goal this year is to finally get a breast reduction so that 1. I can be in significantly less pain. And 2. So I can be one step closer to being comfortable in my own body. I identify as non-binary but it’s kinda hard to tell looking at me so I want to change that one little step at a time!   I hope your quiz wasn’t too stressful and that you did well!
Omg I'm so bad at math 😭 im so bad with numbers, I'm more of a word person. But cheer up there's always another quiz to do your best on!   I'm working on NOT sleeping on my online classes this semester. 2 hour long classes got me dozing off. Thanks for hosting!
Goal of organizing my drawers lol 😂 I let them become messy this past year
good for you for pressing forward! I am working on being able to do pushups better! (I want to do 30 full-pushups in a row)
A realistic goal I am working on this year is writing a novel 😁
my goal is getting into nursing school this fall  and also being happy
My goal this year is to be able to hold a basic conversation in Japanese! Hopefully by summer or the end of the year! I'm really excited!   Thank you for helping me put my goals into words!
Thanks for posting a fun idea for a contest.  It’s been difficult to stay motivated to stay in reasonable shape without any deadlines for me to be ready by.  My goal... Be able to run 3.1 miles or 5K at a pace that’s fast to me by the end of March.  Then do longer events if such things are open/available later on this year.
Getting out of bed. I have fibromyalgia and other pain related issues and I want to get be able to get out of bed and stay out of bed for a few hours at least.
I'm working on reading 75 books this year, which is realistic but also challenging, so I think it's a good balance. Thanks for the contest and good luck on the math quiz!
I'm going to complete a 30 day Yoga with Adrienne challenge... as long as it takes me so long as I finish the series by the end of the year!
I should be graduating in December of 2021! So that’s my goal.
i'm working on cooking more!! and thus far i'm already doing a lot better, my goal addendum is to grow at least one vegetable for myself
I’m trying to read more and Intermittent fasting...  So far so good!!
I am trying to move more. I worked from home even before the 'rona so some days it is hard to find motivation to even get dressed.
Getting to 145 lbs. I know I can do it, but I need to stop eating cake.
Eating healthier. I am not satisfied with where I am weight-wise.
I made a resolution to participate more in the sub, instead of just Discord. Thanks for the contest!
I’m working on eating healthier and losing a little weight :)
I want to start eating more  and better food and hopefully get back to a healthy weight!
This is a tricky question but I have to say my body I've had issues with stretch marks for a while and I'm trying to lose weight to get rid of them, It's been a rough couple of years but I feel like I'm starting it off good with workouts
one of my goals is to drink more water!
A realistic goal that I am working towards this year is paying off our debt completely! We are close and have managed to not create any more debt lately so that’s nice too. We will be 100% debt free this year    Thanks for the contest and I hope you passed your quiz!
thank you so so so so much u/mrsjanssen!! I cannot thank you enough for this opportunity!! you are an absolute gem to this community!  personally I'm just trying to get my mental health a bit better and to get into my dream college!! since I'm going to study abroad I'd really like to get into the college I've always dreamt of so I'm holding my breath and pulling out all the stops to get in!!! how about you, do you have any goals for this year?  if I were to win it would be better if I got the gift card since I live in South Africa hehe!!  once again thank you so so so much for this opportunity!! I hope you know that you are loved and appreciated!!
My goal is to identify my food sensitivities and eliminate them from my diet. I found out I have some allergies to food this year but am still having mild symptoms and so now am exploring the wider range of sensitivities which means the body can’t digest them.
Me too
Nice!
I saw! I love math. I want to teach the world to love math 💖
You can do it!!!! 🎉☺️
That’s a great tactic!
You got this! I know all the words. It’s a great song!
That is AWESOME!! I love it!!
I LOVE THAT SONG!!
YES!!! I need to do that! Thats such a great goal!
Yay what a great goal! I love reading!
Putting yourself out there can be hard. I bet you have a lot of qualities that these companies are looking for. Go after it!
That’s a good plan! Yoga is hard, at least for me!
It’s tougher than it sounds! You got this!
Good job!!
I totally understand what you’re saying. If you ever need to talk, I’m here.
Get it!
How fun is that?! My mom was really into quilting. I bet your pillow is awesome :)
I’ve been told that if you do something for 21 days, it becomes a habit. I’m sure you’ll get into a good routine soon! Stick with it!
I hope you get those done soon! I get cold easily, so those are both important creature comforts for me.   Thank you for the words of encouragement!
I am also incorporating Khan Academy into my studies. He’s a little different than our lecture videos, but I’ll manage.   That’s a good goal!
You deserve the same love you put out!
Nice!  Thank you, that means a lot!
Congrats! What a great accomplishment!  Thank you, I’ll take all the good math vibes I can get!
You got this!! Yayyyyy you’re almost done!!!
OH I feel that!! Way to go!! You're so close and you got this! <3
I really wish I had that kind of reading drive!!
Good luck! Sounds doable!
LETS DO THIS!!
Routine is hard since COVID. You got this!
Amazing! What will you major in? I’m in my nursing prerequisites now!
That’s not lame! Taking care of ourselves is important!  Thank you for the math vibes!
This is such an awesome goal! You sound like a great mom!
Thank you!  I like to collect different cute water bottles. It makes me drink more water because they are cute but also ONLY used for water (a rule I make).
Yikes. That is frustrating. Is there an option for tutoring for him?
I’m rooting for you!
What type of job are you looking for?
Both sound very attainable with some hard work. What industry are you in?
You’ll knock it out of the park!  Thank you! I really am struggling to keep a good grade in math which is required to get into the nursing program I’m after. I’m stressed!
What type of industry?  Thanks! I might actually take you up on that
You can do it!
I’m rooting for you!
You got this!!
Get it! My husband and I both have savings accounts that aren’t linked to our regular accounts, and a certain percentage of each paycheck goes into them. It’s working well so far!
Oh, what a fun job that would be!
Same. I am in 2 classes and would like to complete them with A’s. You got this!
Good on you!!
I believe in you. Those thoughts can be brutal. I have anxiety and I know how that feels.
Awesome! More than halfway done!
Nice! Good job!
Those are all great goals! My husband got me a hand lettering set for Christmas and I was so excited but it’s harder than it looks!
I feel ya. I was doing so well 2 years ago. I don’t know what changed but I’d love to get back into it. Sounds like you have a good thing going with the YouTube videos!
That’s awesome. I want to learn a 2nd language as well!
How awesome!
All you can do is take it one day at a time. Don’t punish yourself for slipping up. Just start over the next day. Sounds like you’ve been doing a great job! Everyone slips up now and then.
Keep going!!
Not unrealistic at all! How cool!
How awesome!
It’ll get easier! I work 530-1430 every day. Took some getting used to. Now, sleeping in is 630am lol
That’s something I could work on! I’m not moving, but my bedroom is a catch-all for basically anything and everything I don’t know what to do with.
You can do it! I’m not a picky eater but I don’t always know how to put ingredients together to make a good meal.
Oh my. I don't think I can ever quit soda.
Congrats!!
Congrats on the new place! Putting stuff away/on the walls can be tiring for sure.
Those are great goals. I worry a lot and let people/thoughts live rent free in my head, so I’m trying to change that this year. You can do it!
Yea, I am a smart person, but math is ridiculous.   I live in the PNW, swimming is almost never an outdoor activity here. I’m jealous!
I am sending you good vibes! What are you planning to go to college for? I’m in school for my nursing prerequisites right now.
How cool!
Me too. A nice face wash and moisturizer are amazing after a nice, long, hot shower.
What are they?
How awesome!! I love sunflowers!!
That’s not generic! My goal for 2021 was to practice more self care. Whatever is important to you is important!
I hope you make lots of new friends!
You got it!!
Voice acting?! How fun! I wouldn’t have guessed (from like, 2 short conversations) that you were into that!   I suck so bad at video games lol. If I beat one, ever, I’d be thrilled!
These are awesome goals and you’ll knock each one out of the park!! Good job on the retirement fund too!
Amazing goals! You sound really driven. I admire that!
Fingers crossed it works out! Dang COVID
That will be awesome!
Good job!! I hope everything works out!!
You got this!!
Intermediate algebra. Thank you for the offer!
I hope this makes you feel more comfortable!!
Online classes are hard to stay awake for!
Yes!! I can only do like two full-pushups!  I've been doing half-pushups, trying to get to five full and then 10 and then maybe 15 lol
Awesome goal! You got this!
Oooh! What genre?
You are so going to get in!! I believe in you!!
You’ll get in!! I’m in school for my nursing prerequisites and hope to apply to the program by this fall/winter.
What a cool goal! My mom taught me to count to 10 in Japanese when I was little. I only remember up to 3 now, lol.
Congratulations! What a great milestone!
It’s so hard though!
YES I love it! I’ve got the tune down, so little by little
aw thank you so much! you and my friends are the motivation that i need!
Thank you. I appreciate that!
TY! i think you helped: i did 20 chin ups pronto
Haha thanks! We are for sure insulating the attic. The water heater depends on if we get a stimulus check again 😬 but the insulation might end up saving us money to save for it!
Yeah, listening to Sal for far too long can take a lot out of a person.
Thank you friend!
Thank you! I really try. I love them and they are super great kids.
That’s what I do!   We spent an hour and a half together today, and he’s getting the hang of it (along with other fundamentals he’s missing). It might be a while before we get to halves of odd numbers, but get there we will.
I am looking for something relatively stress-free like remote data entry.
Education. I'm up for tenure, I need to apply and submit my portfolio and pray I get it.
Which math are you in?
I’d love to work for a non-profit but I’d be happy with anything at this point!
Thank you 💕
That’s great advice!! Thank you!!
It really is! Really taxing job though, so it makes sense there’s such an amazing reward (and it’s not the salary 😂)
You too!
Thank you 💙 I hope you're successfully managing them too
When I started learning embroidery at the beginning of the month, a lot of people recommended cross-stitch as well haha! I also won a cross-stitching kit from a giveaway and I figure 2021 is as good a time as any to get a new hobby :p
Me too!  I was doing well awhile back, then fell off the bandwagon when I moved and got sick.  Eventually, I got into it again and COVID hit.  Feels like I can't catch a break!  I definitely didn't want to resort to YouTube videos, because I feel like it's harder to push myself, but I've got to work with what I've got!
I’ve moved to Nevada recently and it definitely helps
Yes maam :)! Thanks for the encouragement.
Thank you!!!
Thank you! I'm super excited for it!
Sure you can!
Thanks! I make lots of goals but I like the ones that are attainable!
Aw that's a bummer! You guys at least have amazing scenery! I bet it makes hiking a dream!
Lmao my masters. In nursing.
I'm so bad at even doing that! Moisturizing is a good first step though. My poor skin in this dry climate ... it must hate me
I roasted a set of seeds this year after it stated to wilt!  But I burnt them. Bad. 😂
Look! I already made one 🤭  Thanks!
How did I not even notice it was you who posted the contest! Hey mrsjanssen!! 😄  Yeah, I would love to do voice acting for some sort of game or animation or heck even commercials to get going. Acting was never on my radar for my like my whole life (other than thinking it would be a neat thing to try), then there was a moment a few years ago where I thought, "You know what, screw it, I'm just gonna give it a shot." Read a couple books, took a few in-person classes before COVID hit, and now it's turned into a full-fledged dream. I try to keep things realistic, but I have a little mic set up in my closet to practice with and it's been real fun.  How about you? What are you taking math classes for?
Thank you! Encouragement is always wonderful.
Thank you! It means a lot. I’m more motivated then I’ve ever been!
You got that right. But, at the end of the day I had the extreme fortune to be vaccinated. Quite truly that was the biggest goal of 2021 for me, and we can check both of the Pfizer shots off the list now!  Hope you are safe and well and kicking COVID’s butt with your own goals too!
Thank you!! I’m at 15/19 so far! I’d say I’m off to a good start!
Thank you! ♡
Thanks!
Thank you!
Honestly, that's probably because it's never been explained to you in a way that makes sense to your brain. I used to hate math because I had teachers who insisted I do things their way and it just didn't make sense! I got lucky with Mrs Nesbit. She opened the world for me, and I'll never forget her
Heck yea!!
You sound like an amazing person. I’m glad he has you!
Have you looked into medical transcription? That could be a good avenue!
You got this!
Intermediate algebra. The worst part is it’s a prerequisite to my actual prerequisite math class (statistics).
My medication is successful. I can definitely feel the difference when I am off vs on medication.
I love cross-stitch! I’m no good at it, but I definitely appreciate the art!
Haha it will be a struggle.
It does! Hiking is one of my favorite things. It’s gorgeous here!
Ah nice!!
Lol!
Haha yes! I’m always down for new friends!
My comment wouldn’t go through so now I’m typing up a whole new one, lol.   That sounds so fun! I’m terrified of being up in front of a crowd, but I hope it works out for you!  Math is one of my nursing school prerequisites :)
Oh good, I am hoping it becomes available to me soon.   Thank you!
Thanks! I really like tutoring kids. I started halfway through high school, and I’m 4 years in. ACT/SAT tutoring is also really fun; since those tests actually matter, it’s awesome to see the whole family celebrate when the kid reaches his goal (or better)!
Thanks!
I've taught both of those classes on the college level. I can help. DM me if you'd like to meet up over discord or zoom sometime. I'm on the east coast of the united state, so if meeting isn't possible you can send me your work to check over and write notes on.
I'm glad 💙💙
Any idea which area of nursing you'd like to go into?
Whoops, dumb Reddit.  And thank you! My wife is doing prerequisites to become a nutritionist as well, so pretty similar boat. Trying to relearn all the math and science (chemistry specifically for her) after being out of school for years is not for the faint of heart.
Wow, thank you so much!

Oh those look nice! I really need to get some more round brushes and a fan brush might be nice to have. Didn't think to look on Amazon for them might go do that soon.
Love it!!

Ahh, The White Album.  My partner loves the Beatles, but really dislikes anyone covering them...  except the fact that the version of The While Album in the car is done by a "Supergroup" from Australia featuring Chris Cheney (The Living End), Phil Jamieson (Grinspoon), Tim Rogers (You Am I) and Josh Pyke.  You can watch the [whole concert](https://youtu.be/47_1mG6_PxQ?list=PL9eu1zmvyF97rrBTWJ1iE1Ij-TK4QSbBs&t=1638) on YouTube, and I've queued up Martha My Dear
Thank you so much!! :)
OMG THANK YOU!!! - I didn’t think it was a common one but that’s cool!! I feel like people often overlook the white album for some reason 🤷🏼‍♀️ thank you again friend !!!
You’re SO welcome!! That song is criminally underrated and so is the White Album. I was so excited when you chose it because it was only one song off!
I know that’s so funny !!! I have a soft spot for John led vocals but Paul has a tendency to always make me happy when I listen to him singing - Martha My Dear is such a sweet song  about his puppy - if you ever want to chat about the Beatles please feel free to message me - I’m obsessed

Hello. Thanks for the contest.  Leaving my small town to pursue higher education in a city completely changed my life as I met many interesting people with whom I'm still in touch : ) .   Also my dream destination will be Manali, Himachal Pradesh.
u/sajuks
For Enamel pins, am in. 🙌  1. Getting engaged, long time ago 😀, surely was the biggest turning point in my life. Made me a more responsible person, threw away my bad habits, started healthier lifestyle like having meals on time, meditation, opening up more,.  2. Though my favourite travel destination is DC, London is my dream travel spot.
u/niaaa205
Hey there!!  1. Meditation and positive affirmations changed my life.  2. I would love to visit Iceland! Such an alien beauty!  Thank you for the contest. Have a great day!
Hi there not entering just wanted to say great contest!! : )
Not entering, just love the idea.   Sending my cv on a whim thinking I’d never get noticed. That job gave me so much confidence!  Edit: oh! Travel destination! Japan, I love sushi!
1. Divorce. 2. Japan, not sure of any exact place in it, but traveling to multiple parts would be my jam.
Don't forget to add your wishlist to your flair!
Hey /u/shazie13 thanks for the shout out 🙏

Aww this is so sweet! I love Valentine’s Day so much, even if it is just a cheesy Hallmark holiday lol. The color schemes and decorations are sweet, but honestly it’s a great excuse to eat some chocolate and tell the people in your life that you love and care about them! I was an only child for a while and my brother was actually born on Valentine’s Day so it’s an especially special time for my family! I hope you and your sandbox bunch of a happy holiday! 💜
My favorite Valentine’s memory is that when I was in 11th grade, I found a really cute candy jar shaped like a pig and filled with praline candies and had it sent to my mom’s work bc it was the first Valentine’s Day since she had separated from my dad. She told me that it was actually her favorite Valentine’s gift she had ever gotten.
Hey.  Do you like Canadians?  Because I'm a Canadian.  I'd love to be your Valentine though ❤️ but I would understand if you don't want to spend more money on foreign stamps.  I heard ours taste like poutine when you lick them anyway.  SOMETHING! Just kidding.  I personally love Valentine's Day because... 16...? 😳 years ago my husband took me on our very first date to see the phantom of the opera movie.
Bee, you da best. I can't pass this opportunity up!   Valentine's day always reminds me of my first Valentine's day with my (now) wife. I drove down a few hours to her house when we were dating long distance and - knowing she likes middle eastern food - tried my hand at making homemade falafel. It was not only a ton of fun (and turned out pretty tasty), but I really remember how beautiful she looked a dress when I showed up. That was 7 years ago and I still remember that one day in particular.
valentine's day is the sweetest holiday ever! lots of chocolate and love and splashes of pink and red! it is just perfect! 💗 it is always fun to spread the love with a certain someone you like on a very adorable holiday! 🌸
_Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind_  I find this very beautiful  Thank you for doing this!
When I was growing up, my mom would hide a bag of candy for me and one for my brother on valentine's day. She would give us each a clue in the morning when we woke up, and we had to follow the clues to the next one and the next all over the house and yard until we found our bags of candy. She did this every year, and it always made me feel special and loved.    Thank you for doing this giveaway!
This will be my first Valentine’s Day being divorced, I’d love to be looking forward to something for the holiday 😂 not that I got anything while married.
I'm hoping we can do dinner
May I gift you stamps?
My favorite thing about Valentine’s Day is that it’s my daughter’s birthday! This year she will turn 18 so it is extra special.   My favorite Valentine candy is chocolate truffles.
This Valentine’s Day I really want to treat my girlfriend to a home cooked meal with a bouquet of flowers and some candles burning. It’s been a crazy ride for everyone and I think it’s important that we appreciate our significant other  Thanks for hosting :-)
I LOVE Valentine’s Day and it’s my favorite holiday so seeing people offering to send snail mail for it makes me SO happy! 💘 Ever since I was really young my Grandpa has always taken the time out of his day on Valentine’s Day to deliver a box of chocolates and a nice card to me! It always makes me look forward to the day because it’s so special, especially coming from him. My grandma is usually the one to buy all the Birthday and Christmas presents and typically just puts his name on whatever she gifts, but he never misses Valentine’s Day and I just think that it’s so cute that he goes out to the store and takes the time to pick out a card that reminds him of me! I have all of the cards he’s gifted me saved and I really cherish them!! :)
Ooohh valentine's day for my family been very fun we try and celebrate together have a dinner somewhere and give random gifts sometimes play secret valentine too!!
Oooh fun I want one because I wuv your stinking guts lol 😂
Candy. It’s always been the candy. Every Valentines day in elementary it was like a quarter-year-Halloween.
Valentine's is my dad's birthday, and my favorite giant stuffed animal came from a sale after valentine's day. 50 dollar stuffie for 10 dollars!!
I host a Valentine’s Day sleepover for a few friends for us to group read love stories to each other. (Get a Covid test and you can join too!)
My dad always without fail got my sister, mom and I our own chocolates, flowers, and a hand written card every year for valentines day. 🙂🙂 Even if my sister or I had boyfriends, my dad always said it was his duty as a man to ensure his girls had a proper valentines day. 🙂🙂🙂 Without fail. 🙂
Everyone who celebrates Valentine’s Day should head over to r/happyrelationships and share in the wholesomeness!
One year for valentines I made a collage of pics with my then gf and hand sewed a giant heart around it and two little bears. Another time I folded 33 origami roses for her birthday. When we eventually broke up I felt really sad that those things were gonna go into the trash somewhere out there... From then on I haven't invested as much into gifts for partners...   Ops, not sure if it was supposed to be positive, this is just what came to my mind first !  I'm working on a lot of snail mail myself! But I have to balance that with my [journaling](https://instagram.com/kayescreations). Do you do post crossing?
Did you know Valentine’s Day is also Ferris Wheel day?
About 2 billion is spent on flower for Valentine's day.
We got engaged on Valentine's day 2015. Married valentines day 2016. One of our first dates was valentines day in 2014.
I love Valentine's Day! Used to love it as a kid too, and my parents would take me to the store to buy a bunch of Valentine's Day cards to hand out to my classmates! Most recently though, my boyfriend told me we wouldn't be doing anything special for Valentine's day... "Because you should be treated like every day is Valentine's day, not just February 14." Melted my heart. <3
I'm not big on Valentine's day I believe love should be 24/7 365 but I still end up getting my husband and daughter something small just because I love them.
!!!! OOOOO that is so exciting!!! 💕💕 do you have any plans all set up?    Congrats on a first!!
awww thats so sweet!
omg that is so cute!!! I have a TON of siblings and one of them was legit born on my birthday! ahha so we have different experiences by far but I love that you love the holiday so much!   I never used to celebrate it actually until my husband and I got together. He INSISTED that we did and now I love it!
OMG this is absolutely adorable! and good for you to be there for your mother! I completely get that that is a hard thing to go through and you made it so much easier for her I am sure! 💕
ppsshhhtttt Everyone is welcome. As an international studies major, I LOVE ALL NATIONS! lol   Also, you happen to be awesome! 💕  ( I actually do not lick letters or stamps. .I use a device or I throw water at it. lmao but as someone that lives VERY close to the border and has traveled to Canada a lot, I have had poutine)  ooooo I saw that once live! What did you think?!?! Have you been to any other musicals??
💕💕 omg  that is ABSOLUTELY romantic! Its funny but, my husband is actually the romantic out of the two of us and I actually NEVER celebrated valentines day before he and I got together. He was adamant that we not only celebrated it, but that we go all out!! haha  now, I actually adore the holiday even though before I hated it. Your story is so cute and amazing and loving. 💕💕
💕💕 YES! I love this! I actually hated the holiday growing up and as a young adult. .no particular reason as I was in a relationship throughout several valentines days, but I never liked it until recently with my husband lol
Shakespeare! That was always my favorite of his!   💕💕
OMG I LOVE THIS! I LOVE making scavenger hunts for the kids!!! This is right up my alley! I have done this for easter but never for valentines day. ..hhmmmmmmmm  💕💕
you know, the relationship I am in now with my husband is the ONLY relationship that I ever celebrated the holiday so I totally get it. I hope though that things only get a ton better from here on out for you!! Future you, I hope, will love this holiday💕💕
Lots of places, if you call ahead, are doing fantastic carry out options if you arent able to go out!  💕
I am always open to force gifts! lol That is very kind! 💕
OMG YAY!!!!!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO HER!!! 💕💕 that does make it extra special!
oo that sounds lovely!! I hope that your valentines day is amazing!!! 💕
OMG that is so cute!!! I love everything about that! 💕💕 Growing up, Valentines day was always my least favorite holiday and had been until recently. I love seeing this perspective on it, especially since I am very close with my grandparents as well! Thank you!! 💕💕
oooo like secret santa but valentines day version?? That sounds fun!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 technically I guess that fits the theme lmao 💜💜💜
hahaha the Reeses hearts are so good
oo does he get a lot of themed gifts?
omg that is so cute! I love this!!! do you have favorite stories or is it always new?
omg that is so sweet and cute! I love this!
oooo I will go check it out! <3
oooo No! I have actually never heard of it before but that is so cool!!!
oo I did not!! I havent been on a ferris wheel in. . . .sooo long  lol
that is so much!!!!!!
Oh my!! Thats awesome and so sweet!! 💜💜
Aww that is a sweet reasoning🥰
That’s so cool that you have a birthday sibling! I actually have two pairs of shared birthdays in my family, including my Aunt who was also a Valentine’s Day baby so I find the shared birthdays super interesting! Like, the chances of it happening are so slim! Life is crazy lol! I also never really celebrated the holiday because I always saw it as my brother’s birthday and not Valentine’s Day, but I’m glad we both see the joy in the holiday now! :D
Hurray!  I can be my goofy self!  Haha.    Yeah, all our stamps are stickers.  Self lickening, if you will.  I also live very close to the border.  Maybe we are neighbors!    I really liked the movie!  I am biased though because Gerard Butler is yummy and fantastic.  I've seen it live twice and would go again if given the chance!!!  I think it's the only musical I've seen live... It's pretty rare to get musicals that tour close to me that aren't like... off off OFF Broadway in the worst way possible hahaha.
Thank you :) I love that your husband does that. All it takes is the right person to bring out everyone's romantic side I think.
awww that is so so sweet! 💞💞💞💞
It was awesome! My mom did it for just about every holiday, but for valentines day, the clues were always things she loved about us.
Excellent! If you’ll message me your address I’ll pop them in the mail tomorrow. I keep lots on hand because I’m addicted to snail mail.
Thank you! I’m crying on the inside, but really excited for her future!
I’m not even sure when it became my favorite, I was never too fond of it either! There’s just something so endearing about the positive message, it’s literally a holiday to spread love, how could anyone NOT enjoy that?? You’re so welcome, thank you for hosting!! :)
It iss!! And then everyone tries to guess who got what for whom!!! I love it
https://imgur.com/gallery/QPEF8N1
Nah, he's never actually liked it. I usually celebrate it as his birthday first, valentines last (if at all)
ooo well. do I have a story for you. Myself, my birthday thief of a sister, my bio aunt, my other bio aunt, my mother, my married in uncle, my other married in uncle. ...are all born on the 30th of a month. The next to be born after me was my cousin, and he broke they cycle by being born on the 3rd of a month lol  ahh yeah I can totally see how that would happen. I am so glad that you get to enjoy it as his birthday but also as a holiday you get to love too!
As a kid, I traveled to Canada a ton with my grandparents. I also speak French, so I traveled a bit to Quebec as well.  I currently live in Ohio at the northern part near ( BUT NOT IN) Toledo, So about a little over an hour away. Before I lived on the other side of the state and would travel through New York.  ooo YES! The movie was Fantastic! It was one of my favorite musicals turned movie actually! (Still waiting for wicked -- _ -- ) oo yeah I feel that. Most musicals I have seen have been when traveling. Locally, we get the B or C team which is Usually pretty good but sometimes a miss. Toronto and New York have actually been my two main go to's for seeing musicals!
yes! I agree! I always try to do a lot for him as well now ( I bought his Valentines day gifts a month ago LMAO )
💕
ooo that is so cute!!!!! I am totally (writes down notes) no taking this idea for my own  LMAO
hahahahha heal up and enjoy the time! lol 💕💕💕
🥰🥰🥰 ok ok ok ok that is cute. Lmao
Holy cannoli! How fascinating! You couldn’t have that happen on purpose no matter how hard you try haha! Talk about literally perfect timing! Also makes for a super cool story and icebreaker!!
Very cool!  My mom is American and so is most of my family but we are west coasters ☺️  If I wanted to see anything really awesome I'd have to go to Vancouver.  Which is definitely ok, my parents are there.  I'd love to travel all over the east more someday.  I went to university for a while in Quebec but really haven't seen much else.
Haha that's awesome! I'm sure he appreciates it. Hope you guys have an especially good one this year!
Trying to sweet talk you with that little cutie hahaha
yeah I have no idea how that all lined up that way  lmao
You as well!!!!
hahaha to be fair. .it IS cute  LMAO

Hi,  &#x200B;  I'm Steve. I'm surprisingly old and I live in London. The one in England, not the one in Ontario which I've also lived in or the myriad of other places that called themselves "London" because they couldn't think of anything original.     I have a nice, laid back job as the IT Manager in a high profile company. I know it's laid back because I'm married to a child protection social worker and have four sons. My job's a doddle. There's also two dogs and two cats and I'd love to sleep as much as they do. I wish I was still a toddler so I could take a long nap during the day and when I woke up people would congratulate me for it.  The group rules say "no whoring" and "don't be a dick" but I don't have many hobbies other than those. I do teach maths to adult learners at my local college when we're not having a lockdown. I enjoy long, romantic walks by myself away from people who don't wear masks.      Anyway - I came across this group about just over a week ago and lurked for a bit. I didn't read the welcome guide, I just assumed it worked like a "Secret Santa" so at the weekend I decided to jump in and find a few .co.uk wish lists and send some things out. So if you get a parcel from "Steve" you now know where it came from.
"long, romantic walks by myself away from people who don't wear masks." I have to steal this. Fortunately the vast majority of people in my area of my state wear them, but there's the occasional non wearer who of course feels the need to get a little closer to you than necessary with juuuuuust a little cough that may or may not be COVID.  Welcome. I used to do teaching/tutoring too, as well as managing an after school homework support center before all this craziness happened. How did you like teaching compared to IT management? I enjoyed managing actually, though I did miss the teaching bit when I watched all the other tutors go about it.
Welcome Steve. I like your idea of being rewarded for a nap. I don't take them often anymore, but sometimes they are necessary to recharge.
Welcome!! I too wish I was rewarded for naps. Instead I go downstairs and get confused looks and the "oh so that's where you've been all day". So sad ;-;
Hi, welcome! Have you watched any good films recently?
Lol what an awesome intro to the group, welcome!
Lovely intro, we all know you’re a great guy regardless of any retrospect
Hi and welcome.  When I was a teenager on a road trip here in the US I happened upon London, Kentucky and had a really long laugh about it.  Then I realized the city I was from had the same name as a much more famous city so I felt kinda dumb.  Oh to be young again!  (I’d really not want to be young again now that I’ve thought about it!)  How old are your sons?
Hahaha... preemptive gifting is surely welcome. Snd now, how do you do?  You are free to do those naughty things, just not here. 🤣
Hi! Welcome to the sub! You’re so sweet for pregifting lol!
Hi and welcome! Amazing intro 😂 Nice to have a little chuckle before bed.   Where's your favourite place for one of your romantic walks, do you prefer urban or countryside scenery?
Hi! Great intro. Have a great day
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Welcome
Hey! Steve! I hope your significant other is looking after themselves! (I’m also a Child Protection Social Worker!) Sending best wishes from the Midlands :)
You're snarky, have a sense of humor and you're nice. Welcome to the group.
Welcome to the group. I also have the don’t be a dick hobby and well, whoring is just a way to get free drinks.   :)
Hello and welcome to the group! I love your snarky, witty humor! You will fit in very well here! 😁
Welcome and what a nice way to start it out
Lmao great Intro! Welcome aboard, dick whore 🤣
You're funny, Steve. Welcome to the sub, not short for submarine. If you tell me you napped, I will congratulate you. I love naps, too, alone or with the cats.
Welcome! I also have 4 sons! I'm not old yet but I FEEL surprisingly old lol. I enjoyed your intro.
Welcome!
Wait? There are instructions? In a movement of solidarity I will have a long solitary walk by myself, but in your honor! It's nice to be able to welcome you into the fold. I'm not in the UK but I will start writing from Steve when I send gifts out just to keep everyone here on their toes!
Come on, London Ontario is at least 2nd place out of the 29 Londons.
Pleasure! Any jokes I can steal for you? 😈
As soon as I saw you were in to whoring and being a dick I knew you deserved the wholesome award.   Welcome!

Welcome! I grew up in London, Ontario
I didn't know that there was even a London in Ontario :)   I also thought this subreddit would be more like "secret santa" at first, lol, and I didn't realize at first that I should make a post if I do pick a random amazon to gift, just so I can let them know they are receiving a gift from another user on this subreddit.
What qualifies as surprisingly old? Let’s see if I am in fact, surprised!
Aw, welcome! Your post is very witty, and I would certainly congratulate you if you managed a nap, because I never seem to get one!
Welcome to the community Steve!  Just wanted to say I love your intro 😊
I never got to grips with teaching in a school. Tried it for 4 years and then decided it wasn't the career for me and switched to IT instead. But about 15 years ago I discovered that if you teach adults they're actually there because they want to learn which removed about 90% of the stress.
As I said I lived in London, Ontario for a bit when I was working for a Canadian company.      "Where are you from?"  "London"  "No, where are you from?"     ...was a very common conversation.     They're 13, 15, 22, 27.
After nearly a year of Covid-19 the office I haven't been to since this all started would be "Scenery". In a normal world I like the peace of the countryside.
My favourite thing about nature is that it's always trying to find new ways to kill us. It is full of strange creatures: carnivorous plants, birds that can't fly, white people with dreadlocks, politicians with weird hair.     My mother feeds the neighbour's cats every day. At my house I never see the neighbour's cats because Einstein and Lady Catterly just terrorise them. And then the dogs (Lily and Murphy) bark at them.     At the moment my favourite holiday is anything, anywhere.
Are you getting lots of people saying "you can't visit me because of Covid"? That's what's stressing her out at the moment.
Honestly yes, the best students are the ones that CHOOSE to be there.
Hahaha! A couple of weeks ago I knocked on the door and heard the mum say from behind the door “*childs name* cough so she thinks we have COVID” so the child started ott coughing and mum opened the door and said she hasn’t stopped coughing since she got back from school. I ended up FaceTiming from the car 🤣 What a crock of shit 🤣  Tell her not to stress! We can only do what we can do and at the end of the day , we have to have a life too :)

Is there anything better than cookies, crafts, and sexy time?! ;) haha. Thank you friend!
Ain’t it? Maybe if I darned socks in something like that I’d find someone to darn socks for 😂
Haha, I agree! ;)
Oooh really? I always see stuff on Shein I like but never knew how good the quality was.
Thank you! :)
I mean yea, don’t we all? 😜
Maybe if I darned socks in something like that, it wouldn't matter that I don't know how to darn socks
I think it can be hit or miss. I've only ordered stuff off there twice but I've been happy with the things I got. I always make sure to check reviews on each item though.
Hahahah

Hey guys! I felt like running another contest, so I'm looking for something very WTF. It could be a very bizarre image, a strange meme, something weird that will make me say WTF! I'll gift a few people who really make me say WTF!  Contest will end at midnight EST.   Rules:  1. DBAD 2. Have gifted before 3. Must have an intro prior to 1/15 4. Tell u/hsks23 that she is adorable. :)
I’m in the hospital and they still haven’t given me my night meds and it’s almost midnight. WTF?
[this really happened 😞 WTF](http://imgur.com/a/ky69BEN)   u/hsks23 you are too adorable don't open the link
One of my favorite takes on something normal.  [Tail lights.](http://imgur.com/a/T0OUZX4)
u/hsks23 you are ADORABLE!  Both artificial raspberry and vanilla flavorings are made from a goo that comes from the anal secretions of beavers. I believe there are other flavors as well made from this, but I dare not Google it.
[here’s a major wtf](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJTvXSQ8/) u/hsks23 is my girrrrrllll she is so adorable!
Thanks for the contest!  u/hsks23 you are adorbs!!  Here is my WTF picture ... absolutely do not want to visit there!  [WTF](https://imgur.com/a/i9PnOEw)

I don’t wanna but gross or vulgar!
For whatever reason, [https://images.app.goo.gl/N7arYfRxsSrE3bGD6](this) makes me super uncomfortable. Not sure if it’s the cat’s expression or what, but it completely 100% weirds me out.   u/hsks23 you are super adorable. But u/alltheboops, you are too!  Thanks for the contest.

Nice to meet you, and you're adorable lol 😂
The biggest WTF for me are the [vintage ads](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2617868/The-good-old-days-Horrendously-sexist-vintage-ads-wont-believe-made.html) that show husbands keeping their wives “in line”.

u/hsks23 you are ADORABLE!  I work at a school and they fired the principal without a replacement. How WTF and disfunctional is that?   It gets better... They told the kids she was fired before emailing the parents... The parents only got the email 3 days later 🤦‍♂️

This one artist I follow drays tons of these. His handle is @matttitude
Yikes! Those are disturbing. I want to say ads are better now, but....
oh lord if it's a WEIRD anime it has to be intense.
I did. They were waiting for a doctor to approve my med list. But one of my meds is something specially compounded for me that I had to bring from home. We reached the compromise that I could at least take that.
I’ve been having these episodes for almost a week where I feel drugged and dizzy. We are trying to figure out why. I just got admitted around 4 or so.
Lol 😂
I feel the same way
Haha it’s so weird! Like who is actually buying that, besides for a prank gift? 😂
Yeah.. just look up Beeple Crap if you really want some crazy pics.
I’m sorry 😭😭
I’m good 😸 I feel like I haven’t seen you in a hot minute and I miss your face. How are you, my love?
I know right?
Right?!
Intensly intense
WTF i wonder if you're a diabetic.
Right!?! Lol. There is so much stuff like that on Amazon. I often wonder how much the seller is actually making off it.
It’s possible. Type 2 happens to people my size. One of the reasons I’ve been trying to lose weight.
Nope!  At least not this time.

Hello!   I've been a lurker for quite a while and I just wanted to say hi, and I'm wanting to be more active in this group :)   The reddit gift exchanges are so much fun, and I love them doing them, but I want to be more active in a group like RAOA so that I can gift people in between the sign-up's for reddit gifts :)   I've made some cool online friends via reddit through exchanges actually and I hope that I continue to in RAOA.       I'm late-20's, female (she/her), living in North Carolina.  My interests and hobbies are mostly related to psychology and video games. I play a lot of Nintendo games, like Pokemon and Animal Crossing, and online games like World of Warcraft. I also play Magic The Gathering occasionally but haven't been able to as much as I used to due to COVID.  I like making custom stickers for people as gifts.  I have a dog named Ellie and I'm engaged with my new date set in July 2021.     If you read through all of this, post a comment telling me about your favorite game or hobby! :)
Hello and welcome! I’m in NC too and my daughters name is Ellie! 😂  Congratulations on your upcoming wedding!
Canada!   Huge fan of Overwatch. It's my (sometimes) stress relief although some of the matches can get intense.   How do you make your stickers? I love anything crafts. I have a cricut maker and really should use it to make something. Hah.
That's cool! I don't play video games, but I watch my friend stream, while we stay on call and he gives some commentary and that's nice haha, I think I like card games more

I can't answer a lot of questions like some of these more experienced folks, but I'll gladly be your newbie-buddy! 🤗  I used to live in North Carolina, and I get comments on my accent all the time now because of it! (Though compared to a lot of folks I knew around there, I barely picked one up!)  Favorite hobby would have to be rock climbing right now!  Ooh, and any cute pics of Ellie?
Hi! We're state neighbors, even though I live really far from you. (I'm in Tennessee. It's a wide state. Also the state with the most neighbors.)

I also play a lot of Nintendo games, including the ones you mentioned! Oooh What kind of stickers have you made so far??   Wow! Hopefully you have an amazing Wedding! Congratulations!   My favorite game for Nintendo Switch at the moment is Story of seasons: Friends of Mineral town, but my all time favorite game is Jak and Daxter, the whole series! My favorite hobby at the moment is painting
Welcome to the sub! Congrats on your engagement :D My favorite game is probably the board game Spirit Island. It's a lot of fun and is a co-op game so no one has to feel like they've lost (unless we all lose LOL).
Hi! I am also new and figuring out this space. I have played Animal Crossing and enjoy that. My spouse is the big gamer... Just completed Breath of the Wild the other day and was pretty proud. I have gotten into Zoom game nights with some friends cuz of 'rona and have had a lot of fun with Jackbox games and such.
Welcome! Do you like board games as well?  My favorite game is a board game called Pandemic. But I also really love to embroider and read.
Thank you!!
I also want to know how they are made lol
I can send you more info in a pm, but here is a youtube video with the basics: [How to make stickers with Cricut!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdNKoX_5LAc)  &#x200B;  For myself, I draw most of my sticker designs on the iPad using Procreate (best $10 purchase I ever made for the ipad).  There are affordable drawing pencils for the iPad but I use the Apple pencil.   When I'm happy with a drawing, I draw a white border to it and download it without the background as a PNG file. Then upload that image into Cricut Design Space.  Print then cut feature.  I print the sticker onto a sticker paper (I use Online Labels Weatherproof for most things) and then cover it with a laminate (Avery brand self laminate).  Then I cut them out with the Cricut :)   Use a cutter to slice a slit on the back for easy peeling.     Edit to add insta link:  [Instagram to stickers I've made :)](https://www.instagram.com/latenightcraftclub/)
Like trading card games? or card games like Rummy and Poker? :)   My favorite "board game" that uses just cards is Unstable Unicorn
thanks!!
yes, I do!  I'm a school psychologist  :)  It was a three year graduate program (in the US) to become a school psychologist.   I love my job, but wish I was paid more to do what I love, haha.    I also have a crazy amount of animal crossing hours lol!
Oooo, favorite villager. That's a tough one.  I think my favorite villager on my island right now is Shep :)   I really hope that I get Phoebe on my island at some point though.      Favorite Pokemon is also hard, but I think Ninetales would be my partner Pokemon if I had to choose a partner :)  I also really love Umbreon
We've played DnD both in person and through Discord/Roll20.  A friend of ours is trying to get us to play via Roll20 but I just haven't committed, haha. It's so much fun in person that it can be hard to switch over to just online :P
Hmmm... a Gryffin :)
Whatever I can draw on the iPad :)  They are just like regular stickers, I guess? Haha I make them by printing on sticker paper, putting a laminate over them, and then cutting them out with my Cricut.  I have an Etsy shop but there isn't much on there. It's a mix of random things I like, or things that people ask me to make for them.   Like one of my coworkers asked me to make a bunch of Gossip Girl and Friends stickers for their teen's birthday haha
That's totally awesome!
Sleeping, lol, and watching Bailey Sarian youtube videos.  Youtube has been kind of my "go to" lately to just have on and watch without thinking about anything else.
My favorite holiday is 4th of July because it makes me think of good memories with my dad :)   I love the rain and cloudy days, and I spend a lot of time visiting the mountains.
NC is a great place to be :)  Especially for fun tourist towns with plenty of Pokemon stops for Pokemon Go :P
This is one of my favorite photos of her 😊 https://www.reddit.com/r/dogpictures/comments/aecap5/its_been_one_year_since_i_rescued_my_best_friend/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
NC is also a wide state, haha. I used to live close the TN/NC border and visit Gatlinburg quite a bit. My college was a little over an hour from there.  What are your thoughts on the possible remakes for this year? :)
RG is random gift, right?  Haha, catching up with the lingo here :)   My favorite random gift I've given has been a TON of candy, lol! Everyone likes sweets.   The wedding planning has been stop and go for two years. We've switched venues, postponed the date, changed all the colors, etc.  I'm really happy with the current plans though :) and all the vendors are lined up and the date is set with the venue.  I just need to figure out all the decorating stuff and last details with each vendor.
Thank you! :) I'm struggling to plan it but I am gonna have this wedding this year no matter what lol     So far, I've done many customs for kids of their favorite characters/Pokemon and for adults, they tend to ask for quotes and things from TV shows, haha.   Otherwise, I make stickers related to education and psychology to sell on my Etsy shop (needs to be updated badly lol)
Ooo I don't know this one but I like co-op games!
It is a great moment when you hit any of the big achievements of BoTW. I finished all of the shrines, but I'm still working on finding all of the Korok seeds :)   I love Jackbox games!  Don't Know Jack was a staple in my college friend group haha
Omg I love pandemic. I recently told my boss (in a covid testing lab) I was planning to take a week off in the spring and play pandemic legacy with my partner and she was like really? Dont you get enough of that??
I don't like board games as much as my fiance. But such a fitting favorite right now considering the actual pandemic around us, haha. The favorite board games in our home are Catan, Mice & Mystics, and Arkham Horror.
Replied above :)
They're amazing! I love this!
Rummy, Poker, Court Piece (something that's really common here), board games are also fun!
i totally feel that! i feel like a lot of the professions in psychology don’t pay enough (unless you go through a long graduate program to get the credentials). definitely stressed about the future right now! :-(
awww such amazing choices! 🌸💗 hope that you get phoebe soon!
We usually play via discord but sometimes it gets so glitchy. I agree, in person is so much fun and online just isn't quite the same
Cool! I like unicorns as far as classic fantasy creatures go. But bowtruckles from Harry Potter are so cool!
TBF, sleeping is a solid choice  lmao
Yeah i lived near Wilson for a while and had to come here for work about 5 years ago and fell in love with the place. I ended up back here for different reasons and was able to stay! When I was here the first time people were telling me I should live here and I thought it was impossible.
She is adorable! And she looks so happy!
Reddit gift I meant haha, I was going with what you’re familiar with but I was getting on a bus and typed quick 😅 but a ton of candy is a great gift to give!   I know your pain. I tried doing traditional planning a couple years in advance and hated it before I even took covid into consideration! I’m glad all your details are set :) I’m sure it’ll be wonderful
Highly recommend!! Another fun co-op game is Mysterium.
Ah dude the Legacy edition is so much fun! And the rioting cities make so much sense now haha...so sad.
Thank you! I really need to make more!!  You can tell when I got COVID because I stopped posting and creating designs, lol, but I'm starting to get back into it again (as soon as I'm done with my custom orders I'm working on right now lol)
If you go through a 2-year programs/Master's for a Clinical degree, I'd say it's worth it as far as pay goes :)   Some of my friends in private practice make quite a bit of money. But I love working in the school system. It's a busy job and it's a field known for burn out, but I can't see myself ever doing anything else.
I'm starting to journal. Looking forward to fueling my sticker addiction. I've been obsessed since I was a kid
that is great to hear! did you know that’s what you wanted to do throughout undergrad?
I really had no clue what this profession was like until I had already started grad school for it, haha!  My undergrad route was a little chaotic because I started for an Anthropology degree and switched to Psychology half-way. When I applied to grad school, I applied to several different fields in mental health and a couple school psychology programs accepted me. I just took a chance from what I could read about it online and thought that working in schools (but not a teacher) was something I'd enjoy.
wow that is quite a story and I’m sure taking that leap was a good decision. That’s definitely something that I need to do more often: just going for it and taking that leap and trusting that everything will work out.

Hi there! I'm pretty new here, too, but I'm excited to be a part of this community and to have you here with us! I can't answer a lot of questions like some of these more experienced folks, but I'll gladly be your newbie-buddy! 🤗  Do you know where you'll be going to college or what you'll be studying? I teach middle school, but I've been teaching long enough now that I have a lot of former students in college, and I love keeping in touch with them and hearing all about college life and its ups and downs! It is a challenging path, but kudos to you for embracing that challenge!

Welcome to the community! I’m so excited for to begin the college journey! I graduated about two years ago and miss it so much lol hahaha!! Enjoy every moment of it! (:
Im not super sure about where yet, but something medical or maybe in the engineering field.
Im thinking a few things. Healthcare: radiology or lab tech. or Engineering: Electrical engineering.  Hard choices though. But Im leaning toward being a lab tech.
I like knives, but my actual hobbies are guitar playing, writing music, reading, Starting to try whittling.
Knives, playing guitar is my big hobby, writing music, reading, whittling im just starting.
I'm going to likely be a med tech, but also maybe something in the engineering field. Also thanks!

Thank you!!!
Wonderful! Good luck on your adventures in life. Its just beginning :)!
Ohh, me too, I like all kinds of sharp objects lol  We've got a lot in common, I play guitar, write poetry and read a lot, which is your favorite band?

Good choice!
Cool cool! Hopefully they have a handle on Covid by then - it’s been pretty wild thus far
A few bands I like are Pantera, Judas Priest, Slayer, rainbow, and Frank Zappa.

Hi Everyone!  I found this group from the Secret Santa group.  My love language is gifting, so this is right up my alley!  I'm a 38 F married to my wonderful husband for 7 years (together for 12!).  I'm from the New Orleans area and love my city!  We would love to have a dog, but our landlord won't allow us to have pets....BOO!  Pre-COVID, we loved traveling to new places.  The last place we visited was Chicago.  I enjoying watching professional and college football and support our local professional teams.  So, I'm stuck on anything else I can add here, so just AMA!
Hey welcome to the group!! I hope you enjoyed your Secret Santa this year :D  What are some things you enjoy in your free time?
Hello!!! and welcome to this wonderful and amazing place.
Hello and welcome! What's your favorite memory as a couple?   Also feel free to message me if you need any help 🤗

That is SUCH a great question!  My husband used to work for a local music promoter.  He got us backstage VIP passes to a local music festival.  We were able to eat/drink for free and had the best seats in the house to see one of our favorite bands, Foo Fighters!  I'm pretty sure I cried a few times.
Thank you!  My favorite song right now is Willow from Taylor Swift.  What's yours?
Oh man.  There are SO many good things to eat around here.  One of my favorite NO dishes is BBQ shrimp.  It's not made with regular bbq sauce.  They come in the shells in a butter Worcestershire sauce that is just SO amazing.  It's served with French bread for you to soak up the sauce.  I would recommend getting them at Mr. B.'s, which is in the French Quarter.  You also can't leave New Orleans without getting a po boy.  My faves are fried shrimp from Parkway Bakery & Tavern or roast beef from R & O's.
YAY!  Thanks for being a newbie buddy!  Since my Saints were just eliminated 😥 I would love to see a Green Bay vs Buffalo Superbowl.  I've been rooting for your Bills all season.  Y'all have one heck of a team and they look like they are having fun out there.
Thank you!!!
Aw, that's sounds so much fun! I've never been to a concert, but pretty sure I'd cry too lol
Talk too much by COIN I highly recommend COIN if you Are looking for new music!
Sounds so good! I can’t wait:)
Thanks! Ot has definitely been exciting season, no matter what the outcome from here!

Joke:  A man walks into a library and asks the librarian for books about paranoia. She whispers, "They're right behind you!"

Hello!   I'm Nicole, but you can call me a *Chatty Cathy*.  &#x200B;  [I'm 27 going on 28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwK_WOXjfc0).  Finally getting my golden birthday this year, woo!  I'm currently a medical biller in a hospital and this past year has been insane.  I feel lucky to work in healthcare though, because it gave me the opportunity to get the vaccine already.   Got my second dose a little over a week ago and the only side effect I've had so far was an awfully sore arm and pretty strong fatigue initially.  Super chatty introvert.  I love cooking, reading, listening to podcasts, vlogging, and playing video games when I can find the time for it.  I'm a dog person without a dog.  At some point I started watching YouTube videos, movies, and TV shows in fast speed and now I can't stop.  1X feels like slow motion to me, does anyone else have this problem?  I've been a vegetarian for over 20 years and a vegan for four years.  I'm passionate and proud about veganism but I am absolutely not one to judge anyone else's life choices or push mine onto anyone else.  I live in Wisconsin, like from That 70s Show.  The irony of being a vegan in Wisconsin, the cheese state, is not lost on me.  I actually used to work in a [cheese castle](https://www.visitkenosha.com/media-library/kcvb-live/shop/897x505imageslider/marscheesecastle_7.aspx?maxsidesize=432) in high school.  Soaking this up while I can because I'm looking to move this Summer to Indiana to be with my long distance boyfriend.  Scary to imagine moving during a pandemic.  I want to think things will be more under control by then, but there's no way of knowing.  I've been dabbling in gardening, so far I've just managed to grow tomato and pepper plants.  I love the idea of being self sufficient and living off the land, but I feel like I enjoy modern convinces far too much to do that fully.  And....I'm rambling so I'll cut myself off there.  Feel free to AMA.  I'm an open book and would love to make some friends.  Stay safe out there, everyone!

Hello and welcome Nicole! I hope you like RAOA!  What is your favorite vegan meal to cook?
Hi!!!! I'm Ashley!! It's so nice to meet you!!!
Hello and welcome to the group!!!! What are your favorite ways to relax?
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁    Well I think you're gonna have some competition🤑 because I'm considered a chatty Cathy I probly have a 100 messages in my mailbox every single day and it takes me hours to go through them because I just love to talk and talk and I'll talk to you until next Tuesday if you let me 🤣    Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Welcome
Hello and welcome! It's so nice to meet you!  Judging by your title, I'm gonna bet that you're a Friends fan. Me too! Do you have a favorite episode?
Welcome to RAOA, Nicole.
Hello! Welcome to RAOA! 👋 I’m Lily, it’s so nice to meet you! I hope that we can be friends! Being a newbie can be pretty tricky, so if you need help with anything - or just want to chat - feel free to PM me and I will assist you to the best of my ability! ✨💛
I resemble this title...
Welcome Nicole. I also talk too much. It drives my kids crazy. What kind of books do you like?
Hi there! I'm pretty new here, too, but I'm excited to be a part of this community and to have you here with us! I can't answer a lot of questions like some of these more experienced folks, but I'll gladly be your newbie-buddy! 🤗  What kinds of tomatoes and peppers did you grow? Last summer was my first attempt at a vegetable garden, and among other things, I had bell peppers, banana peppers, jalapenos, carolina reapers, and some long skinny pepper that I don't remember the name of....and 3 kinds of cherry tomatoes that were RIDICULOUSLY prolific!
Hello and thank you :)
Hello and thank you!  Oh I love this question!  I actually love a solid black bean burger, they have so few ingredients and are easy to make.  So that's probably my favorite.  Just about anything can be veganized though, I just made vegan hamburger for dinner tonight, mmmm!
Hi Ashley, nice to meet you too!!  What are you up to this evening?
Hello and thank you!!!  I actually took a bath this weekend to relax and I hated it.  I think my tub is too small, which says a lot because I'm a relatively short person.  I love cuddling up with a book on the couch in the afternoon though.  I love to read, but it's hard for me to make time for it.  Most of my reading is done before bed and at that point I'm so tired that I typically fall asleep before I can get through a chapter.  What's your favorite way to relax?  Hope you're having a good evening!
Happy New Year to you as well!  May this one be better than the last.  Sounds like you and I will get along just fine then.  Just try to shut us up, I dare you!!  Oh man, I have to narrow it down to just one?  I guess, if I had to pick, my favorite holiday would have to be Christmas.  It has all the good parts of Thanksgiving, like the food.  But it also feels...magical?  Maybe that's just the kid in me.  I just love the feeling I get listening to Christmas music or seeing houses lit up with decorations and lights at night.  And nothing beats watching someone open a gift you carefully selected for them.  What's your favorite holiday?    You know what my favorite thing about nature isn't?  The bugs.  I think just about everything else is my favorite thing about nature.    I would absolutely love to see pictures of your cat and outdoor kitties, if you have any!  I know I said I'm a dog person, but that's because I've been around them more.  I've had one cat growing up, and she wasn't much of a people person.  But that's okay, sometimes I'm not much of a people person myself.  I love that you work with special needs children, I have a cousin with special needs myself.    Thank you for the warm welcome!  I hope you have a lovely evening, it was nice to meet you.
Thank you so much!
It's so nice to meet you too!  I definitely am a Friends fan.  It's been so long since I've sat down and watched the series through...I guess that means I'm due!  I have so many favorites, but off of my head one that comes to mind is “The One Where No One’s Ready”.  What's yours?
Me three!!!!!! Friends is the absolute best!!!
Thank you!
Hi Lily, thank you for the warm welcome!  I will keep your offer in mind, I really appreciate it.
Hits home for you too, huh?
My boyfriend likes to pretend it drives him crazy too!  My favorite books are horror as well as survival books, especially dystopian survival books.  Are you a reader as well?
Hi there, fellow newbie!  Thank you for the warm welcome, I'm glad to be here.  Everyone's been really welcoming.  So, I grew a bigger tomato that I definitely can't remember the name of, and I also grew cherry tomatoes like you.  Cherry tomatoes do RIDICULOUSLY WELL!  I could barely eat them fast enough.  In addition to that, I did a bell pepper plant.  I didn't do as much as I did the year prior, because that year I was living somewhere with an outdoor space.  This year, I'm in a downtown apartment so I had to grow my plants at my grandparent's house where they helped me take care of them.  My bell peppers did a lot worse this year than the last, I think I got maybe one bell pepper?  I'd definitely like to branch out and grow more of a variety of peppers, but that all depends on where I'm living!  SO JEALOUS of all the peppers you grew, and on your first attempt too!  Way to go!
Hope your day is/went well!
That does sound good! I have never had one. I’ll have to look up a recipe to try. I used to be a vegetarian and have been considering being a pescatarian or something similar.
Not much!!! What about you?!
ugh I totally get that about reading. Reading is my favorite way to relax but it seems like sometimes, bed is the only place and then its like . .should I stay up late and sacrifice sleep or . .   haha I love to turn on some thunderstorm white noise, grab a blanket and a hot cup of something to drink and read!   What are some of your favorite books!   Also, you as well!!
Well hello there he has it does look like we will get along lol my whole life I've had every animal except a cat I didn't own a cat until I was probably 35 years old and now I've had it where me and my daughter had rescued 8 outdoor cats or else they would a died and we have 15 out the colony so we're definitely kept people I have the picture of Mr. JJ and some of the strays in my profile if you'd like to take a peak.
Some days...
I am. I enjoy mysteries/thrillers and general fiction.
Thanks! My bell peppers didn't do too well either, unfortunately. That's great that you are close enough to your grandparents that you were able to grow your vegetables at their house! I moved up here to be closer to family, but now they are all moving away! I hope Indiana goes well for you...it takes courage to move under any circumstances, but hopefully there are great things ahead of you there!  I see you also mentioned that you love reading; do you have a favorite genre or any favorite authors? I'm a nerd and an English Teacher, so books are like double kryptonite for me!
It's been alright!  Work as been slow today, I usually have two busy days of the week, if I'm lucky.  The rest of the time I'm pretending to look busy, which can surprisingly be exhausting.  But I don't mean to complain, I'm definitely lucky to have a job when others have not been so lucky this past year.  ANYWAYS SORRY FOR THE TANGENT, how is your night going?
Never?  Oh man, I definitely recommend it.  The one I use is super simple, essentially just black beans, flour, onions, and spices.  There are definitely a lot of recipes out there loaded with more ingredients where they load them with vegetables, which is great...but I like to keep it simple and top it with whatever fixings I'm feeling.  That's awesome that you used to be a vegetarian, it's definitely not easy.  If you're interested in trying to be pescatarian, I say go for it!  Doesn't hurt to give it a shot.
I'm just browsing the internet, looking for a good Youtube video to watch and contemplating a late night snack.
Right?  Oh my god, I've definitely been in that boat where I get so engrossed with a book that sleep isn't even an option, even if I'm super tired or have work the next day.    For me, I either like complete silence (which be honest, how often do we ever get that?) or a controlled noise like a fan or white noise machine so it can drown out the background noise.    I'm a sucker for a good thriller or horror book!  However, I've definitely stayed up until five in the morning reading a good chick flick novel.  What's your favorite genre to read?  Read anything good lately?
Wait, like every animal?  Or just the domestic ones?  Because now I'm curious and would like to request some sort of a list.  I'm a huuuuge animal person but I've only had the basics, a cat and a dog.  Not even something fun like a bunny or a hamster.  I always joke with my boyfriend that I'm going to end up taking in a racoon in need or something someday.  I just took a peak at the pictures and oh my goooooodness, I am sure glad I asked.  You're making me more and more of a cat person.  Whatever pet I end up getting somewhere along the line, I don't care what it is, I just know I want it to be a rescue.
Have you read anything good lately?
Okay, it feels good to know I'm not alone, although I'm sad yours didn't do well either.  My grandparents got some, they weren't ridiculously plentiful but they got far, far more than I did so they let me have a couple.  I feel really lucky to have been able to grow vegetables at their house last summer.  Nothing beats the taste of a cherry tomato out of the garden.    Thank you!!  I'm definitely really nervous about the move for so many reasons.  Moving in general is hard work, also this is the first time I'll be living with someone other than my family so I'm expecting it to be an obstacle but I've been open about that with him.    I sure do have a favorite genre!  I love your average thriller/horror books, I'll read just about any one of those that I can find.  In the past year or so though, I've been getting really into reading survival books of someone living off the land or going off the grid.  I especially like survival books about the end of the world or dystopia situations.  So good, I can't get enough.  What are your favorite books to read?  Knowing that you're an English teacher, I feel like I should have said something more profound like "oh I just love reading classics!".
I'm sorry it's been slow, that can be pretty rough, but I'm glad it's going alright at least! My night is going well. My baby boy was a super grump pants for a while but I did get to bake haha
Ooohhh what are your choices?
OMG YES!! I LOVE HORROR! lol  My favorite ever is John Saul's Second Child! Fantastic horror! I love listening or reading or watching or playing anything horror related! lol   I also love Fantasty (uprooted is my favorite by Naomi Novik), YA Fantasy (I stayed up every night a new harry potter book came out. I was 11 when I read the first one (it came out right before I turned 11 so it was perfect) (ALSO, Splintered series by A.G Howard or Study Series by Maria V Snyder), or Historical Fiction (Shadows and Strongholds by Elizabeth Chadwick)   I review books for free books so I have read a lot of random books from different genres but those are my favorites!   What are your favorite horror books?
Well when I was a little girl me my brother my sister we had dogs we had snakes we had turtles we had birds we had fish we had hamsters we had djabel's you name it we had it we even had a horse but they made my father get rid of it because we lived in an apartment complex and though he was a little kooky because he liked his alcohol it was fun while it lasted lol    Now because it's just me and my cat Mr. JJI have 3 sometimes 4 kitties who come visit me every day looking for food and water and my goal and my dream in life is to hit the lottery and go clear out some of the nearest shelters go buy a nice little piece of property and let those animals live with me for the rest of their lives
The last flight by Julie Clark was really good. I am currently reading Jihadi Bride which is also really good.
Haha honestly, the thing about "classics" is that they really aren't picked based on how fun to read they are, so I don't generally expect them to be people's favorites - English teachers included! I'm mostly into sci-fi and fantasy myself.
Aw, sorry your baby boy was having a rough night.  What did you end up baking?  Unless you mean getting baked....in which case, nice!
For snacks?  Okay, I'm either leaning towards something spicy like Takis or something sweet like ice cream.  It's too hard to pick!
Oh man, you are absolutely speaking my language.  That is a book I am unfamiliar with, so you can bet that I will absolutely be looking it up the second I post this comment.  It sounds like you're just as much of a bookworm as I am, I'm wondering if you have a Goodreads account?  I love lurking people's TBR shelves even though my own is forever growing.    I've been really into thrilling survival books lately, which can be horrifying in and of itself.  I read The New Wilderness by Diane Cook last year and it was so good.  I also really like dystopia science fiction books about the end of the world.  As far as more straight forward horror goes though, I read "No Exit" by Taylor Adams and "The Last One" by Alexandra Olivia recently, both of which kept me on the edge of my seat.
It's all good, he has two molars coming in currently and didn't really nap today. I baked chocolate chip, peanut butter chip, and heath bit cookies!
Oh, I've been craving takis so much!!!
ooo I DO!!! https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4054997-madison-vessels  I need to start updating it more but I totally have one!! World War Z was the BEST audiobook I have ever listened to and I have started getting into the more survival horror stories because of it. I typically love paranormal and psychological horror but am open to all! lol     I just looked those up
ooooh, I think you've just made my decision for me.  I've been craving Takis like crazy.  I never used to be big into them, but recently I can't get enough!
You know, I really should get more into audiobooks.  My work allows us to listen to music in earbuds, and most of the time I listen to podcasts, which is great....but think of all the books I could have listened to!  I've never read World War Z, although I'll admit I have seen the movie.  I love to contrast and compare books to movies, the book is usually better though, so I'll have to pick this one up.    I'm definitely going to add you on goodreads, if that's okay!
The movie was actually quite. .strange in comparison. It was a decent movie but the only thing in common really was the name of the character and that there were zombies. lol   totally worth a listen!  I only got into audiobooks last year. My work, you can have headphones on as well and it was my saving grace throughout the year!   GO FOR IT!!! haha Im trying to get more current on there. I do have a goal listed for the year and as its attached to my phone, it does update well but I need to actually write reviews again and add more of my owned books  haha
OMG is your profile pic on goodreads Lydia from the Beetlejuice cartoon????? I LOVED that show! i have been looking for a streaming service that offers it FOREVER!
Oh really, strange in comparison?  You've piqued my interest!  I'm definitely going to have to get audible or something comparable again so I can give this a listen and see what the book has to offer.    I almost exclusively find all my next reads through Goodreads.  I don't often write reviews though, I'm too shy.  Which feels weird to admit, considering I used to write reviews for a student run newspaper.    She's my icon for my Twitter profile too!!!  I haven't seen it in FOREVERRRRR though, I wonder where you can even find it these days?
Ugghhh right?!  the best I have seen is that you can buy the DVDs but I havent gone that far yet! lol I am still hoping for it to be on a streaming service.
I'm going to have to look and see if I can find anywhere that offers it online for streaming....two heads are better than one, right?
yes! I will let you know if I find it!
It seems like it's on kimcartoon?  Not necessarily a traditional streaming site like Amazon, Netflix, or Hulu....but i'll take what I can get if it works.
Oooo I will look it up!! Thank you!!
You're welcome!  I only played one episode and it worked for me, so that's all I can vouch for.  I'm hoping the same goes for the rest because I'm soooo excited about this.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/l0b29s/discussion_whats_your_favorite_movie_why/

The Princess Bride. It’s sweet, soothing, funny and has a great cast! It’s very nostalgic for me :)
it's genuinely a 50/50 tie between two different ones for me!  crimson peak, i love because it's a lot of what i personally envision for romance (besides... yknow, the incest and murder) and without going into a full essay, it's just beat for beat the perfect movie in my eyes  and the last unicorn! some of it is childhood nostalgia, i used to watch it every day i could get away with it. it means a lot to me, and i could also write an essay about it
I HIGHLY enjoyed the movie The Arrival. I think it was well written, very well acted and I loved every bit of it! I also very much so love the Harry potter movies, The Lord of the Rings movies and The Thing
OKAY. ALRIGHT. I've been waiting for this question for ages because my favorite movie changed a little while ago. My current favorite is The Prestige!  It's... nuts. I've watched it two dozen times and I always find something new to marvel at with each watch. It has an amazing cast and everyone plays their character fantastically. Not to mention the beautiful scenery! I highly, highly, HIGLY recommend it to everyone ever!!!
Disney's Robin Hood! (Just answered this a few minutes ago in a contest lol)  I have a tattoo on my ankle that says "oo-de-lally" and the y is his tail and his hat witj the arrow is on the O. I went thru 3 VHS tapes as a kid, and listen to the soundtrack pretty regularly.  Honestly I can't tell you why. I'm not a movie person (I think most are predictable and don't capture my attention) but the ebb and flow just make me happy. I also might have realized I was gay because I didn't want to be Maiden Marian I wanted to kiss her. I wanted (and still want) to be Robin Hood!
I love this question because it’s awesome to read everyone’s answers and discover new movies to add to my watch list haha! Personally, I’m a huge fan of Kingsman- The Golden Circle, as well as The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Both have action, romance, cinematic style, and AMAZING soundtracks in my humble opinion lol! 😜
Hmmm... I think How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. I never get sick of it
Okay, so I like a lot of movies but one movie I could watch literally anytime and put on when I'm feeling down is The Nightmare Before Christmas. I just really enjoy it
I think tonight it'll have to be the notebook. Need to cry. Best movie to cry to. :)
My favorite movie is Memento from Christopher Nolan. I believe there are a lot of movies better than Memento and that I like more than it, but it's forever the movie that changed my life. I love films and this maybe the must important one in my life. It changed my appreciation for cinema and opened me up to new experiences that have made me a empathic, loving and understanding human being (at least I thing I am) through my own introspection and the changes it has giving me on society and life in general. I wouldn't be who I am without it.
inception is my favorite! there's so many layers (LOL literally with the dream layers but also in terms of themes and visuals), always makes me cry, and the ending has sparked so much discussion
So hard to choose...maybe Memento because it was so trippy. I saw it in LA in the middle of the day with lots of movie types and the buzz was crazy.  Also Run, Lola, Run.  Sophie’s Choice slayed me.   Out of Africa.  OMG— The Piano.   I can’t choose.
I've got so many in different genres. So I'll go with a best picture winner that beat Inglorious Bastards, Up, and Avatar (which made a trillion dollars but I don't care for) is The Hurt Locker. It doesn't have a historical premise like most war movies so definitely feels more current and it is a must watch!!  Its so intense but also has some light moments
One of my favorite movies has to be The Social Network because Aaron Sorkin is an amazing screen writer and the soundtrack fits the movie so good that it's eerie.  It's all around a really impressive piece of work for a movie about Facebook.
Shutter Island because it has so many big plot twists! I love figuring out what confusing movies are about! So typically movies like get out, dream house, inception are my favorite, I dont even know what that genre is called!
Amélie. I love the whimsical slightly lost and sad feeling of someone who doesn't quite belong but still loves life, and then the resolution of two weirdos finding each other. It gives me hope for my own love life. I hope my current weirdo lasts!
Aliens (1986). It's an Action-Horror that DOES EVERYTHING RIGHT! Besides Xenomorphs being one of my favorite all-time creatures, Ripley is a bad ass woman who doesn't need a skimpy outfit, tons of make-up, and special flippy moves to be an awesome woman protagonist that inspires little girls. I'm naming my first daughter "Ripley"; that's how much I admire the character! The story itself, the atmosphere, the lore, every character's presence and lines. The huge reveal at the end! Just everything is perfect in this movie to me. (Oh, and the Marine eye-candy doesn't particularly hurt, either...)
Sleeping Beauty, because I too was named after the sun (the animation), first movie I remember besides Logan’s Run which is second favorite. But the laugh the owl does in Sword in the Stone usually makes my month.
Tie: Clue (Tim Curry) and The Princess Bride.  Nuf said.
The princess bride
Best bloody movie ever!! 💕
That one is a close tie with Clue, for me.
My FAVORITE non-Disney-princess movie as a kid!!!!!
You like golden circle more than the secret service? I like both, in that genre Snatch is really good if you haven't watched
Totally hilarious movie!
It's a very well done movie.
A great movie, but hope you’re doing okay
=) That is what I was coming here to comment. Great choice
I loved it too. The first time I watched it I was like Huh? Huh? Huh? and the second time I was like, Oh!  Oh! Oh!  Such a great concept.
I came here to say the same!! It was such a good movie. I've yet to find a movie that I like as much as Inception
I feel the same. It's a great movie.
That's a great movie!
I honestly like them both equally, but if I HAD to pick one against my will I would have to go with Golden Circle because of the cast. Plus the use of John Denver songs is amazing lol. I haven’t seen Snatch but I’m adding it my list! Thanks for the suggestion! :D
My cat just pooped.   My nose hates it.  Coffee is brewing.  It is morning.  The wind is high.  My back is traitorous.
Hahahaha yeah, it took me a few watches to completely understand it
The cast was way better but I'm a sucker for an origin story, Snatch is like a cult classic which means you'll love it or absolutely hate it lol
I can respect that because I’m usually the same way lol. I’m sure if you’re suggesting to based off my fondness for Kingsman I’ll more than likely enjoy it! Worth a shot at least! (:
Lol, I'm dumb. Its more like a British Pulp Fiction, you had two movies set in the UK and my mind just went to Snatch!!!

Thats really sweet. Get it? 😀😀😀  ...I'll see myself out 😊
u/loulou927 - thank you so much for my sweet treats!! These are my favorites!
Delicious!!
I didn’t know those were a thing!!! I might have to get some for my MIL, she’s diabetic and loves York patties!
I’m glad she shares 😉
LOL 😂
Yay I'm glad you love them!
Yes ma’am!! I love York Peppermint Patties - These are sooo good.
Always!! 🥰

Chocolate frosted Bavarian cream is the effing best!!!!
but their hashbrowns are pretty fantastic toooo
u/fish-tuxedo I got you a lil dunkin' donuts gift card. It wasn't on your list, so I'll shoot you a PM with the info, or PM me your email and I can forward you the card. Get that chocolate Bavarian cream!
😂😂 love it
Damnit!!!  I always miss free donut time!!!
Absolutely.  Imagine them adding some raspberry jelly to the bavarian cream donut tho. That would be life changing.
OMG their hashbrowns are legendary ♥️
Omg haha I LOVE this meme! Thank you so much again!
Who knows, maybe there will be more donut time in the future!
That sounds really yummy!! :Shakes head: I am fasting! No donuts for me! Not right now, anyway, lol 😆
I'm going to go buy like 5 orders now and an iced coffee with almond milk to toast the excellence that is our taste.  ♥️
Ooohh!!!!
Not sure what your diet consists of, but these chocolate donut protein bars are pretty dang tasty...  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PGCT7DX/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_awdb_imm_t1_d3KbGbMGSYSDB
Well now I'm jealous, lol. I might need to stop by there when I get out to return these very shitty Redbox movies that I wish I hadn't wasted my money on! 😂🤓
I'll admit, these made me raise my eyebrows, lol 😂
Maybe that’s where the value in the Redbox movies is! Motivation to get up and an excuse to grab DD! Haha.
There's so many yummy looking products under this Quest brand! I feel I may be in dangerous territory, lol.   Really though, thank you. I've been looking for a way to treat myself to something kinda sweet besides a few swigs of chocolate almond milk here and there ♥️

I color while drinking chocolate milk because I get to decide what adulting looks like. 🤣
For me, embroidery has been an amazing mental break. Just pop on a movie, show, audio book, podcast, or music and stitch away. Tea along with it also helps.   I forget all about work when I stitch. It's so satisfying to watch the stitches fall into place.
Adult coloring books ftw
[Discussion] Taking a Mental Break  HEY EVERYONE! I’ve been away for a while because I wanted to focus on my mental health and getting my medication straight. I’m feeling much better and am ready to come back! Not long enough to reintroduce but I’m glad to be back. That being said, what do you do for a mental break? What activities do you do that seem to help? I’ll post my tips down in the comments too!
Listening to an entire album of any kind of music that I love. Pick an album that reflects the feelings you have at the moment, and just sit and listen. I love that shit.
When I want a mental break I sometimes do the following:  Read: instead of focusing on your own problems, you fill your head with a good story instead. I've found that sometimes the stories help me work through my real life problems, too.  Paint: I'm not sure how to explain it, but painting is so relaxing. It just feels so amazing and fulfilling to see something slowly come together and knowing that you made it.  Playing a video game: turn that negative energy about life into anger about how you can't beat the final boss 😂
I love binge watching YouTube or a show that just I enjoy while eating snacks and a glass of wine or hard cider/lemonade.  Reading is always great, especially with a cozy blanket and warm latte.  Sometimes I'll just do a hot shower or bath followed by a full moisturize session, and listen to a nice album on Spotify.   Also just hanging with my family or having a walk with my dog.
i love knitting! may or may not have accidentally gotten carried away and spent 7 hours knitting yesterday :)
I watch anime.
Valid 😂
Oooh, same! I'm practically always knitting but I do tend to multitask as well c:
I mean the day I realized I could just go buy cake or pie if I wanted to was life altering. It doesn't need to be a holiday. I don't need to be eating with others. I can just go get pie. *happy brain explosion*

Bwahaha! 🙌🎉☺️
Think it might be my next binge watch. I forgot how magical the Victorian era is.
Oooh I’m intrigued I needa watch I wonder if it’s on any streaming services
That’s awesome!!
Research! Let’s gooooo
The first season is on prime video!

[Closed] Thank you to everyone that guessed.  I have contacted the person that came closest.  I haven't done a flash before, let's try it out!  My irl best friend's birthday is coming up and I just sent her something from Amazon.  Closest guess in the next couple of hours gets something from their list for ~$10CAN (or a gift card if international).  Important information:  She's an author.  She loves history and books in general.  She's very smart and creative.  I spent between $10-$30.  She also lurks here.  If you're reading this roomything, I ❤️ you.
I’m going to say a gorgeous journal/notebook and a pen!
A historical coloring book and colored pencils. No idea if those actually exist, but if they don’t, they should!
Bookend busts of a famous person from history?
Haha! Little did I know that I should have named this contest: What I SHOULD have bought for her: Better ideas for next year 🤣🤣🤣  You guys are amazing.
a wax seal stamp kit
Monogrammed stationery
Noise cancelling headphones? 😆
What a wonderful friend you are come up I'm thinking may be some bookmarks or some book ends.
Perhaps a quill pen setup to hand write some new paragraphs.
A book shelf!
Article of clothing or blanket that has the words of a famous historical text printed on it
A book embosser! I’m pretty sure that’s not what you got her but it’s still such a cool idea I thought I’d put it out there 😅
Bath supplies (bath bombs, shower gel or something like that?)
A historical fictional novel?
Jewellery is my guess 😄
Idk why but all I can think of is a lamp/reading light.
Maybe some calligraphy pens and a gift card? 😅
A wordsmith deck?  That’s my guess!
a book shelf?
A history book
You sent her a book about “must read” books!
How about a set of bookmarks? A reading journal? A reading sculpture? A reading light? A page clip?
✒️ fountain pen and ink !
A nice lamp.
I think you bought her a journal and a fun pen or marker set
Journal set
A book about famous historical figures, a small book case, bookmarks, pens, sticky notes.
A bookend in the shape of a historical figure!
A globe
A very nice pen and journal set
Hmmm... this is tough. A shredder?  Just kidding. I write and a lot of drafts go through one.   A fountain pen and ink.
A custom wax seal stamp, because how cool does that sound?
Awesome international food stuff.
My guess is watercolor brush pens because those are absolutely lovely!
My guess is you got her a book about her favorite author. And also, some bookmarks and stickers.

1. Tell me why your favorite show is the best and/or worst anime of all time 2. Do something fun for yourself today! 3. DBAD  I will choose a winner at some point within the next 24 hours
I think I know all of the words to every episode of friends. It does make me feel comfortable though and if I ever want some time just to de stress and forget things this is my go to.   Happy birthday too
Fruits Basket is cute and humorous too! It has some good friendship and romance scenes
I like Avatar the Last Airbender because the whole story and the characters and everything is written so thoughtfully. Does taking a nap count as fun because I definitely might do that today haha.   Happy birthday!! 🎊🎉🎂🥳
Better Call Saul is the best because it manages to be both dramatic and humorous. The soundtrack is a jam, too.  Today I ate some really good chocolate cake. I always find good food fun.
Today I made Shepards Pie and watched some Korra, so that was fun  My fav anime is Steven Universe because it is clearly an anime and the best anime. It has all the best classic anime tropes! But also the best parts of western animation. It's the best.
Favorite show- Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Super funny, and it balances the dark humor with slapstick and pop culture allusions- unlike some adult shows. Best Adult Swim show. Period.   And I don't know what I could do that's fun for me. Guess I'll just watch ATHF.
Happy birthday!   My favorite show is the Office. I know, I know, but it’s my go to show. It’s funny and real. I’m so sad it’s not Netflix anymore.   I practiced stitches on my new sewing machine today. That was pretty fun. Waiting for the rest of my fabric to arrive tomorrow so I can start making my first quilt top.
My favorite show is This Is Us. It’s sooo good. The thing I love most is that it shows real issues that many people deal with on a daily basis. Everything you can think of from teen pregnancy, drug use, self esteem, bullying, homosexuality, adoption, death, special needs, all of it. It’s an amazing show and I can’t get enough of it    Happy Birthday! 🎊 I hope you have a wonderful day.   Today I got off work early so I’m going to treat myself to a nap and some Animal Crossing
Happy birthday! 🎉🎂🥳🎈🎊🎁 I hope you are enjoying your special day!  In my opinion, the worst anime I’ve ever watched is Toradora. Toradora is a classic romance anime with iconic characters, but the romance/characters/ending are just not what they could’ve been. The characters could’ve been further developed, (especially Ami) , the romance was so cliche, and the ending was so sporadic and left me feeling underwhelmed. Not only did the show have a lackluster ending, it lacked another season.
Happy birthday to you!! I hope it’s relaxing :)  My favorite show... I feel like it changes every month. I suppose a consistent favorite is Desperate Housewives
FRIENDS is by far the best and my absolute favorite. It just gives me the feel good feelings. I can jump in at any point and catch on to the story line quickly and it makes me laugh every time - despite having watched it over 50 times.   For something fun today, I sprinkled glitter on myself
Bulletproof. It’s English and just amazing.   I just had a nice bath. To me that was fun 🤩
Happy birthday! Have a great year ahead :)  NARUTO!!!! I think it's amazing because of all the characters and their character development. It's comedy,fantasy and action all in one! It is definitely the best. Hashirama, Minato, Sarutobi,Kakashi, Neji Hyuga,Gaara Rock Lee, Shikamaru, Hinata, Tsunade,Pein, Uchihas (so many of them ....esp Itachi ) and ofcourse Naruto are my absolute favourites. The emotional bond between the characters and the chemistry is what makes it even more special. (I like watching Boruto too).  I'll get myself some snacks then after class.  :)  You too have a great day!
Thanks for the contest! My favorite show is probably Adventure Time. What starts off as just a silly show with lots of random and crazy humor turns into a deep exploration what it means to mature, build friendships, become and hero, learn to love yourself, and so so much more. Top that off with continuous good humor and a surprisingly dark storyline and I can watch it again and again. It always puts me in a good mood.
1.  I love Psycho-pass.  It's probably my favorite anime and the best ever because I like dark, nasty stuff.  My favorite show is probably Lucifer.  It's not a very good anime because it's not animated, sorry 🤣😉 2. Today I will nap when my little guy naps, thank you for your permission bahaha.  Hopefully he sleeps soon, I'm exhausted. 3.  Thank you!  Happy Birthday. 🍰🎁🎂🎈🎉
I haven’t seen very many anime’s, but the ones I’ve seen I really liked. I actually just binged Parasyte this weekend and finished it yesterday. I love Migi 🥺 Death Note used to be a big favorite of mine too.   Hope you have an amazing birthday! 🥳🎉 January babies are awesome!
1. Happy birthday! :) My favorite show right now is definitely Wanda Vision! I can’t pick an all time favorite, lol. There’s too many amazing ones! But so far Wanda Vision is amazing, and just so dang original! We can’t wait for the next episode, haha.   2. I took a nice little nap earlier. :)  Thanks for hosting! Love it! I hope you’re having a good day!
Happy birthday! My favorite show is probably the Clone Wars, just because it was so badass! I am really liking futurama right now.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!! And death note is the best anime of all time because, come on. Have you seen L?? He’s amazing. And something I did fun today was go to the chiropractor and he cracked my back so good!!
Sailor moon is the best friendship magical girls and romance
Happy birthday! It's been years since I watched it, but my old favorite was Angel Beats. Cried hard every single time.
I'll always believe that Your Lie in April the the worst best anime ever because..   Best-- because the plotline is excellent and the music is great  Worst-- because I have never been so frustrated and tear struck (ok I probably have, I'm freaking sensitive but you get my point)
Happy Birthday! My favorite show of all time is Friends. To me it’s the best show because if I’m in a foul mood of any kind it’s an immediate pick me up. I can be sad or mad or depressed or lonely and I instantly feel better. I’ve seen each episode more times than I can count and I still laugh like I’ve never seen them before, they never get old!
My kids like Nakito I think that’s what it’s called lol 😂 I could be wrong it’s been on in the house way to much and I should know what it’s called
Happy Birthday! 🥳  Naruto is the best anime series i’ve seen. Lots of life lessons that kids can learn, and it’s such a cool concept.
-Happy Birthday  &  -Attack On Titan   No explanation for that is needed
Definitely Skins, because nostalgia :)  Thank you for the opportunity!!! Happy birthday
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is one of the best anime, IMO.  It's just unlike any other anime out there.  Happy birthday!!!
Happy birthday! 🎁   I love Criminal Minds. Suspense, surprise, and spookiness
Happy Birthday!! And thank you for holding this contest!   My favorite anime is the Lain series. It’s just so beautifully done annnd it’s a total rabbit hole mind$&@! which I love.  I had to work today, but I went to the grocery store afterwards, which was only fun because I went with my partner and we always have fun together.  What did you do for fun today? Anything special for your big day?
Happy birthday!  1) Favorite show at the moment is Pennyworth. Love the crazy characters, the action, witty banter/dialog, their take on alternate history, costume designs, and authentic looking settings among other aspects of the show.  2) I'm going to help someone on reddit and maybe get take out for dinner.
I'm not exactly sure what kinds of shows you're into, but if you have not seen ***The Wire*****,** PLEASE GO AND SEE IT. I believe it to be the greatest television show, EVER MADE, OF ALL TIME. No shocker that it's an HBO series. It's relevant more than ever now, and aside from being a well-written crime drama with great characters and dialogue, it's got some pretty serious and necessary commentary on political corruption, police brutality, drug abuse, and systematic racism. And if you've already seen it, WATCH IT AGAIN!   My family and I are still grieving over the loss of a loved one. It's been a rough week, but we are trudging through. Today is the first time I'm cooking  in a whole week, since in Jewish culture, you're supposed to abstain from any sort of day to day activities (such as cooking, laundry, shopping), for a full week after death. It's a bit of a celebration now that the mourning is supposed to be over, so my partner bought a really lovely bottle of bubbles, and we'll be cheerings to my loved one. ❤️
My all time favourite show would probably have to be Gilmore Girls cause every-time I put it on it warms my heart, following the single mom and her daughter through the years!  A ‘fun’ thing I did for myself was that I ordered myself some pizza after a hard day at work
HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYY   Well my new favorite anime is asobi asobase. Literally this comedy is my favorite!! It’s so funny yet original. You definitely have to check it out. They have mini clips all over the internet and they’re just ridiculously hilarious!   I took a ride out in a golf cart with my host family today! What’d you get to do for your bday?
Happy birthday!!  My favorite show is probably mad men or breaking bad, both are so well done and I’m sad that I’m done!   My favorite anime is obviously the OG Pokémon!
First of all, happy birthday to you!! How are you celebrating it? My favorite anime of all time is definitely Fullmetal Alchemist. I am always attracted to shows that talk about the bright side of humanity, but at the same time not afraid to talk about the dark side of it. The same descriptions go to Mawaru Penguindrum, which is my second favorite.
My favourite anime is Natsume Yuujinchou it's a really lighthearted good slice of life anime. I love all the different youkai you get to meet and the interactions between them and the protagonist.
Cowboy bebop is the best anime of all time. It’s just a perfect show even with the filler episodes.
Favorite anime or favorite show?
Favorite show - bobs burgers 🍔   And thank you - I will! I’m going to go take my dogs out to the park across the street that’s always empty and sit in the sun while they romp around
My favorite show is a tie between X-Files and Grimm! I love the conspiracy and monster related plotlines and fell in love with the characters!
Favorite show definitely has to be rick and morty dude. I could rewatch that repeatedly without getting tired of it. The animations and voice acting just feel so satisfying to watch!  And hell yeah I'll eat my bag of chips that I've been saving for awhile lol thanks OP
My favourite show is **Supernatural** my worst show is probably like Eastenders😂😂 my favourite Anime is **Jojos bizarre adventures**, my worst anime is boku no pico. I will go and eat some cake and stroke my doggo for a fun activity!
I am definitely doing something fun for myself today because Ive had a three day weekend yay! So I am off today! My favorite show is SVU (law and order svu) and second is my name is earl I really like svu because of the creative situations they think of and the fact that I’m surprised other people like watching f*ed up situations as much as I do.
My favourite TV show is Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It’s just amazing- exciting, empowering, funny. I can re-watch it over and over again.   I’m going to exercise today, which is definitely for myself :)
My favorite show is Friends... I never get sick of it!!   Todays my birthday so I’ll be indulging in some cupcakes later on:)
Favorite show is Supernatural. It’s just got it all - humor, emotion, hot guys, good villains. I’ve got a soft spot for it.   I went on a nice, long walk with my pup earlier. We both needed it!   Happy birthday!
My favorite show is Supernatural. It is action packed and has a great story.  Happy birthday.  Today I am relaxing at home and will exercise later.
Oh happy birthday!!!  Clearly DBZ is the most superior of shows, it teaches life lessons, its never ending, also it keeps my husband entertained for hours while I watch my shows! 😂  Today I took off work an hour early to give myself alone time before my daughters come home!   Have an epic bday!
Hey, Happy Birthday!! 🎉  One of my favorite anime is Keijo (also known as Hip Whip Girl) and it’s one of the worst anime but is so absurdly hilarious that I keep watching it. It is a bit NSFW because of the concept being college girls in swimsuits hitting each other only using their boobs and butts 👀 but I promise you it’s worth watching 😂  I’m gonna get some food I really like on my way in to work later tonight ;)  Good luck everyone 🍀
Food wars is absolutely amazing and makes me so happy to watch. It inspires me to go off and cook.   I’m going to cook something new tonight.
Happy birthday! The Office is the best because the humor is so cheesy but absolutely hilarious and you feel personally connected to the characters. Thank you :)
My favorite show is Supernatural... I think. Can it still be my favorite if I’m two seasons behind and dislike most of the latter part of the series??? I’ll pick something else. Not GoT either because of the last season. Hmmm 🤔 Got it! Sense8. It’s an incredible sci-fi concept that’s never been done but was done sooo well. It’s too difficult for me to explain any further than 8 people born at the same moment are all connected in their brains, knowing what each other thinks and feeling what the others feel, seeing what the others see, and they use this to help each other and try to defeat the bad guys. The main characters are from all over the globe (they filmed on site!!) and are very diverse. It’s got lots of action and sex too, and funny stuff and little things you pick up during rewatches. It ended up being cancelled after two seasons but the outcry from fans was enough for Netflix to fund a 2 hour finale since S2 left on a cliffhanger.  My fun thing for today is tearing myself away from this sub and my book swapping groups to actually read 📖 (this sub and book swapping are fun too but they’ve legit taken over my life)
Futurama. I make more jokes from Futurama than  any other show, and sing the Nibbler birthday song at birthday. I love that show. Just got back from the creek. That was nice!
1. Attack on Titan is SOOOOOOOOOOOO good! It's weird and creepy and intense, but also the only anime that really captures my attention. The storyline is unpredictable which I really love, and there is a Manga you can read that is further along than the TV show.  2. Thanks! I finished a house project that was driving me insane! Now I am enjoying some Teriyaki rice! Yum! 3. Thank you for the contest! and Happy birthday!! :)
Happy birthday!!   I would say Violet Evergarden is one of the best animes (imo) because of the storyline, art, music, everything! It's simply beautiful :') This anime was also produced by Kyoto Animation (had endured an awful arson attack 2 years ago :(), and the fact that they released a Violet Evergarden movie last year has been such an emotional release :')   As for something fun, I will take some inspiration and go binge watch a show!
happy birthday! 🌸 magica madoka is the best show 💗 it is a dark magical girl anime about a girl named madoka who is given an offer to become a magical girl but there are serious consequences! it is really sad but heartfelt 🌸
Happy birthday!!! My favorite anime is Sailor Moon. Very nostalgic for me~
Happy Birthday! My favorite show is greys anatomy!! I'm spending day running errands and reading!
Serial experiments lain is the bessssst anime~ take themes such as reality, identity and communication through philosophy, computer history, cyberpunk literature and conspiracy theory... roll it in a ball and BOOM. So good. Everyone should watch it once.   And the fun thing I did for myself is eat delicious sour candies~! ♥️
Happy birthday!  My favorite show right now is Schitt's Creek. I just love how positive it is; I like the moody TV show trend too, but sometimes it's too much
Happy Birthday!! My favorite show is Avatar the Last Airbender! It’s so well made, hilarious, with such lovable characters and interesting plot.
I loved Cowboy Bebop. The music, the characters, all amazing!
Best anime is attack on titan.  Worst anime, no suck thing.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!! 💜   Naruto is the best shonen anime. Hunter x Hunter is a close second. They really take the time to build and evolve their characters. The character development and back-stories are original and heart-wrenching. The protagonists are selfless little warriors who I admire so much and try to mirror in my own life. The villains are eccentric and maniacal and some have been understandably wronged. Not to mentions some of the hottest husbandos come from the shows (Kakashi, Itachi, and Hisoka, and Chrollo). 🙌😍  i did something fun, i went to bargain store and saw everything was 75% off - so i bought a lot of goodies.
Initial D.  Best because it was about a high school kid who did illegal street racing at night in a small "shitty" hatchback while doing deliveries, and I was like "That's me, I'm a high school kid that does some illegal street racing in a small shitty hatchback while working a delivery job".  Worst because I found out I couldn't drive like that and crashed.  No injuries except to pride.
Hello and Thanks for the Contest.   These 2 share the same spot for the best, I just can't think of the worst.   **[ᴄᴏᴡʙᴏʏ ʙᴇʙᴏᴘ ](https://youtu.be/TdBfgwHmQsQ)**, because the arc of the characters,  the music of  菅野 よう子, the eclectic melting pot of genres, Westerns, Cyberpunk, Science fiction, Film noir, Crime drama, Comedy, it's Bananas how freaking good it is, saw it the first time back in 2001.  **[ɴᴇᴏɴ ɢᴇɴᴇꜱɪꜱ ᴇᴠᴀɴɢᴇʟɪᴏɴ](https://youtu.be/YAH3r7LbSuc)**   Why your Birthday isn't on the calendar? did you put it already on a post like **[this one ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kzw7df/dr_mlk_jr_monday_daily_hangout_thread_18_jan_2020/gjq3w95?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)** ?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, is a darker take on your family friendly Sabrina the Teenage Witch. It's suspenseful, thriller, and just spookier and darker. You have teenagers who are called the Fright Club who hunt demons and battle the devil. You get romance from several different couples. Its diversity really impressed me honestly my favorite witch isn't even sabrina. There are 4 parts and it gets more thrilling everytime!!  Happy birthday!!
At the moment my favourite show is American Gods, I do like the show, but I really want to see Ricky Whittle.
I'm not huge into anime, but for a fav TV show, I'm going to toss my vote for Stranger Things! Stellar cast of non-annoying kids, tons of wonderful 80's Stephen-King-esque atmospherics, and a whole lot of wonderful thrilling sci-fi and classic coming-of-age lessons. Can't wait for the next season to come out! My fun thing for today is to bake some cookies with friends. Happy Birthday!!
I haven’t watched any anime besides Sailor Moon and Attack on Titan, though I really want to watch more! I just don’t know where to start, there’s so many! I love Sailor Moon because it brings me so much nostalgia from watching it when I was younger and it’s just cute. And they’re badass, fighting evil by moonlight. 🤣🌙  I’m filling out some cards and postcards now which is fun! Did you get to do anything fun for yourself? Thanks for hosting! ☺️
HAPPY BIRTHDAAAAAY!  My favorite anime is Pokemon because... yeah. I honestly never got into anime!  Overall my favorite show has to be How I Met Your Mother or Scrubs. I can watch both and not stop laughing.  I attempted to get a new bra today! While it didn't work out it was nice getting out of the house and having some girl time with my mom and sisters. We did all end up getting new snow boots today though!
Well my favorite anime is Ouron Highschool Host Club because it is both funny and sweet and sad at parts and dramatic. Definitely watched it a few times
Happy birthday!  May all your birthday wishes come true.  What are you doing to celebrate yourself?  My favorite show is Big Brother.  I expected myself to pick something good like The Sopranos, Lost, or Parks and Recreation......all great shows.  But no, I pick Big Brother because I am a glutton for reality TV trash.  It's got all you could ask for...drama, competition, secret twists, and a half million dollar prize.  What more could you ask for?  I've watched like three seasons in the past three months.  One might say I'm addicted.  I am one.  I decided to paint my nails today.  I'm not good at it, by any means.  You know how when kids color in a coloring book they scribble outside the lines?  That's more or less me with my nails.  Thank god I'm working from home tomorrow so I can go to town with the polish remover.
Keeping Up Appearances is my hands down favorite show.  It is a British sitcom from the 70’s and makes me cackle with laughter over the antics of the characters.  I always watched it with my Mom/Dad on Saturday nights growing up and now as an adult have shared it with kiddo/hubby.  Are You Being Served came on after and that too still is a laugh a second British humour series I adore!!!  Today, I did go put snd blow catnip bubbles for my outside kitties to give them a pick me up.  It was fun and made me smile!  Happy Birthday!!!  🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂🎉
My favorite TV show is Whose Line is it Anyway? because the (mostly) guys perform improv so everything is off the cuff. They're a tight-knit group and do crazy things to each other which makes the audience and them laugh. The show was on ABC for years, went off the air, came back, went off the air, and was later picked up by The CW. On the CW, it's in its 12th season.
My favorite anime .. that is soooo hard!! I'll have to choose attack on titan. The plot is so good, cliff hangers makes me wish for the next chapter right now. So many plot twist to keep me on my toes. I like how every character is unique. I have many top animes but I'll have to choose this one.
My favorite anime is Yu Yu Hakusho. It's about a boy who gets hit by a car and dies. He then comes back to life and becomes a Spirit Detective and hunts evil demons. It's made by Yoshihiro Togashi of Hunter X Hunter fame. It's an anime that is relatively popular but I still feel it's a little underappreciated.
My favorite anime is Your Lie in April. Although it's really short, only one season, it's able to captivate you by taking you through a range of emotions! You could go from laughing one second to crying the next. It's about a guy who wants to start playing the piano again, but is afraid to, he meets this girl who is wonderful at violin and begs him to become her pianist, she makes him find his passion for playing again  &#x200B;  The fun thing I did was drink Abuelita hot coco while watching New girl
Happy birthday! Ouran High School Host Club is the best anime because it's fun, accessible to non-anime fans, smashes the gender binary, and features an interesting cast of lovable characters.  My fun thing is going to be playing a video game with my husband!
Whose Line Is It Anyways is the worst anime of all time because it’s not even animated 😂
Future Diary is the best anime of all time bc it is so messed up lol
My favourite anime is Hunter x Hunter! It has a lot of arcs and took a while to finish watching but it was absolutely amazing from start to finish. The last arc just blew me away and I don't think I'll ever forget it. I highly recommend you watch it since it feels like you're going on an adventure along with Gon :)  Happy birthday!!! Hope you have a great day
I love Avatar the Last Airbender. I have a sleeve of ATLA tattoos lol. I also love Naruto and Naruto Shippuden. I am currently watching through My Hero Academia right now. I'm almost finished with season 4.
Thank you 3pm 🥰 I love friends too! 100% comfy show
I was in the hospital for 6 days last month and near the end of my stay, I was starting to get depressed. I’ve never felt happier or had a grander sense of comfort than when Friends came on my TV. I legit almost cried from happiness. My mom got my Nana the Friends box set for Christmas and even though we’ve all seen them a thousand times, we’ve been watching them in order and laughing like we haven’t seen them before, lol. Fav character? Fav episode?
Fruits Basket was my absolute favorite in HS! I haven’t seen the reboot but the series is so adorable. Thanks for the suggest!
This is true. Avatar is one of the best shows ever written xD Naps are fun and relaxing! So extra points for you :P

I love This Is Us! It's very human :) Brings me to tears sometimes but I feel like everyone can relate to one of the characters' stories <3 Also thank you chevy!
I watched Toradora in middle school! I remember loving and relating to Minorin and being sad when she got less screen time :') Liked the show at the time but to be fair it was one of my first exposures to romcom anime. The art style was really cute, sad the show's not as great as I remembered xD  Also thank you so much! Hope you're having a fun day too!
I can understand that xD I fall in love with so many different shows
Friends is definitely a comfort show 🥰
I haven’t heard of that one, gotta watch it!

You sound like a kind person 😊 I love those kinds of shows!!
Yess I love Gilmore Girls! Such a heartwarming show :)
Oh my gosh that anime is comedy gold 😂 I love surreal humor anime!! And that sounds really fun! Are you visiting their country? So far I’m just watching Jacksepticeye, and a nice redditor got me a piece of candy 🥰 so I’m happy hehe
Thanks a bunch 😇 I love Pokémon!!
I loved Penguindrum when I watched it! So strange and mysterious but amazing 🥰 and FMA is one of the best shows ever written. Thanks for the happy!! I’m not sure yet what I want to do 😂 right now I’m alone but maybe I can sing 😜
To be honest I call everything an anime just to be obnoxious
R and M sometimes scares me but the humor and voice acting is pretty great xD
Ah thank you for the recs and warnings xD
Oh man haha. Hope you have a fun 3 day weekend!
I love that!

Yes! I loved that show in high school! I still have to watch the later seasons though :) Thanks for reminding me! And that sounds delicious xD Thanks for the happy!
I love Violet so much :') It's nothing short of beautiful. I heard a little about the attack, the poor studio workers :'( I didn't know about the movie though! Really need to watch it. Thanks for the happy! I hope the show you pick has good episodes :)
Thank you so much! I love Madoka! All the characters were amazing though they broke my heart <3
Thanks so much! I've only seen a few episodes but it's 100% adorable :D
Thanks so much! I loved watching Grey’s in high school 😊 good luck on your errands!
I watched the first episode of Lain a few years ago and it looked spooky but brilliant! And for a second I thought you said you ate candles but either way I’m happy for you 😂
I get that 😂 I need the balance of light hearted and plot driven. Thanks for the happy!
Thanks for much!! I love Avatar with all my heart ❤️
Gotta watch it! Thanks for the suggest 😌

Not yet, but hopefully tonight! I love those anime :D
Scrubs is amazing xD And awe I know the struggle. I'm glad you got to have fun w fam and new boots!
This one is hilarious xD
Haha I get it xD reality tv is the greatest guilty pleasure. So far I haven't been able to do much but we shall see :) And hey, messy nail polish is just extra color, full of life!
Thanks so much! And I gotta watch this one! Love comedy :D
My favourite character is Joey. I just have such a soft spot for him. I’m a bit of a Monica to some extremes which is fine by me.  My favourite episode is between the one where phoebe gets the babies implanted and the thanksgiving one where Brad Pitt is in it. Phoebs wow face when she turns around and says hi just hilarious.
I've seen the original but I just started the second season of the reboot and I'm loving it!
It has so many good mental health messages too.  It's such a good show, it makes me happy!
You should make some! It's very easy!
I haven’t sewn since 9th grade in back in 2009. I’m sure you could pick it up!
Ooh I didn’t know it was free!
Glad to see someone else who grew up on Toradora! I watched the show a long time ago myself, and to be honest, it wasn’t that bad! I was invested in the romance and I did enjoy Aisaka’s character, but I felt a lot of elements had room for improvement.
Yes on sky. It’s like a modern day starskey and hutch. Funny, bloody, clever and gripping. I loved it. Third season starts Wednesday.
Please do! :)
Yesss! I'm so glad you've seen it. I always love getting people to watch it and see how they enjoy it more and more as it goes on :)
Thank you!  It's his fault I'm so tired to begin with so he'd better go out soon 🤪 silly little thing.
Oh it was AMAZING!!
🥳🥳🥳
Yes! Who was your favourite character?
That sounds like awesome times! What will you draw and/or write? Do you consider yourself more creative or more analytical?
You sound like a kind person!
I am glad that you like those two as well!! What is your favorite show?
Lmao okay 😂
Hahaha no problem!
Love it!! Happy birthday :)
It's good, if you're interested in monsters and myths.
It is actually really good, all jokes aside, my husband asked me to watch the originals with him and I loved it!
Omg! I love when someone has not only heard of it, seen it, but actually liked it! It’s sooo underrated   Thanks! Gonna get my daily stuff done on my Love Nikki Fashion mobile game and hopefully start The Boy👦, the Mole (why no mole emoji??? lol), the Fox🦊, and the Horse🐴
Thank you!
It is a little spooky at times but so good!! It gets intense at points and makes you really start to think could this be happening in real life...?!  Maybe I ate candles too 🤤
Yeah, all good, it was a long time ago. I'm old enough now to nearly have my own high school kids getting their licence.

I would 100% recommended finishing it
Ahh make sure you make time for yourself! Hope you have a lovely birthday. ☺️🎉
Ugh, I know.  I used to be ashamed but now I've just leaned into it.  Big Brother is just the tip of the iceberg.    That's true, but I'm pretty sure nail polish is supposed to go on the NAILS.  Not halfway up my fingers, big yikes!
I think Joey is the best friend in the group. He’s always there for everyone or at east tries his best to be, lol. Phoebe is my favorite and I’m totally a Phoebe as well, haha. I just watched that episode where Phoebe gets the babies implanted! My fav is The One Where Everybody Finds Out. It just never gets old 😂
True though! I sometimes wonder if the amount of high-quality anime around makes the good-range anime look worse in comparison xD
I love creativity but I'm not creative that often xD And love writing about or drawing woodland animals, even though many of them are decidedly not the foresting types. Being analytical is also a good skill to have, so I'm working on it :) How about you?
Awe that means a lot :)
Yess agreed! It's incredibly beautiful :)  Mobile games save me xD
I don’t blame you, they smell delicious 😂 maybe I’ll bribe a friend to watch it with me, I like watching spoopy things with other people and it’s also pretty fun 😊
Awe you are so kind 😭 thank you 💜💜💜
Awe <3 you're so kind!! Thank you Kitten :D
Ah yes how could I forget?  They don’t know we know they know we know
Would love to see some of your work! I guess I would say I’m more creative, though I’m absolutely fascinated by science and technology.
Enjoy my friend!!

Ahh so close! Glad he is feeling better already! <3
I was soooo close.
If you scroll to the right, there’s a pic I just took of him. He’s his sassy self as usual and drinking. He’s back to normal!

How cool!
If we can ever have guest again, before a guest come in — I would bless them with the golden hippo (up n down ; side to side) and tell them to rub it 3 times before walking in. After the rubbing of the golden hippo is done, they may proceed in but have to said “JUMANJI” as they crossed over.  Thank you 😉

Hi Aaliyah! I'm also new to the sub, stills getting a feel for everything. I hope you enjoy your time here. I must admit, PINK IS ALSO MY FAVORITE COLOR! My mom refused to let me get an all-Pink dress for my quinceañera so I had to go with a white dress with hot pink flowers. She says she regrets it and that she will let my baby sister pick whatever she wants no matter what tradition or others say. My baby sisters favorite color is also pink or red.  My baby sister and brother, now 3yo, are twins. What advice or wise words do you have in helping us raise them and handle them with respect? I feel like their bond is unique compared to non-twins.

Welcome
Hello and welcome!! 😊
Heyy there!!!!!!
Hello and welcome!!!!   What are your favorite hobbies?  also, I love clothes and makeup!! lol
Welcome to our little group:) glad to have you!
Hi there! I'm pretty new here, too, but I'm excited to be a part of this community and to have you here with us! I can't answer a lot of questions like some of these more experienced folks, but I'll gladly be your newbie-buddy! 🤗  Do you have any favorite books or games?
Yay i also love the color pink! 🤝♥️
Hi Cupcake! I have 3 brother including my twin and 2 sisters! To put it bluntly and honestly I left my job because it was a toxic discriminative prejudice and pretty racist place to be unfortunately. As a mixed race woman you can see my issues with working somewhere like that. Was a shame really.   You’re right the people seem so wildly lovely! I’ve been looking at some threads and I’m so amazed at how kind people are🥺
Hi there! Hmmm my favourite one would be green tones I did for a night out. It turned out pretty spectacular and I wasn’t expecting it at all😂
Ohhh I love girls night I miss it so much! & yes I am super fun on girls night even if I do say so myself😂 you defo seem like you would be too! Andddd no no that’s probably the worst thing you could ever say to me😂😂😂😂  hunnnn you can wear whatever you like! Style is about you as a person and expressing yourself through the way you dress! Putting pieces together is 2nd! Always 2nd😊 I get so many compliments about my style but I honestly believe people love it cause I dress unapologetically for myself. I know what I personally think looks good and more time if you think it looks good, other people will too! So next time you don’t know what to put together grab a few items you think will look good in your head and just go with it! If you think it needs tweaking ie colours or material type, think of what you’ve got before you start tearing the wardrobe apart😂😂 honestly you will find it so much easier putting pieces together. And that is why I don’t like fashion trends for that exact reason!  Loool I’m rambling can you tell I love styling a lot a lot?😅
If I had six cats my six dogs would defo eat them
Same here, I’ve spent some time on forums and google asking how to navigate myself round haha. I loveeeeee that your favourite colour is also pink!!! Everyone normal turns their nose up at its fabulousness! I’m sad you didn’t get to wear your dream dress but at least your sister can - I feel like that’s what us older sisters are for? we’re the trial and error run haha, the amount of things I watched my younger sister be allowed or not have to do whereas I had no choice at all??  In regards to the twin thing, me and my brother started living separately when we were 9/10. Not even in the same city which was sad so one thing I would say don’t ever split them up against their will! Whether it’s for a night or not. Let them be around each other for as long as they want/need. Their twin is their comfort. Treat them as equal cause the older one is going to be reminding the younger one how much more superior they are that will defo happen😂 I was the younger one and I’m a also a girl and well it was annoying! Oh and the twin sense is definitely real so listen to them if they mention it
I am so sorry to hear about the toxic work environment. Racism and prejudice are not ok in the workplace and I am sorry you had to deal with that. I think you are fabulous and hate that people are treated differently because of the color of their skin.   I can't  imagine being one of six kids. My best friend growing up had 2 brothers and 3 sisters and their house was always chaotic. All of the kids waited until they were settled into their careers before having kids. I wondered if they opted to have fewer after growing up with such a big family.
Green tones can either look like emerald jewels or grassy moss on me with nothing in between haha! Great job on creating a spectacular look!

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/l08s4k/discussion_if_you_could_choose_any_name_for/

I like my name so I would probably keep it! But I like the name Charlotte, Scarlett and Isabella. Those were my top three choices when I named my daughter lol.
My parents told me the other names they were thinking of naming me were Juliana, Pearl, Rose, or Cassandra. But instead they went with the worst name ever haha. I would change it to any of those if I could!
Ravenna, I had never heard that name before until I watched Snow White and the Huntsman and I instantly fell in love with the Evil Queen so I would change my name to that one
Probably Akyra, it is the name for all my DND characters and Animal crossing LOL. But I may one day name my daughter that if I get to name 2 daughters.
Cora. I love it. If I ever have a daughter, one of her names will be Cora.
"Your highness"
eugene... lol
My middle name and danger...
Emily Elizabeth, I've always loved that name from watching Clifford the big red dog lol I also like the name Hannah
Dunya or Rukiya, I’m pretty sure my father was like “nah, we’ll give our first born a name where everyone will ask all the time if it’s a short version of another name that’s also similar to my favourite chocolate bar”
Jagoda :)
Catherine. I don't know why, but I love it.
I'd love to be Evelyn.  Because Evelyn of the Mummy, and cause Evil Lynn ( not sure if that's how she is spelled, from He Man)
Sir Thaddeus j. st John
I’m okay with my name, even though there were always so many of us growing up. If I could change it though I’d go with something with a cute, gender neutral nickname like Charlie short for Charlotte.
I've always loved the name Emily. I've considered actually changing my name to it one day.
I would probably legally change my name to butterfly honestly.
I absolutely love my name, but i really like Aimee. It's my sister's name though. So I would go with Yadira because it's my mom's middle name and I love names that start with a Y.
I think if I could change my name “from birth” like grow up with a totally new name I’d pick Jensen.    But if I had to change it tomorrow and therefore learn to respond to a new name and get people to use it I’d pick Lorelei. It’s close enough to my real name that it’s an easy transition but it’s just Cooler than my name
the one I have because I already choose it once back when I got adopted as a kid :)
I would choose my alias “Lissy” as my legal name. My legal name is Melissa, and I like it, but family and friends have always called me “Lissy” because I hate the nickname “Missy”! However, I do like my name, so it’s not a big deal.
I considered changing my name to Camille while in high school, and then I went by Noa while in my late teens/early 20s (I still know a few people who call my Noa just for the heck of it).
I would keep the same, the meaning of my name is "Four pillars of destiny" .. this has always been a good discussion point when I meet people abd it sure sounds powerful
You know. . I used to HATE my name. I was the ONLY Madison for EVER. (then when I was like 12, it was SUPER popular. lol)  but now that I am older, I dont mind it as much!
I'd probably keep my name because I don't like change 😅
I've already had a name change so I'm very happy with my name. Was very much not before hand.
Probably Amelia. I love that name so much.
I used to hate my name and tried to get everyone to call me by my middle name when I was a kid. It never stuck. I now like my name, but would still like something a little less common. No real idea what. I just like unusual and pretty names. Might have named my son Ellery, if he had come out a girl.
I actually like my name and wouldn't change it, but I have always loved the name Lydia.
I like my name and can't imagine being called anything else. There's a common shortened version of my name that can also be full name that I've been called by teachers a few times and I hated it aha!
Zane  I honestly hated my name back in primary school. It wasn't until around 2010 or 2011 when One Direction was popular that I learned to like my name. You don't know how many times people would say, "Like Zayn from One Direction?" whenever I would introduce myself.  Maybe I didn't like it because I didn't know anyone else with my name.
I'm perfectly happy with my name but if I had to choose a new one I'd want to be name after a goddess. Like Athena or Thalia.

HEY! What's up! I'm Jaala I've been lurking in this group for quite a few years now and I just love seeing people getting small funny gifts every now and then when I scroll reddit. Just realized tonight also that I joined this when I wasn't 18 yet lmao and saw someone's intro and thought I should make my own :)  I'm from the Philippines and I'm going to college this year I'm applying for 3 colleges I already got accepted into 1 so I hope the 2 other ones treat me well.   I'm also studying music on my own through youtube and meeting people online! Quarantine sucks dude so this hobby was something I really enjoy and I hope to make good music to share someday.  Hope you guys are having a good week.

I love RnB and Jazz! I reccommend my favorite artist right now lol Jason Dhakal!

rnb and jazz! if you want a reccommendation i reccommend jason dhakal

Yummm sushi is definitely in my top 5 favorites! Good choice
Oh nice :) what kind of music do you like? And what do you like creating?
Excuse my ignorance those were the music tools I’ve been exposed to, I totally don’t know the right words! That’s super cool. You said somewhere else you like jazz and R&B, is that what you like to create too?
I love RnB I reccommend you my favorite artist at the moment Jason Dhakal and I wanna create RnB music too!
Yes! Basically what I do with the instruments is I do this thing called using a "Pen tool" and I just map out chord, patterns, and etc.   And yup I love jazz and RnB hopefully I get to create music like so. :D thanks for asking
I will def look them up then :)  If you’re ever bored and wanna chat, my PM’s are always open for any reason - I work nights in the US, which is the day where you live, so it works perfectly!

Congratulations on your engagement. I must say, I've been married less than two years and I'm 29. So whenever I see someone young engaged, it takes me a while to process because I feel they are so young, almost innocent children. But, even that you are young, I'm sure you made a wonderful decision for yourself and wish you all the best! I love my husband and marriage has been nothing but good to me. Then again, we are both really calm people and don't bother getting worked up about disagreements, so that definitely helps us out!
Hello and welcome!! One of my majors was Japanese and Japanese culture!   &#x200B;  What are your favorite ways to relax?  &#x200B;  Also, Hello and welcome!!!! <3
Hi amber! Good to meet ya:)
Animes include Studio Ghibli, Sailor moon, One Piece, Girl who kept through time, your name, etc. I really love long socks at the minute and am slowly expanding my wardrobe to be more cute xx Totally in love with sakura things at the moment too and also hoping to get into gaming more xx Thanks I'll let you know if I need help ☺️ hope you're okay x

Happy Monday, bippity boppity boo! ☺️   My favorite Disney films are the Hunchback of Notre Dame, Mulan, Beauty and the Beast and Holes! I love all the songs from Frozen and Beauty and the Beast especially. My favorite one though is probably Bells of Notre Dame. And my favorite characters are probably Olaf, Sleeping Beauty and Marie from Artistocats!  I like [this meme](https://imgur.com/a/0LZG4IL) because it’s so relatable. 😂  Thanks for hosting! Here’s my [Wishlist!](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/11C0MQ6JE1OTV?ref_=wl_share)
bippity boppity boo   My favorite Disney film is Tangled, my favorite character is Stitch (but Wall-E is a close second) and my favorite song is "You're Welcome" from Moana. My guess for you is...... You favorite movie is Hercules, you favorite character is Simba, and your favorite song is "You're Welcome" from Moana, because it has to be everyone's favorite by law.       Hope [this](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jennaguillaume/when-you-wish-upon-a-meme) is okay, I couldn't pick just 1 but I think #5 is my fav. Thank you for the contest!
Hello! My favorite Disney film is Big Hero 6 and Moana.  My favorite song is (https://open.spotify.com/track/6YH2r9NyEJTjlRmKOCvxgJ?si=U5XnTVrxQQyUbv5YHDigxw) We Know the Way from Moana   My guess is your favorite is Daisy Duck, Cinderella, and Mowlgi from the Junglebook with your favorite song obviously being Bippiti Boppity Boo. 2. https://i.imgur.com/PyzQbDi.jpg 3. https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/CKBZVMTFKQWH?ref_=wl_share  Hope you have a fantastic Monday!
Okay so this is difficult!  My favourite movie would be Wall-E closely followed by Up and Wreck it Ralph also I loved the old animated 'Sleeping Beauty' as a kid. My favourite characters are: Mulan and Wall-E Favourite song: Once upon a dream and , A whole new world , Remember me and In this place.  I'm really bad at guessing so I'll hope you like the same things as me. Hehe :)  Meme: https://images.app.goo.gl/vuyE4LtnRf5j6DvB6  Wishlist: https://www.amazon.in/hz/wishlist/ls/20KKUTUXIFFWQ?ref_=wl_share   bippity boppity boo

Bippity Boppity Boo, no joke that's what we call out when we want our three kids' attention in a public place. If we just want one, it is based on their age, eldest is Bippity and youngest is Boo. Saves the hassle of yelling "John" (Fake name) and having all the Johns look at us.  My favourite... Film: "TRON: Legacy", the first one was good too, but the updated graphics (and Daft Punk's soundtrack) in the 2010 sequal compared to the 1982 original just made the world so much more believable. Character: "Gonzo", Disney now own The Muppets. Song: Hard to pick a favourite, there are so may good Disney songs. I guess it depends on my mood at the time, so for now I'm going to go with "You're Welcome" from Moana.  Your favourites: Lion King/Genie (from Aladdin)/Bippity Boppity Boo  Why have one Disney Meme when you can make them all [https://imgur.com/a/jg1isMI](https://imgur.com/a/jg1isMI)  [Wishlist is here](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/registry/wishlist/3MXH5EHWXQ82P/) ~~will have to be added later cause I'm on mobile at the moment.~~

I'm going to guess that your favorite movie is *Ratatouille*, your favorite character is Moana, and your favorite song is "I'll Make a Man out of You" from *Mulan*.    This is my favorite [Mulan Meme](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/73/1a/43/731a43f43c97a944cc9b411d69b542b7.jpg) ever!   [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2C27S36776I42?ref_=wl_share)
My favorite Disney movie is probably Beauty and the Beast because I'm a little book nerd who can relate to Belle.  It's so hard to pick just one of my favorite songs from that movie, I want to say "Be Our Guest" because it's so fun and full of life, but I think my true favorite is "Something There" because it's a turning point in the movie and just a beautiful song.  Off the top of my head, [this](https://altarofgaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/47-best-disney-memes-peter-pan.jpg.webp) would be my favorite Disney meme!

Thank you for the contest!
I just randomly came up with something. I think your favourite movie is 'The Incredibles'.( Lol I'm really thrilled by this contest. )
https://www.amazon.in/hz/wishlist/ls/373N9FX9IW537?ref_=wl_share  Also sorry changed my wishlist due to some errors.
Wow! I wouldn’t have guessed, but it is a powerful, emotional song. Only the second Disney song ever to make me cry! 🤭  I’d be interested to know what your favs actually are ☺️   Glad you loved the meme, and thanks so much for fun contest! ☺️
Awe darn😂 and true though! I forgot how much I love talking about Disney even though all my friends are into edgier shows and movies 😜
Thanks for hosting
That’s so cool! I didn’t have a Wii, but I can’t help signing every time I hear it ☺️ And Pocahontas has always been my favourite Disney Princess. Such a gorgeous movie!
😂 it is funny right I was laughing when I seen it too.
Thank you for the contest! It's fun to look through everyone's memes :)
He's helped me send some pretty strange texts. He's great at screen swiping at the strangest moments haha. ❤️
Aw I love Wall-E as well! I will definitely keep an eye out for your other faves! Thank you, friend, I hope you are as well. 🥰
55 was a personal fav of mine too 😂😂
Oh my god, Wall-E!  I haven't seen that one in SO LONG.  I used to work in a video rental store and I would love playing that one on the TVs when I was at work.  So good.  Hope you have a great day yourself!
Unfortunately that isn’t my favourite movie lol. I can’t believe no one has got it yet🤔
I will definitely add my favourites when I close the contest (will add an edit)...I feel like I’ve made it so hard to guess!   I love memes, so Disney memes are a bonus 🥰
I could talk about Disney all day! I’m always the first one to volunteer for a Disney quiz 😂. I actually can’t wait to have children so I can actually share my love of Disney with them :)
He must of knew it was Disney related and had to have some input lol ❤️
I haven’t got too any other correct guesses yet but still going through comments and it’s getting late in the UK so might have to pick it back up tommorow lol. I’ve had a good day for a Monday lovely and a bit of good news, I’m going for my first covid vaccine tommorow :)
Awww 🥰 I totally get that though 😂

Oh that's so awesome! I can't wait until it gets more widely available here. Have a great night! <3

Contest closed!  **I'm going to be attempting to assemble** [**this Ikea Laneberg dining table**](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/laneberg-extendable-table-white-60416138/)**.**   When I am finished assembling, I will leave a top level comment with a picture of my table to end the contest! I'll sort by new and the last person to comment before me who has a working wishlist link and RAOA \[intro\] post will be the winner! :)  **Some facts:**  * I'm not super experienced in Ikea furniture building, but I like to think I have some common sense when it comes to putting things together. * I'm less of a "measure twice, cut once" type of person and more of a "cut a million times until it looks okay" type of person. * I'll be trying to do most of this by myself and will only ask my husband to help if I really, really need more physical strength/stability. * My cats may or may not distract me during this process. * I'll probably take breaks during this process. * I have opened the boxes and [this is what I have to figure out](https://imgur.com/a/queBRRR).  **Wish me luck! Contest ends tonight!** (If I don't finish building tonight, I will pick a random participant before midnight EST to be the winner.)

Good luck. This is why I just buy my furniture at Goodwill. I do not have the patience for IKEA, man.
op needs backup
Are you done yet 👀
The longest time I’ve ever spent putting something together was 5 hours. NIGHTMARE.
One time I assembled my ikea shelf and forgot the screws and when I put my cans on it the entire shelf caved in 😭
I am obsessed, too! 😂
How does it look? Feels accomplished to finish something like this. 😀  [WList](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2W6CHFQSXY0M?ref_=wl_share)

🦖
Last ikea purchase I made had half the predrilled holes missing. Spent a good hour pulling everything apart and putting it back together thinking I had made a mistake! Good luck
💀
Good luck

We bought a shelf for my husbands office and it took like 3 hours to put together lmao

Yay IKEA party.  Enjoy your week
Enjoy your week!
I've never been to an IKEA
I hope you’re not having a hard time assembling it!
Good luck. IKEA furniture can either go together easily or require multiple tries. I have put together my share of it. I hope it turns out well so you can enjoy it.
Are you getting hungry? I sure am! 😂
I've assembled many ikea furniture myself in the past... They are not the most fun thing to do, but I love going to ikea to get inspirations 😊😊
I think I’m going to go get some dinner!
Oh lord :))) good luck. Building stuff (not just ikea) takes way way longer than expected. Parts dont line up... cant find a screw even though you end up with 7 extra... lol. Enjoy the nightmare called assembly.
good luck!!
💛
What a cute table. Keep up the hard work. I bet you'll be done soon if you aren't already. c:
💜
What are you going to eat on it tonight?
This is going to look great in your kitchen!
I hope you’re almost there! Assembling things can be so exhausting.
👽
I hope you finish tonight so that you can eat dinner on your brand new table! That would be so fulfilling.
That looks like It'll be loads of fun to put together lmao
❤️
I’m a huge IKEA fantatic and I’ve assembled many of their items for myself and my cousin. The greatest thing about them is that everything is already pre measure but do make sure you count your screws and what not. I’ve had 2 items that has less screws which is nu bueno.  Also if you don’t wanna ask your husband, YouTube’s got many IKEA tutorials, in case if you need a sneak peek ;)   Honestly if I could, I’d make my entire home all IKEA based but my parents don’t like IKEA items  Yet they still be taking my shelves 😂  Good luck and can’t wait to see the end result :)))

We’re going to have Chipotle for dinner

Woooo! Good luck hope it's going well!

Checking back. Keep making progress!

I especially love how, on the website, it looks super simple... until he pulls it out to expand it and then it looks like it'll be a nightmare to put together lmao
🍀
Did you know that IKEA moved their headquarters? I didn't know that.
I didn’t know that either!
Kiddo still only going for the rice and chips 😐

The cats are probably loving the box

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/l09p5n/discussion_whats_the_fattest_thing_youve_ever_done/

Oh I'm a fat guy lol!! So there are way many to choose from hahaha. Definitely ate my fair share of pizzas by myself. 10 or so cookies at a time. But that shit don't happen any more.
I may or may not have used vanilla wafers to eat a container of chocolate frosting (Betty Crocker). Nobody saw it, so you can’t prove it. This is all alleged.
for about 2 months, every weekend, my husband and I would go to kroger and buy a cake. And im not talking the small cakes. Im talking hte big unicorn style cakes! hahhha
I can't leave tacos unfinished. So any taco night. We have tacos still? They going in my mouth.
This was actually when I was a string bean in high school but I had the munchies.. I ate a 12 pk of powdered donuts, almost an entire family size bag of okedoke cheese popcorn, and drank 2 sobes. We had off campus lunch, so I got all that food at lunch time and then I ate all that in my art class after lunch. I can’t imagine doing anything like that now!
...ate a 1.4 lb bag of Swedish fish in a day...definitely didn’t happen today...
Fattest thang... and the BEST thang. Me and my sister couldnt decide on a fast food place. So we went to all of them on the street and ordered from the value menu. It was amazing and 100000% recommend lol.  I think we ended up with something like this...  Sonic- Junior Banana Split  Jack in the Box- Tacos  Wendys- Cheeseburger  McDonalds- Fries  Burger King- Chicken Nuggets
I once ate 2 pounds of short ribs I'd cooked for dinner,  then remembered I was supposed to be attending a friend of a friend's birthday dinner, where I promptly indulged in a large steak and garlic fries.
I ask as I sit here eating whipped cream with a spoon directly from the container 😂
Girlllll   I have eaten a whole pizza
I’ve eaten a whole pizza by myself
i don't know if it the fattest but is my proudest fat boy moment.  I once walked to a new friend's house and absent-mindedly said it was time to add the noodles of the sauce will burn before they are cooked.  five seconds later a timer goes off.  his mom had set a time to do just that. the spaghetti that nite was delicious.
Umm, 6 donuts on the go
I once got 4 servings of food at an all you can eat Japanese place. Might be the first place I go to to eat at once the pandemic is over!
I’ve never heard anyone use the word “fattest” in this context! If I had to choose, though, I’d say eating a whole large pizza myself! 😂
Okay so when I was pregnant I had super bad morning sickness, which was more like morning, afternoon and night sickness. TMI but I literally couldn’t keep anything down. BUT that didn’t stop me from having some weird cravings occasionally. So one day I had my boyfriend stop at McDonalds for chicken nuggets, Burger King for their fries and Wendy’s for a frosty. I knew what I wanted. Regretted it later on when it was all coming back up, but whatever, it was worth it. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤣
a whole big bag of chips 😆
There are a couple of things that I can eat a disturbing amount of.  Sushi is up there.  We used to (damn you pandemic!) go to an all you could eat sushi place where you had to pay for anything you didn't finish.  I always ordered slightly more than I needed.  But I don't think I ever left without having coconut icecream and a tiny mousse cake after.
I used to eat ice cream so much we had to implement a rule where I was only allowed one thing of icecream a week. And I’ve had to cold turkey ice cream more than once...I may have a problem 🍦🍨🍦  And there was this one time when I was pregnant that we went to a burger place like 5 minutes away and the burger and fries were basically gone by the time we got home. I snarfed them down good 🤤
Everytime I go to Buffets, any type, I eat an absolutely ridiculous amount of food. The amount that I normally would not be able to finish if it wasn't a buffet. Maybe even three times the amount I wouldn't be able to finish...
Oh boy... back in the first year of uni I used to get Domino's two for Tuesdays for myself. Sooo two large pizzas and a box of cookies that I would eat on my own whilst watching Netflix.  That.. is definitely the fattest thing I've done lol
At frosting with my bestie straight out of the little tub on a spoon. 😅
Her name was Hilary, you didn't say DBAD!!! 😂😂😂 Joking, I used to eat two whoppers and fries with a coke when they were 2 for 5 not too long ago, and I finished two baconators at once a couple times to win bets
Happy cake day!!
Omg bud! I didn’t even realize happy cake day!!
Happy cake day!
So with you on the pizza!! Large pizza no problem! I assume it doesn't happen anymore because you don't let it!! I stop at one slice less than half now 😢
I've aspired to eat a whole pizza alone, all I could manage is eating a small alone! Even a medium I ended up sharing the rest cause I couldn't finish but if it was at a buffet, I would be able to finish...
I mean.. I use my fingers, so wafers are a great substitute...
This is genius.
This is fantastic! Cake is the best!
OMG, That is literally awesome!! yumm
I’m impressed!
haha That's a great accomplishment! They're just that good!
Oh man! That is fantastic. Now I want to do this for a date night
This sounds amazing.
That is absolutely EPIC! I aspire to be like you!
Omg I love doing that!! Especially when you freeze the whip cream?? So good!!
I do that all the time. Or squirt it from the can straight into my mouth.
Lol we wrote the same thing at the same time!!!
Same!
That’s a talent!
They are sooo easy to eat a lot of!
Oh my god I love you!
I thought it said fastest at first!
Oh I love you for this 😂
I ate a ridiculous amount of food while pregnant!
Thank you!!!
Thank you!!!! Well it didn't hit till 7:30 tonight lol. 9 years I have spent on reddit.
Thank you!!!!
Yea once I turned 30 I decided i would control my eating a little better. Oh I could never stop at just one piece of pizza lol. But definitely don't make myself miserable.
Yeah! I love sugar to scoop up my sugar!!! lol
I “imagine” it would taste like dunkaroos from my childhood. 😋
I still have the bad habit of having to look at the cake display when I shop 🤣🤣🙃
I am addicted! It’s a problem!
amazing idea! Super romantic lol
Gotta try it. Get the best from everywhere lol.
Yessssss 🍕 ❤️   I mean I haven’t done it in a while but yeah I’ve done it. A Costco pizza
Amazing when I think about how sometimes I eat 1 slice and I’m content lol
Ikr 😭 I am such a sweet tooth ughh
Haha it was the best food ever! I ended up eating more than my husband, and I'm less than 100 lbs LOL No regrets. Love that place!
Right? At work we had a snack cabinet and on my breaks I would raid it and have snacks spread all over my desk and in my desk drawers so I could eat between calls.
I do love a good cake [day]!
Wow!! Congrats! We love having you on Reddit!!
Me neither, if a pizza has 8 slices I'll eat 3 if it 10 I'll eat 4
Haha yes! The fattier option 😂 but yum! What if Oreos
I used to go to Sonic for a watermelon slushee, Whataburger for fries and little Cesars for pizza 🐷
Oh me too!!!! What's your favorite?
Hahaha thanks. Well when people are so nice like you it's nice being here.
Gotta do what you gotta do. Them cravings need to be met! 😁
German chocolate!!
Oh I like me some German chocolate, but better than sex is probably my absolute favorite.
That’s a good one ☝️

Moana!!
Mulan
Favorite movie ever? The Heat.
Eddie Vedder’s soundtrack for Into the Wild
Great question! The Trainspotting soundtrack.
I love all the LOTR soundtracks but especially Two Towers.
Greatest showman soundtrack...  Love love love it
I really love Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1. It's all licensed songs, but such a good variety of great music.
Angus and Empire Records
Do scores count as soundtracks? If so, Revenge of the Sith. If not, Nightmare Before Christmas.
Right now ... The Greatest Showman for both.
Probably your name and titanic. They make me bawl my eyes out every time  ):
Hamilton. The songs are so good.
Harry Potter. There’s just something about it that gets to me. I also really love the Braveheart soundtrack and Hamilton of course.
The [Mummy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1aGsvvAhy8Q) from 1999- it came free on the dvd as a secret extra
For a long time my favorite was the Queen of the Damned soundtrack!! Idk what it is now. I don’t watch a ton of movies. lol
I have too many to list haha  Black Panther has a great soundtrack with original Kendrick Lamar songs and score by Ludwig Göransson!
Hello Dolly.  It gets me every time with that damn "money is like manure" and "forest green shutters."  The music, the words, the costumes...  Put on your sunday clothes, There's lots of world out there!
Probably the Fate of the Furious soundtrack but Black Panther is close though.
Secret Life of Walter Mitty  Stranger than Fiction  Basically anything Howard Shore or John Williams  ETA: The New Pope, Coco, Silicon Valley, Cashback, Walk the Line, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
I have a couple:  Top Gun  Queen of the Damned  Shrek
I recently just purchased the sound track for the Netflix movie ‘Eurovision.’ I absolutely freaking love that movie!!!! And Will Ferrel has a pretty decent voice! At least better than mine 😂
Dirty Dancing has the best soundtrack hands down!
I honestly haven't explored many movie/show soundtracks- so I'll go with the soundtrack of my favorite musical movie: Across The Universe ❤️
Office Space! Nobody ever mentions it but there are so many bops in that movie! Also Grind (skater movie), it has a ton of great older alternative stuff.
Grease, Xanadu, and Pirates of Penzance. The best of the best.

Inception, "The good, the bad and the ugly" and  Armageddon ones are a couple of my favourites
Underworld. The underworld Sountrack is KILLER. As is Queen of the Damned.  AMAZING soundtracks.
The soundtrack for Breaking Bad
The Fright Night soundtrack is really solid.
Umbrella Academy!   But I'm a real sucker for the cinematography and plot driven aspects of the music in that show.
omg yes. moana is superior.
classic!!! i watched mulan not to long ago for nostalgia purposes and i was so moved by the soundtrack.
i love that movie, but i don’t remember the soundtrack too well - i’m going to have to look it up!
The Heat is so funny!! I need to rewatch that, for sure.
Oohh I need to give this a listen. Great book and good film!
i second!
it actually was pretty fantastic. I wasnt sure if I was going to like the movie but omg that soundtrack was so good
Such a good movie with good songs.
Yes! Just watched that again today :) The cast is full of great voices.
oh mannnnn i completely forgot about Your Name. after i watched that i tried playing some of the songs on the piano. sooo beautiful.
I second Harry Potter! Especially Prisoner of Azkaban.
Oh, yes. I agree.
OMG YES YES YES YES YES! That soundtrack is absolutely AMAZING!  I still play it all the time!
Yesssssss
It’s got a great soundtrack! So does Tarzan! Phil Collins made a masterpiece there
It has a lot of fun beats LOL
It’s so great, isn’t it!?
You should look up the green light clips on YouTube. They were trying to get the funds for the movie. If they got the green light, the movie would go on.  They are great!

It still holds up!!
Absolutely Moana! But. I also really love bicentennial man...... One to laugh. One to cry. Both amazing!!
Oh, will do! Sounds interesting.
absolutely agree! They got such a good strong cast of artists for that soundtrack, its insane
Oh my gosh, yes. Absolutely yes.
I had just got my driver’s license when it came out and I wore that CD out riding around with my friends! lol
And for the pity party times in our lives the notebook
I haven't ever actually watched the notebook lmao!
Wait for the much needed pity party. Have all the sugar and carbs plus two boxes of aloe tissues. Then cry your eyes out. Very therapeutic. The movie is very well made.
I think I watched it in (whatever year it came out) so I was kinda young at the time (born in 1988). Haven't watched it as an adult, I don't really remember it that much.

You are extra sweet sending them tonight too. I will definitely be keeping an eye out for them!
Woohoo! :) I could basically live off these things, Lol! And thank you friend! ❤️
Of course! She said you touched her on an emotional level as she is very close with her nana and couldn’t imagine not seeing her.   GF lives in Australia where they are way better off than we are so she has not experienced the isolation and lockdowns like we have here
Wait is it your birthday!!??
It’s this week! :)

Hey there friends! Y’all like the cheesy title? I couldn’t help myself, lol! ;) Sooo, my birthday is coming up this week, and of course I want to celebrate with y’all! Woohoo! This is open worldwide, be active outside contests/ giveaways, be kind, yadda yadda. Have something worth $15 (USD) or less on your list.  For those who may not know, I am super into crafty things, and I’m all about spreading the love and positivity. So, I’m going to be incorporating those things into this contest!   **To be entered, please choose at least one of the following to leave in a top level comment:**  - **Option 1**- *Make something positive, and post a picture of it!* A doodle, a physical or digital drawing, an uplifting quote in bubble letters or calligraphy, a happy coloring sheet, an encouraging handmade card for a friend, a happy colored cake or crafty piece, whatever! *As long as it’s something you make, and it’s something with positive vibes, it counts.* (Please make sure it’s something you’ve made recently, preferably no earlier than 1/12/21.) *Please have your username and the date in the picture for verification.*  - **Option 2**- *Tag a friend or three and lift them up!* Now, I *don’t* mean tagging someone and saying “you’re cool!” Oh, no, no. *I mean tag someone and PUMP THEM UP!* ;) Brighten their day! Remind them how talented they are in their hobby, what a good friend they are, what an epic parent they are, how they’ve got that upcoming interview in the bag, how kind they are, etc. Remind them that they are worthy and loved and wonderful! Stuff like that! Try to make their day, and remind them of how truly awesome they are. *Just make sure it’s genuine.*  - **Option 3**- *Write something uplifting about yourself!* Again, I *don’t* mean “I’m good at sports.” *I mean PUMP YOURSELF UP!* Because you are awesome and deserve praise! (Even, and most especially, from yourself.) Remind yourself that you are talented and worthy and loved! Congratulate yourself on a recent accomplishment, pat yourself on the back for checking things off that to-do list, be proud of yourself for overcoming those mental obstacles today, be proud of the goals you’ve met, etc. Remind yourself just how frickin epic you are! Stuff like that. Again, just make sure it’s genuine.  Feel free to do more than one these if you so wish. (Or combine them. For example, draw/ color a positive message for a friend or for yourself.) But at least one of the options must be submitted in a top level comment to be entered. Also, feel free to look through and reply to others too!   [Here are my answers!](https://imgur.com/a/7cLxcuf)   I am so excited to see this post filled up with positivity, love, and creativity! I can’t wait to see what everyone posts. And I hope y’all like this too! :) This should close the day after, so on Saturday 1/23/21.  Annnnddd GO!
Happy early Birthday!!   Option 2:   u/stopitlaura I have to say you are an amazing artist you make such amazing things and gift them to to many. I have been blessed by winning one of your contest and you sent me the coolest Bob’s burger themed ornaments that rocked my Christmas tree this past year! I can’t thank you enough please don’t ever stop doing what you do because you love it and because it’s such an amazing thing about you 💜
Thanks for this wonderful contest and I hope you have an amazing birthday!!  /u/late_to_join_reddit I know you’ve been having a rough go of it but I want you to know how utterly Loved and appreciated you are by this community!! You bring so much positivity and light and my experience here would not be the same without you! I hope you feel better soon so we can be giggling and talking about everything!! Take care of yourself. XOXOX
2- u/hauntedcoffeecup I wanted to tag you and pump you up!! You're one of the kindest people I've ever interacted with online! Your contests are super fun and you're always very thoughtful with your responses to people. I'm so glad that you're a part of this sub, don't ever leave!!
2-  u/HauntedCoffeeCup \- I think you're an incredible person for doing the things that you do. We've shared a few conversations in the dailys/nightlys over the past months, and I am just in awe of you... of your generosity, your kindness, your care for another human being... and then you come here and continue to be kind, and caring, and generous. I think you're an incredible person on the inside, and while I don't know what you look like, I'm 100% certain that your beautiful soul radiates on the outside as well!  u/ssmith71608 \- You have the most beautiful heart I've ever seen. From the moment I met you, you've welcomed me and shown me genuine kindness, care, and selflessness. I am honored to call you my best friend, and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for us! Please know that if you ever need anything, whether it's someone to talk to or a couch to stay on, I will be here. 💛  u/tmrajgray \- I think that you have such a generous, kind, and beautiful heart! You are adored by so many here, and I'm certain that you are loved by many IRL too! I'll bet you radiate positivity and kindness wherever you go! Thank you for sharing that kindness and beauty with our community daily!  Thank you for the contest, and I hope you have a wonderful birthday!
Option 3: You have been through so much and keep going. You are resilient, tough, strong, and never give up, even when you’ve been completely overwhelmed. You are kind and generous and give your all to those you love. You deserve happiness and all the best!!! You are a great person and I love you!!
u/Zeunicorn From dino friend to brownie wife, our friendship has blossomed more than I ever imagined it would. It started with a simple question of "what's your favorite dinosaur?" and continued to strengthen to the point where we now talk every day. From movie commentary to pictures of our food/day in general to "pretend" displays of possessiveness, you bring so much joy to my life. I wake up knowing I'll have messages from you to look forward to and eagerly anticipate the weekends so that we're able to talk more. I am so grateful that I am able to call you a friend and hope that we one day get a chance to meet in real life to further continue our journey of friendship. 💙  To me: You're friggen awesome, so stop telling yourself anything contrary to this fact. You need to stop stressing out about things that ultimately don't matter because it's wasted energy that could go towards the things you love to do. You're a positive influence for others and affect the lives of others in a way you shouldn't downplay! You are capable of so much and have the potential to get yourself wherever you want to be. You're smart, resilient, loyal, funny, and so much more!
Option 3 - I’m very, very strong. I’m a two time cancer survivor, I’ve endured abuse and homelessness and I’m still here, trying to be the best version of myself, trying to make the world a better place in my own small way. I’m still kind and loving and here, despite wanting to give up dozens of times.   Happy birthday week! I hope it’s fantastic! ❤️
First off, happy early birthday!!! Second, thank you for holding this contest. This is very generous of you to do something like this on your birthday week.   Option 3: You have sacrificed so much, been taken advantage of by so many who were close to you, and yet you have kept your head clear and your heart open. You manage to be productive every day, and you push yourself closer and closer to the life you want. You deserve everything that you've planned for, and I love you as much as humility will allow me to.
Happy birthday    Option 3 : It took you a lot from "I don't wanna live" to "Look in the mirror and find god" and that's not just one days work, the scars on your body are a story, the giving up is a move, the trying again is your spirit, you are rock solid and soft, something that cannot be put into words, you've been there for people, all the random ILYs are not without effort, just be, nothing more, nothing less 💖   Thank you for this, I've always thought of myself with someone who has overconfidence, but writing this down made me feel I've not really given myself that talk and love this way!   Nice meeting you 💖
Happy birthday 🎉 I'm choosing option one, I did this painting two days ago and I'm really really proud of it [painting](https://photos.app.goo.gl/4FmxPw8vWNawtuob8). I'm also super proud of myself for getting one of the start of many cannabis education certificates yesterday just the start of a long journey but im excited!!!
Happy birthday love, hope you have a great year ahead. You are one if the loveliest human beings i ever came across, do not change for anything. Lots if love and bear hugs
u/huntfishcamp you are an amazing teacher, you really care for your students. Wish I had a teacher like you when I was in school. You are a truly amazing friend, we share witchcraft and being slytherin. You are kind enough to gift me just cuz you had an extra book. You have no idea what that truly means to me. Your kinder then most of the people I know. I can't wait to get to know you more!! You will conquer what ever life throws your way!!
Happy early birthday :) I’ll be choosing option 3. I really need to get into the habit of uplifting myself more often. I think i am such a good friend, I’ll be there for you and listen to you. Also, i like how i look. I think i have a pretty face. I think im funny and im awesome when you get to know me. :)
Happy Birthday!!! Let's do this :D  u/Lucy_Leigh225 I've said it a million times, but I'll say it again. You are amazing. If I'm wrong and there is a god, then he knew what he was doing when he put you on this earth. And I think he probably spent a little more time on you. You have been the most amazing friend. You're so strong; you've overcome so much and you've done it. You're a fancy lawyer lady now! I love hearing your excited stories about work :) You're so smart and talented, and I'm so happy that you're in a position for those qualities to be recognized and rewarded in your professional life. With your strength and determination, you can literally do anything. The sky's the limit <3  u/hungupon, I truly treasure your friendship. I think that you're an amazing person and you make my day when you take the time to say hello to me every morning. That's special. I treasure your warmth and encouragement. I also love that we have a shared running goal. We're going to do it! I really hope that we can meet up one day and run a marathon together. That would just be so incredibly epic. I'll work hard so that I can keep up with you :D Just bring some of those cookies! I can't wait to read your novel; I just know that it's amazing! Oh, man. I could gush about your awesomeness all day. You are just a fantastic person and I'm so glad I met you.  u/overthinkee1234 you rock! I love our book conversations and I'm blown away by your kindness and generosity. Your excitement is infectious and I always get excited when I see a chat notification from you. And I can't wait until you finish Benedict's book to start on Collin's. We'll have so much to talk about! We'll also get to talk about the Aurora Rose Reynolds book that you're sending me just because you want me to read it, which blows me away and makes me smile and tear up at the same time. You're such an amazing, special person and I'm so glad that you're my friend.
Option 3 - Dear me, I’m proud of you for trying new things recently. You’ve always been stubborn and easily discouraged when it came to trying new things. Because of this, you are a 30something with almost no hobbies. Deep down you know things take practice and mistakes happen, and you’re finally starting to accept this. If this last year has taught you anything, it’s that you can’t rely on others to provide you a good time because not everyone can be around anymore. Keep trying these new things. Your failures are just happy accidents and precious learning experiences! You are your own worst critic and hopefully we can get some positive reviews on you soon! 🥰  Happy early birthday to you! 🥳🎉 Hope you have an amazing day!
Hotelsarah1234, you shouldn't feel so bad. You lost 20 lbs since mid October. You've GOT to pull yourself out of this downward spiral because you're worth it. People need you. You're someone who has their shit together and you've made great progress.
Woooo happy early birthday! I've chosen option 1:finishing up the 200 origami cranes to turn into a mobile for my wedding reception (I had the ceremony in July last year bit had to postpone the reception) So last weekend finished the last 60 cranes ready to start putting together [pic](http://imgur.com/a/zKk79t7)
I started a spiritual journey last year and I have been following it daily.  I have learned that I am generous, kind, smart and loving.  I'm a generous person, a kind friend, smart coworker, and loving girlfriend. I do my best everyday and at the end of the day, I am happy and feel loved. :)
Happy early birthday! Thanks for the contest!!  **Option 1:** I do watercolors. I really like the quote "Dive into life," and that is part of my life goals for 2021. I want to change my attitude to one that is willing and eager to dive into life and meet what comes with a positive attitude when it does. So, this is my newest painting this week!    [My pretty painting!](https://imgur.com/8Kn5n7l)
Happy Birthday, my friend!  I hope you have an awesome birthday celebration, and make sure to treat yourself well!  ;)  Option 3: you're putting yourself through school while working, and you worked your butt off to buy your first home in a very high cost of living area.  You proved your dad wrong, because that never gets old, and you will be able to succeed, in spite of your family.  You have wonderful friends and a very supportive boyfriend, who will stick by your side because they love and value you.  Legit, I feel really uncomfortable boosting myself up because it sounds like arrogant bragging.  >>  I hope I didn't sound too obnoxious.
Hello! I am choosing option three (sorry on mobile)  You are doing a great job, I know that you have felt like a complete failure over the last couple years, but look how far you have come. You quit that toxic job, you made your marriage a priority, you have actively worked on being the best mom. Just in 2020 alone you bought a house, got a puppy, brought a new human into the world and got a new job. I know it can be hard to remind yourself of these things when you are dealing with the postpartum depression, but you are even rocking that, getting actual help this time! You are kicking ass at your new job, so much so that in just a month in a half you got them back to compliant, you work from home full time with two kids, I cant believe you ever doubted yourself. Just when you thought you were forgetting who you are, your husband and you go bowling and you remember that you aren’t just a mom, wife and employee, you are a badass who deserves to laugh and have fun. I am so proud of the person you are and the person you are choosing to become. You did this. You are a real life superwoman.   Also I was not prepared for how emotional I would feel writing that
Thanks for the contest! I'm going to go with option 3 because I need it the most right now. It's been a hard weekend dealing with some persistent head pain, but I keep trying to remind myself that I am strong. Not just strong, Herculean strong! I am so strong and resilient that I will overcome this — and I'll be even stronger once I do. Nothing can stop me!!
u/Roisecakeness is an amazing friend
Option 2. u/pjpotter14 I am so grateful to have crossed digital paths with you. You are obscenely articulate, so warm, thoughtful, authentic, and sweet. I am the worlds worst when it comes to accepting compliments, but you make me believe them and that’s no small feat. You made me feel inspired, but also special when you tagged me here. And it’s funny how when I need a lift the most, someone from this sub intervenes and gives me exactly that. Thank you for being in tune with whatever it is that led you to do that.    u/megaxxworldxx You are such a force of goodness here. Always sprinkling some magic wherever you go. Your contests make me smile, your interactions with others make me feel happy. I hope you have the best birthday of your life thus far. Happiest birthday to youuuuuu!
Dear Monkey, (this is pumping myself up lol)  GIRL. LOOK AT YOU. You thought March 2020 was the end. You were ready. You were over and LOOK HOW FAR YOU HAVE COME. While you are still looking for the right psych person you have an AMAZING therapist that has been by your side throughout this ordeal. She even helps you out when money is tight due to Covid. You grew a garden. You grew fresh okra (and fried and ate it as soon as you picked it), sunflowers (one grew to be 8ft tall), kale, and zinnias! You started new meds in October that CHANGE YOUR LIFE. Really. It's a struggle some days, and it will be for a while, but you aren't planning ways out anymore. You are being honest with friends, and you even called off work this past week because you felt awful and only felt slightly guilty about it!  I am so proud of you. I am proud of everything you've done this past year. Like using both of your stimulus checks to pay off bills instead of spending frivolous. You raised your credit score 150 points!  I love you, Monkey. You're doing great. When you don't feel that way remember to snuggle your cats. Love you!
Option 3- Hey friend. I see you trying to be a functional human today even with all of the setbacks you're having to deal with. I just want you to know I am so proud of you. Life will get better and I know until it does that you'll continue to strive to make each day a beautiful day. 💚  Love you so much!
I drew a cat for you  [https://imgur.com/FSnJKiO](https://imgur.com/FSnJKiO)   I hope your birthday is fun and all your crafts turn out gorgeous!
For option one... This is kind of a silly one, but with me and Bunny both stuck in bed today, we decided to draw [thank-you postcards](https://i.imgur.com/ghgbtwn.jpg) to send to people who have sent us gifts and who have shared their addresses... we actually had a lot of fun and related them to the person or to the gift where we could. I wonder if you can identify anyone!  Tee hee.    For option 2... u/be_braver, you are amazing. Your journey is important and should be celebrated with the same, or even more, gusto than families growing biologically. I know that you are going to be an amazing mom, and that your child is going to be amazing for having been raised but such a strong leader, dedicated teacher, and loving parent. You also are super good at stabbing wool into corgis and you have a nice ass.
Option 3  I’m really compassionate. When I see someone close to me cry, I often tear up as well. My heart has been breaking lately, because my boyfriend has been going through a lot of crap lately. I’m glad that I can be there for him.
This weekend I did [this](https://imgur.com/a/b991A61) watercolor. I’m new to painting but I’m pretty proud of it. The forest/nature is my biggest positive vibe. I want to add a quote to it but I’m scared I’ll mess it up since I’m not good at lettering.   Happy Birthday!!
Option 1:  I saw this contest and went to work making something happy and cuddly to bring smiles...otherwise known as [this super happy bubbly whale ](https://imgur.com/a/E63unuH) .. I worked on her all yesterday and last night and got up at 5am to finish her this morning before work lol. She was so fun to work on, and truly made me smile when she was all done. She’s so cute!! I’m going to find a child locally to gift her to, to make them smile and keep it going.   Option 2: I want to tag u/jkpenrod ... you my friend are an incredibly rare gem. I’m super grateful to count you as a Reddit friend. Thank you so much for checking on us occasionally. Thank you for thinking of us on holidays. For spoiling the crud out of not just me, but also my minis. You are so appreciated. You do so much for so many people in this sub, and I don’t think you get thanked or noticed or appreciated anywhere near as much as you should. You bring joy and smiles and genuine happiness to all of the lives you touch, and you mean a lot, to a lot of folks here. I hope you know that. You’re a kind soul and possess a big heart, with a genuine happiness to you. Please don’t ever stop being you. ❤️  Thank you for this sweet contest it’s so filled with happiness and positivity and I’ve really enjoyed flipping through the comments - thank you for bringing some fun and joy! HAPPIEST OF BIRTHDAYS!  Tagging u/koalabyproxy u/redherring19702 u/bt112506 to come join the fun.
I swallowed my can’t-do-its this week and started AN ENTIRE-ASS BLANKET in a BRAND-NEW CROCHET STITCH. I’ve never done anything bigger than a baby blanket before, and this is my first corner-to-corner.....  IN WHICH THE ORIGINAL PATTERN WAS FUCKED AND I FIGURED OUT HOW TO FIX IT, GO ME!!!!
u/pembrokelove I wrote you a little note in the link in the post! You are awesome, don’t ever forget it! :)
Thank you! :)   I love it! stopitlaura is definitely very talented! (As are you, friend!)
Ok we’re just having me crying today, I see how it is 😭😭😭 Thank you for your kind words lovely.
😭😭😭 I freaking love you so much!! 😭😭😭 thank you so much for this!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love this!!
u/megaxxworldxx I was so focused on trying to pump up a friend that I almost forgot to wish you a happy birthday! I hope you'll forgive me for this terrible oversight!   HAPPY BIRTHDAY FRIEND!!🎊🎉🥳🎉🎂✨🎀🎈
Take notes folks. ^ Thats how to make a HauntedCoffeeCup cry.   u/pjpotter14, That was so incredibly thoughtful. I appreciate the time you spent articulating such beautiful things. The gift of someone’s time, and acknowledgment is literally the best feeling on earth. Yes, it’s even better than that naked activity thing everyone’s so obsessed with. Anyway, I appreciate you. Thank you for all of that. 🥰
Naw thank you my friend 💕 you are amazing too! I appreciate you so much!
I love this!! I totally agree with everything you’ve said! They are all so wonderful! And you are too! :)
I love this!! You are so wonderful!! :)
Girl you’re gonna make me cry 🥺🥺 I love how you put “pretend” in quotes like I don’t know what you mean 👀 I’m not gonna lie, I don’t read your goodnight messages until the morning (even if I’m still awake when I receive them), just so I can start my day with a smile 😊 I also look forward to the weekends so much so we can talk more (and I’m already sad you have to work Saturday). Girl I love you and I can’t wait until we can (maybe) meet in person 💜
This is so beautiful!! I am so glad you guys have that friendship, and I definitely agree that you are friggin epic! ❤️ Love this!
Thank you friend! It sounds like you have done some pretty dang great things! You are so amazing! ❤️
Thank you friend! And of course! Thank you for entering! :)  You are awesome!! I’m rooting for you!
Thank you for the birthday wishes!   You are so amazing and strong and awesome!! And you are definitely loved! I am so glad I was able to kinds provide a little space like this to write these things down, and I’m so glad it that it was useful. You deserve all the love! :) Thanks for entering! And it’s nice to meet you too!
Ohh wow! I love it!! Such bright colors, and I love whatever technique you used to paint it, like the brush strokes look so cool! You are so talented! And I’m so happy for you for getting the your first certificate! You are awesome!!
How you did that?  It looks like a 3D clay work!
Aww, thank you so much friend!! You are entirely too kind! ❤️ Hugs and love back! You are wonderful! :)
Love this! Wonderfully written, and so true! You are both so fantastic! ❤️
Oh, my friend, I can't tell you how much this means to me 💖 Thank you so much. You just made my day ✨
Thank you for the birthday wishes! :)  You are totally awesome! Proud of you!
Water bro, for real, you’re going to make me cry. Which is hard to do!! I really am such a nerd when it comes to work. Love ya! 🧡
Aw thank you so much for this tag! I absolutely love our morning check-ins. Feels like we're really neighbors and we're chatting over the fence before we go about our day. That would be so amazing to race together (though perhaps a half... LOL). So glad to have met you too and love learning more about you every day :D <3
Aaa thank you so very much lobe this made my day ♥️
This is so wonderful!! I love it! And don’t forget how absolutely amazing and awesome you are too friend! Awesome post! ❤️
Thank you for the birthday wishes!   Sounds like you are doing awesome things! Proud of you!
Dude, I'm so proud of you. 20 lbs within the last 3 or so month is freaking fabulous. You're freaking fabulous. I was just browsing people's entry, but like I saw this and just felt like you needed a standing ovation because losing weight can be so ridiculously difficult and you sound like you've worked hard for those results. Whatever downward spiral you've fallen into, wellllll, I hope with your new gains, you can smack it silly and climb out of it. If you need any help, though, just let me or any of the other people (and I'm sure there's plenty) who care about you know. I've got rope and if it's not enough, I'm sure I can borrow some rope to make it long enough.   Great job and "just keep swimming!"
Oh man, that’s a lot down! That’s epic! Seriously, I am so proud of you and your hard work, and I am rooting for you! I also wanted to say, it’s okay to not be okay sometimes. Take a little time to yourself if you need it. No matter WHAT, you are worthy, you are loved, you are talented, and you are awesome! All the love ❤️
Wowza!! That is so epic!! That is just, so insanely cool, lol. I love it!
I love this! That is so awesome, and I 100% agree! You are wonderful!! ❤️
Ohhhh boy!! That is just gorgeous!! Seriously, beautiful work. You are definitely talented friend! I love the quote and I love the goal. That’s an awesome goal, and I’ve been working on similar things. You got this! I know 2021 is going to be your year! :) Thanks for the birthday wishes, and thanks for entering! Don’t forget that you are awesome!
Beautiful!!!!
This is beautiful! I love the blue tones you used, so pretty.
Thanks so much for the birthday wishes! :)  Sounds like you are kicking butt and taking names friend! Go you! It does not sound overly bragging or obnoxious at ALL! I am proud of you, and I think it’s a good thing to talk about and be proud of your accomplishments sometimes too! You are awesome!

\*removed mentions of my Birthday for re-approval\*       I had been a steady member roughly a year ago! I've since dropped off the face of the Earth due to some real-life issues. Since we have so many new people, I've decided to reintroduce myself.  \*in my best Kenobi voice\* Hello there. My name is Ryki (pronounced like "Ricky"). I'm 25 years old. I am a CIS Female. I'm Sapiosexual and Bisexual. I'm an Atheist. I'm from Northwestern Wisconsin.  I love gaming, movies, music, graphic design, cosplay, comic cons, swimming, photography, modeling, reading, writing, collecting Pokémon trading cards, American Football, among other things.  My specific interests include, but are not limited to: Jurassic Park, Star Wars, Aliens, Predator, Godzilla, Terminator, The Lord of the Rings, The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Dungeons & Dragons, Pokémon, The Elder Scrolls, Marvel, Power Rangers, and Harry Potter.  Some random facts about myself:  1. I am an Alternative woman. I really love Gothic-esque aesthetics. 2. Pitch Black is my favorite color, followed closely by Blood Red, Neon Green, and Dark Purple. 3. I'm a PC Gamer (thanks to my SO who converted me) and I have built my own Gaming PC! 4. My favorite dinosaur is Deinonychus! 5. My favorite Season is Summer! 6. My favorite genres of music are Rock and Metal. 7. My favorite genres of movies are Horror, Sci-Fi, Action, and Comedy. 8. I believe in the legalization of Marijuana on a Federal level. 9. My natural hair is Brown. 10. I'm a Southpaw (left-handed). 11. My HP house is Slytherin and my Patronus is a Velociraptor!  If you have any questions for me, feel free to shoot! I look forward to participating in RAOA once again and gifting all of you wonderful people. *All* (eventually).
Hi! Welcome back to the sub!! What is your favorite dessert??
Hello fellow Slytherin! 🐍 Lovely to meet you. 🙂
I'm wanting to be your friend so badly 😂 You sound super cool!
Welcome back!   You sound like Alternative version of me haha, lots of the same interests. Carry on!

Welcome back
Hello! Welcome to RAOA! 👋 I’m Lily, it’s so nice to meet you! I hope that we can be friends! Being a newbie can be pretty tricky, so if you need help with anything - or just want to chat - feel free to PM me and I will assist you to the best of my ability! ✨💛
Hiii and welcome back! I’m newer here so I don’t think we’ve interacted before but you sound super interesting! When I was reading your intro I misread CIS as CSI and was very confused for a moment because I started thinking police procedural stuff (weird way to phrase policewoman but okay), and then the sharp turn into sexuality threw me off. Until I realized I’m just a doofus 😆 Ignoring my awkwardness, what kind of bands do you listen to??
Hi! I’ve been in this group a year or 3, but I’m awful at names. Welcome back! I need to ask....what on Earth is a sapiosexual? I thought I knew most of the things, this is a new one on me.
What are some of your favorite games? I see elder scrolls (loooovvee) and D&D ( also looooovveee)  lol   what class do you usually play?  My husband is a slytherin though I am 100% ravenclaw! lol   Also, yes yes yes to like all your points up above! Horror is the best, Love the gothic aesthetic, love the color choices, and I am a HUGE rock and metal fan! Also, a solid gamer girl here!   What are your favorite bands? I love In this Moment, Disturbed, Mushroomhead, Five finger death punch, Chimera  to name a few  &#x200B;  Oh!! And hello and welcome!!
My favorite dessert is honestly Strawberries and Angel Food cake. I find it to be soooo good!
Lovely to meet you as well! :D
Awww, thank you! That makes me feel good. I always enjoy making new friends, so, I mean... :)
Thank you for the welcome! I'm glad to hear of more people with similar interests. That always pleases me!
Hello there. My favorite Holiday is Halloween. I'm a sucker for dressing up and not being judged for one day of my life for how I dress! Haha! The thing I enjoy most about nature is the animals and creatures. They're an amazing part of our world and I cherish their presence. I'm sad that so many are dying out and becoming extinct! One day I hope to become apart of the preservation of such amazing species!  You sound like a really great person! Keep doing what you're doing!  And thank you so much for the warm welcome! It means a lot!
Actually, I haven't started them fully yet! I'm having a hard time trying to care about another group of people!
Thank you for the welcome! I really do appreciate that! Life's been doing a lot better these days, thank you. <3
No worries! I'm attracted to intelligence in order words. :)
It is delicious and so underrated!!!
Yay! Lol We have a lot in common. Im 22 and my name is Renee. I love gaming, swimming, reading, writing, binge watching stuff, watching YouTube gamers and tattoos/piercings/dyed hair. I'm alt as well, my style mostly swings between punk and goth but sometimes also pastel goth. I also believe in the legalization of marijuana & my hair is also naturally brown.
I get that, especially as we’re experienced in what can happen to characters we’ve got attached to (😭) hope you’re enjoying the community :)
Oh, I definitely agree with that!
That's awesome! YOU sound awesome! I'm glad to see other people with similar interests!
Thank you 😊❤️

A Horse necklace, A Monty Python mug A sweary colouring book   Thankyou so much.

Sorry you’ve not been well! I really hope you’re feeling better 💜
I hope you feel better soon!!
Thanks for your good wishes, I had the best night's sleep I've had in weeks, and this morning I feel the best I've felt in a long, long time.   Getting the children fed and ready for their Online lessons, then I'm going to get my contests sent and photos taken.

Hello! I’m very new to Reddit and I joined specifically to join this group. My name is Michele and I’m a 45 year old mom of 2. My daughter is 25 and she is in this group and told me how great you all are and suggested I join, and my son is 14.   My favorite thing to do is read, I love books. I also love true crime and all things creepy and anything to do with horror. I love horror movies and documentaries about serial killers. I always prefer the evil queens to the Disney Princesses. My favorite movie is The Wizard of Oz and I’ve been obsessed with the Wicked Witch of the West since I was a kid. My favorite tv shows are The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones and Friends and I love 80’s rock, my favorite band is still Metallica. I love tattoos, I have 14 of them and would love to have many more.   I love animals, I have 2 dogs and 1 cat. I have a female boxer named Cersei and a male shih tzu named Opie. My cat is a female calico named Maggie and she’s 10 years old, I used to have her brother but he passed away in September. They were from the same litter so he was 10 years old too and he was an orange tabby named Chevy but he got really sick. I still miss him.   That’s all I can think of right now but you’re welcome to AMA.

Welcome
Welcome! What’s your favorite horror movie?
Welcome! Have you watched any of Walking Dead: World Beyond?
Welcome!!! What’s your favorite food?
Hello, which is your favorite disney movie? Do you watch the remakes?
Welcome, Michele! Hope you'll enjoy your time on this sub. Who's your favorite Disney villain? Mine is Maleficent for sure.
Hey there! What's your favorite flower?
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁 I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your precious baby sending hugs to you and your family.   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help.

Whoohoo Metallica!   Welcome :)
Welcome! You seem to have a lot of the same interests as my stepmother (who I think is totally awesome btw!!) Hope you have an amazing day 😁
Metallica are great, and so was S&M. Have you heard of the Finnish group Apocalyptica? They did an album called "Plays Metallica by Four Chellos". Here is "One" (https://youtu.be/RzJPFRCaWVY) to show you what they are like.
Thank you so much
I’m a huge fan of the horror movies from the 70’s so I love the original Halloween because Michael Myers is so creepy, he has that slow steady walk but he still manages to get there first. And I love the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre because that came from a true story and every time they remade it, it just got worse lol
I haven’t, they’re all on my DVR but I haven’t watched them. Have you?
I could be cliche and say tacos and pizza but my favorite food changes depending on my mood. Today I’m going to say cheeseburgers cooked on the grill because I want one really bad lol
I have 2 favorite Disney movies. My favorite was Sleeping Beauty for the longest time because Maleficent is my favorite character but now I also love Frozen. I love that Disney finally gave us a Queen like Elsa that stood up for herself and didn’t need a man to save her. I always watch the remakes i very rarely like them. What is your favorite?
That’s an easy one, sunflowers. I actually have a tattoo of 3 sunflowers that represent myself and my 2 children, to me sunflowers make me think of light and joy and happiness and they make me smile.
Happy New Year to you too friend and thank you so much! Although I really love Halloween I must say that my favorite holiday is Christmas. For my family Christmas starts the beginning of December and lasts 25 days so there is so much more to enjoy; movies and music, baking, decorating and lights, church services and programs, family get togethers....the list is endless. Not this year of course but hopefully next year things will be better. I bet you get so much enjoyment working with special needs children, that just warms my heart. I guess my favorite thing about nature is the animals. I’m not very outdoorsy, I don’t like bugs and I don’t like to get dirty but my daughter is a zookeeper and she teaches me a lot about different animals.
🤘🏻🤘🏻 Thank you!
Wow, thank you so much! I hope you have an awesome day too! ♥️
It's not bad in that it's setting things up for the movie.
I like Snow White and Beauty and the Beast, because of their human vs not so human characters, and yeah, we needed that revolution of a woman wanting the sword, not the savior!  I do watch remakes, but just for the nostalgia really, they aren't as good  Oh btw the darker side of these stories is rather fun and horrific
I love growing sunflowers. My favorite is roses. I'm allergic to literally everything that grows but I grow roses (and suffer for it!) anyhow. They make me smile!!  Getting a sunflower well over 7 ft tall is amazing!!
How exciting how did she get into that job? Yes I absolutely love working with children been doing it for 20 years and it just brings joy to see the children making progress and I get to act like a little kid all day as well lol
I’ll have to watch them
I love roses but I don’t really have a green thumb and can’t get them to grow, I have a trellis and have tried to grow climbing roses numerous times with no luck. I always grow sunflowers and I get so excited when they get taller than the garage!!
I have black thumbs. I tossed them into the ground, forget to water them, toss rose food maybe once every couple of years and the only reason they are pruned by the yard guys. :)  Two years ago I just sprinkled a variety of sunflower seeds in a line and wow!!! 💕

**UPDATE: Winner has already been chosen. Thank you for the guesses!**   Frank is getting his dental done- that means it’s gonna cost me a lot. So bye bye stimulus check.   Any guesses on what the cost will be? Closest guess to the cost I will get you something off of your amazon wish list!  **Please link your wishlist with your guess, I’m on mobile**   To help you gage the cost:  - he’s getting a basic dental (300) - pre surgical blood work - a mass removal and biopsy  - 3 front teeth removed (50 dollars a tooth) - anal gland expression   Those teeth better be made out of gold!!
Thanks for the contest and I hope your puppers is good as new when this is all over.  I’m guessing the total cost will be about $1620.  Wish List: [WList](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2W6CHFQSXY0M?ref_=wl_share)
I'm going to say $1200  I just paid $985 to remove my cat's teeth.  [edit for list](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/SPJDUP6U13YI?ref_=wl_share)
$785 Frank better thank you!   [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/YX5WLKEYR30J?ref_=wl_share)
I am going to guess $678.91  [https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3OANR28EWYLHF?ref\_=wl\_share](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3OANR28EWYLHF?ref_=wl_share)  Good luck to your doggo and your wallet!
$765  I know the pain, I took my cat to the emergency vet on another vets orders and he turned out to be absolutely fine. Still cost around $300   [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3DVLXAQU4XHUA?ref_=wl_share)
$805  Vet visits make my wallet cry, but we gotta do what we gotta do😭 [list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/JCD7I9FS85VN/?ref_=lol_ov_le)
I would estimate 800$ I used to work at a vet clinic and that was about the average cost! Thanks for taking care of those puppers teeth! Not a lot of people do!! [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2Y59YGF7YB3WC?ref_=wl_share)
I'd say $950 [wl](https://www.amazon.in/hz/wishlist/ls/2E43HD43UR4A0?ref_=wl_share)  Take care
$850 I currently work at a vet and this is how much it would be at ours.   [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1UP9FH2SB42FS?ref_=wl_share)
$945 is my guess. And I TOTALLY feel you. I gained around 7K in vet bills on Christmas Eve and Christmas 😥 Thankfully we have pet insurance which will help to cover some of it but it will still be thousands. I hope your pupper comes out alright and the biopsy is benign! Keep us posted! Also a photo of Frank would be much appreciated! 😍  Here is my [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1BVB8G71MFKBJ?ref_=wl_share)
I’m going to guess about $910   I hope Frank is okay ❤️   [WL](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2041JXB4IB40T?ref_=wl_share)
$928   [wl](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/36CJ9MEF5VGH2?ref_=wl_share)
$807.54 :(  [Wishlist](https://smile.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/OQ499Q1NOTN7)
oh Frank, I hope you feel better soon! I am estimating your vet bill to be $613 [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/11VYRYDS31ECE?ref_=wl_share)
$725. Thanks for reminding me that I need to schedule a dental for my doggo. He hasn’t had one in two years. >_> [(List.)](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/32GQZZ9I55276?ref_=wl_share)
Oh my gosh... poor little guy.  My guess is $1199.  Good-bye stimulus check indeed.  :(  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3J9XRM3FMLBIH

$1,003 easy.   &#x200B;  Coincidentally I just took my kitty to get a dental cleaning and 2 small teeth removed last Wednesday and maaaaan does he struggle against taking his meds. But he was really funny when we brought him home cause he was still loopy from anasthesia. I also used stimulus money for that lol.

What was wrong with him?!
I know. I spent 700 between to the two of them just getting vaccines updated and heartguard.  Thank goodness for this stimulus check.
My poor baby boy- I used to work at the same vet for 10 years. Wish I still had my 50% discount!
Omg what happened to your pet!
I’m so sorry :-(
I always ask for the liquid version of pain meds whenever my cat needs them. Cats are a lot harder to give meds to!
Oh god no I hope you’re wrong lmao

He’s 12lbs, I believe they’re sending out the specimen to the lab
They thought he might have a urinary blockage, which can be fatal. He's always kind of been weird about using the litter box, seeming like he doesn't want to even though I've tried tons of different litters and boxes for him. Turns out he just has a disorder where his lower urinary tract is a little smaller than usual so he's at higher risk for blockages but didn't have one that time.   Treatment for now is just mixing some extra water in his wet food, which is actually a 2 for one because it forces him to slow down instead of becoming a feline vacuum cleaner lol.   But yeah, good to actually know what was up with him but would rather have had the $60 normal vet visit to find out.   Oh and then once he did have his normal visit he had a bad reaction to the standard vaccines and puked like 6 times in a row and had to go back in. Poor baby. But he's all good now.
give us updates!! thinking about you!!
He ended up herniating some disks in his spine. So we had 2 ER visits (the first er vet was AWFUL) 2 overnight stays, Seeing a neurologist, an MRI & x-rays, blood work, anestesia, a ton of meds, and a few follow up visits. But honestly the money is nothing compared to how sad I was those few days. It was so heartbreaking to see him like that. But he is on the mend and the vet says he expects a full recovery without spinal surgery needed! :D
Oh dont be! Loss is always sad but he lived a very long and spoiled fantastic life! I am so happy to have had so much time with him 🥲 sorry you are dealing with the dental work stuff! So stressful! Clearly you are a fantastic pet parent!
We have a liquid oral rinse, and liquid antibiotics.   For the antibiotics he's learned that we cant give him the full dose if he doesn't lick it. He clamps his mouth shut, and we cant open it cause we'd have to press right where he's healing, so we started putting a dot on his lip, he'd lick it, we'd place another dot. well he stopped licking it, the stubborn asshole.
Oh yeah! Thanks for reminding me! Ill edit it
Thank you so much!
Whoops my bad!  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2F2N3D8PQQ84Q?ref_=wl_share
Whoops! Thanks :)
Urinary blockages are SO EXPENSIVE. Especially the chronic ones where they have to remove the penis bone and make them a vagina basically to pee out of lol
Aw thanks! I bought the vet tech Jimmy John’s for taking care of him. (I know him though. Made a lot of friends working there)
Did he jump off the bed or the couch?
Try the corner of his mouth and stick it through there! That’s what I did
Yeah it sounded like it was gonna be a mess to treat if he did end up having one.   I was kind of annoyed with the vet though. They took him in, and told me they'd call when the doctor had seen him and all that. Covid, so it's basically kitty carside to go, they come take the carrier and you wait in the car.   An hour or so passes and I was getting a little worried. Texting with my husband (who was at work, I have the flexibility to take time off or shift my hours thankfully) and we were talking about how much it might cost and what we would do and if he would make it out and how much pain it would cause him.   I started panicking a bit and asked him to come out and be with me. So he starts driving the 40ish minutes to get over there. When he gets here I still haven't heard from the vet. Sat for a bit with him, still nothing. After about 2 and a half hours of just worrying sick I finally called in and asked about him.   Apparently the vet saw him right away, determined it wasn't a blockage and he didn't need anything immediate, and went to treat more urgent patients. And I totally get all of that, *but why on earth didn't they tell me!*  I could have saved myself the worry, my husband the trip and missing work. I don't mind waiting around for hours because I know they have to triage but I really wish they would have given me a heads up that he wasn't sitting there in pain or needing serious medical work :(
Honestly we don't know. I was upstairs, and didn't hear anything, my husband just said Goose walked into the office, laid down and began to shake. My husband thought he was cold, and put a sweater on him. But after I came downstairs and checked his ears/nose/feet for coldness he didn't seem cold so we carried him outside in case he had to go potty, and he started walking strangely. At that point I knew something was very wrong and we took him to the nearest ER vet.
We tried that as well- he just wriggles his head (the rest of him is wrapped up in a towel). He's trully stubborn lol
Dogs are so good at hiding when they’re in pain. Same with cats
Yeah, I know it is a survival instinct. But sometimes I just want to be like TELL ME WHAT YOU NEEDDDDD
Haha same!

Go Bills ! And go sports! 😅 My favorite sport memory was probably joining my university’s quidditch team (and yes that totally counts as a sports memory)!  u/Lucy_Leigh225 Does the Batman play any sports other than destroying perfectly good buildings?   u/ShreddedKnees what sport do you think dinos would play?
Go Bills  Here's a good, true story and I will try to keep it short. My photojournalism class bought bleacher seats for opening day for the Red Sox. A classmate and I saw someone from class walking across the field and tried shouting, How did you get in? She pointed. We walked around and found a door by the visitors dugout leading to the field. Security saw our STUDENT IDs on lanyards and let us in. They thought we were press. Suffice it to say, I got some awesome photos of the Red Sox before some dinguses from class saw us, pointed us out, and climbed onto the field during the game only to be ejected by security. We left the press box and found our seats. Somewhere I have a photo of myself crouched down behind the local and national sports photographers in the press box. I was 20!   u/tmrajgray u/FictionEF  What say you?
Go Bill even though I’m a Sainted Seahawk. I hate when they play each other and I’m forced to choose.   My favorite sports memory was when we organized across several Silent Dinner / ASL Church / Deaf Student Union groups and all went to a game together in the notoriously LOUD Seahawk Stadium. We ended up with enough people to fill up the whole end zone section as well as the two adjacent pockets. You could see how deeply confused everyone was about the hugely animated and participating - but nearly completely silent - section at the end. Even the players were confused, except for the one we came to support. Any guess who?  Oooh.. do uz/vexedkitten94 and u/dalenakitty like sports?
I love love when my husband turned to me and said *"I never knew I could love someone I've never met so much"*    Context: After lots of trying and a miscarriage we finally have a viable pregnancy. No the timing couldn't be worse, but the love is real.
Go Bills! I used to hate all sports, then I did a 5-week exchange program to Kyoto, Japan. We had to go to a university baseball game as one of our program activities. I was not enthusiastic, but surprisingly I enjoyed the game and became a baseball fan that day. My favorite team is my Colorado Rockies, even though I've lived in Houston and supported the Astros for 14 years! The Rockies will always be my first love from when I lived in Denver.
Go Bills I’m not into sports but my mom was a cowboys fan and she ended up messing her ankle screaming at the tv at emmit smith to run to bring the cowboys closer to the Super Bowl. She loved her team. Only person I know that caused herself a sports injury watching a game.   /u/bratmomjad what about you any sport memories?
Go bills!!! My favourite moment was may 8th 2019. My team were in the semi finals of the champions league and were 1-0 down after the first game. We then went 1-0down in the second match after 5 mins. It wasn’t too bad we could still come back. The bang. 2-0 in the 35th. Meaning we needed 3 goals to go through to our first ever European final. We got to half time and things looked bad when my hero Lucas moura decided in the 55th minute to take things into his own hands. A goal!  Again another goal in the 59th. Things were looking up until we reached the 90th minute and it was 2-2. We wouldn’t go through because of the first leg. That was until god decided to work his magic and in the 96th minute of the match, inextra freaking time. moura completed his hat-trick and took us to the final! Yes we lost the final that year but as a fan it was an amazing thing to watch unfold
Going to my first Cubs cardinals game with my best friend! Never been to a live game before and can’t wait to go this year to a few!  I love love games!!
Go Bills  Tho I am a Saints fan and am now relatively sad...3 years in a row...heartbroken again  My fave sports memory is 2006 the reopening of the Superdome in N’awlins when the Saints beat the Falcons...that blocked punt by Steve Gleason (and the inspirational life he has had afterwards) will forever be etched in my memory.  For the rest of the playoffs I will root for the Bills tho. Josh Allen to Diggs all day!
Go bills! I’m not a big sports fan, but I always love getting together with family for SuperBowl and Stanley Cup parties...we always have so much food (usually themed Regional dishes for whoever our favourite teams are) and just enjoy being in each other’s company.
Go Bills!  I’m actually a Steelers fan but I’m rooting for the Bills to go all the way.  I was a cheerleader in high school and made All American. I got to go to Hawaii and performed at halftime of the NFL Pro Bowl. It was an incredible experience!   Thanks for the contest!
Go Bills   My favorite sports memory is when I was in high school I actually played football. I am only 4’11”! And a girl. The whole team was boys and I made varsity! It was honestly such a fun experience. I got lit up quite a few times but it was honestly so fun.
I love love. I had been having a really rough week at work and came home to an “at home date night” with my fiancé. He had taken our dinner table and chairs outside, lit candles, put flowers on the table, took the tv outside and put a movie on, and started a fire in our fire pit. Oh, and got our favorite meals to-go, because why not have your favorite date food in your pjs on your back porch? I for real love love.
I love love ♥️ this past November me and my lovely lady finally got [married](https://imgur.com/a/5Tdxbld). ♥️♥️♥️♥️  u/1-800-Cummies and u/vexedkitten94 and u/spacesoulboi what about y’all?
I love love 💜 My most loving memories are with my grandmother. She is such an amazing woman, and I am lucky to have her in my life ❤️
Whooo!!   Go Bills! So I read a book that involved rowing but was really about beating Nazis and I was curious about the sport and I joined the rowing team at my school and it was so so fun when we placed in my first competition 🧡  u/orcprincess32 spooorrtttssss  u/JosephineIsMyHero 🏈
I love love :) Im glad you had such a good weekend!   My favourite memory with my fiance is the when we were just friends and I was staying with him while I found my own place. I mentioned I wanted to make gingerbread because it was my winter tradition but he didnt have much in the way of baking supplies so its no big deal. He asked what I'd need and I named the barest essentials, thinking if I went to the supermarket on my day off I wouldnt want to clutter up his house. I came home from work that day and on the table was everything I could possibly need, plus every shape cookie cutter the supermarket had. He'd checked a recipe online and got EVERYTHING so I could make all the gingerbread I wanted.  So anyway, Im marrying him this year :D   /u/pm_ur_uterine_cake /u/andalitegirl and /u/brenhines get in here with your cute stories!
I love love one of my favorite recent memories with my boyfriend is when he surprised me with every color of tulips for my birthday! They're my favorite flower and they make our home that much brighter!
Go Bills   My favorite sport memory was when I finished my black belt test and obtained my black belt in Taekwondo.
I love love! My favorite lovey dovey memory is when me and my bf took professional pictures together for his senior pictures (yes we’ve been dating since high school, 8 years!!) it was so fun getting since nice pictures done of us at such a young age! You can really see how much we’ve grown!! I’m so happy you had an amazing weekend (but I’m still depressed about the bears) what about you /u/bobacupcake
I love love! I'll give you both: one of my favourite memories was when I took my husband to his very first baseball game!! The Brewers vs Cubs, in Miller Park. <3 TFTC.
I love love the memory of mine and my hubby first date dinner and a movie and on that date I know he was the one for me   u/huntfishcamo. u/DreyHI
Go Bills!   Favorite memory was when the Sabres were in the Stanley Cup playoffs in 2006 and we went to a restaurant to watch a game. We won in a shootout and  everyone cheered so loud the entire restaurant shook.
I love love! Also go Bills! My favorite sports memory was going with my husband to his first NFL game, and they actually won! It was such a high and seeing his childhood dream come true made my heart grow three sizes that day  u/Lucy_Leigh225 and u/daisiesandink come play!
Go Bills!   My favorite sports memory is when I played goalie on my middle school soccer team in 8th grade. We played our hearts out, and we won the state championship that year! It was such an amazing experience!  u/space_noodlers
Go Bills!  Congrats on the win!  My favorite memories have all been the World Cup. I lived in Berlin in 2006, and the whole thing was just a blast.
I love love! I just got married this last June:) it was a covid wedding so it was super small and super short, but it was perfect:) when did you get married?
I love love, this might sound a bit dull but me and hubby managed a film night with popcorn the other night and it was so nice to sit just him and me 💜   Thank you for the contest, congratulations on your wedding :)  Tagging u/pumpkinellie & u/mcelroy00
Go Bills  Okay so this is not anything on the big scale, but we had a soccer tournament in our school and every team picked out a little intro/hype song. And one team just went in and the Kickers anime intro starts playing. My friend and I were celebrating that so hard!     Tagging u/late_to_join_reddit and u/Johnwoods1023 to join in
Go bills! Not a very sporty person but my favorite memory that would be close would be getting to playing with the Mississippi State University (famous maroon) marching band during their half time show my senior year of high school in 2018. Was a very fun memory of mine!
I love love!  It pains me to say “Go Bills” but... maybe a Bills/Packers Super Bowl could be fun? 😂  My fave sports memory is probably watching the Packers win the Super Bowl back in ‘96 at a party at one of my dad’s friends’ house... I was just a kid, but the excitement, and the food, and the adrenalin was so cool.  Thanks for the contest :)
I love love   Last year was rough for everyone. I haven't seen my own family for over a year now. But on New Years Eve everything seemed okay for a special couple of minutes. My best friend and I had decided to stay up as long as we could to feel 2020 fold into 2021. Our living room was bathed in warm yellow string lights as fluffy, white snow fell outside our window. She sat near the window playing the ukelele, while I danced to it holding our kitten in my arms (the only good thing to come out of 2020).  It was a simple moment. But so infinitely warm.   Congratulations on your wedding!! I pray that your marriage is filled with such simple and warm moments that you can take refuge in when life gets complicated and cold.
Go Bills   My favorite sports memory was getting to tour a stadium with my family and see all of the behind the scenes and history stuff. When we went through the locker room, my son looked up and saw his name + his age on one of the players' cubbies, and now always cheers for that player 🏈
I love love!  This is kind of a two for one on your request. Sports and Love. My spouse and I met while working at the National Hockey Center. I worked for facilities and he worked for the team. We have been married over 15 years and still love Hockey!
Go Bills! My favorite sports memory is taking our son to a Bills game when he was a newborn. Slept through most of it, even when a drunken fan spilled beer on him. Thanks for the contest and congrats on getting your photos!
Go Bills! Hmm I did dance as a kid and one of my favourite memories from it was during our Saturday classes. On Saturdays there was a class for each discipline. Hip Hop fell in the middle just after lunch so if you didn't do Hip Hop you ended up having an extended/long lunch. One day my friend and I discovered that the second dance room wasn't used during this time so we decided to choreograph our own dance for fun. Another girl I'd never really spoken to joined us. It wasn't anything serious just a silly fun dance but damn did the time fly.
I’m so glad you had such a great weekend! Getting wedding pictures back is so much fun! I do love love, but I don’t have any favorite lovey memories. My husband never officially proposed and my wedding was a disaster. Not a lot of romance here.   So Go Bills! My favorite sports memory was when I was 7 or 8. My dad was in the military and we lived in South Korea at the time. We would always go to baseball games for the Doosan Bears, LG Twins, or Lotte Giants. It was alway just a fun time for our family. We would get all kinds of fun souvenirs like those plastic inflatable noisemakers you hit together. They would shoot confetti/tinsel over the crowd at the games and that way always my favorite part. So sparkly!  Thanks for the contest!
That’s great that you had an awesome weekend. Congrats on your teams win and your wedding.   Go Bills. My favorite sports memory is when I went to Indian wells for a day of tennis. I got to see a match between 2 greats roger Federer and Nadal. Then rain came and delayed the day. Some games got postponed but then lot of people left so then you could go and sit anywhere in the stadium. So we were able to go from top row seats to bottom row seats since very few people were left for the last game of the day. It was an awesome day and worth staying there when most people left.   Thanks for the contest
Congrats on your awesome weekend and you must be so excited to have your wedding photos.   I love love. My favourite lovey memory is from the first night that I moved in with my partner. We built flat pack furniture together (no arguments!) and it made me feel like we truly are a team of us versus everything that is thrown at us. Probably a bit of a silly one haha  Thanks for the contest!
Go Bills I'm not too much into sports anymore. I wanted to play football in High School but they said girls were not allowed, so I watched from the bleachers since I was in marching band. I watched WWE for many years and was obsessed, if that counts as a sport🤣 Which my favorite memory changes every time I rethink about it. But with the climate lately, it's the contact signing with Donald Trump and McMahon for Wrestlemania 23.
Go Bills  My favourite sports memory is going to the London 2012 Olympics. One thing I probably wont ever be able to do again it was just fabulous.  The atmosphere of the city and the olympic centres was amazing.    I am tagging u/purplepastasoul because they are also purple and u/Bitter_Joke1589 because they are new.
That's great that you had a good weekend and got your wedding pictures, I wish you and your family many great blessings.   I love love going through my daughter's baby pictures and just pictures in general, they hold so many amazing memories. They bring back memories I've missed so much. It's so amazing how we are able to have pictures and videos now to record and have amazing or sad but really important memories <3
One of my favorite memories just happened! I am a hockey fan and we were watching the 2nd game of the season. The game went into overtime and a rookie on our team scored the game winning goal with 1.7 seconds left in overtime. Obviously my husband and I had to yell "YEAH" out in excitement and my puppy immediately let out one little yip in response. It was so cute and I love love both my dog and the Devils. GO DEVILS!  Gonna tag my new friend u/neonpurplegreen wanna join the fun?
I love love. There's so many good memories over the years, my wedding day, or the instant love I felt for my children after giving birth. There's nothing quite like those two experiences
Yay so glad to hear you had a good weekend, friend! I hope the wedding photos came out beautiful. I have no idea about sports so I love love. One of my favorite memories is actually when my husband proposed to me. We were at the Contemporary Resort in Disney World, where they let you go out onto a balcony that gave you a view of the fireworks show at Magic Kingdom. They streamed in the music and everyone.   Not only did my husband propose there during the fireworks (which was much nicer than being on crowded Main Street in Magic Kingdom) but they way he did it was to put the ring and a series of love letters inside a small mailbox decorated to look like the one made by Carl & Ellie in Disney/Pixar's UP.   Thanks for the contest!
Go Bills!  My favorite sports memory was Deshaun Watson hitting Hunter Renfrow for the game winning tuddy in the National Championship game against Alabama to give Clemson their 2nd Natty ever!  I suffered through mediocrity for a long time to enjoy that one!
Wedding Photos!! How exciting!   I love love ~ We built a blanket fort over our bed (ceiling piece, long side pieces hanging from ceiling to floor.) I found an old shorter string of multi color icicle lights that I hung in there. We brought the pizza, booze, snacks, and movies to the bedroom. It was so comfy, we left the tent up for weeks 🥰
Go Bills! I have no idea what that is. Yay sportsball!!    I love love...for my 40th birthday my partner took me to stay at a beautiful castle hotel on the coast of Scotland. It was incredible, we had an actual tower room with 4 poster bed, whirlpool bath, fireplace. The chef at the restaurant did a happy birthday dessert and the waiter and my boyfriend sang happy birthday to me in Greek, it was the most wonderful and romantic weekend ever.
I love love ❤❤ the memory of collecting football cards with my dad. I was maybe in middle school? We used to carefully open the foil packages, and spend hours at card shows, and when the fames were on, we'd bring all the books out and go thrpuhh them/ reorganize them. I have countless football card binders FULL of cards. 🙂🙂  I have a bunch of the really cool/special cards framed and hanging up on the wall. It was a really great time. 🙂   Great memory of a girl and her dad. 🙂
Go Bills!!! When I learning how to swim as a kid. There was a competition the very first year of the learning training. I  never could beat anyone but idk how but on the day of the competition my body moved with a different sort of agility and I just pushed through the waters.I came first and I swam so fast I was literally standings for the others to complete the lap. Nobody could believe that I won including me! It was my best freestyle stroke ever! ( The following years I stood second twice and third once. Lol. Never again first!) This was my favourite sports memory!
Go Bills  One year one of the families I taught took my kids and I to a Broncos game. It was a huge win and the last before they entered the playoffs. It was lots of fun with fireworks, etc.
I love love the Christmas card that my boyfriend sent me.  It's the first one I got from him, and I keep it on my nightstand to read whenever I miss him.  :)
Go bills  Favorite sports memory is betting with my dad on if the Miami heat would win another championship in the early 2000s!
I love love the crisp spring mornings my husband and I spent together before school when we first met. So many laughs and hidden kisses. Spring always reminds me of those good first months 🥰
Go Bills! (I have no idea what team this is or even what sport this is, lol 😅)  I love love...and thanks for the contest!
I love love. My partner and I went to Peru a couple of years ago and stayed in an area of Cusco called the Sacred Valley. We stayed in this lovely hotel and I think it was one of the most peaceful spots I've ever been in my life. It's honestly probably the happiest I have ever felt and I got to share that with my love and best friend.
Go Bills! One of my favorite sports memories is seeing the Green Bay Packers play at Minneapolis at the TCB Bank Stadium when they were building the new football stadium. I did not get to see a football game in that new stadium, but I did see Metallica play there right after it opened. Anyway, it was a great weekend this weekend, because the Packers got into the playoffs! 🥰💛💚
Go Bills  Omg my favourite sports memory was when he Toronto raptors won the championship. I was so freaking happy when they won and to make it even sweeter my grandma who doesn’t watch sports actually sat there and watched the entire game with me. After they won she told me I could buy the championship hat. So the next week, after school ended, I went to the mall to secure a championship hat. This is probably the best sports memory next to watching team Canada win gold in hockey.
Go Bills!!   I’m not a sports person at all, but I was recently given the opportunity to visit the new raiders stadium! It was really cool because I’ve never been to a sports stadium before and I got to go before it was officially open to the public. It was something I won’t be forgetting for awhile!
I love love   This is soooo cheesy but my boyfriend and i were cuddling once and we paused for a second, looked at each other, and at the same time he said “you’re so pretty” and i said “you’re so handsome “ and we both were a lil shocked but we giggled and kept cuddling.
Go bills! I love love when my now husband mad a book full of photos from notes from around the world with why he loves me 😍
Go Bills  My favorite sports memory was years ago in high school when our football team was undefeated and went to state. We took eight school buses full of kids to Chewelah, Washington where it was about a billion below zero with snow on the field snd the played anyway! Some band kids’ instruments froze to their lips when they tried to play. We were wrapped in sleeping bags and trash sacks to stay warm and dry, jumping up and down to keep from shivering and the team played on. It was ridiculous snd fun and we won.
I love love. One of my favorite lovey memories was visiting my boyfriend in the care facility he was staying in after having open heart surgery. We had broken up and hadn't seen each other for several months, so it was a very emotional reunion full of tears, hope, promises, and love
I love love! At Mr. Bamboo's and my wedding, we were so busy talking to guests and stuff that we didn't get much time to talk to each other, but then finally we had a moment to dance and flirt for a bit and my friend just happened to get a photo of that moment. We're both looking admiringly at each other while guests are dancing in the background. I love looking at that photo, it reminds me how much we still have a crush on each other!
Go Bills! My family is from Buffalo, and I remember Super Bowl parties growing up...when you're a kid and your family has a Super Bowl party 4 years in a row, you just assume it's something that happens every year! 😂 After we moved away, the Bills stopped making it to the Super Bowl, so naturally I had to move back and now am here to stay!   (All my relatives who no longer live here have a group chat during the games...and it is an expected tradition that regardless of where you are or what you're doing, you must dance any time the Bills score a touchdown!)  Edit: [Bonus pic in my lucky Bills Sweater at work on Friday!](https://imgur.com/a/8L4QISY)
Go Bills   Watching the packers in the super bowl with my dad when I was younger. I had so much fun and bonded worth my dad.  To this day I'm still a cheese head.  GO PACKERS GO
My favorite memory is when I first got my beloved kitty friend, Buddy! It’s so hard to believe that there was a time when my fat cat was just a little kitty.  I love love  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
Go Bills. I have great memories of going to ball games with my parents as a kid and getting a hotdog with fried onions and a big ol cup of fresh squeezed lemonade. I haven't had the chance to go to many games as an adult. I had tickets to see the local AAA team here and then COVID. That's one of the things I want to do when it's safe.
Go Bills  My favorite sports memory is going to the Lakers vs Celtics game last year in February at the Staples center. The atmosphere was crazy and it was a close game. Glad the Lakers got the W. It was cool being at the Staples center for the first time too.
Go Bills, my favorite sports memory is the Eagles finally winning the Super Bowl #GoBirds
I love love  So my favorite memory was when I came back to my family the first time after starting college. College was the first time I was out on my own, so it was a pretty big deal!
Go Bills  My favorite memory was watching Kobe's last game before retiring from basketball back in 2016. I watched in on TV and I was both amazed and sad it was the last time he was playing professional basketball. I cherish that moment because I admire him so much as a basketball player and a creative. Sadly, he passed away in that awful accident last year with a lot of people. His dedication to basketball still influences me to this day. I will always remember watching that game. He is my favorite player of all time and a source of inspiration for my life. He scored 60 points that day and I couldn't believe it 'cause he had a rough season due to past injuries.
Go Bills  My favorite sports memory is when our community hosted Hockey Day in Minnesota in 2013.
Go Bills  My favorite sports memory is probably watching the super bowl of '15 with a bunch of friends. I enjoy football when watching it in groups, and even though the Seahawks lost, it was such a tense close game, which was really fun. Plus great food. I love superbowl food...
Go Bills  My favourite sports memory was being there *in person*, *at the game*, when the Boston Red Sox beat the New York Yankees in 2004 to advance to the World Series. Go Sox!
Oh boy, a chance to share with others how my wedding went hahaha. I Love Love! We got married in a friend's backyard, very small event. He wore his Jurassic Park hawaiian shirt and we said our 'I Do's to the Jurassic Park theme song. This wasn't planned, it's just how it went, and I love it haha  Thanks for letting me take part in your fun weekend through this contest. I haven't had much of a fun weekend in... Months and months! Sending you lots of happy and warm wishes :)
Go Bills 😂 I was really into baseball as a 7year old. My favorite player of the city’s team later got drafted away, but my parents got me a little bear with his name on it from the gift shop on the night that we went and he won. So now, whenever I watch sports, I mainly watch for the players and hope they’re sweet and having fun
I love love  How do you choose just one memory? I could share my most recent when just yesterday, I taught my spouse how to make French toast. Simple moments of just laughing together adds up as the days go by. I hope in the future, I can look back at all those accumulated happy days and find comfort.
Go Bills      My favorite sports memory was when i got to meet cristiano ronaldo here in portugal after a national game, idk if u can count that as a sports memory, but it sure is one that i wont forget
Not entering, but I'm rooting for y'all! - A sad Saints fan
I love love  My best date ever was when my college boyfriend surprised me with a drive in movie in his truck. He purchased a portable DVD player (before tablets were a thing) and a movie and he made a picnic dinner and we went to the park and watched a movie in the back of his truck. It was soooo freaking sweet.
I love love!  My favorite memory was when my fiancé proposed! It was a total surprise. I was 100% convinced he was waiting until after the holidays. I came home from work and he was in our bedroom with a bunch of candles lit and flowers on the bed. We’re wedding planning now and I’m so excited
I love love!  My favourite lovey memory is when my fiancé proposed :)
Go Bills andddd my favorite somewhat related sports memory is this - my family is from Chicago, so i was raised to be a Chicago anything fan. Bears, Bulls, Cubs, etccc. Well i was working as a hostess on a late Sunday afternoon. I was doodling on a sticky note when a shadow came over my head. A man with a deep voice asking for a table for 6. Usually that’s a lot to ask since we were about to close down lunch service and a table of 6, you usually need a reservation. So i was mid-sentence, starting “i’m sorry buuuu” and as i raised my head, there he was. hoop earring and all. Michael Jordan.   That restaurant had celebrities running through it often, and none struck me like him. i honestly couldn’t speak. thankfully my manager came to the rescue and bailed me out. Michael just chuckled but it was something i’ll never forget. He ended up eating 4 club sandwiches and 6 of our specialty cocktails. lol
Go Bills!  My favorite sports memory is combined with my favorite romantic person: I was at a hockey game and we scored some really great seats right at the plexiglass behind the opposing team.  We were all hitting the glass and chanting and I was hitting it so hard that my wedding ring snapped.  Oops!  Luckily my partner has a great sense of humor.
I love love!  My favorite “lovey” memory is when I told my boyfriend that I loved him for the first time.
Go Bills  I will always remember watching boxing with my mother and how into it she would get, throwing punches at the screen and ducking and weaving with the fighters, all the pep talks she would give them while in time between rounds, she truly loved the sport. Thank you for letting me relive that moment in my childhood.
Go Bills! I'm a new Tampa Bay Bucs fan so I'm happy we got through too! And yay for the wedding photo's! :)  I don't really have a favourite sports memory (except last nights game I guess!), but I love love and one of my favourite lovey memories will just be happily sat in the cinema watching the extended LOTR trilogy with my other half.  Thanks for the contest!
I'm not much of a sports person, but "Go Bills" anyway because everyone should enjoy a thing they are interested in. If there were really professional quidditch teams, I'd be all over that lol. A sports memory that I do have however, is going to Dodgers game with my grandpa. He was legit the best human I've ever known besides my dad ( his son) . He would always get me a hot dog, make sure I got to see everything going on ( brough binoculars) and always explained to me what was happening and why. He really wanted me to understand baseball which I've honestly carried a love for into my adulthood. Unfortunately, I've moved away from L.A. so I don't have a desire to follow the team anymore but if/when I move back I'll get back into it for sure. Milwaukee (where I live) has a great basketball team also which I have had the privilege of seeing Giannis Antetokounmpo in the flesh and he is amazing .. so so tall.. and so so nice! That's just what Milwaukee is like though, you just see famous people when they come to town because it's still small enough of a town for that to happen. Anyway, thanks for the contest friend!
Go Bills  First football memory I have is my dad taking us to a San Diego Chargers practice even though he cant stand them lol and seeing Dan Fouts and Rolf Benirschke their kicker and I fell in love with those giants to me and the game :)
I love love!  &#x200B;  When my husband was still my boyfriend, and we were semi-long distance, he had his brother come up one weekend to grab me by surprise. We went to the water park and the carnival, and that's when I realized that we were meant to be.
I love, love!   I’m glad you had a great weekend!
Go Bills.     I loved going to the horse races with my dad.
Go Bills!   I think my favorite sport memories are with my Dad. The city we lived in when I was younger had a small local baseball team and stadium, and my Dad took me to games all the time. It was always our thing! We’d keep track of the scores and he’d run after fly balls for me because I thought it was so cool taking home a baseball from the game. 🤣 We’d get ice cream sundaes out of one of those plastic baseball hat bowls. And we’d watch baseball!  It wasn’t a really popular team so it was always super quiet in the stadium, and they weren’t a very good team and often lost. 😅 But we still always had a fun time together!
I love love hanging out and just chilling with my friends when it was safe
Go Bills!  Favorite sports memory is when my husband surprised me with tickets to one of Kobe’s last games before retirement. It was in the nose bleeds and he couldn’t sit and watch with me because he was working the game but it was an amazing surprise for me since I’d never gotten to see a game live and it was one of Kobe’s last.
Go bills!
I love love. I want to bring up a favorite memory of my late grandmother and how we used to bake on Sundays.
I love love going for drives along the waterfront with my family. Nothing like going for a cruise in beautiful scenery and being together with those you love.
GO BILLS!!!!! My favorite memory is when Josh Allen scored 3 touchdown in one game.   I love love when I got my kitten and my male cat, Ombre, carried him around in his mouth once, and would feed him dry food, and wouldn't leave his side. (Kitten was 5 weeks, found outside in the woods)
GO BILLS!   When my city's Basket team won the Final Four Playoffs for only 3 points after a really hard match! That victory marked the first time EVER we went to the Italian A2 Series, we were a small group of ultràs/fans which followed the team 440 km far from our homecity.    Just moments after the game ended we all rushed to the court, screaming and hugging the players and the others for the joy. Water from the bottles was flying everywhere, I took some photos with my fav playmaker and my clothes were soaking wet lol  It was mad funny and a joyful moment, sadly it was our last year in A2 as it's a difficult position to keep but well, nice while it lasted. :)     I'm also lazy and I should create a wishlist for this but nah, only if i win. lol
Go Bills!  My favorite sports memory was going to minor league baseball games every summer with my childhood best friend and our families. We had the time of our lives eating peanuts and those long licorice ropes, and rooting for the home team. One time we went to a game and the person who was going to throw out the first pitch was a no-show, so they went into the stands and pulled us, and I got to throw it out that night. It was so fun, and definitely a memory I'll cherish forever!  Thank you for the contest!
Go Bills  my husband's employer paid for a bunch of us to go see the Detroit Lions.  It was Dec 12, 2010.  During the game we learned that the roof collapsed at the Metrodome, and as holders tickets to the Lions came we could come back the next day and watch the Viking and Giants play for free.
Go Bills My favourite sports memory is hard to pick but I'm going to pick when we went to the hilinka-Gretzky cup and Canada won gold. It's a tournament for U-18's but the arena was packed and it can fit probably 10K in the lower bowl. It was  exciting seeing so many people come cheer for these kids and they were so appreciative of all the support. Some of them are already playing in the nhl and it's really cool to see how much they have improved in a few years.   tagging  u/toxic_kitten  u/insomniatica
Go Bills!  When I was a kid my friends mom got baseball tickets for my bro/sis/me and their family. My friends mom bought each of us a bag of candy. My sister got fuzzy peaches. My friends brother asked for some and being a butthole my sister threw them in her mouth, chewed them up and spat them into her hand. Then she offered them to him.   And he ATE them!! The look on my sisters face was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. And also the game was fun!
I love love.     This is going to sound cheesy, but I love that I get to be in love with my best friend.  There's nothing better than being with someone who makes you laugh until you cry and who you can be your complete self around.  LAME!
Go Bills!!   I remember going to my university’s basketball game for the first time and the experience was so cool! They had a wicked lights/laser show, the music was pumping and the feeling was just so electric! I don’t remember if we won but I just remember having a good time.
I love love  my favorite memory was receiving chocolate covered strawberries for valentine’s day 😍
I love love   I love it when someone remembers what I like and does something/gets something related to it. For ex, my SO remembered how I casually mentioned the song tangerine girl would be a good song to rollerblade to. Fast forward we were rollerblading with friends and he paid the DJ to play that song for me. I was so excited to hear it and told my SO, and I thought it was weird for it to be playing becuase the theme that night was r&b music. He didn't tell me that he was the one the requested it  til we got home.
Go Chiefs
PLEASE there’s more city damage in a single scene of a marvel movie than in the whole dc universe
Good question! I feel like the quadra-peds might enjoy some variation of soccer. Like Rocket League rules but with dinos instead of cars!  Bi-peds... With their little arms something like Rugby or American Football might be difficult... So maybe skiing, the ski poles would have to be really long to work with their tiny little arms though! I don't know if they'd be able to snowboard, side ways stance seems a bit challenging...
How sweet
My husband is a Saints fan too. Our house is sad today 😞
I played football too! We only had a flag team, but my friend and I were the only girls. The guys were all pissy about it until the coach stood up for us since we were the fastest runners. It was super fun!
Rock on! That’s awesome.
Gorgeous pictures. 🤩 Thanks for the tag!
That is an excellent story! I love that you joined a sport because you read about it in a book! That's just awesome and so you! 😊💚💚
Oooo, what book was it?
I love love!  It pains me to say “Go Bills” but... maybe a Bills/Packers Super Bowl could be fun? 😂  My fave sports memory is probably watching the Packers win the Super Bowl back in ‘96 at a party at one of my dad’s friends’ house... I was just a kid, but the excitement, and the food, and the adrenalin was so cool.  Thanks for the tag :)
Thanks for the tag!!!   THAT'S SO SWEET I CAN'T!!!
That story is adorable! I love love it! Also really makes me want to make gingerbread so I might do that in a couple days.   It's hard to choose a lovey memory, but our third date is probably high up there - I went over for his housewarming and earlier in the week we'd been making fish puns so I turned up with a drawing for him saying "You're fintastic" and he'd made me a "Punderwater Award". I ended up staying over and in the morning his friends invited us to go to the park and so I ended up going, wearing pjs because it was that or my dress (I'd planned on staying at a friend's who lived nearby hence having pjs with me) and we had a lovely time there, then got invited back to his friends for tea so we ended up spending over 24 hours together before I finally went home. Our first date was also super long as we just really enjoy being together.
Tulips are bomb! 🌷sounds like a beautiful bouquet 💐
That is awesome! What is your rank now? (Or if you no longer train, what rank did you make it up to?)
We did that too! 🙌 Wait til it’s been 20 years! 🤭💜
Woo! Go Sabres! (Even if most of Buffalo is [a little like this lately](https://i.imgur.com/q5aboA2.jpg), hehe!)
We got married in October 😊
Thanks for the tag!! ❤️❤️❤️ also awesome anime intro lol I would’ve never known but I’m so excited it hit you guys so good!!
Wait you played with the MSU marching band? That is super cool. What do you play?
I'm sorry to bother you, but on amazon how do u get the link that shares all ur whislists? like how can i see and choose one from urs while i can only share one at a time from mine ?   Thank youu
I love this 🤣🤣 And know I wanna make a little T-Rex on skis! Actually I wanna make a whole battalion of winter sports dinos now!
I mean I know I hormonal but I legit cried after he said that.
That’s why I love reading so much! Anything is possible! 🧡
The Boys in the Boat
I got up to 2nd degree blackbelt. Almost made it to 3rd, but then I got busy with school and work.
Wow!! Congrats that’s amazing!!
I’m admittedly like that this year hahaha
Well congrats! Ans congrats on your team winning last night. I don’t really have any skin on the game but I like the ravens because Lamar Jackson is so much fun to watch and his crappy backup, Tyler Huntley, was my university’s quarterback while I was there. Best of luck in the games ahead!
It was a lot of fun because it came on so unexpectedly haha
They had like a spy theme that year, and I played clarinet. I also used to do colorguard and bass clarinet during concerts. I am in community college right now, and I am lowkey interested in trying out for the band next year if it will fit in my schedule.
Where do I sign up so that I can see all of these??
Awesome! I used to train (and teach) back when I was in HS and college, made it up to 4th before I had to give it up.
Thanks!!! Time really does FLY 😲 enjoy it!
Those are the best!
We’ve established that you’re my Dino friend now so if they happen, you’ll get the exclusivity of seeing them (yes u/PsychologicalPenguin you’ll see them too👀)
That's so cool. Why did you give it up?
Excuse you, I'll get to keep them 👀
Well, I trained in a school in Florida, where I lived during high school. When I went to college in another state, I tried a school in that area but really didn't like it, so I really was just training when I went home for breaks (and sometimes on my own). Once I graduated from college, I moved more permanently, and decided it was the right time to break it off. I still practice on my own from time to time, but I've since gotten very into rock climbing, so that's my main exercise these days!  That's too bad about you getting busy, but I totally understand. Have you found any other pursuits to fill the gap?
We shall see 😈
Not yet! I want to try out Muay Thai though. I do light exercise on my own occasionally but it's not the same lol. Rock climbing looks fun.
😡
That's awesome! I hope you find a good Muay Thai place to train, though depending where in the world you are your options may be limited. One nice thing about rock climbing is that our gym was allowed to stay open; we're naturally going to be more spread apart within the climbing facility than people would be in a traditional "gym."
You should wait for your birthday before complaining too much... just sayin’ 👀
There's a lot of options in NYC, but the membership prices are quite steep. That's good that your gym stayed opened.
Fake complaints don't count 👀
“Fake” suuuuuuure 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀

u/ssmith71608 thank you so much for these sheets I really needed new sheets. The cover is gorgeous I can not wait to sleep in them!!

I love looking up the games to play on it! haha
Just got the echo dot..and besides setting my alarm,and asking her to tell me a joke,or play 60s music lol  Tell me what else you do with yours?   Looking fwd to setting her up to a lamp, I wanted to change her name to dotty. But see there's only 4 options they give you..  So come teach me and others some cool things about it!! the echo ⚫ that is lol☺️
I made a playlist, and I enjoy playing different artists and adding songs to it.
My fave is NPR One in the AM w/ my coffee
I have a plug hooked up to a lamp in the living room. I love it because my kiddo doesn't mess with the lamp now. We'll also ask questions we can Google because it's easier, especially when I've got my hands dirty. And we'll ask about the weather.   We could probably do cooler stuff, but that's about all we do that you didn't mention 😅
You can set up routines.
I got one for free for signing up for Sirius radio and opened the box once because I needed a new usb c but it comes with an adapter and jack, so my tip is don't try to use the charger for your phone lol I'm yet to use it hopefully someone can come up with some ideas here!!!
I don’t have this, I do have an OK Google. Honestly don’t know the real name! I just know it responds to “ok Google.” Use it to play music now and then. That’s it 😂
It has a price is right game, but with Amazon products. Really fun to play with the family.   I think you have to say, “Alexa, play Price is Right” to start it!
Hahaha hahaha I have two smart phones and one computer. That's it. And they ALL stay in one room if my house. My privacy is worth more to me than the convenience. Get some laws on place protecting my rights then we'll see.
How? Example? A talking game I imagine?
Well I dont have prime,but its something to look fwd to in the future!!
I'm new..so very new...what's NPR? ☺️
Yes I'm looking  Forward to plugging my lamp in . I have my alarm clock set at 9:00 p.m. to remind me to take my medication and the alarm went off the other day and I was so excited because she told me was time to take my medication 🤫would you believe that I forgot to take my medication lol🤣
Can you give us an example of your routine?
You don't have to tell me about that when I got my last phone I was so excited that I didn't realize that it was a totally different USB cord , C ...and now I probly have about 15 of the old cords lol
Lol L OK now I'm really confused . What is OK Google?
Oh my God I love this I love this I love this I'm gonna hit send right now it's why can go for and talk to Alexa lol
Well I just got done playing and I only got 2 outa 5😳 but it's definitely a cool feature got any other cool games up your sleeve? Lol😆
Right!  So you can play like an escape room by saying Alexa play Escape the Room!  There are trivia games and music games.  It's easier to just look at a list and try things out!
National Public Radio so the news in small bites
😂 that's great though! No forgetting now!
We have the ring system so we have loghts and switches attached to our Alexa. We have one that when ring senses a person and the say Alexa I’m home certain lights and such come on. We have another where we’ve things grouped that allows for some things to all go on at once or turn off after so many minutes of inactivity. Like for a motion sensor. I hope that helps? My roommate set most of it up.
I LOVE the usb c, I get excited when something uses it! You're post is going to make me "finally" set up my dot lol
I can’t think of the name but it’s the equivalent of the echo dot
Haha nice! It also has Jeopardy (new questions every week) and Wait Wait Quiz (which is kinda like Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me)
Again I am very new to all of this so am I googling games on Amazon for echo dot?
Ok..I tried get news n I think it's set on cnn,i really need research on how get my settings where I need them, but such a cool gadget!
Lol it was the 1st day that I got it and I was just messing around with it mind you it was only a couple days ago that I got it set up and when it finally went off and she was talk and tell me to take my medication my God I was so freaking excited and then 2 hours later I realized I never took my medication so now as soon as she goes off with the reminder I make sure that I grab my medicine immediately lol
Ah ok,very cool.i think it's great you have it set up doing so many things,I'm excited to explore!!
Yeah!! Set it up...   My Chrome book for my job has the C, and that thing is like lightning fast
Well I think I'm gonna pass on jeopardy because when I used to watch it on television I think at of the whole half hour show I probly only got one question correct 🤑  lol can you please tell me where I can go and finds a list of all the different types of games so I don't have to keep coming back here to bother you lol🤡
Try googling “Alexa Skills” it should link it right to your Amazon
Oh my gosh 😂
While you can only call Alexa four different names you can call any of the plugs lights or switched anything you want. So one room has stars wind and sky for lights and fans and stuff
I feel weird talking to a speaker lol I'm soooooo old I cashed a check on my phone last week for the first time ever and I was so nervous
You can ask it for a game, or you can find them on the app. I think it’s More (bottom right) then Skills & Games. Good luck!
Will do ty
😆🙃
Yes I was a little bummed out because I wanted to call mine  DOTTY... lol  I have 2 plugs ,never knew about that tip,ty again!!👍
Lmao..hun I'm old too 50 ish lol..🤭n old fashioned...been alone for yrs now,n talking cats n kids all day at my job...this breaks up my day lol
Oh I did. Tyvm..I was having a hard time finding it..tyvm for the tip!!👍🙃🐧
Make your world fun. You can also set up Alexa to make sounds too when things go on if I recall correctly
I'm 40ish...I talk to my dog, and catch myself really talking to him often lol but they're real and wonderful! Im going to set it up tomorrow Im saving this post because I'm curious what people use it for too.
Have fun! There’s a ton to do
What do you mean like I can make her quack like a duck? Lol tell me more because I want her to do so many different crazy fun interesting things
Mr. JJ is a male cat and male cats are more vocal than females so he literally sits and he meows any answers me all day long and its acutest thing it's the craziest thing and I absolutely love it.  I did some reading and it's at for years ago she did a 130 commands and now she's at over a 100000 lol the one guy was saying that you can set it up to play like a magic wand? music and stuff so I only set it up a couple days ago and I know there's a million different features so I just wanted to throw it out there and see how creative everybody has gotten
Yes and I'm happy that I decided to make this post because I'm sure there's a lot of things that would take me a lot longer to figure out lol have a great evening my friend
There are different tones you can set like magical wands and stuff.
You too!

u/HauntedCoffeeCup thank you so much for the tasty, delightful, heavenly coffee 😁😁😁  I got it last night but wanted to wait till morning to try it out. It is delicious, never tried this one before. And it smells great too! ❤☕
What a cute cup! I've also been eyeballing this coffee because everyone here seems to love it. How accurate is the taste? :-)
Some of the best coffee!! Enjoy!
Silly question but I’ve always wondered because I see these cups a lot and they’re so adorable but how do you drink from them? Do the ears not poke you?
Mmmm! I hope it’s delicious!
Thank you! The coffee is not too sweet but you can taste the coconut flavour. I had mine really strong because I was up all night, but it will be really good if it's light I think.
Thank you! It is 😁 I love the smell and the taste.
This one doesn't poke 😁 till you get to the very end. Then you can just turn the cup around (I switch hands) and the ears point away so they don't poke.   I used to drink it everyday but it's pretty big so I only use it on occasions now. But they are so adorable 🐱😁
It sure is 😁

Contest entry: Im obsessed with the [SCP Foundation](http://www.scpwiki.com/) and am currently bored out of my mind sitting in the ER. The wikia is dense but you can also just search “scp” on youtube or google or whatever. While I wait to get my shoulder and elbow popped back in (dont ask) find me some cool SCPs to learn about. I know the most common ones like SCP-682 (The hard to kill reptile) and SCP-999 (The tickle monster), but theres like 3,000 of them. Someone is bound to find one that I don’t know, and I will entertain myself with it.  Hooray.   1. Dbad  2. Have something on your list that can be purchased and shipped for $32.58 or less (weird, i know, if you were actually interested in why it’s the story below)  3. In case i use the raffle, use the phrase “Adults don’t fall out of bed” to simultaneously enter and mock me.   4. Send momma something weird.   5. Oh and maybe link your wish list. Quite a few of you don’t have them linked.   Amazon decided to send me an empty box which should have contained wound care supplies for Bunny. They’re replacing them but also gave me a gift card because the situation was so silly - fortunately the delivery person was there when i opened it and backed me up. He wanted to know what could possibly be so light in a box so big. It was air. Lol.   Anyway, i figured i’d use the returned value ($32.58) for a contest since they’re still providing the supplies and so it’s not really mine anyway.   Will end after ive been popped, imaged, and slept off the drugs.    AND GO!
Mwahaha. My evil plot to get everyone into SCP is... working?  Shoulder popped back in. Waiting on final imagine and so high. Froggin doctors.

I definitely haven’t heard of this one. I guess it stalls engines or something?  I shall read further. Thanks!
That is the funniest rendering of SCP 173 I’ve ever seen!  Thats usually rendered much scarier, seeing as how its a giant concrete statue that murders.   I love SCP 387 for a fun one (sentient, self-replenishing legos) and SCP 847 for pure fucked-up-ed-ness (the mannequin). Im hoping this gets more people interested lol.
Ah the old man. He is creepy af!  There’s also a lot of fun ones, though. It’s a cool little fandom to fall into the rabbit hole.
I hop e you’re having fun in the rabbit  hole!  I fell down into it last month (😂😂😂) and have yet to recover.
Where does he gets all of his looney ideas?  😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
That one has really great potential. I cant wait to check out the fanfic
Lol. And here i assumed SCP-2020 would just be a giant dumpster fire.
Ferdinand is hilarious!  He was in the first episode of the youtube series *Confinement* and just kept murdering the same immortal character over and over. Hes great!
That is kind of different, and its weird that there’s two sharing the same number!  Good find!
I haven’t heard of this one!  Super cool!    My secret plan to get people interest in SCPs is possibly working. Yaaaas.
Super easy to fall into this rabbit hole, isnt it??  Bunny got me into them. When she was in the hospital about six montha ago, the SCP Animations channel video about 3008 (The Endless Ikea) showed up in her recommendations. She got sucked in and so did I.
My hips and knees subluxate with embarrassing frequency, so i can empathize.   I didnt know this one, and the cactus he telepathically communicates with (3388) is pretty cool, too!
I can’t tell if the penny causes existential despair, or if that guy just really wanted an extra vacation. Good find!
I didnt know that. Ill have to check it out. :)
I actually know what this is!  This is an anomalous humanoid who deletes all information about itself either written or recorded verbalizations. It took me a minute to figure it out, but thats what i think it is. Like 95% sure.   Im not totally surprised about the empty box, being that their traffic and orders have increased by over 200% recently because of everyone shopping from home. Im just glad that i was out front when the delivery came and able to open it right in front of him. Thats why they replaced it and gave me the gift card, i think - their own employee was right there and confirmed it was an empty box for me.
Oh wow, this one is crazy!  Thanks!
Lol.  This one would get my Bunny in a heartbeat. Looks like the softest, moat comfy blanket in the world and then eats you?  She wouldn’t stand a chance!!
Wow thats really cool. I bookmarked it for when I’m less... like an occupant of a Volkswagen Bus. Just sayin.
Someone else just sent this one!  I still cant decide if the penny causes an existential crisis in the handler... or if that guy just wanted to claim a vacation really hard.   The J class is always weird. Check out 420J. 😂😂😂😂😂
First of all, a sapphic ace who loves all things space?  Are you *my* 4141 - 2?? Crazy.   These are both cool. Isn’t the whole thing so friggin cool?  Do you still follow the SCP wiki any of the channels, or did you eventually lose interest?
Yaaaas. My evil plan has worked. Soon we will ALL be studying the SCP!!
Oh no!  I hope your symptoms are nonexistent to light. Keep us updated!  The SCP is whats been helping Bunny’s post-surgical recuperation. Seems like a good choice!
Are you “Mom” on the list of wish lists?
That is phenomenal!  Were you already familiar with SCP, or did you just magically pull this cool ass naked lady up??
My sister truly believes Australia is a hoax. I thought she was kidding for the longest time, but, alas, she was not.
Omfg that is insane. Why germans so crazy?  THAT should be an SCP all its own.
Wow I havent even looked at the stories section!  That’s pretty cool!
I hadn’t seen that SCP... but Spock Mrs. Claus should probably be assigned a number, too!
Same. I wonder if its a joke entry or something??  Weird.
Isnt it amazing?  Which one is your favorite so far??
Well thats not disturbing at all.
That is hilarious.   My favorite screwed up one is The Mannequin, and my favorite fun one is Brickey the self-replenishing and sentient lego set.
Feel some kind of a way is the only thing that can describe what I felt like
Oooh also If I win [this](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08K385SMP/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_dlC_bFMbGbGEPDA6R)is something I really really really want soo badly you could maybe consider it? It's on my wishlist
ahaha xD I like light-hearted breaks from the spooky and serious :D thanks for the contest! SCP is such a fun idea and I'm glad it's been around for so long :')
Haha. It was a whole new frontier for me!
Ouch! Fortunately I only got hit by a semi truck, I couldn’t imagine dislocations being a frequent occurrence 😖 (I hope that didn’t come across in poor taste or like I’m trying to one up your misfortune, it was an attempt at humor and I was technically being honest, lol)
Haha, thanks!
😂😂😂   I still follow it on occasion, when life isn't too hectic and I remember it exists. Years ago I wanted to try and write some for then, but never got around to it.
😂🤣 I’m gonna be up all night it’s fascinating and man so much online
Yes, I am. I forgot there were lists other than the main wishlist. I feel dumb.
I was a little familiar with it so when I saw it I got excited
You know what, you're right...I feel like you should get the number assigning honors.  How'd the shoulder stuff go?
For real!
Omfg how in the world does someone start a sentence, “luckily, I was only hit by a semi truck”???  You are my kind of person!  {Bunny Heard me making this comment, and she replied, “someone who was previously hit by a train?“. Lol. Using talk to text on account of the one-armed-ness is leading to some weird discussions...}
Wait till you get to the good Youtube channels.    Omg i am so jealous because you’re going to get to watch Lord Bung’s *Confinement* series for the first time. Im so jealous. I wish i could remove that series from my brain just so i could experience the first eight episodes for the first time again.
Lol nah thats super helpful. :)
Well, its back in its socket. So... progress??
Lmao, thank you! Oh yeah, I would bet. Probably fun ones too though 😄 And that was a really good answer to your question, Bunny should be proud, lol
Lol I’ll let ya know how it goes
Sounds like progress I agree! I hope it doesn't hurt a lot 😣

Hi folks, I never did a proper intro since I joined around the holidays.  So I guess here are some factoids about me.   Im an MSW/MPH.  I’m  currently working as a psychiatric social worker at an inpatient hospital on a forensic unit.  COVID-19 has been a real bitch to us, as you can imagine.  I’m taking my final boards in April so my life currently consists of working and studying.   I have a giant cat and a beagle runt and they’re the best.   Born and raised on the east coast of the US, been in the PNW for about 9 years now.   I’m autistic and I’m trying to become more involved in the online neurodivergent and activism community.   I like reading, crafting, and outdoorsy stuff.   Am I doing this right? lol

Hi!! Welcome!! I'm autistic too, so I understand where you're coming from!!! I'm also from the east coast living in the pnw!!!!      What are your pets names? I love beagles!
Welcome. I imagine your job has been very busy during COVID. I know I reached out for help when it first started.   What is your cat's name? I have an orange tabby named Teddy. She is the best.   What kind of books do you like to read?
Hello and welcome to the sub!
Hi there! What is a guilty pleasure you have?
Hello and welcome

Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Hey friend! Welcome to the group. We're happy to have you.   What are your thoughts of Sia's upcoming movie?   What's your daily schedule been like working and studying at once?   If you weren't a psychiatric social worker, what would you want to be?
Welcome! You sound awesome and interesting! What are your pets names?
You’re doing this perfectly. Nice to meet you. What craft have you been the most proud of?
Holy crap, this got way more attention than I expected.  Thanks everyone for the warm welcome and I'm sorry in advance if I don't get a chance to reply to each!
Hi and welcome!  (and yes, you did a great intro!)
Welcome! What kind of crafts do you like to do? What are some of your favorite books?  &#x200B;  I do a lot of embroidery, but also sewing, and I love fantasy novels more than others.
Welcome!  What is your favourite genre when reading?
Thank you for all that you do 💛  And welcome!
Yes. Cats are the best, all other pets are a close second. Nice to meet you friend!
Wow!!! Hands down to you! Thank you for all your hardworks! ♥️ What’s your fave book btw? :)
I have phases lol.  I sew, make jewelry, I've recently gotten into macrame, really whatever looks fun and interesting and doesn't cost too much lol
Yay!  Let's be friends!    I'm in Oregon, how about you?     Sadie and Simba.  They're besties.
Hi!  My kitty is Simba.  Nothing terribly unique but it was fun to hold him up and say "SIMMBBAAAAAAA" in a deep voice when he was a kitten..  I like all books, really.  I'll give anything a try.
Thanks so much!  I like Halloween best, I think.  It's so steeped in  history and it's one of the only "ancient" holidays that hasn't been completely morphed to fit into more modern religions, and I just love the opportunity for grown ups to act like kiddos for a day and play dress up, get treats, etc.    Yay kitties!  What does Mr. JJ stand for?
I'm a bit obtuse when it comes to pop culture and I didn't know who Sia was but now I do, so thanks for that!  Umm my schedule is a mess lol.  I work normal business hours but lately I've  been staying late.  We've had so many staff out due to the virus that they've had to start pulling clinicians to work the floor, so us clinicians who didn't get the chopping block (I was one away- phew!) are having to do a bit extra to keep things up. I love my work though and I love my team, so I don't mind it.  Then I come home and read and hang out with my animals.  Been trying to cook every day, too!  Weekends are mostly for exploring.     I wanted to be a physician for a long time, specifically surgeon.  I did well on my MCAT but I had a vascular tumor in my brain and ended up developing epilepsy so medical school was no longer an option and a physicians' lifestyle isn't do-able for me now.  I need a lot of sleep lol
Hi!  Thanks :)  They are Sadie and Simba and we're in love.
Ooh this is hard!  I'm by no means very good at anything because I dabble in all sorts of things, but I'd have to say I'm omst proud of my jewelry because of the time and energy I put into it.  I collect bones while I'm out exploring in the forest, and I buy bones from reptile breeders and farmers, and I make them into jewelry and things.
I'm in Washington!!!!
This is just so interesting out of the last 100 people who joined that I've spoken to probably 80 of you love Halloween and I think it's so interesting. You're going to meet a lot of the same people so you're gonna have a lot of fun.   Mr. JJ was a rescue and when I got him his name was J and he told me that he really didn't like it 🙃and that if I wanted to change it that we could so we both agreed that we would kinda keep it the same so his new name is Mr. JJ🥰🐈
I love those names!
Wow that’s neat!

So come on in, grab a blanket, and enjoy the company.  **QOTD: What Charities do you support, and why are they important to you? (Do not link them)**
Happy Teriiiiiiiiii day! u/supermarvelous310  And Robert day to u/overlyapologeticguy
QotD: My Amazon smile goes to wounded warrior and I've also made sure to donate to  the 22 Project this year. Veterans Health is super important to me as I got from a long line of service members.  Also this past year I've given to legal defense funds for those arrested during protests. Not only has it been a cause I believed in, I've known ~~kids~~ young adults who were paddywagoned during peaceful demonstrations.

Goodmorning have a great day everyone!
how are some of my friends doing?? u/Mimooshka u/late_to_join_reddit u/PsychologicalPenguin
Can i be sad in the thread for a minute? Cause I got let go today from the bartending job I started last week. They brought in employees from a different location so they dont have availability for me anymore. I was excited for the bartending part (the serving part i.e. food was a little less exciting but nonetheless).  I have a fallback job so it's okay, but I'm just sad.
First time here very shy about talking but my answer is Shriners and saint jude and local fire department. Shriners and Saint Jude because my mother deals with cancer patients and the local fire department because my grandfather was a firefighter
My homemade chicken noodle soup was good! My parents both really liked it, so that made me happy.
Good morning everyone! I hope y'all are having a magical day ✨  I'm spending my day grading statistical essays that were due yesterday. So much fun! The kids picked really interesting topics, like testing to see if Pink Tax exists in Walmart products and whether the cereal at eye level on grocery shelves is more expensive than cereal on the bottom shelves.  QOTD: I support The Trevor Project, which focuses on suicide prevention in LGBTQ+ youth. I am so passionate about helping young people who are struggling with their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. This is especially keen because I work in a county where many parents are not accepting of their children who are not straight or cisgender. Those kids need support. The Trevor Project is an amazing organization doing very important work 💖
QotD. The three main charities I support are:  * Doctors Without Borders, * San Francisco SPCA, * Oregon Food Bank.
Good morning everyone! Today is the day I finally start exercising more. My mom and I are going to start yoga. I don't have much else planned today. I've been spending most of my morning looking for vans, because I'm hoping this year is the year I finally get one to convert into a tiny house.   I hope you all have a great day! Remember, someone loves you! <3
QOTD: I support a few children's and food security charities through volunteering.   For our MLK Jr. day of service project today, we made 24 cards and bags with meals to be delivered to seniors who are food insecure and who do not have family or friends to check in on them.
Good morning! Since we had company last night, and I actually cleaned up dinner dishes after they left, I'm enjoying a lazy morning AND pushing work to tomorrow, also. Today, I'm going to finish folding and putting away laundry and I'm also going to pull out my packed away decor to start putting it up! :)  I hope everyone has an awesome Monday.  **QOTD**: I support TWLOHA (To Write Love on Her Arms). They have saved my life and continue to spread hope to those who need it most. ❤️
Weirdest week online school. It's about theater and childhood stories and I don't want to think back about that lmao
Hey friends! Hope everyone is having a good Monday. Todays my birthday so super excited to be off today and looking forward to cupcakes later :)   I like to donate to local charities because I know where the money is going. Local dog shelters, churches, or food banks are where I usually donate.
I've gotten 9 hours of sleep every night for the past 3 days 👀 So glad I have today and tomorrow off
Hey there friends! Hope y’all are having a good day! :)
I'm literally just eating sweet potatoes for lunch today, because I'm lazy and wanted to be healthy.  QOTD: several, but mainly the Sierra Club, Meals on Wheels, and Planned Parenthood. Locally, we donate items regularly to the pet shelter (blankets) and the children's foster home center (gently used clothing and toiletry items).  Edit: the toiletry items are not used!
currently dealing with a lot of dizziness right now, not a very fun time grrr.. 💭 hope that you all have a lovely day and to stay hydrated! 💗 remember that someone loves you! 🌸
Ok i need your best instant pot recipes. My bf is a jerk who spent way too much money on me and now I have an instant pot 🙃 lol
QOTD. I like to support nature based charities and I always try to buy local before buying from larger stores. ..even when traveling!
Hey hey hey mischief makers. What are you guys into tonight? I’ve had quite a lot pumpkin cream cold brew so I’m gonna be up FOREVER.
QOTD: I support the women’s shelter and the humane society.  There was a short period of time that we were in the shelter when I was a child. And dogs ♥️, of course.
Alright, I'm just calling on all my friends I can think of now! I'm having a really just (%)#(&%#)(&$  month and I'm sick of it!! Let's chat guys, let's laugh together and just be us. I know a lot of us are going through it right now for our own reasons, so let's just try to put that aside just for a moment and talk... tell me something, anything!  u/gdarn16 u/space_noodlers u/PsychologicalPenguin
Qotd:  generally I like to support Lincoln Atheists, my local atheist group. I support my local humane society and the agency through which I placed a child for adoption. Sometimes I’m inclined to throw money at other fundraisers. Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. Food charities. I usually keep it local.   Today I’m chillin at home. Just have physical therapy later. Might try to finish some masks.
Morning!  I work from home and started early to get some stuff done this morning. My 4 year old came out to find me because he wanted to snuggle and was mad I want in bed. Kids are the best sometimes 💜
Hi. Hello. It’s morning. Good morning.   Today’s my weekly 6 hour break and I’m takin my butt to the duck pond to feed the Canada geese, hopefully to not be attacked by that bastard white Chinese goose again. Might zip over to the spooky shop and grab some incense, see if that weird guy who called me Wizard Eyes is working and have another bizarre conversation. I really need better break ideas.   Charities I actively support...   - Appalachian Bear Rescue, a local black bear rehab for injured and orphaned black bear cubs. Not only do they rehabilitate these beautiful babes, but they release them back into the wild to have the lives they deserve.  - Wildcat Sanctuary in Sandstone, MN. They’re a sanctuary for wild cats who are unable to live wild. Many were declawed, abused, or kept as pets somewhere. They give them the closest possible thing to a wild life, for the rest of their lives.   - ADI, which is short for Animal Defenders International. They’re like the A Team for wildlife. Going in to rescue wildlife from bad situations, and giving them a wild life in a protected space. Phenomenal work. These people are literal angels.
Good morning everybody happy Monday and happy Martin Luther king day to all. ❤I'm hoping that this message finds you with peace in your heart and remember to be grateful for the freedom that we have👍   I turned off all of my alarm clocks last night 😹all 5 of them to make sure that I slept in late today I missed my morning breakfast with my outdoor kitties but they're here now for lunch. Have a pretty busy day today with cleaning cooking and food prep and cleaning out the vacuum cleaner.    Sending you hugs from the Sunny East Coast from me🧸 and Mr. JJ🐈
I’m nannying today. And I have to finish a syllabus tonight. It’s going to be a busy day. Happy Monday, y’all!
I did a majority of my cleaning yesterday. So now, I have nothing to do.  QOTD: I support the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network. Pretty self-explanatory.
QoTD: Playa Rescue where we adopted our dog from, WWF because I've been rooting for the pandas since the 80's, I buy ZOX to support clean water and other various charities.  Maybe I shouldn't have been driving today. I saw an item last night on FB local group I wanted. After porch pick-up, I promptly crashed my car into their garage door. I was super embarrassed. I was a little fuzzy after poor sleep last night. All I took this morning was asprin as I don't think the kidney stone is on the move at the moment
QOTD: Hope for Bereaved.  It's a little local place that offers free grief counseling and maintains a local garden/park.
re-watched Once More, With Feeling and still loving the songs :D
Hello! I'm brand new here (been lurking for a bit but finally decided to stop being intimidated today and try and jump in to participating!). I've been enjoying watching the threads and gaining a little hope back in humanity through the generosity and community of this group. Thanks for being such great people! I'll post an intro soon so I can hopefully get to know you all a little better. My answer to the qotd is that I support the Ehlers-Danlos Society because I have hEDS and I think it's important to advocate for myself and other zebras and help fund research to make life for future zebras easier and more accessible.
I try to donate stuff to the local woman's shelter. My friend worked there and said there were SO many kids who came with just the clothes on their backs. I always donate my kids gently used clothes when they've outgrown them, and occasionally stock up on woman's supplies.
You know your frugal when your living room rug has a lot of runs and instead of buying a new one you cut all the runs. In our defense we have a cat and a dog and feel it pointless to but a new one for them to destroy when we can get a few more months of this one. But I truly did feel super frugal doing it. 🤷🏼‍♀️
I love three day weekends. It was honestly one of the best weekends I have had I think during this entire pandemic. It was exactly what I needed after a terrible work week. Baby girl also learned a new trick; splashing in the tub. It's so cute, and so wet 😂  QoTD: ACLU, HRC, Raices Texas, a local social justice org, a local food bank, a local women's shelter
I had pistachio encrusted chicken and leftover pasta salad for dinner :-)
Good evening. Today was busy. I get my covid booster shot tomorrow morning, followed by a quick check in with my counselor. Not much else to report tonight.
So my co-worker called me this afternoon and told me that 2 visitors at the site I worked at on Saturday had another family member test positive Saturday night.  We were cleaning between groups, and of course the people were among some of the early ones there throughout the day.  I hope it doesn’t cause an outbreak, as that could be a huge problem.    I bought meat Saturday night, but haven’t cooked it yet, the plan is to cook it tomorrow night provided I am not too exhausted after working late.  I might opt to try to make it in the morning, if I get up early.  Maybe I can have part of it for lunch before I go into work tomorrow.
Hey friends! I'm having a rough night. How are you guys?
Hi all! I haven’t checked in here for a few days but wanted to stop by and see how everyone’s doing.   As for charities I support any that are against animal cruelty such as the beagle freedom project. I always feel bad for animals that are used in labs against their will makes me sad especially the videos I’ve seen. Just. Breaks. My. Heart.
**Daily RAoA post:**  Hey you! :) Yes, you. The one reading this post. I think you're amazing. It may be the beginning of the day or the end for you. It may be the first time or last time today someone will say that to you, but it still holds true. You're wonderful.  Have a great day today. Make today *your* day. Find ways to make today better, brighter, happier and nicer.   If you need a friend, a place to vent or just someone, I am here. I may take a while to respond, but I am here for you. Always. <3  If you need to reach me immediately, please PM me for my phone. I will always have time for you.   Thanks for reading. I love you. Go and do great things. <3  —-  Considering I get a crap ton of mail from the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, Mission AZ and so many more. Those charities. Haha. I went on a charity spree a couple times during the pandemic because current events reasons. lol
a dream is a wish your heart makes, when you're fast asleep~  Quote of the Day : unfortunately I don't have a charity I hold dear to my heart, I mostly go with needs I can see locally but I have heard that Fuck Cancer is a really good one!
Good morning everyone! Got my coffee. Transplanted my chocolate mint to a pot. Made a homemade chocolate peanut butter coffee creamer for hubby. Talking about going back to a dot grid bullet journal. Hoping as with every day that the weather is warm enough to finish weeding the garden areas.
Is it nap time yet? No? Fine.  Got to work this morning and had a major cleaning and organizing urge. Two of my coworkers just stood there staring at me and looking at each other while I frantically dumped out boxes and drawers and whatnot. But now my two offices are so neat and organized. They have been warned that I will be very unhappy if things are not put back in the proper places from now on. Haha.   Now I'm getting ready to see my patients, so off I go!
QOTD: I always support the "TV campaign" - that's a nation-wide charity campaign that takes place every fall here in Norway (different charities each time). It's a great thing to participate in!
Good morning everyone!!!  I love to contribute to charity that handles heart conditions, the studies/advances they have made probably saved my moms life a few years ago.
>.< Mondays. I dislike Mondays. I have 8 million things to do, uhhhh.  Also, HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY TO YOU, u/supermarvelous310!!! You are amazing, and I hope you have a beautiful day ❤️
QotD: National Psoriasis Foundation. It's more than just itchy skin people :'(
Good morning everyone, hope everyone has a wonderful week ahead. My job search continues, having a bit of lows in between but I'll get over it.     QOTD I contribute mainly the old age foundation
Happy Monday! You matter! ❤️  QOTD: My Amazon Smile goes to the local ALS Foundation chapter because that’s super personal and close to my heart. I also give to the local food bank and closets.
Happy to have today off! I'm going grocery shopping, gonna meal prep, and read!
I'm in local club with focus on scholarships and community action
Coffees been consumed. Dishes are (mostly) done. Settling with the kiddo hoping he'll nap so that I can clean more and he's not cranky.   I hope everyone has a good day
Hello everyone!!!! I hope everyone's week starts off spectacularly. I have to go to the dentist today after work for a cleaning so yaaayy for me.
Morning all!  QotD: CHOC, for saving my cousin's son's life at birth. Art of Life Cancer Foundation, for helping a very close family friend. They gave us a few extra years with him.
Good morning, friends! There are so many good charities to support, and I have been so grateful to be able to keep a job and income during the economic difficulties that came with Coronavirus. The one I've donated to most is **International Justice Mission**, which fights slavery and human trafficking around the world. I also support **Preemptive Love Coalition**, which goes into areas hit by war and other major humanitarian crises around the world, and back when I got my first job in HS I sponsored a kid through **Compassion International**. And of course, don't forget to support local - part of my "stimulus" check went to foodbanks in my area through **Feedmore WNY**.
Good morning everyone, how's everyone day going? About to head into work 😢. How does one deal with customers saying "you look too young to be working", or "how old are you?". I look like a 14 year old, but I'm in my mid 20s. I always do a nervous chuckle and say I'm old enough, but they still like to push the joke around.
I just wanted to say I love the Selfie Sunday posts and which there were more posts like that. It's constant good vibes and people being good to each other. Also I get to see all your beautiful faces. Hope everyone is doing well today. Much love.
Hello!  I’m getting ready to run some hopefully quick errands here.  It’s 12:08 and I’ve done almost nothing all day.  Not my fault though.  There were some technical errors that were causing problems.  Hopefully tomorrow will be more productive.   Oh well.  What are you gonna do right?  Qotd:  I work with Habitat for humanity because everyone deserves to have a chance of having a decent, comfortable home.   I also support a local domestic violence shelter because I have a sister who was in an abusive relationship when i was a kid and I saw a lot of things that effected me greatly.  I donate regularly to an international fund to save elephants because they are beautiful, caring animals and my bff, who passed away a year ago was an huge elephant lover so it’s in her memory as well.  I wish i had time, money and energy to do more
Happy Monday all! I need coffee. Badly.   QoTD - usually local. I support causes like LGBTQ mental health, women’s shelters and Planned Parenthood. And the animal shelters in my area.
Qotd: I use Amazon smile to benefit my local animal shelter where we adopted three of our four doggos   I got like three hours of sleep last night and ended up calling out of work because I felt like hot garbage. I managed to get some more sleep and now I'm thinking about ordering some pho.   What does everyone like to eat when they don't feel good? Mine used to be a bean burrito and a mashed potatoes and gravy from the combination taco bell/KFC but they got rid of the kfc 😒
Good afternoon!    I’ve had a productive day and I’m ready to take a time out, in my bed with the heated blanket!  I’m waiting to pick my child up from a hike with their friend, then I’ll be able to do just that.   QOTD: the organizations I support most frequently are Preterm, National Ovarian Cancer Coalition, WomenSafe, and Native Americans Rights Fund. These organizations are important to me for different reasons but each has a special place in my heart.   Have a great day everyone!
QOTD : I'm supporting the SPA ("Société Protectrice des Animaux" , basically the french association who rescues, gives a shelter for abandonned animals in order to place them). I'm gonna adopt a cat in a few weeks/months i think, when the dog i'm fostering will be gone in another foster family or will be adopted. So it will be 4 cats at home !   And it concerns me a lot, because animals deserve the best, that's why i'm vegetarian tho, i can't handle the need to kill an animal just for your own pleasure (because meat is definitely not recquired to survive and be healtly, it's just a luxury that we, human, decided it's our  privilege as a "smart and evolved" species. :D).
Ugh I can't believe school starts in a week. We also still don't know if classes will be in person. I have 1 lab that may be in person, but the county is still in lockdown. As far as I know, only the 1st week is cancelled. I hate commuting but hey at least there will definitely be parking spots available lol.
Good Afternoon, Quesadillas!  Hope everyone is having an awesome day!
Handed in my essay at 3am this morning, so hurrah for that being finished! I also found out the school I'll be doing placement in soon so that's really exciting (but now I have to awkwardly wait for a response from them). Got one more thing to write which is summarising my current skills and my targets for it, and I'm on the third one out of five so fingers crossed I can finish it soon and then have some time to actually relax and read before bed!
Man. I cannot go a day without doing something absolutely stupid. Why am I like this?
I have so many new ideas flowing right now... ideas for another book, ideas on how to potentially help people... I'm both loving it and frustrated by it.  Have an appointment in like one minute and I'm mildly looking forward to it but I think it'll be good.  Hope everyone has a wonderful day and week!
I decided on breaking in my new instant pot with some homemade chicken noodle soup. I also invited my parents over for dinner.  I've only rarely cooked for them, and they're both super picky about food, so I hope it goes well.  Qotd: I generally support animal welfare charities, but I also use Tab for a Cause and choose to put donations towards decreasing worldsuck, and water.org
Been using this time to work on an old bullet journal for February and made zucchini noodles in an Alfredo sauce.
Just found out my boss has a fever and hot a covid test. To say I'm scared is an understatement. Sigh.  If today wasn't crappy enough.  How's your day going? I hope better than mine!!!
Todays a tired day..i had horrific nightmares the night before last. Pain is high and im living on my heating pads. Gonna try to do touch up paint today. Looks like husband avoided covid19 and im SO grateful. Mom doesnt have cancer either. So life hasnt been horrible ♡
I have been sponsoring a child since I graduated college and got my first job. I feel strongly about providing children everything they need for a happy and healthy childhood.
Hey everyone - I need to be in here more as I always love how positive it is but I'm always mindlessly scrolling when I'm on reddit.  Qotd : I don't have much money but I do give some to my local church and volunteer time there. They actually do what a church is called to do - we provide help for the poor and comfort for the sick - we run a bus route and pick up kids from the poor communities near us and feed them breakfast and show them love and send them home with food. Our pastor is on call at the local hospitals and with the sheriff's office if prayer or spiritual comfort or counseling is needed. And provides first contact counseling for people including referring them to professional help where needed. (Many people won't go to a professional unless an uninvolved person they trust suggests it and explains why they think it's a good idea.) So I feel it's worth my time to help the church out where I can - I have been on the bottom and needed help myself before and want to give back.
Didn't have the day off but luckily the boss let us out of work at noon!
Bloodwork done today. I gave the lady a heads up that I'm a slow bleeder, and she was actually very patient with me! It was refreshing! Hopefully I'll have the results soon, and we'll have some answers! I'm getting so very tired of this.  Hope everyone has a wonderful week! Stay safe!
After two +weeks in quarantining I got to see my best friend last night! I think our silent hug lasted what felt like a solid five minutes.
Cramps are very not nice but I've got them under control with meds. If only this bloating would go away for the night.  Got some things to do tomorrow, gonna buy some good soil for my terrarium, it needs more. Hopefully I can find a milipede too, they look so cute and adorable. I found one a week ago but it died. I think it was because it didn't have enough dirt to bury in :(  I want a pet bug or critter but I'm having a hard time finding one. *Sigh*... the search must go on!
Hey guys! Long time no see! Just popping back in.  QOTD: I don't currently support any charities in particular, but I would probably contribute to Royal Family Kids! Great program to help the local foster kids. :)
QOTD: I support Charity: Water, as I believe everyone deserves access to safe clean drinking water.
My anxiety is in overdrive. My antidepressant ran out today and I don’t have an appointment until Wednesday. My therapist scheduled me for a med appointment last minute today but I didn’t see the email until it was too late and by the time I logged in, the doctor wasn’t logged in anymore :/ so upsetting.
I'm sleepy, but I probably wont fall asleep for a few hours.  Today I went shopping for groceries.  I forgot to give my coupons to the cashier because I was so focused on whether or not I could use my Visa gift card (I like to use them all at once). T-T  QOTD: Children International, my local PBS and NPR station, and Wikipedia personally.  I also help my mom support the city's animal services shelter, where we got Dude.  We'll occasionally go to the store and buy them a bunch of stuff.  I feel like they probably need more help than my town's animal services department.  I live in a somewhat rich suburb compared to the city.  We got my old dog Petey from the town shelter, but I think the city has a higher kill rate.  So we'll probably adopt from there when we get another dog.  Hopefully that's a long time away.  (We're a two-dog household.)
today i unmolded my resin and they look nice but have a lot of bubbles cause i stirred too fast. whoops.
I had work tonight and it SUCKED but in good news , I just had my 1 year anniversary with my fiance a couple days ago 🥰🥰 feelin good. And sore. Ugh.
the drama surrounding my mother's body continues. we were supposed to get a cause of death today, but instead, an investigator and the coroner are now involved. I mean, if something funky happened, I wouldn't be surprised to hear it knowing her husband and how he left her unclaimed for 2 weeks.
Just zoning out and celebrating my mom's birthday. My birthday was yesterday so she took me home on her birthday. Hard to do anything when you zone out for 5 minutes.
3 good things today:  1. Had a good talk with my coach  2. Started doing morning pages today. I'm dreading it tomorrow, even though it went fairly smooth!  3. Did all my new morning routine steps, aside from going for a walk! Yay!  ACCOMPLISHMENT: shopping  VALUE PROVIDED: Got mom in law (and her doggie) presents! ♥️
Hello RAOA! I haven’t been around here in a long time but I’m back! I just did a re-intro post lol
Hi guys. Been radio silent today. I might have mentioned I’m not feeling well lately. I got admitted to the hospital for it. I’m getting poked and prodded and scanned. Currently have an IV in, a monitor on my finger, and Coban in two locations.plus a couple of nice looking bruises. Woohoo!
Good morning, everyone!  Still feeling pretty worthless from last night. I'm gunna try and be productive today. We'll see. I feel like I'm drowning.   I hope you're having a good day!!
Good morning! We support our local food bank all year because no one should go hungry. We also support One Tree Planted and Team Trees (good for planet earth!).
Oooh I got in early today! I scored an interview for later in the week, put in a couple of job applications and got recommended internally for a job at a company I really want to look for! Psht blue monday got nothing on me!  QOTD - I support lots of mental health, autism and scientific research based charities, but my favourite to support right now is St Peters Hospice. Its a very specific local charity down in the south of England but they took care of my aunt when she had terminal cancer. When she wasnt in the hospice for treatment adjustment, I went in every day to keep her company last summer. We went to SPH charity shop a lot because it was her favourite and most important to her to support.  I love this question because I love charities. For our wedding we've asked our families to donate to whatever charity makes them think of us and send us a card to let us know who we helped.
Spam caller just woke me up.  And I have the same almost headache feeling I had yesterday minutes after I got up.  Drinking some vitamin water, I am hoping That will help.  QOTD so many charities...my undergrad alma mater, Marine Corp Toys for Tots, the Volunteer Fireman’s Home in Hudson, NY
Hope everyone is doing well :) I'm feeling quite productive today. And by productive, I mean increasing my procrastination efforts
QotD - I support a wide variety of charities including those for medical research, food pantries, child trafficking, and animal care. In honor of Betty White's 99th birthday yesterday, I bought a few things off the wishlist of a local zoo.   We got out a bit yesterday and went for a drive. Found a parking spot that overlooks the cityscape. My cousin stopped by so we chatted outside, masked, at a distance. That was a nice surprise.   I have difficulty talking myself up and am struggling through cover letters to accompany job applications. In the meantime, I need to contact that HR manager again and see if the company's recruiter would like to acknowledge her error (and cover-up) which potentially cost me employment with them. I don't put up with liars.  I've got more work to do around the house and to gather our weekly donations for a resale shop.
I support charity: water because they do great work, and all public donations go straight to the field. I've done a lot of volunteer work with them in the past (in the office or at events, not in the field) and they're a really fantastic organization. I also support Planned Parenthood and the ACLU because I think access to healthcare and basic human rights are pretty neat. I'd support more financially but I don't earn much, so those three are my go-tos.
Qotd : local animal rescues; and houseless people resources, because animals don’t have voices or many laws protecting them; because I was houseless, I understand the situations.
Good morning. It's Monday and I feel blah. I've been watching tutorials on how to run a dungeons and dragons game on roll 20. It seems so complicated and can't be used on a tablet and I don't have a computer.... yet. I will be getting one in the next couple of months.  I miss playing dnd with my friends.   What do you miss doing?  Have a wonderful day.
Putting in those holiday hours 😎
I'm cooking chicken paprikash for my roommates and me.  I took a walk yesterday and received a lovely gift, and am just trying to push through the funk until my family is here.   I played Carcassonne with one of my roommates last night and watched the new James Herriott special.   I made a meme that amuses me greatly.  I just wish there was one magical thing I could do to feel better.    &#x200B;  These days I'm a big fan of Tickets for Veterans.  I just want to see these gals and guys have some joy.
Good morning! I had to wake up at 7a.m. for class today, too early for me :'D  I think today I'm going to try getting some art done, last time I finished something was a week ago ;; Or play Mabinogi since I've finally been working on the story quests after many years  *Might* also be dyeing part of my hair red today, still questioning if it's a good idea since I have black hair so the colour probably won't show well. I still kind of like my blonde streaks, even though it's been awhile/not as visible anymore 😅
Starting a new eating plan today...no sugar...no flour.   Wish me luck!  QOTD:  I support the local children’s hospital, cause my youngest kiddo was a NICU baby. I also support Wounded Warrior and Autism Now because I’m both an Army Mom and Autusm Mom.   Basically, my charitable donations revolve around my kids. lol
QOTD: I support a child abuse intervention center in my home town. It is a rural and poor area that receives very little federal or state funding for anything. I am fortunate to have a wonderful family, but I grew up surrounded by people in extremely unfortunate circumstances.
QotD: Donors Choose and No Kid Hungry. Living in a Title I school area and having several educators in the family I love to support education initiatives. I also learned that so many kids are food insecure and it breaks my heart that I can't feed them all so I tend to give to No Kid Hungry to help that mission.
I just woke up from a nap and it’s almost noon. Oh my gosh I was up very too early this morning.
Everyone please help me with my homework, I’ll love you if you do   Which industries have not been impacted by the pandemic?
I’m finally back at work. Kinda annoyed that we don’t get MLK day as one of our holidays but whatever. It feels good the be back.
Hi all! I hope you are all having a wonderful and enjoyable day! I'm about to go to the chiropractor and I'm so excited!
Hi yall! Hoping to be around more again soon. Hope everyone is having a great day!
Hi everyone! It’s been way too long. Things have been a little bit nuts, but I’m hoping everything will calm down soon. Hubby graduated college in November, then we sold our house and had to move in with my parents right before Christmas. Now we’re just waiting to close on our new house. Hopefully it goes well and we are on our own again soon. The kids have had some trouble adjusting to the new living arrangement, so that’s always fun /s
Hello! This is my first daily thread post! I am so excited to be a part of this group and I cannot wait to send some super awesome surprises to people! ☺️
Just finished an MLK Day self guided interpretive trail with the fam. QOTD: mostly homeless and veterans charities.
It’s is 70-80 degrees here in California, in the month of January, WTF?!?!? 😡
I love my friends. I was just scrolling through fb and a marketplace ad happened to pop up. It was for some old bondage stuff. I sent it to my friend because the pic was a whip and an old gorilla mask and a bag that looked like it was full of old hard bread, thought she would find it funny. She did.   What does she do? She’s curious what’s in the bag.  So she contacts this lady, lady says she doesn’t know what’s it in bc it’s from an estate. So my buddy  has now spent 5 bucks to find out what was in the bag. It gets better.   She now currently has a giant Rubbermaid tub in her trunk. We were expecting a small box or a bag. No. HUGE tub.   I’m now waiting for her to get home from the gym to open this stuff so we can finally quench our curiosity 😂😂  Pretty sure she just bought grandmas dirty fun tub that she kept secret from everyone.   Will update 👀  Update: what was in the box. An Indiana Jones style whip, gorilla mask, tons of ace bandages, cool leather cuffs with spikes all over them, suspenders, some fluffy stuff on a Stick possible make shift duster?, a leather paddle whip, ski gloves, and a vintage bdsm manual.     We did a video chat and it was hilarious. Yes she wore gloves digging into the bin lol.
QotD: I'm not personally in a place to support any charities at the moment, but my 2021 goal is to list a new fundraiser on my Facebook once a week. This week it's the National Children's Advocacy Center, while last week I posted a fundraiser for the DC Coalition for the Homeless, the week before that was the Transgender Law Center, and the week before that was the PMC Winter Cycle. I tend to base my weekly fundraiser link around things that have happened in the world or in my personal life (plus their Charity Navigator score). In the past I've personally donated to HIAS, the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, RAINN, and a handful of small, local fundraisers for things like medical bills, funerary costs, and the ilk.  Does anybody know of any affordable retailers who sell rings for small fingers? I'm tired and want to buy a ring, but I've got hands like E.T.
My Spiggen phone case cracked, and the Trianium replacement I got is much heavier.
How was your Monday? I spent the day stuttering and stammering and then er to rule out stroke. I got a gazillion (exaggerating) wires out of me. I just wanna go home. Of course not stuttering when admitting so they don't really believe me.
I had nice thrift day today. I found two really nice sweaters, one was vintage. I have to wait to wear them because the new washer isn't here yet. Hopefully it'll be here this week. Its been a while and my pile of laundry is growing.  I also visited a fairly mally mall. It still had one of its fountains and a decent amount of neon.  QotD: homeless parrots , I feel bad that so many of them get rehomed so much. Also anything where I get to grab toys and things for kids, they deserve to have fun and what they need  edit: I can't  spell.
My day at work went quick, but there is a labour dispute downstream and it may mean no work tomorrow.   As much as I would prefer to be home during this lockdown, this isn't how I want it to be.  QOTD:  I support a few:  SNAP for Cats is a local spay and neuter organization for feral cat colonies.  It was through them that I got the two cats I have; the MS Society of Canada because Canada has the highest per capita cases of MS in the world; and the Downtown Mission, a shelter/soup kitchen/pantry and so much more for the homeless people here, I had an uncle who was not homeless but felt most at home with the people there and it holds a special place in my heart.
I've had a weird day. I don't like having a day off in the middle of the week. I keep getting interrupted by people I normally work with.   QOTD: A local food bank and wound warriors foundation. I've seen both have a wonderful impact.
Had a three day weekend and absolutely loved it. I spent the day playing lego jurassic Park so I'm kinda loving the lazy day off.
QOTD: I support the American alpine club, they keep climbing crags clean and safe, and provide lessons and safety information to anyone who needs them. They replace bolts and anchors and keep the outdoors just a better place for everyone. I also support the world wildlife foundation, for obvious reasons. The world is too beautiful to not keep it that way for everyone to enjoy.
My favourite hockey team is doing really well and I’m not used to it lol.   I had a good day walking and food wise. I also put new sheets on my bed that I got for Christmas.   I support quite a few charities but the ones I donate to the most are The shelter my cats were adopted from The food bank and homeless shelters  Rainbow Railroad that helps LGBTQI+ people escape from persecution
I posted here already but the timings are all out with me being in the U.K. and I’m sad. Today would’ve been my aunts 67th birthday. I helped with her palliative care last summer and it was awful to see her suffer but I went in every day with a smile and a goal to make her smile. One time I even made her laugh. I just needed a space away from the direct grief of my family to process these emotions, so thanks for this space. I am being cuddled by two of my cats so I’m okay. Her last gift to me was a love of cryptic crosswords, so I think I’ll spend the day doing that.
🎶 Take my love, take my land  Take me where I cannot stand  I don't care, I'm still free  You can't take the sky from me 🎶   Always love for Firefly ❤️🎶❤️  Today is the last day of celebration weekend day 3 😉 which is 🥳🥳.   I’m going stop at this age and be 21 forever , okay ? 🥸🙃  simply thank you 🎈 🎈   *haha, just noting — I’m not turning 21, I just think that is a good forever age*
💃

*dancing virtually with everyone*  u/overlyapologeticguy, *drop the beat*  🧁🎉🧁
These are all amazing causes, Billy. I think the husband's smile goes to Wounded Warrior as well! :)
The 22 project is an awesome organization. I had a bad experience with wounded warrior. They aren’t looked upon to highly by many veterans that are what we call the walking wounded but I heard they do great things for those that have serious injuries from the military.
❤️
Wholesome  No, but really, those are some great causes.
u/OverlyApologeticGuy happy birthday, Robert!!! <3  u/supermarvelous310 happy birthday, terii!!! <3

You're so sweet and wholesome :-) I'm doing pretty good, just enjoying my third lazy day in a row and watching Impractical Jokers. How about you?
Not the best today unfortunately. Overnight my little bird’s tumor doubled in size, and getting an appointment with the avian vet is a struggle when they’re only there three days a week and all booked 😞. He’s happy and chirping right now, but I feel so bad for him!
Love you, friend!! Still not in a good place so I’m going to take the day off from the world! Be back!! Until then, carry on loving!!! ❤️❤️❤️
u/alopez1592 u/ognicat
Hey guys!! Will you all keep my big booty boy in your thoughts please? He started limping out of nowhere and it’s pretty bad 😭😭😭 I gave him a doggy pain med but I don’t think it’s helping much
I'm so so so sorry. ): Sending massive hugs and good vibes
I'm so sorry about that you were let go :/ and yes, allow yourself to be sad! It can be really important to grieve the loss of something good. I'm hoping and praying for a better opportunity to come out of this for you.
That stings.  I got let go from a job last year after only 2 weeks.  They decided that they needed someone with more skills than i had.  I was perfectly qualified for the job i interviewed for  and was given but it turned out that they needed someone more advanced.  I cried for half the day after that.
You can definitely be sad.  I'll be sad with you if you need company!  I'm glad you have something to fall back on and hope you have something new to be excited about soon!
Welcome! It's always hard to break the ice but you did it! Congrats!
[deleted]
Welcome and thanks for sharing! Those are great orgs to support! 💛
I'm a big fan of St. Jude.  They're local to me.  Sometimes in the past I would go down there to donate platelets.  I haven't in a couple years (even before covid) due to always having a high heart rate.
Ooohhhh that sounds amazing!
Yuuum!
ooh amazing! 🌸
Those sound like fun topics!
I hope you have a good day too! 💕
Good morning and same to you! 😊💚
That's awesome! I am so in awe of the incredible things Doctors Without Borders have done in the world; that organization was such a brilliant idea, and our world is a better place because of it!  Thanks also for your support of local SPCA's and food banks. If you don't mind me asking, why those specifically? Obviously San Francisco and Oregon are in two different places, so they're not both local to you; why did you pick those specific locales?
You got this!!!!!!! Go you!!!!
oh my gosh! #vanlife is 100% goals!!
I’d love to hear more about your yoga journey!  I’ve always wanted to try but I am the least flexible person on the planet.
Good luck with your van shopping!
That's awesome! Thank you for all you do!
Good morning! I'm glad you're getting to enjoy a lazy morning :).
I didn't realize TWLOHA was still around! I had a few tshirts of theirs in high school; they do some amazing work ❤️
Oh crap, you just reminded me I did not put that last load in the dryer last night 🤦🏻‍♀️
❤️
I'm terrible about doing dishes at night after dinner, but it's always so nice in the morning when you wake up to a clean kitchen.
We gotta do the same for laundry
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!!
Aw hopefully you can get some rest 💕
I hope you have a good day!💕
I hope you do to!!!!!
Same to you! I see your birthday is coming up. Anything fun planned? 😊💚
Have a wonderful day!
Sweet potatoes are delicious 😋
I love sweet potatoes!!!!!
Hope you feel better soon.
Feel better soon! I hate being dizzy. How’s your blood pressure?
I hope you feel better soon! 💕
Oh I'm so sorry to hear you aren't feeling well! Did you eat a little something? Take care and hope you get to feeling better soon.  Hugs
Are you ok?
Youtube is full of videos with great instapot recipes
how heinous!
Join the Facebook group, especially if you're new to the Instant Pot. It's been a lot of help for me!  I love making chili and soups in it because they taste as if they've cooked all day, when it's been maybe an hour!
Kind of you to give back your support!
I got a new squishmallow today and it’s so soft and cuddly!! (I also have a weird obsession with punching it and then immediately apologizing???)
I hope you feel better!
well hello :)   I tried making butter cookies with my mom today but instead of normal sugar we used Splenda and it doesn’t taste good lmfaoo!! We made like two dozens of these 😭😭😭 and I tried practicing cause I want to bake some and send my bf a few for Valentine’s Day since we’re long distance. Might give up on that idea now. Not talented at this !!  But what about you? What have you been doing? Do you need to talk? Tell me something nice that happened to you today!!! Even if it was small
Aww you tell life that it better start treating you better or it'll have to deal with me!  I made some pistachio encrusted chicken for dinner and it was **amazing**. I'll probably have some neopolitan ice cream soon
What’s happenin, kitty cat? I’m binge watching a show called In The Dark. I love it. Today I had 5 hour break from work, the incense shop was closed which was annoying because I needed some cones, but the book store was open and I found a few books I liked, then I went to the food co op and got some bananas from Ecuador, which are my fav bananas. Hmm. Oh then I went to the duck pond and fed the Canada geese. I love them so much. I told one of them if she jumped in the car she could sleep in the bathtub and fly free in the day time. Sadly she did not comply 😂
Hi there my friend what's going on? I had a pretty crummy day yesterday but I got 8 hour sleep and I was full of energy and I did my meal prep and some cleaning and I took a shower so I had a pretty busy day what's going on in your world? Come over here give me a hug sit right down and let's talk🧸
Hey friend! I’m sorry you’re having a month... f***ing winter.   I didn’t do a darn thing all weekend. Tried ice-fishing with the hubs every single day, not a single bite. Not too thrilling (although that peace & quiet was sweet).  Came home to find the dog left a puddle on her bed, and now I just found another suspicious wet spot on the floor 🥺 She’s old (for a big dog), has skin cancer that we’re worried has mets’ed, and hasn’t been pooping well lately either... yeah. Little worried about what this is. I guess it’s time for a vet visit.  What’s new in your worlds?
https://imgur.com/gallery/zxrBIzT   I’m a little frustrated myself. It’s exhausting.   https://imgur.com/gallery/6uhOj0f  I was really counting on that stimulus and it never came. 😭
I love this. It’s been rough. I like, really need some mental healthcare but I have no insurance, so, to quote my favorite movie in its r-rated fashion, “fuck me, right?” Hahaha. I hate you’re suffering, too, in your own way.
Hello ! Let's do this! Everyone needs a cheer up and what are friends for!
Sending many positive thoughts your way! I like the idea of putting the hard times aside for a bit. I just finished my morning journaling, which was nice. And I got a good sleep!

That is adorable! I work from home at the moment due to the pandemic. Being able to see my kids more has been so nice. I dread having to go to the office full time again.
Awe. That's sweet
Aw that’s so sweet! My daughter isn’t a cuddler at all, so when she randomly wants to snuggle I cherish it. 😭
I love animal rehabilitation places that release back in the wild if they can
Enjoy your time off! I hope there's no goose attacks!
Hey there hope you are having a good day! Glad you got to sleep in today you deserve it. Why so many clocks? Don't you dislike cleaning out the vacuum? It's one of my least favorite jobs along with the cat box! I have been working on a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle for several days and it steals my time away from me. lol I'm trying to slowly clean out different areas like closets of my house. I have accumulated so much stuff over twenty one years of being here! I would really like to become a minimalist. Have a lovely day and give Mr. JJ a big hug from me. 🤗
Sending hugs right back at you!!! I hope you have a lovely day!!!
Hugs right back to you! I hope your day is wonderful. 💚💚
Hugs back to you, hope your Monday goes good! ☺️
I hope you have a good day!!!
Good afternoon! You have a busy day planned! Hope it goes well for you. Have a lovely day and don't forget to hydrate.
You can come help me clean! lol There is always something that needs cleaned at my house because I have three big dogs and a cat in the house! But I love them all and wouldn't change a thing. 🐶🐶🐶🐱
Oh no! Hope your okay! Sorry to hear you have a kidney stone those are very painful I understand!! Feel better soon!  Happy cake day!! 🎂
That’s really sweet.
Thanks for participating !!! I hope you have a wonderful day!
I don't blame you one bit. I never see the point to getting new things like furniture or rugs, because the dogs are just gonna destroy it the moment it gets inside the house. 😆
If you ever get to the place where you need a new one, rugsusa and boutique rugs are pretty affordable for rugs (which are crazy expensive) and I think the quality is pretty good.
Omg yum 😍
that sounds amazing! 🌸💗
Man, I was just about to post asking if today was a tough day for anyone else. I am feeling it too. I'm trying to soak away all the tough things with a bath..
Hey!  I'm doing ok, other than some back pain and a headache.
Happy birthday!
Because I've been binge-watching "30 Rock" I just read your post switching from Tracy Morgan's voice to Alec Baldwin's to Tina Fey's. That's normal, right?  Have a great day! (my voice)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY THO
I hope not, I dreamed I went back to school in my hometown and they wouldn’t let me have the day off for my wedding!
Oh I gave a few bucks to fuck cancer. A little more than I intended but definitely a good cause 😂 so I wasn't too upset
What exactly are the advantages of a bullet journal? I always hear people excited about them but I don’t really get it haha
I wish it was nap time.   Having an organized work space is so nice! I hope everyone keeps it clean
🥃, I’ll send you a video ❤️👀
Yes it can be an ammuno condition
You matter!💕
I hope you enjoy your day off!
Enjoy your day off! 😊
Thank you for helping provide young people with opportunities for their education! What you do matters!
You too!
Hope you have a super quiet day!
Hooray for teeth cleaning!
Thank you for supporting both of these! It is tragic how many lives cancer has taken from the world, and my heart breaks to think of all the joy and wonder those people could be bringing into the world if they were still here.
I hope you have a good day!!!!!
I hope you take those as compliments, as annoying and inappropriate as they are.  You obviously look amazing :)  I would simply say “thank you” and change the subject or say “why do you ask” when they ask your age.  Put them on the spot.  Maybe they’ll realize how inappropriate it is.   Have a great day!
The selfie Sundays are my favorite too. I look forward to it every week.
Hey there hope you got your errands done. Not much going on here I slept late 11. I have had breakfast and two cups of hot tea and still dragging. Just catching up on here and making cards to go out. Not very exciting I know! Hanging out with my fur baby's.
Thank you for supporting local organizations! It's much harder for them to stay afloat than the big national foundations, and I'm sure the pandemic has taken a real toll on them, so your donations are definitely making a difference!
I need coffee too! I hope you got yours
I'm sorry your not sleeping well! I usually just drink hot tea when I'm not feeling well. Don't eat much then. Please get to feeling better soon.
Mmmm I could go for a quesadilla
What are you going to school for? Congrats on finishing your essay!
What did you do?!
Yum! I'm sure it will turn out great!
I love my instapot. Potato soup is my favorite!
That sounds tasty
Oh no. Have you been exposed to them?
Oh no!!! Crossing my fingers for all of you!
Sending massive hugs!!!
That's amazing!!!!
I'm glad the nurse didn't stab you a bunch this time and actually listened to you.
Awwww yay!!!
I now support this too, I didn’t know there was a charity for this till now tho
Oh no!  I hope you don't get withdrawal symptoms, or at least that they're not too bad.
I. Freaking. Can’t. Fall. Asleep!!!! Gaaaahhhhh!!! lol we should’ve just kept chatting earlier! I could’ve sworn I’d be asleep so many hours ago though. Dang it!! lol
Congratulations! Are you doing anything special?
Nice! Did you do anything special?
Wow, that's intense!
😳 omg... hey if you ever need to talk, I’m always here for you... I’m really really sorry you’re going through this. Sending you a massive hug
Happy belated birthday!!! 🤗🤗🤗
Sounds like a good day all in all 😊👏👏👏
Welcome back
Ooph, that's not a fun day. Here's hoping to good results, and feel free to DM me know if you need a buddy to chat with and keep you company.
💕don't be too hard on yourself
You are not worthless.
I will echo u/lameoldperson, YOU ARE NOT WORTHLESS  I hope things start looking up for you soon 💗
I’m sorry you’re feeling bad. You’re definitely not worthless. I’m here if you need to chat ❤️
You have a lot of worth, please always try to remember that! Even when it’s hard. You’re special and important and you’ll get through this. 💕
I'm feeling the same way today.  If you want to talk, feel free to message me!
Oh and cat charities! Forgot those!
Good morning. Here's a pinch to get you moving.
Try lorel high light color it’s designed for dark hair and the reds have a purple undertone and no need to bleach. Try with the ion 30 sensitive developer to dye your hair
Good luck, that’s awesome!
It is so sad that our society has those problems, but I am so grateful for people like you doing what you can to help! People in small communities like that are often overlooked by "the system," so thank you for supporting an organization that is there to help them!
Thank you for supporting both of these! As a teacher, one of the things I've found hardest about teaching remotely for almost a year now is knowing the difficult home situations so many of my students are dealing with; many kids across our nation are dependent on schools for daily meals, and even with efforts by schools to still provide that, many are seriously struggling.
Construction. Which is what I do.
a handful of e-commerce businesses like amazon. (Was able to get a job there in the middle of the pandemic)
Possibly liquor stores. Well they might had a bit of boast.jk. Really, in our state they couldn't close out of fear people would go through withdraw for going sober. True.
Impacted in what way?    I ask because you could say the police force/firehouses/EMTs aren’t impacted in terms of layoffs like other industries, but they’ve been impacted in terms of risk to their health at work.
I work for a bank call center and we don't even get bank holidays off :/ it's fucking dumb
Oh hope you are feeling okay! I use to work for a chiropractor a long time ago!
Congrats on contributing and finding the sub! I hope you feel welcome here!
Welcome!  💛
Bruh imma be real, that sounds lovely right now. I miss warm weather.
Ikr?! Which part of California are you in?
Have to say I am kind of curious and kind of scarred to find out what your friend bought.
Have to say I am very curious!!
I kind of want an update on the contents.
so funny, but also eww, used bdsm stuff, lol
So sorry, i hope it gets better.
Oh my goodness, your comment about the mall took me back to all sorts of nostalgia!
Aww, I loved Lego Jurassic Park. I think my favorite Lego was probably Lego Incredibles. Sooooo cute!
I’ve never heard of the rainbow railroad before!
Sending love your way
Sending hugs hugs x
Well that sounds just shiny!
🕺
WWP had a couple really big problems a few years back, but they've also worked on fixing those problems.  While they're still not perfect they have made pretty [big strides](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/08/09/after-public-crisis-and-fall-grace-wounded-warrior-project-quietly-regains-ground.html)
Thank you!!!
Made a wish 💫! Thank you ❤️
I'm okay!! How are you?
I'm doing well, how about you?
I just got your gift so I am doing fantastic!!! Please be patient as I simply must make a cute thank you post before I can officially thank you 😃😃😃
I'm doing well, my friend! Impatiently waiting for work to be over, and then going home to do some chores and cook dinner 😁 how are you? Did you have a nice weekend?
That's probably  in my top 3 favorite shows. I love them guys.
I’m on my third lazy day in a row as well!! It’s been awesome!!
Aww poor little guy! Hopefully they can see him so he can start feeling better real soon!
Sending you and little bird lots of love and positive thoughts ❤️❤️
I'm sending you lots of love and light! I hope things start looking up for you really soon!
Chin up!! You got this!!
Sending you hugs and love!!
Thank you ❤
Thank you so much ❤
Yeah im feeling real shitty. I worked for two days.
Thank you! It's very appreciated.
It was a poor attempt 😔
People say that about alot of thing... OwO
High heart rate is okay if you dont let your emotions run wild i learned that
Right? These kids are so smart
Thank you so much 💖
Thank you so much 💛💛💛
Former San Franciscan, current Oregonian.
Thank you!!! <33
Me too.  I'm afraid I'd hurt something.  I might have you beat for least flexible but I am the most clumsy... maybe those two things are related for me.  Hmmm.
Oh yea! My AmazonSmile goes to them and I love seeing what they're up to!
I hate when that happens!
❤️❤️❤️
So true! I'm also usually terrible at it. 🤣
Thank you friend!
Thank you so much!
I should probably edit for wording I guess LOL....I meant I got 9 hrs of sleep every night for the last 3 nights 😴
Thank you friend!
Thank you! :)
Thank you! And yes! Haha. Nothing big really. We will prob order takeout from somewhere, hopefully red lobster, lol. But that’s all I know of right now really. I know I’m having a zoom call with my mom and grandma that day too. But it should be a pretty chill day! :) Thanks for asking!
Thank you! :)
So true! And such a filling meal!
Me freaking too!
thank you! 🌸
aww thank you! i think it is getting normal again, it was lower earlier but now everything seems to be slightly better now! 🌸💗
thank you!! 💗💗
Ooh thanks!
Right? What a jerk. xD
Ohh I'll have to do that! I'm very new to it haha. I've never even seen one in person, before today.
Things that are super cute often give me the urge to harm them too 👀 I tell my dog that I'm going to squish him to death all the time
😳👀 hahahaa you crack me up! I wanna see the squishy!!
I’m obsessed with squishmallows too. Ugh I could have a mountain of them and it wouldn’t be enough.
I love that so much
Thank you!! Stay and chat w us! It’s really helping!
Oh staaaap!! I’m sure you’re a WONDERFUL baker! That’s awesome that you decided to try Splenda instead of regular sugar! Hey, you gotta take chances, right? Sorry to hear they didn’t turn out so great but I’m sure I’d probably love them 😂 I love all things sweet!   The best thing that happened to me today was receiving u/purpleteasoul’s gift & a beautiful pop up card! Otherwise the day has been a dud! Currently trying really really hard not to freak out bc Big Booty here started limping & I just noticed his exposed dew claw quick is infected on the side he’s not limping!
Oh man! Bummer on the cookies! What a sweet idea to want to send your bf some....
YEA!! YOU GET ‘EM PSYCHOLOGICALPENGUIN!! Get ‘em for over a decade of crappiness!! ❤️❤️❤️  Dang!! Pistachio encrusted chicken sounds delicious!! And don’t get me started on neopolitan ice cream!! Ugh sooooo gooooood!
Oooooooh that sounds delightful. All of it.
That sounds so good! I need to try that! Uggghhh yum!
😂😂 I’m sure she regretted that decision instantly! 😂😂  What genre is In The Dark?   Wow what a super productive day!! ❤️❤️❤️ loved reading about it!!
Awwww I’m sorry the goose didn’t cooperate. Although, I’ve heard they can be real jerks so maybe it’s for the best 😂🤷🏻‍♀️
Huuuuuuuuuuuug!!! [pause] (sighs) huuuuuuuuuuug!!!!   I’m just really not in a good place emotionally mentally and physically! Makes me want to just break things and scream!!
Holy cow!! Ice fishing?! That sounds sooo cool yet so freaking scary (for me) at the same time!!   😣😢😢😢 I’m so sorry to hear about your pup! Big dogs are so heartbreaking to have bc they leave us too early but love us so big!! Please let me know what the vet says! I’m about to have to make a trip myself if Big Booty here keeps limping!
I LOVED THE HEDGEHOGS! So adorable!
Oh mannnnnn thank you so much for sharing those links!!! Really made me smile!! ❤️❤️  I’m so sorry that you haven’t gotten your stimulus yet! It’ll come!! Mine and my parents haven’t arrived either 😕
You know, someone actually passed on some really cool resources for me for mental health bc mine is so shitty! Lemme see where I put it!!
Try BetterHelp.com/thoughtfulhuman !! I think that’s the link! The other one expired apparently
LOL omg I was JUST saying good night LOL!! Where ya been?! Omg why’d I get so many downvotes??
That’s awesome!! I haven’t journaled in a while now! Hmm come to think of it, I don’t even remember which journal I was writing in LOL
Hey! I was busy for a while. What would you like to chat about?
giving you a hug, you deserve it and so so much more! 💗 do you have any plans for tonight? i am currently trying to find a good recipe for a mug cake and hoping that it turns out decent 🍰🌸 have you ever made a mug cake before?
I just did! Ha!
I didn’t even see this from you!! But I’m glad we had our chat tonight!! ❤️❤️❤️
u/gdarn16 and I were just saying that the other day!!
Hugs im trying to find gluten-free snacks that I can make cos my stuff is expensive . Why not get some bored baking in and coffee right
I do too! There are definitely times I would like to be in the office and see the people I work with again but I like so many things about working from home and spending more time with the kids is definitely one of them
My older son is 9 and every once in a while he'll still want to snuggle and I LOVE it when that happens!
I hit send too fast 😂 theres more now. Yea, our bear rescue is phenomenal. Limiting human interaction is a huge aspect of what they do to ensure they’re releasable. The sanctuaries I listed give the animals who cannot be released the home they deserve. ADI specifically will drop into a location (overseas) to confiscate abused wildlife, which is why I call them the A Team.
Hahaha
I love cleaning out the vacuum cleaner I guess it's one of those sick mental things of seeing how much dirt really comes up lol and I have that many alarm clocks because I'm afraid if the electric goes out or if the battery dies in 1 or if my phone company Verizon goes down that I will always have a backup somewhere lol    You sound like me after burying my mother and my grandmother and then having to go to their apartment and clean out 40 years worth of stuff I said never again so I like to live as simple as I can and sometimes less is more. I get a little crazy when things get very crowded
Thank you! I hope the same for you!
Thank you! I hope you have a lovely day too!
Lol. I have a dog that borders on the Yeti when he hasn't been groomed. Cleaning his food and water bowl holder was the hardest part of cleaning yesterday. I don't know where all the hair came from!
Just died of embarrassment. There wasn’t even any paint transfer, just a minor bump. I’m lucky the woman I was buying from didn’t freak out on me. Garage door still worked fine. I don’t have a good track record with garage doors. I destroyed my parents reversing, and left permanent damage on my old car too. Sorry I’ve written a wall of text about this.
Thank you, I hope your day is great as well!
Right!!! And the cat! The darn thing thinks EVERYTHING is a scratching post!
Ohhh thank you!
It was 😋
It was! :-)
That's a good idea. baths are always soothing for bad days.
I hope your back and head feel better soon!
It’s a way to track everything and journal what your feeling. It’s very helpful with behavioral/mental health issues. Then you can also set up for school needs. It’s good to see in advance what one needs to study for and when tests are due as well as papers. I use track my anxiety/panic and ptsd moments for therapy
Thanks girl!
Thank you!
It's totally selfish,  investing in our youth is buying stock in a better world🌎💛
Thanks
🤞 we'll see
Yep twice a year for me.
Thank you I hope you as well 😊
It's older men that always make comments about my age. It makes me feel uncomfortbale 😖 I want them know its inappropriate instead of complying (I think that's the word). But I will try what you advised, I hope they will stop it! Thanks for the advice and I hope you had a great day as well!
I did!  Thanks. They turned out to go quickly which is nice.  I hibernate most of the winter so I’m always happy to get back home quickly
I agree! That’s why I go local. I used to volunteer my time a lot, too but life got super busy then the pandemic hit. I’ll be back when I can!
I did! I hope you do, too!
Thank you ♥ ♥
I'm studying to be a Primary Teacher - this will be my second placement and I'm super excited as my first placement was so much fun. It's all online learning at the moment so will be very interesting to see how that is handled but I definitely hope the schools will re-open so that I get a chance to do it in person.
It was nothing bad. I just feel stupid. XD
Ooh. That was my second choice, but dad voted chicken noodle.
Ty it actually was pretty tasty surprisingly
Yep!
Thank youuuu
Thank you♡
Thank you! I have also recently donated to a charity that provides travel bags with goodies (stuffed animals, blankets, etc.) to foster kids, so that they are not carrying their belongings with trash bags 😊
I know! It was awful being apart. I've never had such a long hug where neither person wanted to let go
I'm glad I should shed light on it! ♥
Darn!
Thank you!!! Npt this year haha, we wanted to but bc of covid and since we’re rly broke rn we just hung out at a dog park and shopped at half price books a lil. It was a good day tho.
Thank you!!! Npt this year haha, we wanted to but bc of covid and since we’re rly broke rn we just hung out at a dog park and shopped at half price books a lil. It was a good day tho.
Thank you!
I'm trying, but it's hard.
You. Are. Not. Worthless.
Half of my brain knows that, and the other is like nah, you're stupid.
Thank you. I appreciate that a lot.
Thank you. I appreciate you more than you know
Thank you. I appreciate that a lot.
Sending hugs! Same to you!!
ooh I'll check that, thanks!
Thanks!!!
They are very much overlooked. I will never understand how anyone but especially children are unable to get help they desperately need. I wish I could do more. One perk of my job is they match donations. Every time I donate, the amount is 100% matched by my work so that is pretty awesome.
I never realized how pervasive it was until The Little started school. Thankfully, our area gets grants to keep feeding kids over the summer and other school breaks. I'm pretty sure that for some of these kids the ONLY food they get is what comes from school. Many don't have transportation so I really wonder how they're getting fed now that many of them are doing distance learning. The schools are still providing food for the distance kids but they have to go pick it up.
I should clarify, impacted meaning they had to stop/end working since March 2020
Wow that sucks
Just some back pain from a labor intensive job!
Thank you ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you!
As much as a lot of California’s love the warm weather, this shouldn’t be happening during this time.  We really didn’t have “winter weather” in November and December, and it looks like January as well. This warm weather plus it being really windy outside, puts California in fire danger watch
Bay Area. It hit me last Wednesday when I went to go outside for lunch. I was like “How in the hell is it 70 outside in downtown SF?”
I’m in the same boat. Curious but would have been more than fine scrolling by the ad and forgetting about it lol.
Just added an update
I added one!
That’s what I thought too. But she couldn’t resist buying it to see what was in there LOL
Thanks me too. Gotta schedule a nuero mri
Malls always used to seem so magical. Especially when there were actual specialty store, special events, fountains!  Everything is just slight variations on the same theme now.
Thank you :)
That’s good
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
I’m good! How was your weekend!
I’m good!! How was your weekend??
It was an amazing thank you post ❤️❤️
What are you doing for din!? And I did have a nice weekend! Very relaxing!!
Yes!! It's so great!
Thank you! 💜
Thank you so much ☺️
Thank you so much for that!! ❤️❤️❤️ I hope things start looking up really soon, too! lol until then, LOVE ON!
Gahhhhh gdarn!! I don’t got this!!! My Big Booty is limping and it’s taking precedence (naturally)! It’s freaking me out that I don’t know why he’s hurting! 😭😭
Soaking up all the hugs and love!!
🧡
It was great!You did a good job! What do you like about the group?
Good to know.
So try limiting your emotions and see if it helps
Me too. It happens more often than I'd like, lol.
Haha oh wow, well that is awesome then!
Whatever you do, I hope it's a great day for you! 💚💚
I’m glad. Take care of yourself ❤️
It is super helpful!! It's an official instant pot group. I had mine and only used it a handful of times over almost two years 😅 then I joined that group and I've started using it at least twice a week, if not more.
Lmao I find myself refraining from telling a friend her daughter is so damn adorable I just wanna smother her little face w hugs!! Just sounds a little morbid but she’s soooo cute!!
Ask and you shall receive! [my hamster squishmallow ](https://imgur.com/gallery/bV3bs5R) I got because my hammie passed on a few days ago
I went to Costco recently and it took everything in my power not to buy the huge ones 😅
I love squishmallows! I have so many! I thought my collection was big but my friends have so many more! I need so many!
I'd love to join!!
I'll beat up your life if I have to!!   It was amazing, the pistachios brought a depth of flavor to it that was just mouth watering. I also seasoned it with some olive oil, salt, thyme, and lemon pepper 😋😋😋😋 Neopolitan is awesome, but I wish there was a version without strawberry sometimes 👀
And I had some leftover Greek pasta salad :-)
Yes you do!
Uhh,  maybe a drama? I’m not sure. Blind girl living in Chicago, and I’ll spoil it if I keep talking.
There’s a Chinese white goose there that attacked me a few weeks ago. He’s a total bastard but when he starts coming I get in the car 😂
I'm sorry to hear that but what we need to do is teach you different techniques because 1A hear about somebody who wants to break things that this that make Me sad😓    we have to learn how to channel our energy differently,  much like maybe counting to 10 or what I find when I'm at work and I get stressed out I usually count on my fingers and I sing a song in my head.   Whatever is going on you need to figure out what is a priority in your life and what really doesn't matter and will not matter a week from now and focus on that .   I'm always here to talk in my mailbox is open for you and anyone else, hugs to you sweetie, I will pray that you get a good night's sleep and to morrow you wake up doing something positive🥰
It was cool (literally 🥶 lol) but creepy af — there was no one else out there and it was super windy. Hubs seemed confident that the ice was plenty thick buuuuuut ... all I could hear were creaks and groans like it was gonna crack open and swallow us up.  I’m trying to tell myself she just had some crazy excessive drooling, but... the spot on her bed was soaked through the the bottom, which would be an awful lot. Even for my drool-bag lol. 🥺
What’s going on with your pup’s paw though?
Their quick waddle makes me giggle!
I hope we all get it soon! I was told that if you didn't get it by last Friday then you wouldn't. I hope that person is wrong....cause they stressed me out!!!  I found some laughs in these too....https://imgur.com/gallery/Wln10ag
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🥰🥰
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🥺🥺🥺
Why did you get downvoted?!? Sorry if your already asleep! but I hope you have a wonderful sleep and sweet dreams
Awe, you were downvoted for this?  The down voters are so random. Don’t try to figure it out. 🤷‍♀️
LOL! That just means it's time to start a new one :D
No worries!! Did you get everything taken care of? I had nothing specific to chat about! Just wanted to have a lovely group of friends chatting. It really helped me a lot. Wish I had done it sooner! I’m actually gonna head off to bed, but thanks for checking in on me!! ❤️❤️❤️
I have a mug cookie recipe that’s not too bad if you want it :)
Oooo you know I’ve always been fascinated w mug cakes but I’ve never made one myself!!  No plans tonight! Probably just going to try to go to bed in a couple hours lol I’m sooo lame! 😂😂 I have some random movie streaming from Amazon Prime
Cheater!!!!!!
💕💕
MAKE IT
Ooo that’s not a bad idea!! Bored baking!! I just realized I have a box of cake mix sitting around!   Gluten-free is expensive! Sorry you have to experience that! Totally cool to be able to make your own snacks though, right? I haven’t baked in years!! I loved making things from scratch!
Gf is so tricky and expensive af! It’s hard to find stuff that doesn’t taste like cardboard :/ Do you have an Aldi? We’ve had some decent luck with their gf snacks
Nice I just know that most of the animal rehabilitation places do a thorough job checking the animal out to see if they can be released back into the wild
I understand the hair thing! I can vacuum and sweep and by the end of the day my steps have started to collect dog hair again! Oh well it's okay I would rather clean it up daily than not have my  fur baby's.
No problem you write as much as you want! Glad it didn't do any major damage to anything and you are okay. Have a lovely evening.
Thanks!  I'll probably take some otc pain relievers soon, but I needed to sit down for a bit.
Sounds cool!
That’s awesome ! Are you not in the  U. S. ? I’m getting my masters in library science and English but intend to teach eventually
I bet it wasn't that stupid.  I break things all the time and have come to terms with the fact that I'm just insanely clumsy.
I'm so sorry. I'm hoping he's negative for your sake!!
I'm so glad you got to see them!!!!
I finally fell asleep LOL
Yw
I know it is💕 I hope your day turns around.
You are NOT worthless
Well tell your brain to be nice or shut up
Yw you can get it at sally beauty not sure if your us or not
I’ll say police/firefighters/emt/hospital workers.
Oh that's the worst! Hope he helped ease your pain! Hugs
Your welcome!
Ah, in that case I can definitely see the difficulty with that. I do enjoy having some winter weather, so not having any PLUS the chance of fire danger is a real problem.
Oh I am in Sacramento, so I'm with you... And it is super windy today too!
I just read it it did not disappoint!
honestly I probably would have too, lol
100% agree!
It was good up until today. Just found out my boss has a high fever.
It was pretty good actually. Went to my dad's and played bingo with a bunch of his neighbors lol. It was soo freaking fun just drinking and playing bingo. How bout you, how was your weekend?
Lol. I try! Thank you
Okc Crisis Nursery Foundation is who I donate to    It’s a local place. It’s unlike any other place. It’s 24-7 emergency care for children as well as a place for endless resources- food, diapers, formula, car seats, clothes, etc.
Cheese ravioli with homemade sauce and meatballs, garlic bread, and a nice salad! It was really good and I had planned to take some to work tomorrow for lunch, but my two bottomless pits (aka my 17 and 16 year old sons) made sure there weren't any leftovers 😂😂😂
Did he jump or anything?
Idk yet im still getting to know people here
Though it may not help in some cases, but its all about keeping calm if you cab do that your heart rate will lower a bit but it works for me but it could be different for you
SAME. I always keep a bottle of ammonia on hand just in case I forget for too long. ;)
I love sleep 😍
Thank you! I hope you have a great week too! Do you have anything fun going on this week? 😊❤️
Nice!
😂 It's totally a natural human response to want to destroy what we find adorable...r-right? 👀
HOLY SHIT that’s a huge squish!! LOVE IT!!! Awww sorry to hear about your hammie, friend!! 🥺😢
Awww so cute!!!
u/gdarn16 u/psychologicalpenguin u/space_noodlers, have you guys met Elephantlover17?   Have you seen lots of elephants? I sorta recall seeing some at the San Diego zoo but it was so long ago that I can’t really distinguish whether I actually saw them or it’s a false memory lol
GASP!! You take that back right now!! How dare you take strawberry out!!! NEVERRRRRRR!!! lol jk   Ok you’re making me really freaking hungry just reading what you put in it!!! Yummmmm!!!
Yummy!
LOL I see why it’s called In The Dark now though! Haha!
Ahahaha... one day — you’ll show him.   ^i ^dont ^even ^know ^what ^that ^means
I’ve always been very composed when stressed or upset but now I’m just feeling like I’m repressing that energy that needs to be expelled! I should do something more constructive like running or something. A good scream sounds nice though. Wish I lived somewhere where I could do that LOL
Omgawd!! I wouldve been so tense and annoying on that ice!! DEFINITELY would’ve freaked at EVERY sound lol   Awwww poor baby!!! I really hope it’s just a tiny accident that she had and no biggie! ❤️
IDK!! 😭😭😭 he’s had both his dew claw quicks exposed for a while now but they’ve been fine. One has been healing just fine but the other was dangling around. No bleeding ever, everything was intact so it’s really weird to just see an exposed vein! But now the one that was healing nicely looks infected; the leg he’s limping on is the one that has the dangling quick. Just doesn’t make sense why it would bother him now... could be his arthritis flaring up or his osteochondritis. It’s been a good long time since those issues came up for him so I’m just praying to God it’s just a one off for him!
it's pure wholesomeness!!
Whaaaaaaa?! Omg don’t say that!!!! That can’t be true!! I know tons of ppl who haven’t gotten it yet and are totally qualified for it!!
HOLY CRAP those were fucking hilarious!!
Promise me you’ll give it a shot? Come on, who says no to free?
I can’t freaking sleeeeeep!!!   I have no idea why I got downvoted! I started noticing it towards the end of last week 🤷🏻‍♀️
🥺😕 I don’t get it either but whatever! Calling for my friends to cheer me up and having a great time chatting w friends won’t be ruined by downvotes! 🙂🤗 ok ok really going to bed this time LOL gnight!!
Hahaha I really want to!!! But it’ll also drive me nuts that I have an unfinished one laying around!!   I think you’re right though... it’s time to start a new one and put that past behind me for good! Thanks!!! I feel all inspired now 🤗
Yep!  Except when shopping I forgot to give the cashier my coupons... :(  But otherwise good.  I'm glad it helped you!  Sleep well! <3 <3 <3
ooh i would really appreciate that, thank you so so much!! 🌸🍰💗
they are so so cool but very confusing to make sometimes eeep! 🌸 what is your favourite flavour of cake?   ooh what kind of movie? 💭
And BOOM just like that! Again! * mic drop * 🤣🤣🤣🤣
👀  Sayyyyy whaaat? lol I don’t even know how to but I can try!! .....tmw. LOL
Bored baking cures the blahs and boredom. Yeahhhh for cake!
I haven't checked ours yet but I've got Pinterest and time so, I bored bake 🙂
That’s definitely important to me. These 3 are the most legitimate organizations I know of.   ADI houses a lot of lions rescued from circuses and such, but they’ve also rescued and placed some animals in sanctuary facilities where they receive specialized care, such as Cholita, a sun bear who was so stressed from abuse she lost all her hair. She couldn’t survive in the wild after the life she had. They’ll periodically update on how these animals are living their best sanctuary lives. You see their best updates on Facebook. I always look forward to seeing Cholita because she’s one that I donate to for her care.   Wildcat Sanctuary is the same deal. They give them space to live wild, but also care for them medically, feed, and give enrichment.
The great thing is there’s no wrong or right way to do it. Don’t be discouraged by all the artistic bullet journals you see on Pinterest/fb/ google or even the bullet journal sub here at Reddit. You set it up how you need to for you.
Nope, I'm in Scotland. Here you need a degree (I'm doing a postgrad) and then a year's experience of full-time teaching to become a registered teacher. All our schools are closed at the moment and doing online-learning but we'll be finding out today if they're re-opening in February (which isn't looking likely)
I hope so too, for his, mine and the businesses!
Neither of us even slept until like 5 am because we were just awake being with each other
Thank you! I hope you have a good day too!
YOU ARE NOT WORTHLESS
Hahahaha I will!!!!
He did help for today!! Cant wait to go back!
I got home from Tahoe a few hours ago, and as I was passing through Sac I was like “it was literally just 40 degrees 1-2 ago in Tahoe”
We had fun on the video chat as she pulled stuff out. Lol
And the lady didn’t even meet her. She just said leave the 5 bucks in the mail box and take the container lol.
Oh no!! Thinking of them and you, let me know how you are doing!!
Sounds awesome!! Mine was good!! I did a whole lot of nothing! Lol
What a beautiful charity!!
😂😂😂 my boyfriend is also a bottomless pit (I call him my garbage disposal) so if I ever get too much food on my plate I just slide it his way 😂
No he’s been sleeping a lot so I thought maybe it’s just old age or something! But today he got up and was limping so badly that he’d stop and lay down bc it was too hard for him to limp! 😳😳😳
It’s all good! We are all pretty friendly and open 😊❤️
I keep white vinegar 🤣
🤣🤣🤣 lmfao!! 🤣🤣🤣 omg I needed that, thank you! ❤️
It’s okay! He was a good boy and sadly hammies don’t live forever we had lots of love in his short little life!!
Thank you!!
Hi /u/Elephantlover17 :)
I haven't seen as many as I'd like lol I love the San Diego zoo!! The pandas were so cute there!
Yes I know her, she's cool 👀  I don't remember ever going to a zoo, so no elephant seeing for me!
Growing up my parents would get this Costco brand neopolitan that was AMAZING, but that was the only one I've ever had where the strawberry didn't taste super fake and didn't have the little chunks of strawberry in it. I actually just found out the store I shop at DOES have an ice cream with only chocolate and vanilla...guess what I'm having for dessert on Wednesday night 👀  I make pretty delicious chicken!
I normally don't like it because it can be overpowering taste-wise, but the olives weren't super salty, the grape tomatoes were fresh and didn't taste bitter or gross like I find most raw tomatoes to be, and the vinagrette I made was mild 😋
It’s like crime and uhh, mystery ish, and drugs and murder, and sex. Good stuff
I'm not show your weather is like but could you get outdoors anywhere to do anything?
Awwwww poor guy! 🙏 that it’s nothing & all heals quickly
It was an opinionated pia that said it, so maybe he was talking out of his ass.   I’m glad I got to lighten the mood with some laughs!!  Are you okay?
I promise to consider. It’s the CC part, which I get, that gives me pause. Did you use it? My goddaughter utilized this 24-7 txting counselor service. Is this the same thing, I wonder? Said he was really cool and helped her. Didn’t give me much more detail than that.
Yeah, I don't know why people do that! Maybe there's like down vote bots??
Woohoo! Hope you have a great day!
Ugh I hate that!!! Awww!!   Thanks! Sleep tight! We shall chat again tmw!
[Here ](https://www.melskitchencafe.com/60-second-chocolate-chip-mug-cookie/)you go! My only tip would be to not overcook it otherwise it gets very dry! Even if it still looks a bit underdone in the middle, let it sit for a bit and it will finish cooking on its own 😊
I can’t discriminate w cake flavor!! I love them ALL!!! lol true story!!   I’m watching The Silencing but I don’t really know what’s going on bc I’m not paying attention to it lol
Mic drops aren't like that! I'm supposed to say it for you!   FYI warm cinnamon rolls with an inch of cream cheese frosting are flipping amazing!!
What’s one of your favorite things to bake?
Yum! We’re stuck at the opposite end of the spectrum — I’m lazy and don’t have time, so usually... it’s the cardboard tasting crap lol.  We made some pretty decent energy bites the other day with chickpeas (I think?), pb, brown sugar & choco chips. They didn’t last long tho 😂
Amazing glad they are here to help the animals
Omg Tahoe sounds fun!!
Will do! Thank you!
Those are always great weekends. I love just sitting on the couch and playing video games and watching movies.
It is!!! They provided Christmas for over 1000 people last month. It was started by this one lady and they survive only off donations and volunteers. I pump them out whenever I can!
Maybe he laid on it funny! Give it some time and see if he keeps doing it
Hahahaha. Yep. They both work! :)
How long do they generally live for? I remember in elementary my teacher let me take home her guinea pigs for the weekend! But I didn’t get to play w them much bc every time I picked one up, it’d freak out and their eyes looked like they were going to burst! lol
Hello!
Pandas!!! I don’t know why but I love when they fall off the trees and just roll LOL that’s so mean isn’t it?
Say what now?! No way!!! We’re taking you to a damn zoo!! Everyone should go to one in a lifetime!!
No way!!! That’s awesome!!!!!! Wednesday night is gonna be off the hook!! Dang I want some ice cream too now haha!!  Teeeeeeach meeeeee to make delicious chicken!!!!
Oooo I’m intrigued now!!! Netflix? Hulu? Amazon?
We’re in our 80s over here which most ppl would find ideal but it actually is bad weather for me bc it inflamed my chronic pain areas 😒 I’d love to go up on a mountain somewhere and let out a good scream!
I hope so!!! I really freaking hope so!! 😭😭 love this Big Booty too much for him to be having issues!!! lol
Yea I’m sooooo much better now. Thanks so much! I actually think I’m gonna head to bed soon! Love you guys so much!!
lol I totally understand about the CC part for sure! When it was suggested to me, it was for only one free session!!  I’ve heard of the texting service but never used it. If I come across anything, I’ll let ya know?
🤷🏻‍♀️ I hope so bc I think it’s really crummy if someone’s actually going around downvoting!
You too!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Sounds good! :D
thank you so so much! 💗💗💗
Ugh that SOUNDS amazing! Drooling from over here!!! Oooo I miss Cinnabon’s cinnamon rolls!
Breads cos I miss them.
That sounds good
Wow how beautiful!! Thanks for keeping it on my radar!
Thanks gdarn16! I’m trying not to freak! I think he might have some sort of infection or maybe it’s just his arthritis flaring up? He’s on bed rest for a week
Usually only 2-3 years sadly! And guinea pigs are too much for me!!! They are buggy man!!
How are you??
It's cute tho!!
😳😳😳 I'll gladly go
I might have some more ice cream now because a mug full wasn't enough apparently 👀  I....don't know? Just make it? 😂 I usually cut a breast in half (one half for me, one for boyfriend cause ya know...portion sizes), brush it with olive oil, season it, bake it at 400 for 30-35 minutes and don't cut into it immediately or all those yummy juices will gush out
Netflix! It’s a CW show apparently. I just can’t stop watching it.
I love going to the mountains as well I think it's very calming and peaceful and definitely good for the soul. Do you have a pillow that you can scream into to make yourself feel better? If there's anything else I can do you know where to click to get into my mailbox hugs to you my friend I'm hoping that you get a good night's sleep in tomorrow is a better day for you
🤗 sweet dreams love!
Right! Bring people up! Not down!!
You’re very welcome! Let me know if you end up making it!
He made WAY to much frosting. Thankfully it freezes!!
Holy cow!! You can make bread?! 😳 my mom has been HOUNDING me to make some and I just don’t have it in me lol
*pimp them out. I’m sorry. I txt way too fast and hit reply way too fast!
Give Him lots of love from me!
A vet once told me that a client paid over $10k for their daughter’s hamster to have surgery bc the little girl just couldn’t let go. I was like 😳👀  Hahah guinea pigs do seem to squeal a lot for no reason
I'm good, just finishing up my meal prep for work tomorrow. You?
Hahah it really is! Plus they look so cushy!! Lol
Hehehe!! It’ll be soooo fun!!
I remember making chicken ONCE and it turned out nice and juicy!! But since then it’s always been super dry on the inside and drives me nuts!
I love CW shows lol another reason for me to subscribe back to Netflix! I don’t get why the price differs based on where you live, though! Like it’s $11.99 for me but just a couple cities over where my bestie lives, their Netflix is freaking $5.99/month w no ads!!!
Thank you so much! I know where to find you 🤗🤗🤗  I tried screaming in a pillow once. It actually just frustrated me more. Someone explained why to me back then but I don’t remember why that was anymore lol
Exactly!! Or just move on! I guess I really annoy some ppl here LOL!! Sorry!!
There’s no such thing as too much frosting. Ever.
Gluten-free bread is actually pretty easy since we only have 1 rise and no kneading
Yeup he’s milking all he can outta me!! Extra snuggles and kisses from you to him! On it!
Wow and I thought his 300 dollar vet bill was a lot 😂😂😂
I am trying to fall asleep because I have to go to the dentist tomorrow and i accidentally took a nap lol
Right?!
Awww 😭 The tricks I've found that work best is a high temp for a shorter time and not cutting into it before its done and has had a short time to cool down
Here it’s $12.99 for one device and low res, $15.99 for HD
Just try to keep in mind when things are stressing you  or bothering you or you feel you want to argue with someone you need to ask yourself is this really going to matter a week from now or a month from now?🤔 And the answer is usually NO so it's definitely not worth it, I learned this many years ago and it stayed with me and I use it quite often and it definitely does help.🧸🐭
I'm sure I do too! But yeah! Move on people!
I thought so as well. He put about an inch and a half on my cinnamon roll and...... You couldn't tell he'd scooped some out! He froze about half for the next batch of cinnamon rolls 😋
All of that just went over my head LOL jk the only part I understood was no kneading bc that’s the part I dread the most hahah
And tell him he’s a big booty Boy from me!!
Hahah right?! I felt so crappy about myself bc they were telling me it’s gonna be $1k for my little dog’s CT scan & I couldn’t afford it back then. When that vet told me that, I was like well damn! I’m sorry I don’t have an extra $10k around!! But then another vet said it’s understandable if I can’t and that honestly it would only lead to more expenses bc either it’ll lead to finding a brain mass & needing surgery or it’ll turn up fine and they’ll need to run more tests.
Ooh I hope you have a good visit and you can fall asleep soon!
Ugh dentists!! I hate dental visits!! You just reminded me I need to call and make my appointment tmw LOL I hope you’re sleeping!! xoxo chat again tmw!
Hahah yuuuupppppp!! Ok it was soooo nice meeting you & chattin w ya!! I’m gonna get ready for bed and just call it a day! Hope we get to chat some more tmw!!
Good to know!! I’d say I’ll try it but I won’t lie, I don’t know when I’ll ever try cooking chicken again LOL
Wth, right?! What’s the deal!!
Regular bread has two risings due to the gluten and you have to knead it usually. Gf bread only has one rise due to lack of gluten and it’s batter like compared to gluten bread making.
You know it!! Gotta give him some big booty pats on his booty while I tell him!! lol
Thank you sweetie!!
Totally not sleeping!! Ugh I messed up but that nap was too good!
Good night!
Awwww but there's so much good stuff you can make with it! 😱 I can't imagine life without chicken
Wow fascinating!! Now I want to YouTube this but ssssshhhhh 🤫🤫🤫 no need to put ideas in my mom’s head LOL
Awww mannnnn!!! I hope you can fall asleep soon?? Don’t you hate when naps mess up your sleep schedule? Like come on, why can’t we have our naps but also keep our sleep schedule?? LOL totally know what you mean when you have a goooood nap!
Haha! That’s very true! I don’t know though.. I feel scarred lol I’m sure I’ll get back into it one of these days!
Lol
Like I wanna be more mad at myself but Damn do I feel rested right now!!
Do it!!! Embrace the chicken!! Salads, curry, soups, main course with veggies on the side....**use it** 👀
🤣🤣🤣 good luck dear friend!! I’m gonna do my best to sleep! Big Booty wishes you a very good night!
😂😂😂
Tell big booty to stop worrying mama!
Omg.... I can’t freaking sleeeeeeep!!!

CLOSED  Hey! This is a contest that anyone with a phone that takes pictures can join in for. Everyone can join because I can get prime for all the Amazon's ☺️   So this is a game that I like to play that I'm going to modify slightly so it works over text. The game show me is one where someone (me) will say "show me.." and then an item and everyone runs to find that item and whoever shows it first wins that round. So obviously I don't expect you all to check reddit every 2 seconds to see if I replied.   How it's going to work is I'll make a top comment saying "show me..." And then a house hold item I'm pretty sure everyone will have (if you don't it's alright just show me something as similar as possible). Then you'll go and take a picture of that item and reply to my top comment. I'll pick the winner based off of whoever has done all of them (or if multiple people have done all of them I'll do it point based on who replied quicker overall). If this doesn't make sense or you have a question comment on my comment that says "Help"   Rules:  1 - Be nice & have fun  2 - Only reply to my top comment (my direct replys to this post)  3 - Have something £10/$10/€10 or less on your wishlist   Let the games commence 🥰 (They'll end on the 19th at 3pm Uk time)   All the "show me.." are posted. Reply before 3pm (uk time) to be counted :)

Show me a table
Show me a light (can be a lamp, the main light, fairy lights, anything that produces light)

I love spooning ❤️
They look so cool
I've never seen a spoon like that. Am I the weirdo in this situation? Lol 😆
That's so small and cute 🥺
That is a tiny meal, indeed. 😋
That’s too cute 🙈
Your chairs look so luxurious and the table cloth is very pretty!
It really is fun! Tbh, I've never (no offense to anybody else!) had actual fun doing a contest. I really really like this idea ❤️
No problem I'm glad people are enjoying it! 🥰
Don't worry I make mess wherever I go! No judgement here 🤣
wowza! I love sky lights.
This is such a funky lamp (lamps?)  I absolutely love.
That’s such a cute lamp!
That's so cute!! 🥰
Hahaha that’s too funny! But also sorry it doesn’t work 😬
I have light up pois too! They're so fun
Your room is beautiful!! I love it!
Your room is awesome!
Me too! I was like hmm should I take a pic of the blanket I'm sitting on, one of the two beside me, or one of the 10 baby blankets lying in here 😋
🥺 so cute!
OMG he's so cute!! I just wanna snuggle him 🥰
SAME LOL
Me too 😂😂
🥺😍 adorableee
Yup that's fine!
That's so pretty!
Yup! That works :)
😍😍😍
That's so cool!!
Yo, that's a beautiful watch!
Yup that's fine!
Ooo I like it! That's so nice. It's a very calm picture if that makes sense :)
I want to try to make some floating shelves so badly!
It's a beautiful wall
I love the frame!!
That's ok, my niece drew a very crude looking pooping unicorn on my bedroom wall 😂
I like it!!

Okie dokie! ☺️
Yes, I've been meaning too, just not sure what to write haha   You're from India too? ^^ flair
You can go onto imgur and upload the photos there then press the 3 dots in the top right corner and then click "copy perma link" then paste the link in your comment. I hope this helps!
🥰🥰🥰
Your carpet is gorgeous 💕
Oh I want one! And I can’t even game 🤣
Yessss
Thanks they are made out of olive wood! Very fancy kitchen spoons lol
I hadn't either I til I met my husband lol. Apparently it's a grapefruit spoon. Personally I use it to mash up my cats' wet food, it's easy to keep separate from the human spoons.
I possibly borrowed it from my son's dollhouse 😅
Thanks! It was my grandmothers and is older than my dad! I secretly hope my kids want it one day
Haha thanks and well we got a dog like a month ago so the chairs aren't so luxurious now thanks to the doggos teething!😂 but thankyou!!
I’m pretty new to the sub and haven’t signed up for a lot of contests or been gifted yet but fun contests make up for it imo.  It’s like a fun little gift for everyone before the gift y’know?  I have so many ideas that I can’t wait to try out when I have some extra cash to share my joy with others in this community!
It was a bad idea to keep a big box with "stuff I will donate once covid is over" xD
Me too! The sound of the rain hitting them 😍 It’s our first home and I told my husband I’m not sure if I could ever have a house without them now! 😬
Thanks! I've considered painting him, but I'm not sure about it.
Thank you! You can position his head, legs, and tail! And to turn it on, you just kinda "pet" his head *and* there's three different light strengths- you just pat his head to go brighter, then back down. I was super excited when I won him, lol 😆
I'm really enjoying learning them next I want to get staffs and hoops but sooo expensive
Thank you! Needed to do something in Lockdown 2!
Thank you! Lockdown project :)
I used to sleep with 6 but the weighed blanket really helped because I love the weigh of a million blankets!
He gives good snuggles
Thanks!
Thank you! :)
Thanks! It is in my meditation corner haha
I had a feeling you would like this one 😄
Thanks! He holds plastic grocery bags!
Thanks it was a gift from my mum i love it💙
Thank you :)
I love themmm
Hehe, thanks!
Thanks! My husband got it for me off my Etsy wishlist for Christmas 🥰
Thank you!! I've got more but, it I'm still working on it
Yup! I'm from India as well!  So, to make an Intro post you can tell us general information about yourself like what do you do, what are your hobbies, what kind of movies do you like to watch. Make sure there is INTRO written in the title inside square brackets. Basically this: [INTRO]  You may want to read the sidebar and if you need any help, feel free to message me!
I’m from India too!  Hello frens :) always so fun to run into someone from your country online no ?
Oh thank you I’ll give it a go
Thanks! It's actually the carpet in the waiting room at the dentist office where I am at the moment. Lol
Still comfortable!😂
It looks very handy, regardless! And I thought I was well versed in kitchen utensils lol.  It'd definitely work great for wet cat food! Or any of those moments when you're contemplating "fork or spoon?" Lol. 😋
Aww! That makes it even more adorable. My mom gave away all my toys after my sister turned 6 since we both were too old for it.  Sigh.
It really is! Also, welcome to the sub! I'll keep an eye out for your contests. But we're not *all* about gifting here, so don't worry about taking your time on contests. Your needs come first!! I've been here for months and only recently hosted my first contest.  But I know what you mean, it really is so exciting to be able to share that joy with others. I love it. I wish I could gift every single day, that'd be amazing! ♥️♥️
That sounds like heaven. Please tell me you curl up under it with a good book and a hot cup of tea/coffee/cocoa and listen to the sound of the rain cause that’s literally goals ✨
Ooh that could be so cool. You should def do it! If it doesn’t work out, you could always wash it off or paint it a neutral colour.
Well you definitely did a great job! I bet it feels great to relax in a comfy space you worked so hard to create. My room needs a makeover ×3 lol
I really want to try a weighted blanket!
Did you make or buy yours? If you don't mind me asking.
I didn't know you could make Etsy wishlists!! Very cool.
Suree, thanks a lot 💖
That's so nice!!
Haha! Well you have good taste in dentists then?  Hope it’s a painless appointment and that you flossed before coming!
Hmm I think you meant to post your original comment on the comment below mine 😂 my photo was not of the tiny table haha. My photo is a actual human sized table. Not a toy 😅
Yess! It’d be so cool wouldn’t it?  Thankyou! You’re very kind. I’m super excited to be part of a such a warm community like and to make friends. I keep seeing all these contests ask to tag people and  I can’t wait to start tagging folks :)
I usually just sit and listen without the book. Listening to it without distractions is so peaceful! During a thunder storm I like to watch the storm through them
Mine is only 10 pounds and I really want more weight lol it’s so nice and it feels like a hug all night!!
Walmart has them for not too expensive!!
We made my old ones but I just moved rooms so still decorating but these are bought!
Yeah, if you "favorite" an item, it makes a list for you! :)
Thanks! 2 fillings! All done now thankfully lol.
Oops 🙈🙈
Your table is so cool as well! Though I’ll confess I’m more in awe of those tiny skeleton cat figurine thingies you have. Those are toooo awesome!
You can tag me anytime you'd like! Tbh, I don't have lots of ppl to tag yet either. We could tag each other!
I'll have to check into that!!
No worries! Their tiny table is quite adorable!
They are salt and pepper shakers! 😀 we had them for día de muertos but didn’t put them away haha
That sounds great! I’d love that :)
I still have my tiny fake Christmas tree up when I don’t celebrate Christmas and I live in a tiny dorm room so I relate so much!   Those are really awesome so I don’t see why you should even put them away regardless.

What’s up folks!  I have kinda been away from this sub for a while; partially due to feeling guilty because my financial situation wouldn’t allow me to gift, partially just due to a general depressive season I’ve been going through that has kept me from wanting to do things lol.  But I’m back! This community has always been a very kind and open one and I’d love to be a little part of it again.  If anyone wants to chat a bit I’d love someone to talk to! (Or if anybody is a Brandon Sanderson fan, I just finished *Rhythm of War* and I’m DYING to talk about it with someone).

Hello! Nice to meet you! Do you have a favorite fantasy creature?
Welcome back tree!!
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Welcome back! I've totally been there, but each time I come back I'm really glad I did! Never read anything by Sanderson, I'll have to add him to the to-read list!
We've never met but welcome back to the sub! I'm Chris, board gamer and reader and writer. I haven't read Sanderson yet but he's definitely on my 2021 list.
Welcome back!   &#x200B;  I loooove fantasy, and Sanderson is great! I haven't read that yet though. I'm working through Wheel of Time right now, which he ended up writing the last few books of. Have you read Wheel of time? I'm so excited for the show!
Welcome back! I'm not very active in here but tend to pop in and out myself.  I haven't read any Sanderson but it's on my list - currently working thru Pratchett (Good Omens and The Long Earth) and just got caught up on Butcher (Dresden Files).
Hello!
Welcome back! I don’t have anything to say about the Rhythm of War or Brandon Sanderson but I will give you a warm and friendly greeting! Hope you have a lovely day
Howdy! I'm new here but I like friends! I have no clue what you're talking about but howdy!
Welcome back.
So... Rhythm of War, huh? What’d you think? It seems pretty polarizing.
Thank you, and I am getting there! Between finally being able to start therapy, the book I read being full of relatable mental health struggles, and the unbending support of my fantastic wife I am on the right track!
Thank you!
Thank you, and it was! It is the latest book in the *Stormlight Archive* series.
Thank you very much!
Wow that’s exactly where I snagged the name from! I’m so glad someone finally pointed it out haha
Oooooh, as a long-time fan of all things fantasy that is a very tough choice!   If we are going with classic fairy-tale creatures then I gotta go with dragons! Endless variety there, and endless depictions with their own unique twists! I had this book called *Dragonology* as a kid that was a sort of faux-scientific guide about different types of dragons, and it always stuck with me!  If I can think outside the box a little bit though, my current favorite is the spren from the *Stormlight Archive* series. They are basically little pieces of divinity that have become awakened because of human ideas and emotions, and spring into the material world around the things they represent. Painspren crawl out of the ground as gnarled disembodied hands if someone gets hurt, gloryspren appear as little golden orbs that flitter around the heads of someone finally achieving their life’s goal or a seemingly insurmountable task, and flamespren appear when you gather around a campfire as little figures dancing through the flames. It is a super fun concept for a mythical creature!
Good to be back!
Hello there!  My favorite holiday is probably Christmas, primarily because I love being swept up in the spirit of the seasonal changes. Living in a place that doesn't have much variety between the seasons, it makes for a good indicator of the passage of time and helps mark a reflective end to the year. Also, giving gifts and eating tasty food!  My favorite thing about nature is probably learning about a unique new animal I'd never heard of before. I grew up binging the Animal Planet channel (before it became more about people and reality shows), and the love I have for learning about fun new creatures has never left me.
Glad you’re back too! I’d definitely recommend starting with the *Mistborn* series, it’s a great launching point for the extended universe he’s built up
Great to meet you! What kind of stuff do you like to write?
I haven’t gotten to the Wheel of Time yet! It is quite a massive undertaking haha
Hello! How’s your morning going?
I hope you do as well!
I like friends too! How's your day going so far?
Thanks!
I liked it, but I think it was my least favorite in the series so far. It felt very much like the type of book that was spent setting up for more to come in the next book.  However, the implications it has for the greater cosmere have me going wild. >!What the hell did Taravangian/Odium do to my boy Hoid in the epilogue???!<  And not to mention that >!we found out that the leader of the Ghostbloods is the Cognitive Shadow of *Kelsier?!?! That has me going insane.*!<
I’m so glad you have the support for your wife, books, and a therapist! That sounds like a great support team.
I want to start the outlander series but our closest library is temporarily closed at the moment
One of my favorite quotes from that album is: “Brother, sister too Do what you must do Don't trust people you meet Yeah, yeah They might promise you That the river ain't deep” (new genius)
I love dragons and all the variations and varying lore surrounding them! Gotta respect the classics!  Spren sound so interesting! I've never heard of that series. Who is it by?  My current favorite fantasy creature is the bowtruckle from Harry Potter. But my all-time favorite is the unicorn.
Hi there I find the so interesting though I used to watch animal planet years back as well I'm always up for learning something new every day and the more people I talk to the more I'm learning. Hoping that you have a wonderful evening
Mostly fantasy and fiction! I'm trying to write a fantasy novel now :D
I'm at work and I need more coffee, so yaknow the usual lol. Hbu?
It's going alright. I made an appointment for my cat as he keeps throwing up bile ):
I’m 100% on board. Also >!fuck Moash. Killing teft there literally ended my soul!<
I’ve heard good things about that series! It’s such a shame the libraries are closed though
Such an underrated song in their discography, always been one of my favorites off that album!  Have you listed to Song Machine Vol. 1 yet? It’s probably my favorite thing they’ve done since plastic beach!
It's by Brandon Sanderson! He has written a lot of books, most of which are part of a big interconnected universe. I suggest starting with the *Mistborn* series first, if you are looking for something new to read.  Bowtruckles are so cute! I'd love to have one chilling on my collar or shoulder all the time, just a nice little plant friend.
That’s amazing! I’d love to hear a little about it. What’s the premise?
Giving my son some breakfast and watching Moana :)
Awww I hope they feel better soon!
>!Agreed. Fuck Moash to shadesmar and back.!<  >!I wonder who Odium is going to choose for his champion. I saw an interesting theory that he is going to choose someone like Moash, and then completely abandon him at the time of the fight, making Dalinar question if he can go through with the contest while keeping his honor.!<
I get it though to be safe but at least do pick up
My husband is more hep than me, he probably plays it and I just don’t know. (I can tell you about Led Zeppelin, but only refer songs by everyone else lol)
Okay, thanks! I'll have to look into his books! Yes, bowtruckles are adorable!
It's sort of typical in the sense that it's a group of unlikely heroes who kind of come together to save the land from a blight that's slowly destroying it.
Sounds like a solid morning to me!
>!I really like the theory that Odium’s gonna pick someone Dalinar won’t fight, like Gavinor or Kaladin’s young sibling. I can see Gavinor definitely being an option, especially since he is definitely emotionally 😬!<
Well if you are ever looking for something new to listen to, it’s become an instant classic for me!
Sounds like a lot of fun!
Most definitely!
God that would break my heart
Thanks!! Hopefully I can actually stick with it and get it done :D

Hm, perhaps /u/timeywimey99? He's a steve and a .co.uk user!
That's awesome! Sonic was my favourite as well!
Wasn't me, but maybe it was a relatively anonymous gift. 🙂 What an awesome first gift!! 😀
Enjoy!!
It was u/stetho \- his first RAOA endeavour after discovering this subreddit at the weekend.
Could be u/theNUTRONIC ? Are you the generous funko gifter??
u/stevelikestobake perhaps?
Timey was it you?
Are you really mystery Steve? ;o
No not me. Sorry.
Nope. Wasn’t me!
I didn't read the instructions properly about the tags. Here's the belated \[gifted\] post  [https://imgur.com/a/7MQOxOx](https://imgur.com/a/7MQOxOx)
How many UK Steve's are on here?? 😂 You should create your own mini group too 😂
Thank you mate, I really appreciate it!  I had the awkward "but i haven't ordered anything" conversation with the delivery driver. It looks perfect on my desk which has a retro video game theme going on :)
😆   That'd be cool.
Will the real Steve please stand up :)

I am so excited to be here! This place has such a warm vibe to it, almost like lying on the beach, don't you agree?   A little about me, I have been a content writer and voice over artist, nothing official but those were the jobs I landed on and it was fun, currently I am doing things by myself, I am a tarot reader and I do sell metaphysical supplies, help people understand their energetic patterns and do some holistic healing like reiki, acupuncture, I've been doing this for 5 years or so but recently have set everything up  My hobbies include baking, I made some banana muffins just today, I like to read books, Julian Barnes is my favorite author, I love anime and I am watching a LOT of seasonal, Winter 2021 is stacked iukwim, I play guitar, I want to be more sporty, like swimming or gym but I have some back related issues so I can't strain myself a lot, I do simple yoga and stretching for now   I love tea, perfumes and I collect those, I should stop, really, what do you guys collect?  I love cats, they catch my attention anywhere and my only vision is to have a sooo many cats   I am really wanting to travel now, been so long!! And I want to move to Germany in the next few years, so I am trying to learn German (currently in India)   That's it about me! Have a good day/night
Welcome, friend! Hope you enjoy your time on this sub. I'm also into tarot and oracle cards, as well as reiki (though I don't do any healing myself). What's your favorite tea? I collect coffees and board games and books.
Oh god don't get me started on tea, I have too much and always go collect more lol.   &#x200B;  Welcome!
I'm a crazy cat lady! I can't bake, but I'm happy to have you with us!

Hello and welcome to the sub!
Welcome! Have you watched HoriMiya yet?
Hello and welcome
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦  How about a quick reading for your new friend? Lol   Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Welcome! I also want to own so many cats. Currently I have 3. [the only picture of all 3 together because 2 hate each other publicly but love each other secretly.](http://imgur.com/a/x49Myhb)
Welcome to the sub!  I hope you have a great time here!  I watch anime occasionally as well.  I'm trying to get into Darling in the Franxx so I can see why everyone loves it, haha.  I collect figures and keychains of my favorite video game and anime series.  :D  An expensive hobby for sure, but I am being more and more picky as to not break my wallet completely.  I also love cats!  I hope you can get a cat at some point.
Welcome fellow Indian, always happy to see a fellow country person in this amazing sub.  Julian Barnes is not an author I was familiar with, was checking out his books and they seem quite interesting. Thanks for sharing this, is there any special one that your recommend, in the mood for something humorous
That's so cool! I like earl grey, rooibos, white tea in general   What kind of books do you read?
Haha, which is your favorite?   Thank you
Do you have any pets?
Thank you
Yaay! Another tea lover, wow, I'd love to see your collection!  I love earl grey, recently finished a batch of lemon eucalyptus white tea and loved it, I like rooibos quite a lot too, lapsang as well, wbu?
Hello, thank you!
Yes! Absolutely loving it, I watch a lot of romance/SoL type of stuff and this was such a good one   Are you liking it?
Heyaaa
Happy new year to you too!   My favorite holiday has to be Halloween, cause I am secretly a witch and pumpkin spice latte is so yummy I like the way nature always is, continually! On a lighter note, I love rain and beaches   Omg, I need to see their pics! And that's very kind of you, not everyone can do that, I was in therapy for OCD and I can understand the battle it can be, and sure, just message me hehe   That's very kind of you! Feel free to hmu, we can talk about anything and everything, I am just weak with current affairs but I got you covered with the rest 😂🤗
That's so adorable, give them pets from meee
You should!!!  That's cool, which is your favorite keychain from the collection?   And yes, even I am trying to be more conscious about what I consume   Aw, thanks, I did get cat thrice but my mom was too scared for me to keep them, maybe later when I am elsewhere
Julian Barnes is far from what would be funny, unless you enjoy the kind of humor tied in grief, his books are mostly romance/philosophical  I am currently reading Nothing to be Freighted Of and I did crack up now and then
Ohh rooibos is so good! I read everything but especially fantasy and literary fiction. How about you?
That's a tough question hmmmm... I'm pretty happy with Ahmad tea and twinnings brands, and I loooove Pantenger (it's good tea but also they have a beautiful tin with a beautiful leopard on it and I love all cats, including wildcats).   I think my favorite actual teas are a lady grey/earl grey steeped with lavender latte, or a plain lapsang suochong. Also plain genmaicha is amazing too...  What about you?
I do! I have two boys, Puddin' and Houdini!
My fav changes by the day.  I do adore Earl Grey just like Captain Picard,  but also Chai,  Irish Breakfast and such.  My friend u/sleepy_pickle also gifted me a Little Women inspired blend with real apple in it and it is delightful!
I've only had time to watch the first episode, but I really like it! I really liked the manga so I was excited that it was finally animated.
I can't believe it I just spoke to 20 new people and everybody loves Halloween lol I have a picture of Mr. JJ and some of the other kitties in my profile if you'd like to take a peak. I'm also not too good at politics so I think we'll get along just fine lol
I wl!!
That's a tough question, but I think I have to go with my Cipher keychains from Fire Emblem Three Houses.  They are incredibly rare and hard to find, and super well made.  I'm really happy to own them.  Aww, it's sad that you didn't get to keep them.  :(  I'd love to get a cat in a couple of years.
Added a couple of his to my reading list, his reviews have been quite good 👍
Pantenger, I gotta check that one out  Same haha, I love earl grey, rooibos, lapsang and white tea in general
They are adorable!!
Ah, Chai, well that's what I grew up with, we make chai every morning with breakfast, however I like my tea w/o milk and sometimes slightly bitter too  I've tried English breakfast, next should be the Irish one   That seems interesting! I do feel fruits/berries do add that extra kick  I've been meaning to try matcha, make some tea, latte and even soda  Have you tried any tea based soda? I didn't know it was a thing until recently
Oh that's cool, I didn't even know about it until now but I can see why all the manga readers would be excited
Lol, that's reddit for ya :p  Mr JJ is adorable!!
Or will...*
Rare stuff :D  I have a limited edition zippo that I internally flex over haha  Me too! Cats are just, I can't overthink around them lol
💖💖💖
It's all just so goooood. So much tea, so little space for it.
I haven't come up but I be willing to give it ago. Bubbles and tea might be weird though. Lol! Do you drink iced tea as well?
Ikr 😭
Yeah, it sounds weird, but YouTube always surprises me lol  And not really, I prefer hot tea, I do drink cold brew at times because I make 1ltr tea and keep it in my bottle and it eventually cools down lol  Wbu? Is Iced tea your thing? Any other interesting ways you've incorporated tea?
Oh man and Davids tea! I was so sad about the stores, I was gonna get my birthday tea but pandemic, and now the stores are all nonexistant in the US!    Did you ever shop David's tea? Caribbean Crush (really its more an herbal tisane), and another one, Budha's Blend (a white tea) are phenomenal.
I love hot in the morning and drink cold tea all day for the rest of the day.  If you were to cut me open I would not be surprised to see tea come out
I am from India, so unaware of those haha but Caribbean Crush sounds yumm
Now that's the kind of tea lover I aspire to be 😂
Ah, I think David's tea only does Canada now, and US online only. That's too bad. But I imagine there are many delicious tea shops in your neighborhood too. India has a long history of tea after all!
Yup! Can't complain about that, we get a lot of local and fancy teas, so it's nice  I've been meaning to try match next, have you tried it?
I have! I enjoy it. Ceremonial quality for drinking, other grades for cooking. And man you can make some tasty green tea cakes and cookies with it.  It's just so expensive T.T I like it most as a latte with just a hint of sugar, but there was one I tried once that was very good entirely plain too.
Yeah, I am curious about match soda lol  Ikr... it is expensive 🤐
There's a matcha soda??? If you try it let me know how it is! It sounds fascinating!
Yeah, thanks to anime, I wanna try it so bad! Ll keep you posted
I'm gonna be doing a lot of googling of it tomorrow!

Well done /u/ricenoddles, though OP you clearly need more books :P
Well done. I was waiting for the answer abs thought actually I should count mine
How kind of you!!
Congrats!🎉
Ooooh Merci! I bought some just yesterday!
WOW 59 books?! That's amazing!! And thank you so much for hosting this contest!! 🥰😊
Ha! I read too fast, is the issue--my family always thought I'd have a huge book collection. Thing is, I'd constantly be buying new books, so I get them from libraries or keep them digitally instead
you're welcome!! 🥰
Hah I do the same but I’m so adhd with books that I either spend 8 hours reading cover to cover or don’t touch a book for 8 months. I miss libraries so much!

What an amazing outfit!
🤩
Wow that outfit looks amazing on you! I’d never be able to wear boots like those with my ginormous calves 😂 love the dress too, the colour really suits you! 😍
Those look so awesome on you! 😍
You look amazing!!! Love the outfit
While the outfit is great, I can't help but notice you have an awesome board game collection!  What are some of your favorites?
Ughh I’m so obsessed with you!!! You’re just the cutest!!!!
Cute!!! and I'm loving all the board games :D
Ooooh love a good sweater dress! Looks great on you
You are beautiful and so is your board game collection. Have you played lords of water deep?
Thank you again!!! I wanted to let you know that I also got the science kit for the kids but since tomorrow is a school holiday for them but not a work holiday for me, they are staying with a relative until tomorrow after work. As soon as they are home, I will post a thank you for the science kit! Thank you...so very very much u/jkpenrod
I spy a Schecter C-1 !
Stunning!!
You look amazing!
Oohhhhh can you link those boots? They're awesome!
You're adorable!
It looks great on you!
Sooo cute! They both look so good😍
You look so good!
I love those boots! As someone with giant feet I constantly struggle to find good cute boots.
CUTIE!!!!!--- Do these count as "fashion boots"? My new job has a very oddly specific rules about not wearing "fashion boots" so idk.. lol
Everything is so cute on you and that color looks great with your hair! Also I’m super jealous of this low key board game flex you have going on haha Is the Villainous game fun? I’ve been contemplating buying it.
Looks so cute!!!
Those boots are to die for!!!
Omggg!! Gorgeous!!
😍😍
You look so sweet! Like you'd make me a really nice cup of tea and give me a warm blankie 🥺
That dress is adorable!
Those boots are gorgeous
You look stunning! Whoever bought those for you has good taste :D
Love this outfit!!
You look amazing in it!! I love your smile you look so precious!!
Look at you looking fantastic!! Damn lady!! 😍
Woo woo! 😁
Thanks!! We have a couple laying around. I love playing when i get free time  lol
yes!!!  ❤️  its so nice!
❤️❤️ Thank you! These are the first boots I have ever had like these! lol
I feel you on the calves! I have small feet, 5-6, and my calves are larger. I can’t fit in boots.
❤️❤️ Thank you so much!
🥰🥰 Thank you!!!
Thank you!! My favorite is tainted grail: fall of avalon followed by cthulhu death may die, kingdom death and talisman! You?
😲🥰🥰🥰
Haha thanks!!! I have a board game addiction! Lmao
Thank you!! 💗
Thank you!!!!🥰🥰 no not yet actually!
You are very welcome! That outfit looks great! You had so many beautiful clothes on your list it was hard to choose, thus more than one. 😉
Yes! We have a few more guitars lying around and my good one is put away (kids and all)
❤️
❤️ Thank you so much!!

😊🥰 thank you!!
Thank you!!
🥰🥰 thank you!!!
Thank you!!!!🥰🥰🥰
🥰
🥰🥰   Hmm. I..I think..idk. lmao thats such a strange rule! I would ask them to be a bit more...descriptive lol
HAHAHAHaha We legit have a board game obsession in this house!  Its pretty fun! Its not overwhelming or time consuming either! Pretty quick play. I havent used the expansions yet but I have heard good things about each!    Also, 🥰🥰 Thank you!
🥰🥰
🥰🥰
🥰  🥰  Thank you!!
Hahha I totally would!!! Cookies too! 🥰
🥰🥰
🥰🥰 thank you!!
Haha 🥰🥰😊 thank you!!!!
The honest to god look amazing on you. I’m jelly over here ♡
Same lol so I totally get it
haha well it was unexpected and greatly appreciated! You completely blew me away! I had no idea what was in that package when I got it! haha   It all came in one!
I miss my C-1! But I’ve still got plenty other guitars haha
Yea I was like ok someone effed up and now this is a rule.. hahaha.. I don't own any boots like that anyway.. plus I know you're pretty tiny and those boots would prob look funny on me ( I'm too damn tall) <3
I loveee board games! I’ve been eyeing it but we have quite a few board games already so it’s hard to justify buying more sometimes. Though now I can show my husband that our collection is *not* too big muahaha
❤️ Thank you!!!!!
ppsshhtt I bet they would look great on you! Long legs make for killer looking boots!   but yeah. . what on earth for taht rule!?? hahaha
Hahaha the sad thing is..is thats just a corner..[We have a problem..🤣🤣](https://i.imgur.com/Fo7AJX5.jpg) if you ever have board game questions or want to talk about them, im totally here for it.  Im also on board game geek!
I want you to know I used your photo as evidence last night and convinced my husband we need more board games 😆 We have most of the traditional ones and have started branching out into other ones. Have you ever played Blokus?? It’s one of my absolute faves and I’ve never met anyone else who’s ever even heard of it lol
Hahahhaa nice!!   I have heard of it and seen it but I havent played that one! My husband's father has a collection that makes ours look pathetic and he has blokus!
Whaaat, makes *yours* look pathetic?? That’s so cool 😆 It’s like a weird Tetris-type game. Everybody gets weirdly shaped pieces and the goal is to place as many of yours on the board as possible. I love jigsaw puzzles and puzzles in general so I think that’s why I love it. Do you know any other similar games? I’m open to recommendations!
Have you ever tried the escape games? Several of them have a ton of puzzles like that in them!
I have not! I’ll definitely check them out though, thanks! Also, my husband would like to know more about the Dark Souls game if you don’t mind 😆
Ok. So. [Here is the base game](https://i.imgur.com/hKdpoKY.jpg)  we don't have expansions to this yet so we only have four playable characters. Basically, you have a spawn point/bonfire where you are safe, just like in the video games. The boss you have to level up to be able to defeat. Each room has different enemies and what not and there is a decent flow to it. Its an overall fun but hard game with one major flaw. When you go to the bonfire, all the enemies reset..just like the video game...so literally..you are grinding to level up...and like in any video game, it can get boring. We've decided to change up the rooms some just so its not tedious and unfun by the end of round 4 lmao.  If you want a good pop game that is horror, I'd go with brutality. [The characters are amazing as are the figures](https://i.imgur.com/fYkjj62.jpg) its easy set up, easy take down and fast paced game.   If you want horror co-op. My all time favorite  [Cthluhu death may die](https://i.imgur.com/T5Ht5JF.jpg). Amazing. The mechanics for the dungeon crawling are on point, the characters are fun to play and it has some of the best figures eevvveerrr.    I cant show this one bc it is HEAVY af. But [The bottom box, kingdom death](https://i.imgur.com/Jn0heSi.jpg) is a co-op survival horror campaign game that is my husband's absolute favorite. We have never once won this game lmao but its a lot of fun. Its like a board game and dnd combined.
Omggg you’re amazing! He was really interested in Cthulhu game too so he’s excited about that one even more now (and I have a gift idea for him haha). Thanks for giving so much information! I’ll definitely be looking into these ☺️
Always!!! I LOVE board game talks! lol I only stuck with horror because of the dark souls, but my favorite game is actually Tainted Grail. If you like fantasy, co-op games that have a ton of awesome art and centered around Arthurian lore, THAT is THE BEST game ever     But horror and fantasy games are my specialty and the ones I buy the most so I def have a ton of those to suggest or point away from hahahah
Nice! These are all right up my husband’s alley but I’ve never played anything like them so it’ll be a fun thing to learn together :) so I may have questions in the future haha Arthurian lore? Count me in! Thanks again and have a fantastic night!
hit me up whenever! and have a great night too!!!

Contest [closed] !!  Today is my first day as a member of this community and I’m really looking forward to gifting someone for the first time so I figured I’d try my hand at a contest in order to choose who! I figured I’d further establish myself as the local Beatle fanatic by theming the contest after them!!  I have randomly chosen a Beatles song (nothing too obscure or impossible to even non-fans, it’s a song that was released on one of the original 12 UK Beatle albums) and it’s your job to guess which song it is!   RULES 1. Comment your guess (you can comment one song). 2. Link your wishlist in your comment because I usually use mobile. 3. Have something on your list that’s worth up to $15. 4. The contest will end when someone guesses the song OR if no one can correctly guess the song by tonight (1/18) at 11:59 EST. then the person who guessed the song closest without passing it in track listing order will win! (Think The Price is Right rules — closest without going over).  Good luck!!
My guess would be Hard Day’s Night! That one was my favourite as a kid :)   [wl](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/16M8BZ7HHTBW3?ref_=wl_share)
I’m going to guess Yellow Submarine 😊  Also welcome!  [list](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/ls/?ref_=navm_em_lists_0_1_1_5)

I am stalking this thread like crazy because I’m dying to know. I had a few in mind and my Beatles loving Nana talked me out of the one I was originally gonna choose and it hasn’t been guessed yet and if it’s that one I might just cry (jk lol) But I’m seriously invested!!

I’m going to guess Michelle!  [WL ](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3QA0DVUSNFLCJ?ref_=wl_share)
So, what was the correct answer? 👀
That wordplay was so clever! I cant believe I didn’t think of that when naming my wishlist, haha
One of my wife's favourite Beatles songs, she even tries to get the kids to sing along when watching the Yellow Submarine movie.
Good morning to you too, and thank you so much for the warm welcome! In My Life is my favorite Beatle song of all time, I’m so glad that you brought this cover to my attention! I’m so excited to give it a listen!! :)
White Album is the best album. Definitely my favourite of them all, anyway.
I love Regina Spektors version of this
Yes go ahead!!
Revolution number 9 would be my second guess
I love this one!
I love that song
Yes but what?
Oooh I love this one so much.
Thank you so much!! :)
Welcome!! I’m new here too! :)
This was gonna be my guess.  So good!
I like Michelle :)
I’m going to guess Michelle cause it’s my favourite!  [WL](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3QA0DVUSNFLCJ?ref_=wl_share)
Thank you for the tag lovely
I didn’t think I was prepared to hear Jim Carey cover I Am the Walrus, but that was actually pleasantly surprising, haha! Thank you so much for sharing that!!
I was *not* prepared for this, but I’m definitely here for it.
Love this song ! <3
Edit to add my list and also correct my grammar! It's I've just seen a face  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/39TB29E5XR07X?ref_=wl_share
In My Life is my favorite song too!!
Now I’M curious as to which one you were originally going to pick!
It was Martha My Dear from the White Album!!
I'm kinda sad no one has said Savoy Truffle or Octopus Garden. I love those too! It was hard to pick just one lol
The White Album is definitely my second favorite album, it’s incredible!!
Oooh, I’ve never listened to her version. Thanks for the recommendation!
That version is so incredible!
Yay! Okay: If I Fell  I Saw Her Standing There   Back in the USSR
Hold Me Tight
Ticket to ride
It won’t be long
Me too. It’s a family favourite
Me too! It’s one of my favorites!
How's it going for ya? This sub seems so wholesome
Ive never heard that one.
You commented under me. Dont forget to put it as its own top comment to enter. :)
Jim Carrey's version is definitely a lot better than you'd expect.  I'm assuming you've heard Robin Williams do a version Come Together with Bobby McFerrin ([Audio only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_7xoC6k7PA))
It's a great song and full of meaning for me. It's great to see more fans out here! 💚💚
I see now someone chose it right after my comment. It was While My Guitar Gently Weeps. There were a few others too, as I was working with my Nana who was an original Beatles fan when they were alive, lol.
I just keep thinking of more guesses that people haven’t said yet. After midnight you should let people guess a second time, lol. Or just guess a bunch til one of us gets it, not to count toward who wins, just for funsies😅😅
Ooooh! What a good choice!
Has anyone guessed the correct song yet?
Isn’t it! I first heard it watching Kubo and the two strings which is an amazing film
I hate to say this but it’s still none of those 😅
I know right? It seems so lovely! So far everyone’s been so kind and welcoming, it has such a positive vibe! I’m so excited to start gifting!!
It’s really pretty!
Oops! Thanks :)
It really was, I cant believe the man can actually sing! And I actually have heard that!
It’s so cool that your nana was a fan when they were together!! I’m relieved that it wasn’t While My Guitar Gently Weeps because I would’ve felt SO bad! Haha
I’ll totally leave it open for more guesses (that don’t count) for a half hour after midnight so feel free to comment all your guesses because I’m curious as to what you think it could be!! 😊
Not yet, I cant believe it! There have been so many good answers and no one has picked the one. People have come close though!!
I’d honestly rather that be the case than have one I thought of but didnt choose be the right one 😂
Yesss! Me too, I'd like to do a contest too 😄
Lol me too! 😂😂
YAY!!!
Wow, that’s crazy! Hope someone gets it soon!
Your song choices were fantastic though! I’ll definitely be doing more contests like this one again soon and I have a feeling you have a fantastic chance!
You totally should! This is my first one and I’m already hooked, I just know I’m going to be doing this all the time!
Yay! Are you gonna post what song it was??
Nvmd just saw it lol
I can’t believe no one picked it, I’m genuinely surprised!

KotH is a part of my childhood and I might have an addiction to all of the potential meme formats lol

You giving me some good ideas. I next step I gotta figure out how to make fancy edited gifs like I'm seeing here.

Thank you!! Lol yeah we have a ton. I Love board games!! [Please ignore the mess](https://i.imgur.com/N07rIwX.jpg) but here is a majority of our board games. The kids have some in their room and we have some in ours too. Lol it might be an obsession

thanks for that link!
Yusssss thank you. The hips refuse jeans and the boobs refuse...any frickin top I try lol so I'm delighted to see this dress on a human I can relate too! It looks so wonderful on you!
I love Tainted Grail: The fall of Avalon, Cthulhu Death My Die, Kingdom Death, and Talisman in that order!  We are getting Middara soon though and I CAN NOT WAIT  How about you ?
Like plant plants? Yes!  When I get a house I want to have a ton of gardens!! [This is my window lol](https://i.imgur.com/chXZ48I.jpg) the flowers in the wine bottles are fake but all the rest is real
❤️ Thank you!!!!
Wow I have not heard of a single one of those. Dont mind me Im just googling away...   I like Lords or Waterdeep, Takenoko, Terraforming mars, Root and 7 Wonders duel!
Oh I seeee! I thought you owned the place you currently live in. I've been going crazy with the plants in our apt but I also don't have bunnies that would eat them lol. I do have cats like to destroy things though lol
ooo I have never played Terraforming Mars but I have heard really good things about it! Ive played Root and thought it was good! I love the art work! Lords of waterdeep looks good! I love the D&D games
yeah we have fencing that we keep up in our place so that the rabbits can only go in certain places. I want to go nuts with plants in the future but so far have kept it pretty much around the windows and in the kitchen. lol   nah, we live in an apartment. (third floor which I love and hate (depending on if its grocery day lmao)) We would like to get a house sometime soon but we have a few other expenditures coming up first.
Terraforming mars is good but its a very loooooong game. Took us three hours last time I played with my fiance, not including reading the rules!
Ugh learning the rules for new board games is always sooo loonnggg lol

When I was in my lower 20’s, we had a small party at my house. In between the drinking games, we were solving Rubik’s cubes. We had a knock on the door and in walked a police officer. He looked around, grabbed a Rubik’s cube, solved it, said there was a noise complaint but we were fine, handed back the cube, and left. It was the most random thing. 😂   [nifty Gifties](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/RF6V01S0PKH4?ref_=wl_share)
My most embarrassing memory, oh dear. It's been 6 years and I still turn red when I think about it. I'll make it as PG as possible.   I was living with my inlaws with my husband and two year old daughter for a short time and all shared a bedroom. At some point, a friend had sent a gag gift to my moms house in my name. A comically large adult item without packaging in a flimsy bubble mailer so it was clear what was in it. Thankfully, THANKFULLY OMG, it came while I was house sitting for them and they never even got to see it.    I eventually go home to my in laws and the package gets put on top of a waist height stand in my room and I thought nothing of it. A couple of days even pass and it the bubble mailer never moved so I forgot about it. Until I wake up one morning and I hear my father in law, who I have never heard yell and I perceive as a very quiet and reserved person, telling my daughter to "TAKE THAT BACK UP THERE RIGHT NOW AND PUT IT WHERE YOU GOT IT." And I'm just laying there confused because what could she have possibly gotten into? She walks in, using it as a lightsaber and I'm pretty sure I died at that moment.  I have never experienced that much blood running into my face at once, and all I could do was struggle to try to get my husband awake to share some embarrassment. When I did leave my room that day I made sure I had something to do away from the house 😅   We don't see eachother that often but I remember every now and then and I just hope it's a long forgotten memory for him😭  [Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/305H73RG7UYSE?ref_=wl_share)
Thanks for the contest!   [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2C27S36776I42?ref_=wl_share)  My brother passed away 5 years ago when he was 22, the summer after he graduated college. I have a lot of sweet memories of him, and I want to share the story of the best meal I ever had! I love telling this sweet story to keep his memory alive. My brother went to a very good culinary college to become a chef. Every summer, he would come home and say "what do you want me to cook?" My family would ask him to cook all kinds of fancy dishes. But I always asked for the same thing. My 2 favorite foods are chocolate-covered-cherries and steak. So, I wanted him to experiment and make a new recipe: A chocolate-covered-cherry steak. Every summer when he came home, I asked for a chocolate-covered-cherry steak. Every summer, he said, "No, that's gross!"   But! The summer after we both graduated college, we met up at my dad's house. He asked, "what do you want me to cook?" I asked for a chocolate-covered-cherry steak. And, guess what! He finally agreed. We went to the store, bought cocoa, bing cherries, red wine, and steak. We cooked it together (he told me what to do). The end result was a medium-rare pan-seared steak coated in cocoa powder and pepper with a bing cherry and red wine reduction drizzled over it. It was spectacular!
Hey Mage Michael :D  When I was a kid I had a hard time talking to people, so when I went to camp for the first time without knowing anyone already, I was very anxious. After the first hour of being there I just climbed a tree and swung on a swing. As it turned out, a girl my age was watching me, and when I went to sit down, she came up to me and asked if I wanted to be her friend. We're still close 11 years later and I'm so happy I was in the right place at the right time :)
My dog likes to pretend he’s a cat.

Hello hello!!  I recently visited a friend because she got a new dog and I wanted to meet it! When I got to her place, her boyfriend discreetly handed me what I thought to be a handful of Oreo thins. Overjoyed about being handed Oreos and slightly confused as to why he had been so secretive about it, I stood there, thanked him, and immediately took a bite. I quickly realized it WASN’T Oreos because of the taste and as my friend and her boyfriend sat and watched me with both amusement and confusion across there faces, he reassured me that what I had bitten into was “beef jerky”. Overjoyed once again because I love beef jerky, I took another bite before he could finish the sentence and let my dumbass know that it was beef jerky FOR THE DOG. Long story short it was the most embarrassed and equally grossed out I’ve been in a long time and my friend reminds me that I ate dog treats at least once a week now.
Hello. Here's my story.  About 5 or 6 years ago during the summer, I was at Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania for a basketball tournament. On one of our days off, all of the players, coaches and chaperones went to Hershey Park for the day and split up around the park. It started to rain and my group went into an arcade for shelter. Me being the dumb kid I was, I spent a $20 and got $20 worth of quarters because I thought we were going to stay longer until the rain stopped. It was my last $20 too. Unfortunately, the rain cleared up pretty fast and I was left with quarters in my pockets weighing me down. The next day, we went to a nearby mall to shop. Some players stopped in a Subway to eat lunch. I decided to order 2 Flatizzas with a drink. The lady at the counter said my total was like 7 or 8 bucks. I then proceeded to pull out 4 quarters. Then 4 more. And 4 more. By the 4th set of quarters, the lady was a little amused and my teammates were shocked and having a good laugh at my expense. I eventually paid the money but my teammates found it funny how I spent $20 on quarters. But hey, at least I could use the vending machine at the dorm.

I have a really cool story that I always forget about. When I was 15 I climbed the tallest mountain on the East Coast in the US. We went in August and it’s known for having the most erratic weather on the planet. We climbed up in one day and decided to stay on top of the mountain for the night and climb down the next day. We hiked to the cabin and played games with some cabin folk and ate dinner and went to sleep. The next morning we went to climb down and there was an actual blizzard. We had to go down so we hiked down the mountain (luckily once we got under the cloud like the blizzard cleared.) we make it all the way down the mountain just to be told by someone down there that “there is this crazy blizzard above the clouds right now 90 mph winds!” 🤦‍♀️ so yeah. I hiked down a mountain in a blizzard with 90 mile an hour winds.   Thank you for the contest! [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1BVB8G71MFKBJ?ref_=wl_share)
I have a twin brother and when we were little, my brother would get on his hands and knees and I’d stand on his back. He’d straighten up as as high as he could and I’d open the freezer. We’d sneak popsicles and ice cream quite frequently.   [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2V0AE6R80B0FP?ref_=wl_share) Thanks for the contest!

Thanks for the contest!    After being diagnosed with breast cancer I needed to have surgery to get the cancer out.  That morning different doctors and nurses were coming in and out of my hospital room with their preps for surgery.  Extra doctors and nurses came in for they were all trying their methods to get my wedding ring off so to avoid cutting it off. Finally, everyone left and I had a moment to breathe and try to calm down before they rolled me into the operating room. My sister was in the room with me and she was keeping me calm. A nurse walked in, asked me a few questions and took my vitals. She then told me the next person coming in is the Dr. who will place the blue dye into my breast so they can tell where the tumor is in surgery (I think that was it?). A few minutes later the Dr. walks in with his blue scrubs, closes the curtain and begins to walk to the side of the bed. When I see him I pull open my hospital gown and politely say, ‘let’s get this step over with, is it going to hurt?’. I am now laying in the bed bare chested and nervous. Then he says, with a look of surprise, “Mam, I am hear to cut off your ring” as he pulls up the cutting tool from his waist. I quickly close my gown and my sister bursts out laughing, I thought she was going to  pee her pants. I could not help but to join her because the entire cancer journey is surreal. Luckily, the gentlemen was chuckling too. I apologized and he cut my ring off.  It taught me, even though this was the hardest fight of my life, you have to still find the humor!!

Hello! My story is a little bit immature, but funny nuntheless.  Over the summer my friends and I were hanging out outside, with masks and social distancing of course, when we get the idea to order smoothies. We ordered them for delivery and while we were waiting we were thinking of a plan on how to "test" the delivery driver. Me, wearing braids because I had wet hair that day, decided that I would put on my mask, walk up to the delivery driver and asked if I could tell him a secret. (I'm really short, 4"10 at the time so with the braids and  height and if I changed my voice I could be the perfect embarrassed 10 year old) He said yes so I proceeded  to tell him that "I pooped my pants" and that "if I tell my friends they are gonna laugh at me". My friends where on the front porch laughing because it was so funny. After that he started to get out of the car and help me carry up the drinks. When we got to the porch he told my friends "Don't laugh at her she is only little. Thats not nice." When he was walking away I told them that I pooped my pants and I wanted to go home. Because it was so funny it was easier for them to pretend they were making fun of me. Once he left we all burst out laughing. It was a great day. In case you are wondering,  I did not actually poop my pants.   Wishlist: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1R2YPONWDUBZN?ref_=wl_share
A story I like telling people is... I was born on Friday the 13th, my brother was born on Friday the 13th, my parents were married on Friday the 13th, and my moms siblings were born on Friday the 13th! O\_O  [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/11VYRYDS31ECE?ref_=wl_share)
I am positive my grandparents house was haunted. When I tried to sleep in their basement I kept hearing creepy voices and noises. One time my brothers and my friend and I were alone in the house and we heard a door close and what sounded like someone with a walker or a cane walking across the floor but there was no one else there.
I LOVE telling this story because it’s sooo funny!  This story begins at the start of quarantine way back in March...  When everyone started adjusting to Zoom and Google meetings, it was only expected for mistakes to occur. All these things were new to us, after all.  Every now and again there would be little slip-ups like forgetting to mute your microphone, or audio trouble. But one particularly hilarious moment stood out from the rest; this one still gives me second-hand embarrassment.  I was on a Zoom call and it was dead silent. All of a sudden, a guy unmutes his mic, rips a HUGE FART, and then mutes again! Expectedly, everyone erupts into uncontrollable laughter. I felt so bad for him, but it was too hilarious of a moment not to laugh.  I speculate that maybe he thought he was unmuted and in an attempt to mute his fart, instead allowed us all to hear it! This was the highlight of my week.  I hope my silly story could get a chuckle out of you! ❤️   I have items under $5 on my misc. wishlist!  Thanks for the contest and the opportunity to share my silly story! 💨
Damn that guy was onto something!

Did it.
Oops sorry ... linking above. Thanks for your patience!  Yes, looking back there is a lot of good and bad to remember ... but the laughs are the best.  Another one just for you. I shaved my head after the first chemo for my hair was getting everywhere!  My friends stopped by and at that point it was hard for me to sit up I was so tired so I got out of bed and opened the door and there they were both with half a stretched dodgeball on their head to mimic baldness. I could not help but laugh so hard I had to go lay down again.😂  Or the time I told my five year old I was going to take my hat off in the house and he will see my bald head.  He cried for now mommy would look sick. Easy to ignore if I don’t look sick.  He gave me a big hug and said, “That’s ok mommy, I just won’t look at you.”. He honestly thought that was the solution smiling at me. I think I cried and laughed at the same time ... he was trying so hard to be brave. I caught him peaking at me around corners but he got used to it in a few days.   Sorry going on. this contest brought back a flood of funny moments on an awful journey. 😀

Hi! I’m Manny, I’ve been part of the group for a few months now kinda just getting the feel of things. I’ve written out an intro a few times and delete before posting because I get nervous 😅    I have the BEST bad girl in the world, my pup Jane. Shes my 8 year old baby, I was still living at home when I adopted her and hid her form my parents for a few months until.. she kinda chewed through my room door lol that was about 7-7.5 years ago.   I’m super into deep space/interstellar travel shows, facts, images, stores.. ANYTHING beyond this planet. Don’t get me wrong I love Earth but imagine a top golf on the moon 🌓 if you have an movie or show referrals shoot them my way!   Feel free to AMA!  Help me decide what to cook for dinner tomorrow?   a.) Chicken chile verde enchilada casserole   Or   b.) Lemongrass pork-chops with fried rice
The casserole sounds really good 😌
Heyy there!!!! I am a vegetarian but I'll still help- go with enchiladas
Hi, welcome! That’s so funny about your pup! The chicken chile sounds amazing, what’s your favourite dessert?
Glad i could add a recipe to your arsenal! By generic I meant any thing canned or premade. I prefer the ranchero sauce over enchilada. Ranchero sauce = acidic/tangy & enchilada sauce = smoky/bold
Hey and welcome! Do you have a favourite nebula? Is that a weird question? Lol
Welcome! I'm so glad you posted. No need to be nervous.   The chicken sounds delicious.   If you could tame any wild animal and make them a pet, which would you choose?
Welcome to RAOA, Manny.
Welcome:) we are glad to have you and Jane!
Welcome to the sub, Manny! Hope you'll enjoy your time here :D I vote for B.
I definitely say go with the pork chops, just reading it made my stomach grumble.  Welcome!

Lemongrass pork sounds amazing. Do you have the recipe?
Hello and welcome! First, Jane sounds absolutely adorable 💖  My vote is definitely for the lemongrass pork chops with fried rice! I love fried rice, though, so I'm biased 😂  Have you seen "Sunshine"? That's my favorite space movie. My husband is obsessed with outer space and so he always wants me to watch them with him. I'm happy to! I prefer the ocean, though. I'm hoping that when we pass, there's someone who is able to send his ashes to space and scatter mine over Challenger Deep.
Dude, Chicken chile verde enchilada casserole all ther way. And then pork chops and fried rice tomorrow.  That way you get both!   &#x200B;  Welcome.   Space is cool. Do you have any interstellar travel books you would reccomend? I recently finished stitching up a little  [planet bookmark.](https://imgur.com/gallery/E4W14G1) Part of my exploration of space things. As a biologist, I've always been really busy with biology things but I like science in general as well and am exploring space things right now. Do you have a favorite planet, or nebula, or constilation, or...etc lol?
Welcome, I joined today as well, looking forward to this community  I think chicken would be good!  I've tried chicken only once, since I am a vegetarian, but I like all types of fancy dishes *cries in veg sushi* haha
Welcome to the sub, Manny!! Lemongrass pork chops sound absolutely delicious so that's my vote.   Question: What's your favorite ice cream flavor?
Enchiladas are always the answer!
Welcome! If I'm invited for dinner, then the pork chops sound great. Can't handle the spicy stuff! I assume you must already watch Dr Who?
Hi! Welcome to the sub! Enjoy this amazing community of people!! What is your favorite dessert?? Also lemongrass porkchops sound delicious
Hey, and welcome.  You've probably seen some of it already, but I really enjoyed **Red Dwarf** for a laugh.  As for dinner, I'm putting my order in for the Pork-chops with fried rice.
You want enchiladas.  I have an irrational fear of space, but it does seem cool to play golf on the moon!  DOGGOS ARE AWESOME!
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁    I say cook both and then you have the next one for the following note for dinner lol🙃    Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Welcome!   And oh my god how did you manage to hide a puppy for a few months? What about taking her outside or noises? I can't imagine the shock on your parents face when 1. a dog suddenly appeared and 2. you told them you already had her for a while! xD Can we get a pic? :)     Also I'm voting for the  a.) Chicken chile verde enchilada casserole  because that sounds super deliciousss
Yas! I learned the recipe years ago on my first job as a cook. The left over chicken I sometimes use as a topping for nachos. I think I’m convincing my self of the casserole now lol
Oh! How long has your diet been meat free? I was vegetarian between high-school and my second year of college. I caved for burger after eating the same vegetarian options offered on my meal plan in the food court at the time.
Dessert is TOUGH. Have you tried deep fried plantains with sweetened condensed milk? I literally almost cried the first time I tried it. How bout yourself?
Eskimo or red spider nebula! Not weird at all! What’s yours?
This was hard but Vampire deer! Such a peculiar animal.. like why the fangs, deer?
Thank you! Wonderful group (:
Thank you! Noted your vote for the chops, it’s so close!😆
Yes! I’ll post the link of the recipe below. My only modifications were that instead of stalk lemongrass, I used lemongrass purée also if you have air fryer, TRY IT. It so good and much easier to clean after cooking. I honestly could tell no difference in flavor from using store bought purée vs the stalk lemongrass.  [lemongrass pork chops!](https://www.vietworldkitchen.com/blog/2009/04/vietnamese-restaurantstyle-grilled-lemongrass-pork-thit-heo-nuong-xa.html)
Fried rice is is something I could eat everyday tbh, simple and substantial.   I haven’t watched it but I’ll add it to the list! You know, I LOVE the thought space, traveling to other planets, experiencing new worlds but always forget how are own oceans are vastly unexplored. Deep sea animals like siphonophores and those we haven’t even discovered fascinate me so much. Does wanting to send my ashes straight towards the sun sound crazy? Lol 😅
The Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson! If you’re into podcast, try Wolf 359 you’ll be hooked!   Eskimo nebula and red spider nebula are my favorite. Yourself ?
Welcome to you as well, I posted a super easy veggie enchilada casserole dish a few comment below, you might like it! I only ever eat veggie sushi, raw fish and me don’t mix very well 😅😅
Thank you!   Mango!! Anything mango 🤤
Ahh yes! This is the way
Yes! I have a small obsession with Dr. Who(it’s bigger on the inside) 😊
My favorite dessert is deep fried plantains drizzled with sweetened condensed milk. I had this for the first time a few months ago, ITS AMAZING 🥲
Omg, thanks for the new show!! Starting this tonight 😊
I see the force is strong with you 🤣
Happy new year! If I cook both, they’ll both be gone by today lol my housemates LOVE when I cook too much food, they make sure it doesn’t go to waste lol  My favorite holiday has to be Halloween, only time of the year I can show up to bar in my power rangers, wookie or mandalorian costume.  I love nature’s ability to subtly reward you when you respect it, the peaceful silence and general balance.   Appreciate the warm welcome!
I found her on my way back from school, I was maybe 17-18 years old, she was skin and bones. I gathered whatever cash I had, hopped on my bike and went straight to Banfield. I couldn’t afford ANYTHING. Luckily someone, some precious soul overheard me essentially crying and payed half my bill which prompted banfield to donate the rest. Unfortunately I still couldn’t afford to keep her there so I took everything home and administered the IV myself. Jane honestly wouldn’t move, eat or play for a at lest two months.. until she decided she felt well enough to plan her escape. Now she’s 60 pounds of couch potato lol Diapers, sneaking out at night and leaving my TV on all day worked wonders, also helped that my  parents were never really home until the late evening.   She won my parents over in like two days but they didn’t fix my door until I could afford to pay for it myself. That part SUCKED. Also of course! Let me see if I can set up an imagr link since I can’t post pictures in the comments, I’ll edit it in a bit!(:  EDIT:  https://ibb.co/ftM4JgX https://ibb.co/G0p79FC https://ibb.co/7pT14r9  I know you asked for one but ahhh🥰
My entire life lol. Can't crave something you've never eaten
I’ve not but that sounds so good! I love a treacle pudding but ask me tomorrow and it’d be a different answer haha! Hope you enjoy the sub :)
Definitely the veil nebula!
Haha! That's a very good answer. Thank you
Thankyou that's amazing x
Omg, you're going to love it! It's so good.  That doesn't sound crazy at all! I wonder if it will be possible in the near future. Technology is constantly improving, so you never know.  I know! I think the oceans are the final frontier. We have no idea what is lurking in the deep, silently sharing our plant
Ah Red Mars was a great book!   I personally don't have any favorites, they're all just so gorgeous. The colors are amazing. I wish I could embroider one but I have no idea how to even think about attempting it.
Ohhh thanks! Ll take a look at that, I've been cooking some recently, I tried the raw fish one once, also the caviar, I just don't understand it lol
Wow that sounds incredible!!
This is just blowing my mind I was just telling another person out of a 100 people that had their hello post that I spoke to about 80 of you love your Halloween very interesting.
Ohhh what a great doggo! <33
Woah! Very true, do you ever consider things like beyond meat etc?   I make a really good vegetarian enchilada base mix you could try: whole black beans, brown rice, spinach, corn, any ranchero or generic enchilada sauce, jack and cheddar mix, chili powder and salt to taste. I usually just layer it like lasagna but with corn tortillas.   When I have time I add zucchini, potatoes or even broccolini and it’s SO good.
I think it has to do a lot with the freedom you get on Halloween to express yourself, be a kid again. If it was about drinking and partying then maybe st Patrick’s day or something might be the top pick but Halloween is the only time I can play the part of a intergalactic bounty hunter, walk into a party or bar and have people play along as opposed to just staring me down in confusion.
Nope never considered that before!! Though thanks for this recipe will surely give this one a try! Though I'll have to learn how to make a generic enchilada sauce !!

So close to the Superbowl but the season is over for us Saints fans. Still, it was a good season and what has finally broken me and gotten me into football after almost 29 years. So tell me who your favourite Saints player is and why you love them. They don't have to be your favourite team but bonus points if they are. Have something Saints related on your list, preferably. And preferably 20 or less but we'll see haha You can add something if you don't have anything yet but please don't just add things for the sake of getting freebies.    Rules  1. Have an Intro 2. Have gifted before 3. Be a nice lad or lady 4. US only cuz shipping can be expensive, sorry   Ends when I wake up tomorrow/today whatever you wanna call it. Sometime on the 18th
I put a Saints backpack on my misc. wishlist! My boyfriend is a Saints fan so I know he’ll love it! His favorite player is Brees.  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
/u/georgiamouton1981 You're a Saints fan, right?
I would enter but I know nothing about football 😂 I hope you have a fun Super Bowl though!!
Sorry about the Saints! My boyfriend is a big fan too and he is sad too. My favorite player is Alvin because that man is a machine and he got me to my fantasy playoffs
Sorry about the Saints :/ the most I keep tabs on football is with the Seahawks (who's odds seem pretty good this year) so I'm not really entering. BUT! I wanted to drop by and say hey because you a boss, fish-tuxedo
Not entering. I'm a huge football fan and I was really rootiin' for Drew Brees tonite. I think he's a great quarterback and it's going to be sad if he retires. I'm a Steelers fan and I thought Ben was going to retire this year, but I guess he's comin' back next year. I think he and Drew got in the NFL at the same time.
Chiefs fan here! Just dropping in to say hello and not to enter! It always sucks when the season ends 😢
I was pulling for the Saints because Brady is a whiny sack of horse shit. Plus, I wanted to see Brees go one more time before he called it. Otherwise, I’m a Cowboys person as I grew up less than a mile from Texas Stadium (RIP). Also, my grandfather would haunt me if I weren’t. Ha ha
I’m always loved Alvin Kamara. Great personality and handled the brees scandals with class. Beast on the field also!
can't join because I'm new and haven't got to chance to gift yet, but as a Ravens fan I'm sorry for your lost🙏🏻 its been tough for us finishing the season with lamar having a concussion 😢, but after the Ravens lost I rooted for the saints as I love brees. at least it was a good game, both of the group definitely played in a super bowl level
I usually don't enter but I'm from La so it's compulsory for me to love the Saints lol. My brother and sister in law are obsessed with them, too. They watch every game and are hoarse the day after... Every game. They even named their daughter Brees after Drew Brees. We bleed gold is what I'm sayin'. I gifted my bil a painted rock from the superdome and he cried so I have an autographed picture of Drew Brees that I would like to get for him and his family in my wishlist. They are about to pay off a small house they were able to find so it would make an amazing house warming gift and would likely make him cry again... Which is always fun lol. They're heartbroken over his NFL career being potentially over. I don't understand that whole aspect but it's hard not to get into games when we watch them over at their house. They'll also always have a place in my heart since they win that first super bowl the same year I graduated high school (don't look that up, I'm old). Anyway, thanks for the interesting contest!
GAHHH MY HEART IS BROKEN. How did we lose to the BUCCS AND BRADY?! I've been a dedicated Saints fan since 2006. As a Katrina refugee, it was one thing that I looked forward to, seeing people talk about my home in a good way. I like Harris or Lattimore currently and Hartley as my favorite overall. I can't tell you why, I just liked him lol.  While I haven't gifted yet, I just wanted to say I'm sad and GOSH DARNIT.  Edit: I didn't realize I couldn't enter without gifting (I can't read all the time lol) sorry!
I've been a Colts fan since I was 10, so 26 years. They played the Saints in the  Superbowl for the 2009 football season.  Since that day, I have always maintained that my favorite Saints player ever was Peyton Manning during that game 😂  He played like trash, Colts lost, and they haven't been to the Superbowl since 😭
Okay, I know you must have misread that but thanks for the sweet sentiment 😂  We ain't going to the superbowl after tonight
Watching him play in the Vikings game...dude just couldn't be stopped! It was amazing to see that!
Nah you are! But bring some of them donuts for us to mourn! 😂😂
Def does haha this is my first football sad
Absolute fuckin beast! Like the Billdozer irl 😂 but hopefully without the sad life later on
I think I remember bf telling me about that announcement earlier today! Sorry to hear! Yeah it definitely was...well I expected it would be this tough since this was nearing the end game here so yeah...just was super excited to see the first ever team I rooted for to go all the way!
Oh 😂 case in point haha, I don’t know a bit about your sport. Hoping for you next year though
His 54 fantasy points made my week 😂😂
I really should get more donuts to share! I may have eaten them all... [but I have this to offer.](https://youtu.be/NXfC16rv_fs)
yep it was definitely hard, and I hear you wanting to see your first team go all the way, me myself only started watching a few years ago and missed our win with Flacco, but I'm glad I'm getting to see them improving as they really really sucked with Flacco when I started watching 😂 let's hope for a saints Ravens superbowl next year 🤝💪🏼
Hey, I barely know anything but this is getting me into it. Saints players (for the most part cuz I've heard some sketchy shit about Winston) really seem so passionate and wholesome and that's more than just rooting for a team to me so I can get behind this. Brees and Kamara are wonderful, sweet people.
I imagine so 😂 I heard about his story about the kids  bicycle and the cleats though and it warmed my cold, shriveled heart lol
Nothing better than an egg from Mantis Toboggan in these trying times!
Hell yeah! Here's to some friendly rivalry! And the Saints beating yall of course ;)
I can understand that 😂 I love when talented/famous people also seems nice and down to earth. Can’t help but root for them
He is honestly pretty cool. I used to be a fan of Brees because I’m a purdue grad but after his statements last summer (I don’t wanna get political) he’s not my fav! But they are such a good team I’m sorry they didn’t make it!
I KNEW you were someone with good taste!
I need to get caught up for sure but I LOVE IASIP haha

Hello!  (Sorry I’m on mobile) Buckle up and join me for my very late post contest introduction!  Hi! My name is u/spizzlespacemom18 or better known as C ☺️ I am a mom of two awesome human kiddos and an awesome fur kiddo! I have been on Reddit for a little over a year now, I didn’t really begin to do anything more than lurk until the 2020 secret Santa exchange.  In November I gave birth to my second child and got hit pretty bad with PPD, the secret santa exchange brought some real life magic into my home while I worked on getting my mental health back.  I am a massive Harry Potter nerd and I LOVE reading. I rarely take time for myself, reddit has reminded me that self care is important and that it is okay to have hobbies, even as a mom. Recently I have started making perler items and drawing handmade postcards for a sub reddit.  I really have fallen in love with reddit (yeah I know, late to the game) it is nice to have a social profile that focuses more on my brain, heart, and personality than my looks.  I could bore you guys all day, but thank you for welcoming me into your group! ♥️  Edit: my fur babe is a pup named Phoenix!   I am a slytherin and my children are casually named with subtle slytherin references!

Hi, welcome! 😀
Hello and welcome, fellow Slytherin 🐍🖤💚  No human kids of my own here, but I've got a 10 year old pit bull named Major Tom and he's my baby 💖💖💖 I also have a couple of kids who occasionally refer to me as "math momma" 😂 Comes with the teaching territory.  You're going to love it here; this place is kind of magical. The community is so welcoming and everyone is super fun and friendly.  What is your favorite Harry Potter moment?
Hey welcome fellow Slytherin!
Wingardium leviosa!! 🤗🤗   I freaking love that you subtly named your kids after slytherin!!
Hi! Welcome! What's your favourite fictional animal?
Hi and welcome! If you had six snakes what would you name them?
Hello and welcome! Mind explaining what perler is? I love crafting and good on you for making time to do so!
Hello! How are you?
Thank you ♥️ it has taken me a long time to understand this.
Hello! I just finished reading a fantastic book by Augusten Burroughs, You Better Not Cry! I would love to read the Bridgerton Series next!
Hello! Thank you! She is a joy and my older kiddo is such a good big sibling! My favorite holiday is Hallowthankschristmas 😂 but really, I love halloween the most. I just am partial to the October - December holidays!   I worked with special needs children and young adults for years as a swim teacher and care giver, I love that we have that in common.   I also love nature! I am excited to get back into hiking now that I am not pregnant!   Thank you for such a warm welcome!   Random fact : I am a slytherin
Hello!  I get joy from holding my husbands hand! Also making people smile!  What about you?  I am excited to be an active part of this community ♥️
Cats are fantastic! I should have specified I have a pup! ♥️
Thank you so much for your kind words! This is a big reason why I love Reddit, thank you!
Hello ! Thank you!
Hello! This one is a bit difficult as I have so many favorites! My favorite scene would probably be In the first book and movie, Harry’s first Christmas at Hogwarts!
Hello!!
Yes! Our house has an  Ivy, Jade, and Phoenix 😂😂 both girls names mean green.  Also my husband is a slytherin as well. 😂😂 I am going to make them love it as much as me hopefully!
I tried to make it casual without being obnoxious, after all, they do have to live with these names.
Hello! My favorite fictional animal is a wookie. Hands down! How about you?
Hello! I would name them Rufus, Theodore, Astrid, Clementine, Colette, and Sigmund.
Perler beads are the small plastic beads that you can make designs out of and melt down with an iron!
I'm fine and you?
(◍•ᴗ•◍)❤
LOL what is the slitherin? And I love the way that you blended your holidays I thought there was cute I actually had to read it twice lol
I also enjoy making people smile. I love gifting people randomly when I have the money without them knowing. That is the best feeling hehe :D
Or maybe I’m just crazy tired! I was supposed to be asleep hours ago, lol  Regardless welcome :-)
I love it too! This has been a great place for me with my own struggles and it makes me happy to see this community lift other people up too. I think we'll be good friends 😊
Depending on their ages just tell them you hate it! They may love it because of that! 😀😀😀🤣🤣🤣 Reverse psychology!! 🤣🤣 That, or just jam it down their throats at every possible opportunity! Whatever works!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'd say maybe....a harpy? They're pretty neat!
Oh neat! I think I had those at one point. They were fun
A Slytherin is a house from the cult classic Harry Potter series! Also thank you! I find it so hard to choose but I tend to lean towards the spooky side of things just slightly more than the cheerful side!
How fun! What a joyful thing to be able to do! 🥺 I would like to also do this!
:D I am also avoiding sleep by scrolling through reddit!
Yes! I would enjoy that!
😂😂 they are both under 3 so I think I am going to try exposure 😂😂
Fantastic! I love wookies because they look snuggly. 😂😂
Yes! My two year old loves character magnets so I have been making her Disney characters for the fridge!
Well thank you for teaching me something new. There is many people here that love their spooky things and love Halloween all year round so I know the you're gonna have a great time
Yeh it is. I am currently broke as hell, but when I get some extra cash I will for sure
🤣 yes probably the best plan! My first plan was for the pre-teen, teen age range! You know, when they hate how you breathe/move/exist. 🤣🤣
Clever! Have you posted any of them on r/somethingimade or r/crafts?
I love that! I cannot wait!
Same here!! ☺️ I hope you have a fantastic week!
Ugh! I am not ready! 🥴🥴
I have not! I will have to join!
Just be sure to pop into the daily thread every day and that's where you'll find all the excitement and gets to meet everybody
You too!😁😁😁😁
💝 you've got a looooong way. 😀😀
Good to know!! I will!
You are not wrong! Ill have two teen girls at once!
Yikes!!! That just means double the love...right guys....? Right?? 😖😖😂😂😂
😂 I feel for my husband, he is out numbered!
My dad was outnumbered too. 2 daughters and my mom. We gave my dad the votes of the cats to at least balance the scales! 😂😂😂 I'll never forget the day that happened. We were having a playful family disagreement about something, and my dad had HAD ENOUGH. 🤣🤣🤣 He laughed and said, "I am a MAN! I am outnumbered! That's it, I get the votes of the cats from here on out!" 🤣🤣🤣 The scales suddenly became tied! Hahaha
That is hilarious! My dad and mom had 5, 3 boys 2 girls and there were two sets of twins, I was always the swing vote!
🤣🤣🤣 you held ALL the power!! Ooohhh and you can leverage your choices! Man, I wouldve had so much fun with being the swing vote! 😂
😂😂 it was always an event! Still is! I told my husband that would be the perk of having 3, there would never be a tie!
True!! 🤣 Only problem is if the kids join forces....then may the odds be ever in your and your husbands favor! 🤣🤣
I have also seen that happen! You may be right! Two girls is plenty 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣

I last went to Vermont summer of 2019. We were supposed to go on our honeymoon in August 2020, but that did not happen. :/
A place to hike🥰 it was really pretty and we got to see a waterfall and tons of streams. How about you?
... I went to Disney when I was four.  I've got a mini-holiday planned for later this year, but it fully depends upon the state of the world.
I went to Florida to see my best friend who moved there for an aquarist job. I had a terrible time in general, but was glad I got to see and spend time with her. That part was good and worth it.
The beach!
My last vacation was a road trip to Boston with my fiancé in October 2019. We stayed in Albany on the way there. And while in Boston we did a day trip to Salem on Halloween. It was such an amazing trip; Boston was gorgeous and it was fall and I was so happy ❤️
I went to hawaii right before the pandemic hit to see my family that lives there!
I haven't been on a vacation since camping in Utah about 20 years ago. Yikes. 😟
Whitefish, Montana!
Estes Park Colorado! We absolutely love it there and try to go when we can!
I feel like my last vacation was to Cabo bc it was so relaxing and like a real vacation!!  But my last trip was to S Korea same time u/gillbeans was there!! How crazy is that! I don’t really consider it a vacation as much bc it was visiting family during a really rough time in my life. But seeing family was sooo awesome!! I was just talking to my mom about random memories from our trip earlier tonight!!   Where’d you go last?
Tokyo, January 2020.
Long ago, in the before times, I went to the island of Crete. It was amazing and I told my at the time boyfriend I wanted to bring him there to walk along the beach at sunset.   3 years later and we were supposed to go on our honeymoon but we doubt we'll be allowed to :(
My husband and I went to Germany two years ago. We were supposed to go to Mexico last year but we canceled it because of the coronavirus.
I had a fabulous birthday trip to New York City only a few days before everything shut down due to Covid-19.
We went to Knoxville, TN!
Vacation?  I have heard that word before - like 400 years ago - oh, someday I might get to take one!  It has been a very very long time!!  4 years. ☹️
We went to Louisville (short drive from where I currently live) in September because we had to cancel our Paris trip and stayed at a fancy pants hotel for dirt cheap thinking that we wouldn’t have to leave the room because we could get room service and just watch movies and eat junk food.  Well.....  All of the services in the hotel were closed. Even though they said on their website they’d be open.  We still managed to have fun, though. The city was basically empty because of Covid so we really didn’t need to worry about crowds or whatever. We saw some tourist spots and were literally the only people there. Drove around and saw some beautiful neighborhoods and architecture. Had the best chicken of my life.
Arizona.. nothing like a desert sunset!
The mountains so we could be isolated in a different place. My in laws are my bubble so it was a fairly covid friendly vacation ❤
I just went to London and Tibet. The postcards really sold the staycation 🤣
Last February, I visited Olympia WA on an all too brief birthday getaway.
I went to Colorado!
I went to London during Christmas of 2019. I wanted to go to Italy but then covid happened.
Sapporo, Japan and was supposed to go again but corona happened :(((
Fort lauderdale, Florida, it was the first vacation in over 5 years
We went to the mountains
Oahu in April 2019 for our daughter’s  HS marching band trip.
Summer of 2019 we did a road trip, stopping in Kingston and then to the Ottawa valley to visit my inlaws.
My last vacation was to home a week ago!  Well, at least I had some days off there.
My last vacation was for my wedding. We drove to Eureka Springs AR to the Crescent Hotel and also did a bunch of silly touristy things~
My last vacation was to the outer banks summer 2019! With my family and boyfriend. It was wonderful
Toronto, January 2020. It feels so long ago and it was a short trip too, which made me a little sad
So for me, it was doubly special. All my life I grew up in a home where we were never financially able to have vacations. The concept was totally foreign to me. My husband and I took my first flight on an airplane to Mammoth, CA, also the first time I saw snow!
Kentucky when I wasa 15, 25 years ago.
I went to Vegas for my honeymoon in 2/2020.
Disneyland right before it closed!
Vegas 😅
South Korea, Dec 2018 - Jan 2019. Spent Christmas and New Years there. I was looking forward to the snow but nothing.  My friend that lives there, recently sent me videos of snow. Apparently, I wasn't so lucky during my visit. Haha
Huntsville, Alabama to visit friends.  Great town! Great friends!
Spain! Went there with my mom in summer of 2019.
i went to greenwood lake which is in upstate new york, it was lovely!
Seattle, Feb 2020!
Tokyo and Kyoto, January 2020. I also went to my home country to visit my family and friends in December 2019. I am hoping that I will be able to visit them again this year...
Was supposed to go to Iceland/the UK in august for a wedding but...you know  So a hotspring tour here in Alberta with my mom/sister in 2018? We took a week off and drove to the mountains and checked out random springs and camped in our truck.
France, sept. 2019
Chicago. We went there at the end of October. 3 days.
Portugal, Algarve
Kassiopi, Greece 🇬🇷
Domestically: Quebec City QC (February 2020) Internationally: Savannah GA (November 2019)  It makes me want to cry that it’s been so long since I’ve been able to travel. That 4 months between those two trips was about as long as I’ve ever gone without heading somewhere even for a weekend!
Last January I went on a trip round SE Asia which was incredible, managed to make it home just in time as my connecting flight was in China right when they started cancelling all the flights. I've never seen Beijing airport so empty!  Last summer I was in Spain, but that was to visit family so I wouldn't really count it in the same way but it was lovely as I just spent a couple weeks relaxing in their pool with my Kindle.
Last march I went to Zell am See in Austria to ski! It is my favourite place to ski and I miss it already!
Within the UK: our last trip was to Devon last October. We ate loads of ice cream and drove over the moors and it was great.   Outside: We went to Kos in Greece in August 2019. It was the best experience ever and I hope we get to travel again this year!
A lake near where I used to live! I really enjoyed it, and had an awesome time.
My last vacation was one of the last cruises before the pandemic. We took a Disney cruise to Cozumel, Mexico. And it was incredible!
Italy! So glad we had the chance to go before all of this happened.
Wasnt really a vacation but visited spouse family- they run a funeral home, they embalm and stuff (Beorne , Texas). I cooked them meals, we played games, last trip with our dog two years ago, came home. (Real vacation was about a decade ago)
Last actual vacation...Kauai. Amazing place.   Last time I went out of state though? Last Christmas, we went to visit in laws in the DFW area. This year we haven't gone anywhere haha. It's not exactly a vacation for me, but it was out of state and I did get to take a couple days off work.
Last was to tube the river in Texas! :) Looking fwd to getting back to Puerto Rico this year too :)
Lisbon, Portugal! It was so relaxing and beautiful there
My last vacation was in March 2020 just before lockdown. We went to do the California Route 1 Pacific Coast Hwy drive.
Michigan's upper peninsula a couple of summers ago. Swimming in lake superior was surprisingly not as cold as I had been told!
Dang, I think it was out honeymoon to Toronto in September 2018. We usually go to SoCal for thanksgiving as that’s where I’m from, but I wouldn’t consider it a vacation as there are too many family obligations.
Greece in November 2019! My brother was studying abroad there so we used visiting him as an excuse to go ourselves! It was a wonderful experience!
New Orleans! December 2019, it was my bf and i’s first trip together!
It was about a month ago. Flew to FL and GA. I am 46 yrs old and have been married twice now. This is my first real, adult vacation since leaving my parents home.  I guess I just finally found a real man that likes to do things with me other than use me, and likes to make me smile. 🥰
The year was 1988. My family decided faces carved into a rock was a great vacation. It was cloudy when we got to Mt. Rushmore. The end.
Oh nooo!!! What a huge bummer! When you finally do go, it will feel that much sweeter, now.
Oooh waterfalls. They’re so cool.
Here’s hoping all will be well by then!
Oh nooo! I’m sorry to hear that. And glad it didn’t taint your entire experience. Maybe she can visit you next. Lol.
Ooooh beach vacations are my favorite!
You braved Salem on Halloween? I had to do school portraits on Halloween maybe 20 years ago and got outta there as fast as possible. It's soooooooooo crowded.
Oooh how was Salem on Halloween? Anything neat going on?
Supposed to go in March. Recommendations?
Oh man!!! So jealous! I *wish* that was my last vacation. Although I did spend my last vacation on an island off the southern coast of America. Hawaii is pure paradise!
Damn, you really need to be good to yourself and take one please!
If I win the lotto, I’ll def be sending you on a vaycay my dear. A girl can dream, at least.
I’d love to go to Utah!! Which park was your favorite?
Sounds lovely.
I’ve visited there a few times many many years ago
My honeymoon was there! We had no money but my parents bought us two nights in the Stanley Hotel. It's so pretty and I love the shopping, even if it was mostly just window shopping for me!
I do too as well also. One of my favourite places on Earth. Good thing I live around the corner.
I’m sorry you traveled there under such tough circumstances. ☹️
Ooooh!!!
“Have you got plans tonight? I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight. I’m a couple hundred miles from Japan and I can’t seem to get you off my mind”
Awww man. I’m sorry to hear that.   Crete sounds beautiful.
Nice! Germany is somewhere I’d love to visit
I hope you had a great time! If you don't mind me asking, what was your favourite thing and what was your most disliked thing about Germany?
Oh wow! Just think of all the people right after you that had to cancel and *still* haven’t been able to reschedule. You got lucky!
Alright! How long ago was that?
Aww that stinks. It’s a lot easier to travel when you’re pet free and kid free like me.
Wow. That sounds like it turned out to be an unforgettable time, in a good way! Ya kinda totally lucked out, despite the food and room service.
Ahhh. It’s been a few years since I was in Arizona. I adore Flagstaff
Oh I bet that was a nice break for you
Oh wow! Tres impressive!
Just before everything shut down 🥺
Love that place
Oh bummer!!! At least you got to visit London! Italy will still be there when this is over 🙂🙃🙂
I thought I replied to you already but I guess not. Yay for London! I hope Italy welcomes you back soon
Japan? That’s so freakin cool!!!
Ooo I’ve always wanted to go!!
Oh wow. Well-earned!
So pretty, I bet
Oh nice!! I’m obsessed with Hawaii
I used love a good road trip. Can’t take the long drives anymore, unfortunately.
Did you enjoy your visit?
What time of year did you go?
Oh nice! My sisters bf lives super close to there.
I hope you can go back as soon as all thissssss is over with
Oh wow! What a special trip!
That’s quite a long time ago 😔
Congrats!
That’s a scary place to be now
Did you get married? Visit with any 90 day fiancé “stars”?
Dang! I completely forgot I went to Korea, too! I was about to post my last vacation was to Cabo until I saw your post and was like oh shoot!! We were there at the same time!!
Oh darn!!! Other than the lack of snow, was it awesome?
Sounds like you had a great time’
Ooh spain!
Oh nice.
Whoop whoop
I've been to Kyoto but not Tokyo! What was your favorite thing about Kyoto?
Oh wow. Color me envious! My sister got to go to Japan and South Korea and she looooved it there
Oh man!!! Yeah, I had an iceland trip in the works as well. I really wanna see the Northern Lights. But realistically my body probably can’t handle that kind of trip anymore. I hope you still get to go!
Camping in truck sounds fun!
Nice!!
How was it?
Oooh nice!
Ooooh! I’m a bit jealous, not gonna lie. Lol
Oh man! Yeah, I feel ya, I’m used to going away a lot. I finally went through Georgia on a trip last year. Went through Atlanta
Both trips sound amazing!!!
Oh wow! No one else has said Austria.
Greece is somewhere I’d love to visit!!
Lake time is a great time!
Oooh it sounds incredible!
Wow. Italy!!
Sounds like a nice trip
Any time away counts right now lol I went to Kauai about...3 years ago. I loved it so much.
Oooh Puerto Rico!
Oh nice!
Ohhhh nice.
I’m not even sure I realized you could swim in it. I just assumed it was super brrrrr
Haha. I hear that!
Oh yeah! You def had to take advantage of him staying there! Very cool
Sweet! How’d it go?
Oh noooo! That’s some bs
Haha yeah we’re supposed to go in July! But we might get a placement by then. I keep joking around with my husband that we are going to land in florida and then as soon as we get of the plane get a call from our adoption agency that we have a match and need to be there ASAP. 🤣 I’ll happy accept that though!
NoU 🥰
Mine too!! It was just a day drip but I love it!
It was crazy crowded but so much fun. Of course, now when I look back I can’t believe I was comfortable in such large crowds!
It was so much fun! So many people dressed up and walking around. We did a ton of tours (witch museums, horror museums). It was amazing!
What island are you going to!
Wow where were you at!?
Trust me, I wish I could! My husband and I haven't even been on our honeymoon yet, and we've been married 7 years! When we start to get the money saved up, something always happens (job loss, car totaled, etc.)
Hahaha that is too sweet. 😘🥰
[Duck Creek](https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/232039) was the one we went to the most. It was very beautiful!
Such a pretty location!
We stayed at The Stanley once as well! I love that hotel so much! That’s so cool you’re honeymoon was there! You don’t need money with a scenery like Estes Park!! That’s awesome!
Nice!!! It’s a flight for me but can’t wait to visit again :)
Yea, that was a big downside but the big upside is now I want to go back when things are better and re-do the visit 😊🙂
Its okay, were going to Shetland for the summer solstice instead. We think we should be allowed to travel within scotland!
The Heidelberg Palace was my favorite. There wasn’t really anything I disliked about Germany itself, but a weird guy did grab my backpack when I was at the zoo which made the zoo kind of a bad experience.
I know I am beyond fortunate to have dodged Covid-19 given how many times I was among huge crowds. I did get sick 3 days later and my doctor's office closed or just refused to see me. After almost 2 weeks I went to urgent care. I had strep, a double ear infection, and a sinus infection. I was terrified in the meantime.
We went in February of 2020! Super fun. It was actually the second year we went to Tennessee
Oh yeah - I miss my 20’s when I could just take off but I also have become very comfy in my own house and with my own stuff.
Yeah it ended up being a pretty good time! We tried to eat at only local places, so we had a lot of fun finding stuff to do. Like we found an ice cream and pie shop that used all locally sourced ingredients (like the cream for the ice cream was from local cows type of thing). A delicious chocolate chip cookie from a coffee shop that made orders through a window because they didn’t let people inside (Covid). An amazing donut from a donut shop in an old brick building in an industrial part of town who also took orders in a creative way so you didn’t have to go inside. We got the best chicken of my life and enjoyed it while just sitting in the car and listening to music and laughing. And at night we drank local beer in our hotel room and ate junk food and watched Netflix.
Its crazy how much a change of scenery can be good for the soul ❤
Yes! What about you? Any travel plans?
I love Japan!!
You should!
Yes! It really was! Super needed!
It’s where I grew up, I love it so much
Me too!  We would live to move there some day!
it is an 8hr drive straight to the ILs.  Once the kids hit toddler stage we split it into a 2 day drive to get there and do something fun at the stopping point.  On the way home we power through all the way, getting home a little late isn't bad if its your own home.  My kid are now 10 and 12
Hugely.  They're coming up in about a week! <3
We were there back in November :)
I have a fear of heights but the plane was surprisingly okay. I’m sure I also made the locals laugh in my canvas tennis shoes lol. Hope you have a great evening!
Grew up poor and as an adult never really appealed to me.
Thank you! We were lucky to celebrate when we were able to!
I believe they are making it a vaccination center soon for Orange County
I got engaged! Hahaha
Oh wow, maybe we bumped into each other haha, where in Korea did you go? I mostly stayed in Seoul.
It was my second time going there, it was really fun. I love going to Korea and riding their subway haha (ours suck!) Oh and the food! Also their strawberries are delicious! If you ever go you should try it! Sweetest strawberries I've tried.
Yes we did!  It was just nice getting out of town. Plus with the pandemic driving we were able to control our environment. 🤪😀
Absolutely the traditional culture and architecture! I am so obsessed with learning about different cultures from all around the world, so that was my main reason for visiting Kyoto! Tokyo was super fun too, and it definitely has a different vibe than Kyoto does. And, if you're a Disney fan like me, Disney Sea is a must to visit.
Omg Japan is definitely one of my favorite countries to travel to... Tokyo was fun, but I love Kyoto better just for all the traditional culture and architecture there.
The Northern Lights are AMAZING. I've been lucky enough to see them a bunch of times here in Alberta. I hope you can see them one day :)
It's not bad, we put a big air mattress in the back, and wrapped up in sleeping bags
It was for a writing course. Very lovely and productive!
We had a good time. Saw museums and the aquarium. Ate food. I just wish I had been able to go to a club or something. I miss live music and well, it’s Chicago.
Yes! The reason i went there for was less amusing but it's my home!
The SE Asia one was incredible! I spent almost all of January just hopping around (primarily in Vietnam though) and so now I'm constantly getting those "On this day" to taunt me, especially since I took a lot of photos of my food and so now I really want Pho!  Unfortunately my dad is moving home from Spain so no more free accommodation there but oh well, by the time it's safe to travel again I'm sure I'll have saved up enough for a really good trip somewhere else.
It’s so beautiful!
I love it! I spent 6 weeks out there a few summers ago working with sea turtles. I felt like it had to be the first place I went with my partner.  And hopefully we'll be going back in the summer to celebrate his brothers wedding!!
It was amazing! It was a family vacation with my parents and so much fun.
Oh it's very cold, just not as bad as I thought!
Oh yeah. Adding babies to the family are def more important than vacations. 👶🏻👶🏽👶🏿
Oh and I last went to the beach!
🏝🌊
That's good. The people watching is a sport.
Wow. Sounds super freakin awesome!
Big island and maybe Oahu
Dauphin Island. Off the coast of Alabama. Very small island. But my family loves it!!!
Wtffff...girl...you gotta do something! It doesn't even have to be your dream vacation but just something relaxing and fun! Although I really do commend you for going so long without much of a break and keeping your sanity!
Beautiful!! Zion is on my list.
It really is. I enjoyed the elk walking around
You can do it!!!
Oh nice!!!
Ohh yes there is some awesome architecture!   Damn that sucks but good you noticed it!
Oh lord!!! You were dealing with a lot!!! Thank god for urgent care and meds!!!
I don’t think I’ve ever been there
I hear ya! I enjoy traveling but I also always enjoy coming home
Sounds practically perfect right about now!
Doesn’t get much better than good fried chicken and donuts!
Ain’t that the truth!
Me and my folks met up with my sister and her bf on a small island where we could easily socially distance ourselves while occupying a beach house right on the water. I hope to visit Hawaii again in the next few years!
Seems so cool!!!
I can’t speak the language anymore but one of my cousins can so I’m trying to convince him to go w me 😁
Did you have a blast??
Was it nice to be back home?
Same! I’ll never be able to afford it, though.
Takes me back to all the vacations my family took when I was a kid. Good times. Great times.
Your family?
That’s a pretty drive in November
Glad to hear your fear didn’t ruin the plane ride. I hope next time it’s more than okay! 😉
As long as you don’t feel like you’re missing out, it’s all good.
Absolutely
Oh wow. I hadn’t heard that
Sweet!!!
Haha how crazy would that have been?! I went to so many places but I wouldn’t be able to recall all the cities now LOL I just followed whoever was taking me somewhere 😂 I spent a few days at Jeju Island, too. I don’t think I spent too much time in Seoul, at least not as much as I would’ve liked. Totally missed my chance to go to Gangnam, too! Bummer!
Really? Who would have thought their strawberries would be so sweet! I want to try them, now!
Was anyone local actually wearing a mask?
I bet it was amazing
Even cooler!!
Maybe the future holds another trip with clubbing in your future!
Oh okay! Do you still live in Portugal?
Mmm pho! Well I wonder where you’ll go next!
Romantic!!!
I bet it was amazing!
I wish I could be of more help but I’ve Only ever been to Maui! But I hope you enjoy it’s a special place!
I’ve never heard of it!! Sounds wonderful!! I’m glad you got to go before all this craziness!
I didn't say I've kept my sanity... 🤪  Maybe eventually once my husband and I are both back to work and the pandemic is over with.
Same here! I’d love to retire there someday :D
Well, I wouldn’t be able to any time soon bc I have Big Booty w me! I thought about taking him w me but I wouldn’t want to put him through that! He has wayyyy too much separation anxiety to be able be taken care of while I’m away, too. But one day! 🙂
Hawaii sounds great. That's nice that you guys did a hang out an island.
Omg the food there is so gooooddd
My brother wants to teach English in Japan bows he wants me to drop out of school so I can join him 😂
It was awesome! The weather wasn’t as warm as I’d liked it to be so we didn’t swim, it was a week long, and we went to a bunch of nature walks and things
It was amazing. I can’t wait till I can go back again
yeah. . . it has a debt-free prerequisite for sure!
Yeah, I guess I'll claim them on the internet. :D
It was a beautiful drive and all the leaves changing oof it was so lovely~
Oh yes, everyone when we were out.  They were pretty strict about it.
I can’t wait for the return of live music!  And I definitely wanna get back to Chicago
Unfortunately not! (not so unfortunate i guess since i met my boyfriend where I've been living) I ve spent most of my life in a small country between Germany and France! I moved to Germany last year to save some money until I can move back to LX. What about you? (I hope I'm not breaking any rules by telling where I'm from and asking! I'm new to reddit and I'm still figuring this out)
No one has really heard of it outside of Alabamians, which I’m not.
Fair enough haha you hide it well then!
I hope you get to!
My sisters dealing with something similar. She can’t travel because her dog is old and can no longer control when or where she relieves herself. Lol
It was only the 2nd time we got to see her last year.
Mmm didn’t even think about the food!
😂😂😂 I’ve heard nothing but great things from ppl who’ve done it!
Beaches are still great when it’s not peak summertime. Just walking the beach is lovely
There’s no place like home
Come on lotto!!!
Lolol
Yup! You picked a great time to go
When I was there in Oct everyone acted like my family was dumb for wearing our masks. Lol
Who are you dying to see?
No rule breaking as far as I know. You’re good! I live in the southern US, right in the middle of the country. I’ve only ever lived in the US.
I sure haven’t! But as a northern I wouldn’t expect to 😂😂
Aww that’s so tough isn’t it? Right now Big Booty started limping out of nowhere and I’m already in a frenzy just panicked about what it could be!! Poor guy seems like he’s in so much pain so I drugged him up. Ugh I hate that we have stairs to get in n out the house!! He just went for a pee and it breaks my heart to see his struggle!
Aww.
I love sushi
The beaches were beautiful! The water was nice and warm to walk in but the air too cold to want to leave the water in lol but it was beautiful! I really enjoyed it!
So true
Wow!  I was in Huntsville ... maybe it was the area 😮
Anybody really. I want to go to the house of blues. Maybe the kickback or the claudettes. Whoever’s playing in a club with a $20 cover.
Awww yeah. She’s dealing with the same. Her first floor is her garage and then her condo is two story on top of that. So lots of carrying her up and down stairs now. Plus she can’t see well. Poor thing. Yalls dogs are lucky to have such great mommas!
It’s not for me, so more for you!
You like ramen?
Yep!
It’s one of my favourite foods
It’s so yum. So many ways to make it. My mom also takes the noodles and adds ground pork and peanuts and spicy stuffs. Dragon noodles!
That sounds sooo goooood

Hello everyone! I am new to here, so I hope that I am doing this right. I really like the vibe of this group! Everyone seems so friendly and chill. I suck at doing an introduction of myself, so we'll see how this goes...  I like all kinds of art and craft and would love to learn about new crafts/techniques. My favorites so far are watercolor and crochet. I love to read, although I am not a fast reader. I am currently in the process of renovating my backyard, which I am planning to put a small pond in! I am very excited about this because I love fish and love going to the aquarium but cannot do so since COVID, and now I will be having my own fishy-area!  Anyways, thank you for reading! Have a great night/day :)

Welcome to RAOA :)   I love the idea of putting in a small fish pond! I’d love to be able to do that too one day but our garden is kinda small! There’s something about watching fish which I have always found very relaxing 😌. I’m trying to look into new arts and crafts, currently wanting to try 5D diamond art kits :). What fish are you hoping to buy for your pond?   If you need any advice/tips on how to interact with the sub I’m always happy to help :)
Welcome to the group. What kinds of things do you like to paint? What types of fish will you keep in your pond? I want to learn to crochet. Since COVID I have realized I need more hobbies I can do at home.
Welcome! Any favorite books?
Hello and welcome!  A pond in the backyard sounds soooo cool and very relaxing.  I love arts and crafts too and have tried my hands at several different types, still trying to find my niche though
Welcome to the group! 😀
Welcome!
Welcome! I love crafting too! Fish are awesome! What types are you thinking of?
Welcome!  I’ve been getting into watercolor too.
Welcome
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Welcome!   The aquarium is my favorite place to go!   What's been your favorite craft you've created? I you'd ever like to try embroidery or sewing I can answer you some questions!
Hi:) you’ll be able to go to the aquarium soon enough, we’re on the home stretch!
Thank you! I am pretty new to reddit as well, so I am trying my best to follow the rules before posting anything.  My friend showed me the 5D diamond art that she has been working on, and they are absolutely beautiful! I have been wanting to try it but haven't gotten a chance yet. Let me know how yours go!  I am thinking of goldfish and/or koi for my pond. But I still need to plan and see how much space to I have for the pond to determine.
Thank you! I love painting landscape/plants. I don't do portraits because I am so bad at capturing facial expressions... For my pond, I am thinking of some goldfish and/or koi! But I still need to do more planning to figure out how much space do I have for the pond to determine. My best teacher is YouTube! I didn't learn crochet from anyone and just kinda learn it by following YouTube videos. You should try it out! 😊
Thank you! I read in both my mother language and English, and I have my favorites in both of the languages! For English books, I really liked Jaycee Lee Dugard's memoir A Stolen Life. I don't want to say I enjoyed it, because it was such a sad experience that she had... But the book was very well written and did a great job at bringing the readers into her tragedy life. I also enjoy reading The Serial Killer Files by Harold Schechter. One thing I realised that I forgot to mention in my post is that I love true crime podcasts! I used to be a Psychology major in my first few years in college, and criminal psychology was my favorite subject!
Thank you! What have you tried? I have tried different stuff as well and am ready to exchange ideas!
Thank you!!
Thank you!
Thank you! What type of crafts do you like to do? I am thinking of some goldfish and/or koi, although I'll still need to plan some more and see how much space do I actually have to keep the fishy.
Thank you! What is your favorite thing(s) to paint?
Thank you!
Thank you for the warm welcome!  I definitely love Christmas! One reason being, since I live in another country away from my family and friends, so Christmas is really the only time that I get to visit them. I wasn't able to do that last year because of COVID, so I am really hoping that I can do it this year! Another reason for that is I enjoy gift shopping. I love to think about what shall I get for my loved ones to make them happy!  That is very cool that you have cats! I have been wanting one since I was a kid, but my family has always prefer dogs. We have a dog which is staying with my parents. He is a complete sweetheart, and I adore him dearly. I now live with my boyfriend who is, unfortunately, allergic to cats so... :(  I love nature as well. I am in an industry that is highly related to natural environment (don't want to be too specific for privacy reasons).  It is very nice to meet you!
Thank you! I have done glass sculpture when I was in college and absolutely love it. Unfortunately, it requires a bigger space for the fire place and all the other tools, so it is not something that I can do at home... I am recently getting into Kintsugi and am loving it!  My mom taught me embroidery when I was a kid, but I was so bad at it... maybe I should pick the needles up again and see how it goes. Any tips for a beginner?  I love sewing though. I used to make my own bags to school when I was in high school and had gotten a lot of praise for them! 😁😁😁
Hopefully we are! Stay safe 😊😊😊
Well if you need any help I am just a DM away :) Always happy to help others!   I haven’t started any yet but have some on my wishlist that I think would be beautiful if I managed to give them a go! I don’t know how hard they are but am up for a challenge :)   Koi carp are so beautiful! I always associate them with peace and tranquillity :). I hope your project goes well! You will have to share a photie of your pond once it’s finished, I’d love to see it :)
I’ve tried embroidery, mixed media art, watercolors, acrylic paints, soap making. Currently, I’m trying out resin pouring and wire wrapping.
I’ve been working on trees/forests lately. How about you?
Oooo Kintsugi looks neat! I hope to be able to try that one day. what have you mended so far?   For embroidery I'd honestly say it's all practice. Pick out a begginer free pattern from DMC's website, and just do it! Before stitching the pattern itself, look up the stitches and how they are done on youtube. Practice doing them a little bit on a piece of scrap fabric! then tackle the beginner pattern. It's inevitable that the first ones we do don't look perfect, but it's only up from there.
Thank you for the offer! I will definitely let you know when I have any questions 😊😊😊  Have you been working on any other art and craft projects lately? I am getting myself into Kintsugi and found it super relaxing.  Yes! I will share pictures once it's done! Is it against the rules if I make a post about my pond here though?
I have tried resin before, and it was so hard to get all the air bubbles out! I've never done wire wrapping though, maybe that will be my next thing to try!
I love painting landscape/plants! I wanted to try painting portraits, but I am very bad at capturing facial expressions...
I have started with a small bowl, but that was a failure lol I am planning to do another bowl this weekend.  I agree with your suggestion; practice makes perfect! I am planning to make myself a new bag, so maybe I can add some embroidery on it when I feel  good enough 😊😊😊
Your very welcome ☺️  I have just recently moved house so haven’t had the chance to get into anything just yet but Kintsugi sounds interesting so will definitely have to check that one out! I used to enjoy scrapbooking from places I had visited but since Covid I’ve not really had many places I can visit :(.   No not at all :) you could post it as part of the nightly/daily chats held on the sub or you might want to turn it into a contest...like guess the names of your new fishies :) I can’t wait to see it!
Oh man, I’m having a hard time with bubbles and resin too haha. Wire wrapping is so much fun! I really enjoy making trees of life. They’re so pretty and they have a deep meaning to me
Ooooh please share the bowl when you finish! 😁
Omg moving is such a headache! I hope everything went well.   How do the contests work? Do I just pick some people to send gifts to? Is there a maximum/minimum number of people I shall pick each time?
Awwww it is always nice to work on something that has special meaning to yourself 😊 I have done glass sculpture when I was in college. It was so much fun, but you need a huge space for all the fire place and tools... just wish that I have that capability to do it at home. I am getting into Kintsugi recently and found the process super soothing and relaxing.
Of course!! 😁😁😁
Sorry for the late reply! I’ve been working and just clocked off for the day :). It was certainly a headache moving! What was I thinking moving a week before Christmas lol. It all went well though and I’m finally in and settled so can’t complain too much lol.  So with contests it’s entirely up to you how you want to do them..you can make them a theme/around an interest etc. You can state in your post if they are open to everyone (internationally) or just the country you reside in. You need to state when you are looking to pick a winner I.e tomorrow at 8pm CST. You can give a budget if you wanted too and it’s entirely up too you who you want to gift from the contest or you might want to use one of the tools (raffler) that’s in the about section. So you would tell people to use a certain phrase or word in their comment (I.e freaky Friday) and then you would copy the link once you closed the contest and put it in the raffler tool along with your chosen phrase (freaky Friday) and this would generate a user/winner randomly for you :). You can randomly gift a user if you feel like it or do a gift giveaway. At the end of each contest you would edit your post to say it was [closed] and then access the persons wishslist who was your winner/s and choose something to send them. You would then make another post identifying the winners using (u/ followed by their username) and include an invoice/order number advising them that they are a winner of your contest. Once their gift is received, the person will upload a thanks to their gifter for all to see :)  I hope that makes sense, feel like I’ve wrote war and peace lol. If you become unsure or want to clarify anything I’m happy for you to DM me :)
oh man, glass sculpture sounds awesome! And Kintsugi sounds like it would be relaxing
Omg thank you so much for the detail response!! I read through the rules and guides and couldn't find anything that tell me what is a contest exactly lol it is super helpful to have an experienced person walking me through the process!! I will for sure dm you if I have any other questions... Thank you sooooo much ♥️
Yes! And now is definitely a good time to work on different types of project 😁😁😁
Would you believe I was a actually a newbie here only a few weeks ago lol. I’m really getting into this sub and just enjoy it so much I have learnt a lot from other members and watching what they do along with the subs rules/guides. Everyone is super friendly and helpful :). No problem, you are most welcome! Happy to help anytime! Enjoy the rest of your day  💜
It really is haha I've been enjoying all the different projects I've tried

Thanks!  Wow that brand/seller has a lot of really cute, inexpensive stuff.
The picture is the actual earrings that I got. I was surprised at how nice they were. I love them! I looked online, in general, and found these same earrings sold at a higher price.

Hi! I'm Alyssa, my love language is gift giving and I enjoy trying to find the perfect gift for people so this seemed like a fun community to join. I've always been interested in reading and history and am in fact an Anthropology major atm. I love Disney, Gilmore Girls, Harry Potter as well. I have two cats, Ronan and Gilwell who are the absolute loves of my life. I also am a fan of body art, I have 5 tattoos and 11 piercings (for now)  I can't wait to get more involved here!
Hello new friend! I think you're going to love it here. I don't usually consider gifts my top love language but I'm starting to think it's a bigger love language for me than I thought because of how much I LOVE this sub! I recently discovered the birthdays tool and when I have the means to send a gift I love seeing who's birthday is coming up and sending them something. I get so excited picturing someone getting a surprise birthday gift from a stranger 😊  If you have any questions feel free to message me! I think we could be great friends as we have some shared interests :)

Hi there!
Welcome! I’m a fellow Harry Potter lover! I also love reading and history. I’m happy you’re here ❤️  If you need anything or have any questions, feel free to reach out!
Hello and welcome!!! My mother was an anthropology major!! If you could turn into an animal at will, what animal would you choose?
Hello and welcome! I also have two cats! :DD
Hey Alyssa ! Welcome
Hello! Welcome to RAOA! 👋 I’m Lily, it’s so nice to meet you! I hope that we can be friends! Being a newbie can be pretty tricky, so if you need help with anything - or just want to chat - feel free to PM me and I will assist you to the best of my ability! ✨💛
Welcome to the sub, Alyssa.
Hello and welcome! I'm a tattoo lover as well! What are yours of?
Welcome, I'm Tracy and pretty new here myself, everyone here is great and I look forward to getting to know you and everyone else :)
Welcome Alyssa! What is your favorite tattoo so far?
Hello and Welcome! I love the look of a lot of body art, and would have a tattoo if I wasn't a total wuss with needles!
hello and welcome to the family! what are your three best attributes?
hi there, newbie here too, also love body mods! just got a NSFW piercing to kick off the new year 🤪
welcome! the combination of loving Disney and tattoos is super lit, a lilo and stitch with ice cream tattoo is definitely my next one🤤🤤
Hey welcome I have 7 tattoos! And huge fan of Harry Potter! Well one of the tattoos is a Harry Potter tattoo😂🥰
Hi Alyssa, welcome to the sub! I also love Disney! What's your favorite Disney movie?
Welcome to the sub!!
Hi, Alyssa :). Welcome to the sub! I'm a uni student as well, by the way, and I'm a big fan of Gilmore Girls, too.   What's your favorite history book?
Welcome fellow harry potter and disney fan! 🤗🤗
Welcome! I hope this sub gives happiness to you. Do you have pets?
I didn't even know about the birthday tool, where is that and how do people put their information there?  It's just so great being able to help spread joy.
I'll give my boys extra snuggles on your behalf tonight!
That is such a hard question. I read obsessively and voraciously. It's probably a tie between three series Harry Potter, Winnie the Pooh, and All Creatures Great and Small.
I love seeing the reactions on people's faces when they open gifts I give them! I like Lorelai best I think, but Paris holds a special place in my heart for sure.  My favourite tattoo is one I got this summer of the original Winnie the Pooh characters.
Either my most recent Winnie the Pooh tattoo or my nipple piercings probably.
Favourite holiday is Christmas because I just love giving people gifts and seeing their faces and reactions when they open what I've given them. About nature, I like the sounds of nature most. The wind and rain and the chirping of birds and croaking of frogs. Give Mr JJ kisses and cuddles from me 😻😻
Thanks! I love the positive and welcoming vibe everyone gives here.
Oooh that's a really tough one....honestly though I think house cats kind of have it made in life, plus that gymnastics skill and agility is something I definitely don't have in my human body lol.
Thank you so much! That's so sweet and I appreciate it 😊
I have a Peter Pan one, Harry Potter one, Winnie the Pooh one, a girl scout one, and a boy scout one.
I think my newest which is a Winnie the Pooh one
It always hurts far less than I expect it will. It feels nothing like a normal needle does.
An excellent way to welcome 2021
The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh for sure
Oh god....I have no idea....there are so many. I listen to history audiobooks every single day practically.
I have two cats, and they are basically my children.
I'm on mobile so it might look different if you're not but if you look in the upper right corner there's the three dots to see the menu for this sub. If you click on it there's a link to tools and the link for the birthday calendar is in there! I hope that makes sense, I can try to explain it better if you aren't able to find it
Awwww I love it 🥰
Me too! I know if my Nana cries, I really succeeded 😅 Lorelei is awesome. Her and Rory’s relationship always reminded me of me and Nana. Favorite beau of Rorys?
Nice!  I think that's my next piercings.  Just have to wean the baby.
Hahaha solid points on all accounts! Lol
Oh such a good one!
Three dots, community info, user tools. Those are the actual names of the links, I couldn't see them when I wrote the original reply so I was going from memory haha
My goal is to have a relationship with my daughter like that of Lorelai and Rory (but with hopefully a bit more motherly maturity and a far better relationship with my own parents....)  I wish she had dated Jess after he got his shit together, after the book publishing I think. They were well suited but their timelines didn't line up right.
Yeah...that's going to be an interesting time. I know you can keep them while breastfeeding if you do it right but it's a decision I'll have to make one day lol
Plus they get to live on their schedules and get essentially on demand cuddles. Everyone I know instantly starts snuggling their cats when given the chance because they have us trained to only do it on their timelines.
Thanks so much!!
Yeah, they would’ve been good together for sure
I think it would be easy to take out when baby eats and then put back in.  I think the main thing is a) not having pieces baby can choke on and b) worry of infection if there's any open wounds - which wouldn't be a concern really.  Plus milk has great healing properties.  I've been waiting to get mine, but this guy is my last baby.  Excitement.
true...and they are VERY good at sneaking bites of people food. lmao
I hope you love them when you get them
Oh god I know! My mum's cat once literally shoved his head into my mouth to steal my burrito. I was so gob smackingly shocked I didn't even manage to stop him.
Thank you!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA OMG!!!!!!! Now that is next level talent!

Hi! I was looking for something else and stumbled my way here, and everyone seems really positive. I also love seeing how excited people are.   I struggle to stay in touch in real life, much less online, and my reddit account is in large part a low stress way for me to a human. I've been having a pretty hard time with life, and have a lot of things I need to do and haven't and I figured that if i'm going to be avoidant on my work I should at least not just stare into space. I've been trying really hard not to dwell on the negative, but it's been hard, so I'm trying to join and be involved with supportive groups and communities.   I'm almost done with school, and that's most of what I've got to do. I'm not working at the moment because I live with my grandparents who are 90+ and if I was out working and brought home coronavirus to my grandparents I'd never forgive myself, but no lie, it's really starting to get to me. Generally speaking I like working and being productive. Ah well.   Hmm, I like nature, and art. Like alot of people on Reddit I'm some level of nerdy and into boardgames and dnd and such. So yeah, I don't know exactly how active I'll be here, but I'm definitely looking forward to being part of and getting updates from a positive community. I can be pretty word so I'll leave it at this, and yea. Good to say hello!

Thanks so much for the coffee u/mrsk1013 - it was very kind of you. It really made my day and I’m excited to have a cup! Coffee is the best ❤️  And thanks for the gorgeous embroidery scissors u/sleepdeprivedmama! I had to take a break from my projects because my scissors were so bad they were destroying my thread. This is so special to me and they are so lovely! ❤️
yayyy nice gifts! dunkin coffee is a must in my home. i love it! i get decaf because caffeine messes with me and it’s veryyy good too!
Super cute scissors!
Omg!!! That’s really yummy!!!! 😍
Delicious! Enjoy!
Those are the most beautiful Scissors I've ever seen
You’re welcome! I hope your head feels better today!
You’re very welcome! They’re such cute scissors!
I usually only have Folgers so I’m SUPER excited! I just talked myself into making cinnamon rolls so I can have some now 😂
They are really lovely in person ❤️ they have lots of different styles, too. Here’s a link if you’re in the market. [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Vintage-Embroidery-Scissors-Everyday-Rainbow/dp/B08BXLK62B)

Omg I love pit!!! So great to see some love for it :) congrats!!!
Looks fun!’
Best. Game. Ever! My family plays this on holidays and we get so loud. New SO's are always so shocked when they play for the first time. 😂 I remember teaching my younger cousins to play and now my kids are playing!  Did anyone else's family have the old orange bell?? I'm guessing it's an original bc my gma has had it for as long as I can remember and I'm 29 (and it looked old to me as a kid).
Hey that’s one that I have on my wishlist! Man it is such a fun game!
My family likes to play spoons with these cards. It’s fun!
I absolutely love this game!  My parents still have their old original version from the 70s. Apparently one night when they had friends over, they all were so loud during the trading that the neighbors called the cops with a noise complaint lol.  Enjoy!
The best game! This has caused many an argument in my family.   Once my uncle broke my cousins engagement ring they were playing this game so violently.   Then we played this one Christmas and we were so loud the neighbours phoned the police on us.   Enjoy!!
You’re welcome! I never heard of it but it interested me when I saw it on your list. I hope it brings many more hours of fun with your family!
Yes! Ours had the orange bell before it was banned from family events. One cousin had her ear drum injured and another had a thumb injury. My dad was definitely the loudest.
Ooo I never thought about a spoons mode
Oh my gosh, I don't think we've had any injuries. 😂

Thank you, u/BH2! I haven’t been feeling great, so I hadn’t posted it yet. I appreciate it a ton and can’t wait to taste it after my COViD clears up.
I've seen this sauce around. How do you like it? I'm in the market for a new not-so-sweet BBQ sauce.  EDIT: Just saw your comment about COVID needing to clear up. Hopefully that'll happen soon, and then maybe let me know how you like it!
Ooo looks yummy!
Looks amazing! Congrats :)
enjoy!
Looks pretty good!
Hey! I know the owner of Lillies brother! He brings us sauce all the time!! Too fun!

Hello again - here is another unimaginative contest for you in true Vicium style.  It’s my cake day on the 21st and I wanna share my cake with you all. Unfortunately old BoJo says that can’t happen so the best I can do is share my £1.83 Amazon credit left over from Christmas with you. So here’s the contest:  1) Link me to something on your wishlist for £1.83 or under. The closer you get, the better.   2) Explain to me badly what it is and how you use it.   3) Tag a RAoA UK buddy and tell them to take part (optional but you should do it because you’re cool).   4) DBAD.   I’m on mobile, so please link your wishlist (🅂🄾🅁🅁🅈 🄼🄾🄳🅂 🄸 🄻🄾🅅🄴 🅈🄾🅄 🄿🄻🄴🄰🅂🄴 🄵🄾🅁🄶🄸🅅🄴 🄼🄴)  I love you; [Guppy](https://i.imgur.com/isRHhnJ.jpg) loves you also.   The randomiser will pick the winner 🤖  Contest ends 12 noon on my cake day 21/01/2021  Edit:typo
I have some white chocolate at £1.69.  Being whiter than white, I tend to use it by melting it down and smearing it onto my teeth, thusly giving my teeth a wonderful white look while maintaining a lovely vanilla aroma. My dentist never approved, but what does she know about teeth?  While I'm at it, get in here u/zx7319 and give us some more ideas...  [Me!](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2C4UA8X1PEOIX)
Happy cake day! Thanks for the contest!   I have some sour watermelon candy kittens on my list for £1.50. Candy kittens are now my favourite thing after /u/Poisonedmonkey bought me some! I eat them when I am having a tough day at school having to deal with stroppy teenagers.   /u/cantallbemadhatters get in here and have a go!
I was tagged, so here I am! Closest I have to £1.83 is a fantasy Greek gods ebook for £1.79 on my [under £5 list](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/3MVTZIMV473L8?ref_=wl_share). Look at that cute kitty!! u/SJRDSJRD, how about you?
I have some miracle hair drops at £1.81 on my [list](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/5RM0EDRKT0CX?ref_=wl_share). I'm hoping these will restore some zing into my hair which seems to be having a midlife crisis.  u/SJRDSJRD what ya got on your list?
I have kitty treats on my [wishlist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/24H344B5LZGZ8?ref_=wl_share) for £1.25 - My kitty [Snape ](http://imgur.com/a/F9vQoKD) would love them, he says hi to you and Guppy!  u/tamaralads come play you little cutie!
Hey UK people.  Its so kind of you to share your balance.  I have looked on my list and the closest I can see is [this cute soap bar](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00GY89LP2/?coliid=I3GEA5T79RMEZJ&colid=J56UR3HJROJO&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) \- still not as close as some of the others though. I tried making soap in the Christmas break, kids still dont use it though LOL.  I think my UK mate u/boudicas_shield might want to take part. Thanks for this one.
Happy Cakeday!  I have some make up wipes for 1.25. They are scented and I’m such a way that I believe they will go well with a nice glass of wine and some cheese crackers.  [wishlist ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/14PNWW5A8J9Y4?ref_=wl_share)  u/killawatts24 come play!  Thanks for the contest!
Happy Cakeday! This is a pretty fun contest 😊  The item I have chosen is this for £1.60 https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00EF10HE4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_hTwbGb9Q9KVV2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1  It is a thing you use for dirty stuff when you are a bit too far from your regular apparatus for cleaning the stuff that gets dirty. Primarily for those things you put on your body but I imagine there are other things that it could be used on. Apparently it smells nice but I have never used it so cannot confirm this...  u/burntheships come join in the fun!  My wishlist is here: https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/1S5JWW6GP4VE9?ref_=wl_share
Omg how cute is Guppy! 😍  I have an M&M's Hazelnut Chocolate Bar on my wishlist for £1.60. I love hazelnut chocolate and like M&Ms sooo would love to try this new treat out :).   Thanks for the contest <3 [WL](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2N7922X1L6SLN?)  u/boudicas_shield want to take part?
[Pen](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07VFQ41MS/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fabc_bRubGbC0Q0709) it’s one up from Bob Cratchet’s quill, I too could scrawl and smudge fan letters to people of note.  [list](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2O58D4XGWM4XK?ref_=wl_share)  Thanks for the contest! Do you want to join u/adorablyunhinged 💜
The closes thing I have on my list is [this face mask](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07NFG5Q3L/?coliid=I5GU7QJWKNSYV&colid=TMF9EK78L6FP&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it). I would love a time when there were no kids rattling at my feet, no dog barking at the bathroom door and just chilling in my face mask. If I won I’d save it like a bottle of champagne for a special occasion   I nominate u/77ec77 as a fellow UK person
when I saw you had commented I had to see how you went about explaining whatever your item was. I have to say you didn't disappoint 😂
Yeah, I agree. Damn dentists are always telling me what I should and shouldn’t do with my oral sharps. How rude of them. I had an extraction last year and they told me I wasn’t allowed my tooth back to take home. I reckon they kept it to trade with the tooth fairy.
Oooh they sounds tasty! Could you drop your wishlist please ♡
thanks for the tag!
Ooh £1.81 super close! I think the closest I have is £1.25 treats for Snape! Thanks for the tag lovely 😻
Aww snape sticks out his little fangs as well! He’s friggin adorable 😍
Faith in nature is one of my favourite soap brands! Love it so much but never tried the coconut one which is odd since it’s my favourite thing XD
Just took a peek because I’m always after new skincare products, but I can see them on your list 🥺
Oh my gosh you have to try it! It’s so amazing 😍🤤
Hes a little terror but I wouldn't have him any other way haha. Thank you! 😻
Add it to your list. I might get it you 😘
Strange! They should be 4th item down. They are the Johnson’s ones1 definitely my favourite if you’re looking for new wipes! Super kind on your skin and leave it feeling clean and moisturised 😌 [wishlist ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/14PNWW5A8J9Y4?ref_=wl_share)
Oooo is it that good? I’m a big lover of Lidl’s hazelnut chocolate normally really fancy giving them M&M one a try 😍
♡♡
Just checked on PC and I can see them now :) Think maybe it was just my phone

Absolutely love that series also
What an awesome gift!! Enjoy!!
Oooh. I'm reading that series right now, it's so good!
LOVE IT! Also, there are more books afaik, so omce youre done with these 4, the story keeps on going!  And i just see these are only the first three - you will have a great time, i promise!
Omg, best series I have read in a really long time! I also love her other books 😍
Thank you u/frumpmcgrump for these books! Ive been dying to read them and am going to dive right into them! 🥰🥰
I've heard great things about it but haven't been able to read it until now!!
oo!!! We need to talk when we are done! lol Have you read any of her other work?
I just saw that the other day! I had no idea that there were ten books in this series!!! Im so excited to get to read so much of her work! I hope she writes a sequel to Uprooted
Her books are so good! Have you read A deadly education yet?? HIGHLY recommend it!
Yay!  Glad they arrived.
Just a few. I have a few on hold at the library, turns out she's pretty popular though, so the wait list is a bit long.
Never read that book - 15 year old me was too preoccupied with dragons :D  Though now i read less, but i have no idea if it would be suitable for me as a young adult guy :DD
I haven't yet, but just got on the waitlist to get the ebook from my library so I should get it in the next few weeks and be able to read it! I am excited for another series from her, even if it's only two books (so far? 🤞🏼)
Uprooted is fantastic! Its a fun fantasy that has a "dragon" (he is a mage but called the dragon) and witches and war and an evil forest. its a good read for anyone that likes fantasy
Woohooo!!!
Might just get me back in to reading, this one, cause lately in DnD i've been playing a draconic sorcerer. Sounds interesting!
oooo thats perfect!  Ive been playing as a druid!

Hope everyone's doing well! I'm still trying to figure out how all of this works since I'm also new to reddit. Love and light
Welcome. I love the positivity of this group as well. What kind of music do you like? What are your favorite veggie dishes?
Hi, welcome to the group!

Hi there, welcome! I love spirituality too — anything that can help me reflect and grow. Do you have a favorite mantra, prayer, or meditation?
Welcome! What are some of your favorite veggie dishes?
Thank you! Ooof, it depends on my mood, i guess. I listen to various types of music, from classical to reggae, rock, indie, hip hop, french rap, reggaeton, lofi and more! If you would ask me about my favorite artist i would probably need some time to think because i just love the differeny varieties. I've been listening to frequency music/binaural beats a lot these past months as well. What kind of music do you enjoy? My favorite veggie dishes include garden gourmet stuff like their incredible mince, nuggets, 'schnitzel', which i just add rice or fries to, vegan hummus based pizza topped with veggies (i also love eating a whole baguette with hummus occasionally lol) vegetable fried rice, veggie ramen, spinach pasta.. And more haha! Sorry for the big text! What about you?
Hi! Thank you!
Thank you!
Thanks!
Thank you
Happy New Year to you and your loved ones too! Do the summer holidays count? (I work in childcare so I get confused haha, even though we have to work during summer holidays it's my favorite time of the year)  Or do you mean days like christmas etc? I really am a summer person if this makes any sense and I guess new year's day is pretty cool because a lot of people wish eachother a happy new year, a lot of people seem more hopeful and i just like the positive and kind vibes among other things!   I love walking through the woods with my boyfriend, take some moments of silence and just listen to nature's peaceful sounds🦉last weekend we went near a lake and my bfs dog disappeared for a few minutes so he called out for him and we noticed the echo and how far it went! (feel free to ask anything if my english is hard to understand! It's not my native language:))  I also enjoy discovering new flowers, shrooms and big, old trees! And the calmness of it all😊 sometimes we hug trees or hold our hands against one to feel the energy of it. Walking through nature helps relieve my anxiety as well🌱🌳  That's so cool that these cats keep visiting you, even if the main reason might be the food, I feel like getting any animal's positive attention is always an honor  I'm an empath too! I would gladly chat with you! Feel free to dm me for any random reason or stories as well😊  Thank you! I appreciate your kindness and I look forward to chatting with you too! Hugs, love and light! ✨♥️
Thank you! That's great! I started my spiritual journey quite recently. Last year, to be more precise! I grew up as a christian but christianism is not included in my journey anymore. Feel free to dm me for any random spirituality conversations! Yes. I'd say that my favorite is ho'oponopono! I'd send you the link to the one I've listened to the most because it includes apologies to ancestors etc but it's in portuguese! I'm sure you can look up nice ones in english too😊 What about you?
I enjoy Country, Classic rock, rock, hip hop, indie. I have never heard of french rap or lofi. What is frequency music?   I  am trying more veggie dishes as I found out I am allergic to wheat and trying to find different dishes to add variety to our menu. I did make fried rice not too long ago that was good. I do miss baguettes. I need to try to make my own.
Well thank you very much for the well wishes though all of my family members have passed it's just me my cat at this time .  And I loved reading the story about you walking through the woods I think that's absolutely wonderful though I can't say that I've never actually touched a tree to sit and feel it it's definately something that I'm gonna be doing next time amount in nature.🌻🙃   I'm here everyday so I'm hoping to see you as well and there's so many wonderful people to chat with I think you'll enjoy your stay with us. Hugs🧸🌻
Oh cool I'll have to check that out. I am a Catholic but very interested in traditions and practices from all faiths. I still have a lot to learn so I'm not sure I have a favorite anything yet!
Nice! I guess french rap is more common here:) Here's a yt link so you can get an idea of what lofi is! [lofi](https://youtu.be/_tV5LEBDs7w)  Is it similar to gluten allergy? I know a few people that are allergic to wheat/and or gluten including a kid from the place i work at and there are a lot of gluten free options here but they're so expensive.. Maybe you could try soja, oat, quinoa, millet or rye? (feel free to correct me if i misspelled sth)I think that none of these include any traces of wheat You can definitely make your own "wheat free" baguettes! Do you have any favorite veggies?
Beans are also a nice alternative (in my opinion) to add to your meals!
Rye contains gluten but others are ok. I usually make my own deserts and stuff but haven’t tried bread yet. I should really give it a try. I have found some brands of store bought that work for toasts and sandwiches. They are definitely more expensive.  It is an allergy, just developed in the last year in addition to some food intolerances that I am still learning.

I am reintroducing myself - I joined this sub a long time ago and then life got in the way.  I could use a positive place to hang!  I live in Chicago (my handle makes that obvious) and am from NYC originally.  I work in clinical research which is, uh, interesting at the moment ☺️. Hope to really be part of the community now!
Welcome.........so I guess a question you might get asked a bit. NYC vs Chicago. Who has the best pizza?
Hello! I'm glad you're here! Your job sounds super cool! I'm registered on research match and other clinical research registries and I've participated in some pretty cool studies. My favorite was one studying how weighted blankets impact sleep and chronic pain. What's your favorite study you've worked on?

Hmmm.  Wild animal probably an otter.  I also love penguins ☺️
I work in oncology research.  I’m a program manager on an NIH grant!

Aesthetically, the Gold Coast (north of Division) or Lincoln Park.  To hang out, West Loop or Logan.
My degree is actually in public health policy -I administer the grant and review research 🧐
Awww both excellent choices!
That’s amazing! Thank you for all your hard work!!
Illinois or indiana??
I think I stayed in or near the Gold Coast when I visited. I would love to go back to Chicago.
Ahhh interesting! Well welcome all the same :)
If you ever need a pick me up follow the Shedd Aquarium on Instagram.  They post adorable penguin videos once a week or so.

Hi Meal Planners!    If you've planned with us before, welcome back.  This year, /u/seabluz and I will be sharing the thread-posting and tagging responsibilities, so that if one of us needs to fall off the radar, the group is not left hanging!  If you haven't planned with us before, jump right in.  We are planning our meals for the week, and turning chore time into social time.  Browse for ideas, make suggestions, share your own plan.  It's inspiring to see what other people are having, and sometimes you get a great idea or you try something completely new.  This is totally a no-pressure-no-judgment zone.  Start a conversation with any of us.  Food unites.  If you post a meal plan, you'll be tagged to join us in future posts, as a reminder to stay organized and keep the planning going.  If you'd like to stop being tagged; just let me know. No hard feelings. Sometimes a tag creates too much pressure - I get it.    #So, anyone want to plan with us?  ____  #This Week's Meals In Progress   **MONDAY**: Honey Soy Tofu/Chicken Green Salad  **TUESDAY**: Quesedillas  **WEDNESDAY**: Roasted Cauliflower Casserole with goat cheese   **THURSDAY**: Crescent-topped cheeseburger casserole with french fries  **FRIDAY**: Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas served with refried beans and spanish rice  **SATURDAY**: Leftovers  **SUNDAY**: Company Chicken with rice and broccoli casserole
SUNDAY: Herb-roasted chicken with carrots and shallots.   MONDAY: Sun-dried tomato chicken.   TUESDAY: Italian tuna melts.   WEDNESDAY: Cilantro-lime cod.   And that's as far as I've gotten. My brother and grandparents have been quarantining, so they can visit this week!!! So, we'll plan further when they get here. Though, I suspect a lot of spaghetti squash since they just harvested their garden this morning.
I've prepped three dinners for this week, and we'll have each twice:  Paleo spaghetti with homemade meatballs and homemade marinara sauce  Crockpot pinto beans with cilantro-lime Spanish rice  Corned beef brisket with roasted green cabbage and onions
I’m still on training mode so I haven’t had a chance to cook much last week.  This week, I’ve prepped crawfish fettuccine for two days, hopefully gumbo for two days (can cook roux day before and have it simmering all day) and a free day to eat out
This week will be pretty simple:  Lunch: spaghetti with ground turkey and hidden veggies sauce  Dinner: mushroom soup   And I have lemon bars and marshmallow cake because desserts are the best
I meal prep lunches, so I'm here for ideas.  Monday: lunch out with my parents  Tuesday: chicken teriyaki with rice and veg  Wednesday: leftover Lasagne  Thursday: broccoli cheese soup I think. Plus salad..  Friday: TBD...
Hey there lovely's!   Here we go!  Monday     Left over Chicken and dumpling's from Saturday night. Yummy!  Tuesday    Taco's Or Taco salad  Wednesday  Baked Chicken Parmesan & veggies on the side  Thursday   Fried potatoes and onions in light olive oil with Burgers  Friday     Baked Spaghetti  & Garlic bread  Saturday Bacon egg and cheese omelets   Sunday Beef Roast with veggies
Monday: [Black Bean Quesadillas](https://www.budgetbytes.com/hearty-black-bean-quesadillas/)  Tuesday: [Falafel](https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-vegan-falafel/)  Wednesday: Salmon with Couscous  Thursday: [Baked Pasta](https://www.budgetbytes.com/roasted-vegetable-baked-penne/)  Friday: [Hamburger Stew](https://www.budgetbytes.com/slow-cooker-hamburger-stew/)
This week, my dear friend is organizing my meals, so I have no idea what I’m getting! We’ve just welcomed a new addition to the family, so my lovely friend organized a meal train for us.

That cilantro lime cod sounds so good
Nice.  I am jealous of the past tense portion of that sentence.
Congratulations!!!  How exciting! And I'm glad you've got good friends looking out for you.
Congratulations on your new addition! It’s lovely to have someone looking after you :)
u/rebelfixed, welcome to the sub, this is a weekly meal plan thread if you’re interested?
Thank you 💛
My sister always does funfetti pancakes for her kids' birthdays.  Such a sweet tradition.  Bacon fried rice sounds unexpectedly delicious.
Sounds yummy.  I haven't done anything with leeks in a long time.
Friday doesn't sound so hot!  Fingers crossed!  Those porkchops look good.
Hi there! We have the same cake day :) would your new regimen be considered Whole30? I would recommend looking up some of those and tweaking as needed, since Whole30 is already [free of grains, sugar, and dairy](https://whole30.com/whole30-program-rules/?gobacktext=Return%20to%20my%20whole30%20dashboard&gobackurl=https://whole30.com/do-the-whole30). Which comes in handy since I'm lactose intolerant! My mom is sensitive so when we did whole30, even just 5x a week instead of 30 days nonstop, she felt less itchy and less bloated symptoms. Best of luck to you, friend
Monday- leftovers  Tuesday - chicken enchiladas  Wednesday - beef bulgogi  Thursday - chicken kievs with chips  Friday - porkchops with ikea style gravy and mash  Saturday - spag bol  Sunday - roast   The beef bulgogi is the recipe someone posted here lasy week. I managed to get some gochujang from amazon but I still need to pop put and get some sesame seeds at some point. I'm hoping our local zero waste shop will be open after their refit on Wednesday!
I’m not sure what to plan for meals this week. I have chicken thighs, rice, and some pantry staples. Hallpp
I hope it is! I haven't made cod is SO long.
Lol, that's what I spent the day doing today. I still need to prep the spinach and sausage breakfast egg bites, but I can to that tomorrow because I've got a couple bacon and mushroom ones leftover from last week that I took down from the freezer for tomorrow.
Thank you! I’ve never had anything like this before, but I’m told it’s incredibly helpful. I’m just excited to be home with the little one for a bit.
Yaaas! Thank you
Before I had really mastered I tried it and it wasn’t right but I am confident this will be much better.
we get some vegetables from a farm shop delivered every 2 weeks and they are random. makes for interesting meals 😂 the only problem is there always seems to be a cabbage and we havent worked out a good way to eat a lot of cabbage 🙈
it should be fine really. the dr wouldnt administer a drug challange unless he thought i was allergic too it. theres always a chance though.  they do cant wait to try them!
I will have to check out whole 30! I’m sure it will be similar!

YYYYYYESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!! 🙌🙌🙌  Thank you so much for this amazing combo of gifts!   [This will be me after i finish my skincare & head downstairs for some nutella 😂](https://imgur.com/a/dASz5Yq)
The toaster was something I heard someone mention they need. It was a forced gift.
Wheeeey where you been, stranger?
Haha. You could probably make a Nutella mask. I’m sure someone somewhere has done it
I know I was kidding lol
heeeey! just hanging in there, a lot of work mostly. how are you?
Probably, i watched a video where they’re dying hair with it. 🙃
Fair joke though. That poor girls boyfriend stole the facemask too!
I am here!
WHAT HOW RUDE   Now I want toast but my toaster always smells like it’s burning my toaster strudel :( so zucchini bread it is 😋
I would eat the f out of either of those things right now. So hungry. Bout to go find some noms.

I'm excited to take my son to zoos, museums, aquariums... everything. Im excited to bring him to the park and to watch him interact with other kids.

Comic con, or any con really. Wow I never thought I would miss them as much as I do.  I'm a cosplayer so go to every con I can in full costume, I sometimes work at the stands and stuff, and I used to live to complain about it, "it's too hot, too crowded, too this too that" but now I miss it.  I miss taking pics with other cosplayers, I miss having people freak out cause they just LOVE the character I'm cosplaying, I miss meeting new people, I miss the thrill of finding someone with the same costume or from the same series, I miss group photoshoots. Hell I even miss the weird people who would hug me or kiss me like we've known each other for years just bc we are in the same fandom.  Idk, I miss it all, even the bad and the weird.   (I tried to put a gift card on my wishlist and for some reason it won't show up, If I happen to win can I give you my email for an Amazon gift card?)

One thing I'm looking forward to is getting to hang out with my in-laws again. They're like my second family, and in the before times we used to go over there every weekend to play dominoes, drink coffee, and hang out.

Nothing because not having to leave my house is the best part of my life so far
God I really just want to travel again. I was supposed to go on a trip to Europe this past summer. I had saved up and paid it off and then it just never happened. And I just to have things to look forward too. Even just little stuff like hanging with a bunch of friends or doing a day trip or something. I think that's why things have just been blending together. There's nothing to break up the monotony. But I have the trip rescheduled to this summer and I am tentatively looking forward to that. And I know I'll be able to see my friends soon we just have to wear masks and be safe a bit longer but it will be worth it.  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3RCRP7AROAXJU?ref_=wl_share

I can't wait to loiter around the library again. They closed completely, then opened but it was to get your books/media and get out, and now it's closed again. I have an 8 year old and we would spend ages in the library playing with the learning toys, puppets, attending classes and programs, looking at the displays, even trying to fit a piece or two into the jigsaw puzzle they have out on a table for anyone to hop in and work on. It's closure has def left a hole in our lives.

Oh, it will be amazing!   First, I’m going to hug all my grandkids and kids which means I’ll fly to Florida and New York to visit. Or maybe have a huge family reunion here and invite all my cousins too.   Then I’m going to buy theatre tickets and see some plays.   Third, I’m going to go shopping at the Goodwill bins standing elbow to elbow with complete strangers pawing through things other people have touched.   When it’s really over, I’m going to burn my first mask in a thank you ceremony for its protection of me and my good health.   Until then, I’m going to keep cheering those who follow protocols despite fatigue and sacrifice. When I hit the wall as I sometimes do, I imagine the sacrifices in WWII and all those who’ve currently died in this pandemic and it helps me keep perspective.   Hang on and keep your chin up.

I can’t wait to go to my parent’s home country again as an adult and meet all my cousins as adults! It’s been 11 years but I’ve never waited so hard for something (I don’t know what that means but it’s how I feel 😂) I also have a hard time with masks and the sensory overwhelming feeling they cause but I know they’re for the best. Can’t wait to be done with them though. Thanks for the contest! 💙  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/YNK11TYESXYM?ref_=wl_share
I can't wait to go to a huge music festival and have my face melted off by bass. It will honestly just be nice to interact with other people on a normal basis without having to worry about getting infected. I want to go out, make new friends (moved to new town mid-pandemic), flirt with someone (badly, for what it's worth), be affectionate towards others, etc. The pandemic has given me a view of what the future could look like. In many ways, technology has the ability to bring people together, but I think the way we've handled the pandemic proves that technology also has the ability to keep people apart. I would hate for that to become the new norm. Ok. . ./end rant. Thanks for this <3  I should have something $10 or under on all of my lists [here](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/CAK0D0S0ONW4?ref_=wl_share).

Hugging people I want to be able to hug someone again.
Thank you for the contest friend!  I am totally looking forward to seeing my family again. I live far away from everyone so it's been really hard not being able to see them. My cousin just had a baby yesterday also which is like UGH!!! She's more like a sister, we see her and the rest of my husbands family the most of all the people we are somewhat close to ( they are like 3 hours away) but, my family is in CA so I have to plan for that and flying just isn't possible right now.   I'm also looking forward to seeing just people in general. We're being more cautious than most people so we don't see anyone right now really and luckily RAOA has been really nice for interacting with people but I don't think my IRL friends realize how much effort went into maintaining those relationships when we could see each other and now it feels kind of like they stopped caring. I should say I was the one putting the effort into the relationship, which sucks. It's so emotionally draining to have a one sided relationship. I'm trying to be positive about it now but I've been in a depression hole for a while now.... just trying not to think about it. Anyway, thanks again.. sorry if this was a bummer, it just came out, lol.
Is it weird that I want a hug so badly? A hug from my mom, my friends, anyone. I feel like it’s been so long since we’ve been able to feel the touch of another human because of the covid situation. I am sure I am not the only one who feels depraved of human interaction let alone touch during quarantine.

I'm looking forward to not be angry every single time I have to leave the house. There's always people roaming around inside of my 6ft bubble, people not wearing masks, not wearing masks properly, pulling their masks down to rub their nose and sneeze. I'm fatigued from all the frustration with these people.  Also, I can't wait to be able to hang out with people. This is such a weird time we are living in.   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3FD7CXQMJTZT4?ref_=wl_share  Thanks for holding this contest! ❤️
Honestly I’m just wanting to not hear about so many deaths everyday. It’s hard to handle. I also can’t wait to take off my mask. I’m breaking out so bad and it’s so frustrating. Thanks for the opportunity to share.    [my list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3OP902UYAL2CV?ref_=wl_share)

I am really wanting to visit Disney world for the first time or take a cruise! I had planned to take our daughter for her fifth birthday and that is next year so sign me up for the vaccine asap!  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/MUN3KTE8KP4Y?ref_=wl_share
My wife and I are planning what we call a "Happy, Happy, Christmas Party" where we catch up on all of the lost holidays, birthdays, get-togethers in one big party.  There will be ugly holiday sweaters, Halloween costumes, birthday cakes, a bonfire, kegs, and our annual white-elephant exchange (missed last year for the first time in ages).   The biggest point of this is just to get everyone, extended family and friends, together at long last to hug, catch up, laugh, dance, and just enjoy each other's company.   There is only one requirement that we will have to come to our party - everyone must have received a vaccine (no exceptions).   In the meantime, we've made a list of all of the adventures we can have as a family to help us get through. Things like teaching my daughter to drive, building new gardens, outdoor workshop areas, and some hikes we've been meaning to take.   As someone that strives to be outside and connect with folks, it's been tough. Finding some new ways to entertain myself and focusing on slowing down and moving with more intention.   Keep your head up my friend.   [https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2EW4F330P6HCW?ref\_=wl\_share](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2EW4F330P6HCW?ref_=wl_share)
I can't wait until I can go to a karaoke bar with my friends again.  I know it sounds silly and unnessesary but I turned 21 in January of last year and only went once for my birthday.  It was one of the most fun nights I had and looking back I would love to be able to do it again!  I am also a theater major and I seriously and itching to get back on a stage.

I can’t wait to take my boyfriend out on a surprise adventure! We’ve been cooped up in the apartment only leaving for emergencies like food and for him to travel for work and it’s just been a mess. We missed celebrating his birthday and we didn’t really get to do anything for New Years bc our supermarket was stripped clean of food I wanted to cook him. We are constantly in and out of lock down parameters and we got hit with a bad storm.  I just cannot wait to go to the Park, our anniversary restaurant,  and do some other outdoor adventures!

I’m just looking forward to LIFE. Before COVID my boyfriend and I went bowling every Saturday night and we would have lunch or dinner at the Chinese Buffet.

We go on car rides and walks which she absolutely loves but I just want to do more with her.

Out of everything, I miss having face to face conversations the most. I miss being able to talk to people at the grocery store or in line at starbucks, I really miss genuinely interacting with people without the communication barriers.

I need human connection. Physical. I know I have my husband and my baby, but I need more. My doctor hugged me the other day when she came into the exam room and I just about cried. I think she knew I needed it and I think she needed it too.   I miss shaking my patients' hands when they come in. I miss high-fiving my littles and getting hugs from them after testing.

Imma head south of the border, meet my boyfriend in Seattle airport and we'll fly to Ireland to finally go see my family.  It's probably not gonna be the *first* thing we do when we see each other... But it's high in our priority list. He's never been to Europe so I want to show him as many of Irelands 30,000 castles as I can. Introduce him to the whole family (gods help him) and I'll just get to spend 3-4 weeks surrounded by all the people I love the most.
I just... miss my people.  I'm a super introvert but about 6 months into this,  it stopped being my ideal life (ha!) and started feeling really lonely.  I mean,  I Skype and zoom and whatever and have the occasional social distance hang out but...I miss hugs and seeing friends in person without masks.  My list of people in my bubble is normally very small and exclusive and I don't miss a lot of people,  just maybe 10 that really feed my soul. It's really hard... plus my kid is missing out on so much social development and he doesn't know any of my best friends,  which extra sucks.

Dear lord, I just really really want to hug and spend time with my grandma. She lives in an assisted living home, and we haven’t been able to actually visit her or hug her in like a year. We can visit for like less than 5 minutes at the door, and we got one day to see her a bit longer around Christmas, but still socially distanced. It’s been really hard, probably especially on her. The residents at her home are supposed to get the vaccines soon, and we will be so happy when that happens. That’s probably the number one thing for me.

Ohh, I have so many things I'm looking forward too! I haven't seen my girlfriend in almost a year (I saw her last March). I miss her so much everyday. We text each other and have video calls but it's not the same. When this is over, I'll go see her and hug her a lot. Then we'll go eat ramen or burgers at one of our favorite spots and walk a lot while talking to her. I'll come back home and go play basketball when it's nighttime. I haven't played it since last March, too...
I don't know what it will look like either. I've been thinking about it a lot lately. We had to go to Seattle Friday for medical appointments. Our grandbaby was so overwhelmed by the people, traffic and city noise that she got scared and cried. She's nearly 9 months and has been in quarantine her whole life. It really hit me hard seeing her reaction to what is so normal. So I am looking forward to being able to take her out and let her experience the world without being terrified because she has been stuck at home since birth. Also, a mask bonfire sounds awesome!

What country? I hope you get to go home soon and see your loved ones
I feel that way for my very young nephews, and even my own kids. Playing in the sandbox, going to the library, museums, and other children will be wonderful. I want this for your son! And for you!
It’s so hard to want to take your kids to these amazing cultural things and not be able too.   We’ve started doing a lot of video tours and then trying to do something on our own that is like what we saw - painting, sculpting, etc.   I hope you and your son can get to the zoo and museum and have play dates and lunch dates again. Hang in there ❤️
I was thinking of our last concert the other day, and I got so misty-eyed.
I hope you get to go to a concert soon and get to enjoy all your favorite artists with a group of other fans
I had plans to go see the Green Day/Weezer/ Fall Out Boy concert last August! So sad to miss out on that.
Who is your favorite artist? Who do you hope to see in concert first?  I hope you get to go to a concert soon and jump up and down, wearing your favorite band tshirt and sing really loudly when they play your favorite song soon 🎸
A cookbook club sounds amazing!! How young is your daughter? She must be little.   I hope that you and your best friend can get together soon and hug each other and hug each other’s little ones and have many happy tears soon. Hang in there ❤️
Oh goodness! I hope your surgery can happen soon ❤️   Me? I want to go see my girlfriend. We live in two different countries right now and Australia is locked down so I can’t get there and she can’t come here. Our trip got cancelled when covid started. I miss her and can’t wait to see her
Thank you for your continued work during the pandemic ❤️
I’ve never been! What are you looking forward to doing when you go there?
It’s hard to make plans when everything is so uncertain. But you sound like a great big sister and your brother is super lucky to have you in his life. Hang in there
What sort of cosplay to do you?   I hope you can safely cosplay soon and show off some new cosplay outfits and take group photos and make new friends. I hope that you get to have fans come up to you because they love your character and ask for a photo again soon. ❤️
I hope you get to have an amazing post covid hug from your friend soon. I’m sorry about your job. Hopefully something better is on the horizon
I’m trying to respond to everyone’s comments in order but I’m gonna jump the line and respond to yours   I feel this. My girlfriend lives in Australia and I miss her so much and can’t wait to hug her and see her once this is over.   I hope you can see your girlfriend again safely soon
Thank you for thinking of the club members you’re in charge of. I’m sure screen sharing movie nights aren’t the same. Hopefully when this is over you can hold a big movie marathon
It’s very hard. It’s nice to see what everyone else in the world is looking forward too and realize you’re not the only one feeling that way or missing the same things.  You sound like you have great in-laws. I hope you guys can play dominos soon and drink coffee and laugh until your sides hurt
We moved back home just to be able to see our family outside with masks. I missed my dad so crazy much these last couple years. I still miss the hugs. I want you to hug your dad soon too!
That’s rough. I’m luckily enough to have my dad and sister live with me pre covid and now during covid. They both moved in to help me raise my kids after the divorce.   I hope that soon you can hug your dad and hear him laugh and see his face and hug him some more ❤️
I hope you can see some live music soon and have road trips and stand so close to the amps that you can feel the bass in your bones soon 🎸
It’s very sweet that you’re thinking of how to make your friends happy and how it seems like their happiness makes you happy too. I hope you can hug them soon and complain to them about going out to the bar even though you’re tired (but you’re secretly having a good time) and laugh with them soon ❤️
Wow that’s great you have tickets and I hope you can see the show in person soon!
I miss board games with friends so much! Even board games with strangers!
What board game is your favorite?   I hope you can have a game night again and have fun with your friends as soon as this is over. ❤️
I’m sure you have a very beautiful face! And I think I’ll probably still wear a mask afterwards for germs like the flu and a lot of people will too.   I hope you get to travel soon and get the joy of getting up early to go to lectures soon. Hang in there
I agree with you.  I can’t wait to do just normal things I took for granted before like sitting on a park bench or going to IKEA
That’s not stupid. What kinda food do you think you’ll want to eat first?  I hope you can skip down the street eating something yummy soon !
Me? Seeing my girlfriend. We live in two different countries and hers is very strict about covid (Australia). I can’t wait to be able to travel and see her in person
I miss movie popcorn a lot. We make our own at home but man it’s not the same.   I hope you get to see your friends and family soon
I hope that your first hug is comforting and is warm and all you wished it would be. ❤️
Congratulations on your upcoming wedding!
I hope that you can see your friends again at a resultant where the food will be so amazing (50% because it’s good 50% because it’s food from a restaurant you’re actually dining in at) and then go to a show or concert or hang out together after dinner soon. ❤️
I’m sure your grandparents miss you and your hugs. I hope you get to hug them and see their faces light up soon!!  If you had to choose between a winery or brewery, which would you go too first?
Your kid is very lucky to have a mom who planned a trip. That’s so special! I hope you and your daughter get to travel soon and spend some quality time bonding and having fun. ❤️
Congratulations on the birth of your nephew! That is probably so hard.  I hope you get to see him soon and pinch his little cheeks and tickle his little baby feet and give him hugs and probably not want to put him down ❤️
If that’s what makes you happy then good on ya 👍🏽
What part of Europe?  I understand and can soo relate to the monotony of the everyday.  Hang in there. I hope that you get to travel and be amazed by all that Europe has to offer - all the sights and sounds and amazing food and new people soon. You’ll love it ❤️
I agree to that in all ways.
I hope you and your husband can go out to your favorite place, have a nice dinner, take a stroll and just generally have fun...far far away from your kids for one night again soon.   I love my kids but man, they drive me crazy sometimes
I hope that you get to see your best friend and her adorable baby soon and get to hold the baby and gush about how cute it is and take pictures and tickle those cute little feet and baby tummy soon ❤️
I hope you get to go on a date soon and that it’s a great date and that it’s worth the wait ❤️
I hope that you get to hug your friends soon and that it’s great and you all can go do something fun as a group again soon ❤️
I work for a county and I know some library clerks and I can tell you that they miss being able to help people and see them come in to the library too.  I hope that you all can get to the library soon again soon and get to spend quality time together out of the house again. ❤️
Where would you travel and what concert would you want to see first?  I hope you get to do both soon. Maybe travel to see a concert and do a 2 for 1 ❤️
Soon. ❤️   I hope that you get to travel to your loved ones and give them a big hug again soon. I hope you get to have a date that isn’t a walk!! I hope it’s somewhere nice but gives you something to do and see (everyone has had enough of sitting around I feel like) and that is a good date!
I hope that soon you can see all your loved ones near and far and scoop up those grandkids in a big hug and tell them that they’ve grown so much. I hope you see a great play and that you can thrift again and feel the joy of scoring a great deal.  I think I’ll have my favorite mask framed and put on my wall as a reminder of all the things I got through and the world got through collectively
What an amazingly kind big brother to share his experiences with his little brother. You guys are raising very kind little humans it sounds like  It’s tough for sure and I hope that you get to take your grand babies out safely to the store and watch his face light up at all the new sights and colors soon ❤️
Where would you travel?  I hope you get to travel soon
I hope you get to have a massive cookout safely soon and all your friends come and you guys eat delicious food ❤️
What country is that? I hope you can go soon and see your family and get to meet them as adults and find out what you guys have in common
Thank you for the rant. It’s cathartic to vent to people who are also frustrated and longing for the same type of normalcy.  I hope that you can flirt with someone and that flirting turns into a concert date and that you both get so close to the amps that your bones rattle and your holding hands and both excited when your favorite band comes on stage and plays your favorite song and you sing along and maybe air guitar. Maybe the other person will air drum. And it’s great and amazing ❤️   Hang in there
Which national park is top of your list?  I hope you can travel safely again soon and that you can see as many national parks as you can and enjoy the beautiful sights
Virtual hugs from me to you for your positive attitude.   I hope you get to safely hug a loved one again very soon.
What sort of work do you do?  I hope you can go safely back to work soon
I’ve never been to any of those states! What a great friend they have in you to make a trip to visit them.  I hope you can safely see them all again soon and hug and enjoy time together and laugh again.
I hope you get to hear some beautiful live music soon
That’s amazing!! I hope you get to see your nephews safely soon and sneak attack tickle them.
I hope your post covid hug is great and warm and everything you hoped for
Congratulations to your cousin and to your family on the new little addition. It’s hard for sure as those we love welcome in new babies and not being able to be there in person.   I hope that you’ll be able to safely see that new baby and your family, give them a big hug and spend the rest of the time holding that baby as you all catch up. I also hope your IRL friend realize what a good person you are to keep the friendship going with some effort. I know it can be draining and I hope that if they don’t realize all the time and effort and love your expending that you find a group of friends that does.  Don’t apologize for the rant. I’m happy to listen
It’s not weird to want a hug. I’m responding to everyone’s messages - so I can read them - and so that everyone feels heard and a lot of people want a hug. You’re not alone.  I hope your first post covid hug is amazing and warm and joyous and the kind of hug that makes you cry happy tears and squeeze the other person even tighter.
I hope that you’ll be able to get a hug again safely soon and that it’s great and amazing and worth all this waiting. Make sure you get 2 hugs!
I feel this in my bones. I’m angry at people who don’t take it seriously and put me at risk and everyone I love at risk. I’m tired of my coworkers lives being put at risk . I’m tired of people coming to my work angry (because everyone is angry about something now a days) and taking it out on us and hurling insults and yelling or threatening.  I hope that soon you’ll be able to go into a building or store or even outside and have people respect boundaries, that you won’t have to worry about why a person is sneezing and if you’re far enough away. I hope that you (and I) can find beauty in our fellow humans again. ❤️
Maskne is real, friend. I feel it.   I hope soon that when you turn on the news you’ll see headlines of people being free again and how great the world is.
I hope you are able to locate great treasures safely again soon
I hope that you get to take your daughter on an amazing trip where her eyes will light up and you’ll be able to soak in those precious memories of being together and bonding as a family. You’re a great parent ❤️
I love this ❤️   It’s about being together and still being safe so that there will be many more next times together.  I hope that soon you will all be together safely and dance until you all are laughing super hard and hug and happy cry and eat delicious food again.
It’s not silly or unnecessary.  I hope that soon you’ll be able to safely see your friends and go to a karaoke bar and sing really loudly and make other people smile at how much fun you’re having with them. I hope that you can get back out on stage soon!
It kills me too.   I hope that soon you’ll be able to safely hug all your friends safely and show them affection when they need it most and get affection in return.
I hope you and your homies are able to get together safely soon and hit the open road and have an amazing trip that you’ll remember forever
What’s your favorite roller coaster?  I like seeing what everyone else is looking forward too as well! I hope you get on a roller coaster safely soon with your husband and have a fun time at the theme park it’s in. Make a silly face for the photo at the end!
What would you cook him if you had your choice of groceries?   I hope that soon you’ll be able to safely go to the grocery store, I hope you can go to your favorite restaurant and then go on a fun adventure to somewhere new and spend the day having a great time enjoying new places ❤️
West coast best coast jk   I’m sorry you haven’t been able to see your cousins. I hope soon you’ll be able to safely hang out with them and laugh and have fun and catch up together.
Ahh the British...I loved going down the street to the pub when I lived there or going the other way on the street and going to the OTHER pub.   I hope soon you’ll be able to safely go to the pub, kick back a pint and hang out.
Is there a specific composer you want to hear them play or just any thing?
That sounds like a great time! What a fun bonding thing with your mom.  I hope you and your mom get to go back to the bar safely again soon and dominate trivia night! What was your team name?
That sounds really nice.  I hope that soon you’ll all be able to be together safely to do something fun like camping. I hope you can hug and laugh and enjoy each others company again soon
It’s crazy how the mundane and everyday are so appealing now.  I hope that you and your boyfriend can safely bowl again soon and that your favorite Chinese food buffet tastes amazing. I hope that you guys can take a cruise to somewhere fun and get to relax on the deck in the sun and do silly things on the boat that you’ll never talk about like taking belly dance classes or eat a. Entire sundae at the midnight on board buffet.
I hope that soon you’ll be able to go with your friends on train trips to fun places like the museums and get some awesome cards or just browse at a stationery store. They always have the best smell...different than a library but also a paper smell.
This is the sweetest thing.   I hope soon you’ll be able to safely smile at people and have people smile back at you. ❤️
I hope you get to eat safely at a restaurant soon and that it’s delicious and you end up getting dessert. ❤️
That sounds really nice.  I hope that your friends get to come over safely soon and that you have tea and maybe some sort of sweets to go with your tea party or finger sandwiches
I hope you and your friends can one day soon go to a concert again safely with each other and dance to your favorite songs and throw your hands up when it’s the best part of the chorus.
What do you miss eating out the most? Like Italian, Chinese, American, etc. I can make most things but good Chinese food is hard to make at home   I hope that soon you’ll be able to see your loved ones and hang out with them at a restaurant.
Thank you for being honest and open. I think sometimes it’s helpful to vent to the vastness of the internet and just say how we feel.  I’m trying to respond to everyone with something positive for them so here is mine for you...  I hope that someday soon you get to safely take your daughter out into the world, a world where you are not afraid of her or someone you love getting sick. I hope that you can laugh with her at the museums as she stares at big dinosaur bones or how she “oooo”s at the displays. I hope you get to experience taking her to a grocery store and having her beg you for a package of cookies AND ice cream AND candy. I know it’s hard to see the future after all of this, I know...trust me but the future is out there and it’s gonna be great.
I feel this so much. My daughter know nothing different than what we have now, so it obviously doesn't bother her. But it kills me. She's never been to a store. She's never been passed around so everyone could meet her and play with her. She only knows us, my parents, her doctor, and her babysitter. Anyone else she sees is in masks.   Not to mention the anxiety when I think about us eventually being able to go out with her.
What band do you wish you could see first when you can go back?  I hope you can go safely see a concert soon and rock out to your favorite bands.
I hope that some time soon you’ll be able to go out safely. Maybe to a store with a friend and then to a movie and you won’t need to worry about being so close to other people and you’ll have an awesome time. ❤️
I hope that soon you can safely strike up a conversation with someone while out doing your daily chores and have them see you smile and laugh. I hope that one day soon we all won’t be so isolated ❤️
I’ve only now at 33 gotten into D&D but even then we play what I call D&D jr which is called dungeons.  I hope that soon you’ll be able to safely break out your favorite pair of dice and play with your friends and have a long campaign that goes all night ❤️
I hope someday soon you’ll be able to enjoy all those things again ❤️
I hope soon you’ll be able to safely see your family and sit on the beach enjoying the sun with a nice cold drink. I’ve never been to Hawaii but I’ve always wanted to go. Maybe you all can gather there!! 🏖   I can’t wait to see my girlfriend and give her a hug
I hope you get to make friends safely soon!
What sort of job do you do? It sounds like you’re in health care. Either way thank you for working so hard during the pandemic.   I hope someday soon you’ll be able to safely get hugs and see your patients smile and give them that sense of ease while you explain what you’re doing and why. ❤️
I hope that soon you’ll be safely able to have patrons come to your library again and see all that joy - people rediscovering the joy of the library, parents introducing little ones to the library, folks just enjoying themselves. ❤️
Wow that sounds great!! Do you and your boyfriend live in two separate countries? It sounds like it.   I hope soon you’ll get to see you boyfriend and share memories of traveling and meeting your family and all the amazing food and making all the memories you can. ❤️
I hope that someday soon you’ll get to see your friends and they can marvel at how great your son is and how awesome of a mom he has. I hope you get to have your friends safely over and have good food and laughter and You’re doing a great job ❤️
I hope that soon you’ll be able to safely do both of those things!! Maybe go to a dinner and a movie on the same night!! ❤️
You’d be surprised (or maybe not) how many people have that same desire and those fears.  I hope that soon you’ll be able to be around people in normal settings without feeling like you have to be on guard all the time, that you won’t have to worry about why that person over there coughed or if you sanitized your hands after you touched something. ❤️
I also am looking forward to that day.  I hope that it comes soon and we all can breath a deep sigh of relief as we re-learn how to love one another and be around each other again
I hope that someday soon you and your family will be together safely and you can make that turkey. I hope that you guys spend the day laughing and maybe watching your all time favorite family movie or playing a game or listening to music and catching up. I hope there are lots of hugs and laughter
Yeah that never works for me. You can use the icon at the bottom of the post that is looks like a chain link and link it that way  I hope that you get to safely date soon and that the person is amazing and funny and kind and that you can have a second or third date and one of them is at a ballgame where your team wins.  ❤️
You’re a person with a plan!!  I hope you can safely get your first bar order soon and that it’s amazing. I hope the beer is cold and the corn is crispy ❤️
I hope you and your friends can safely get together soon  ❤️
I hope that you are able to have your friends over safely soon, in your own place!, to play games and laugh and that the dnd session lasts really late and you all have a great time ❤️
Who is your favorite team?   I hope you and your dad are able to enjoy the puck drop again soon ❤️
I hope that soon you’ll be able to safely do things without worrying who is around you and that you can enjoy your pregnancy and your little one with a sigh of relief and peace ❤️
🤣 I hope that soon you’ll be able to go to a restaurant and the food is amazing....70% good because it’s actually good, 30% good because it’s food from somewhere other than your home!
It is interesting and nice to read everyone’s things they can’t wait to do. It’s nice to find that commonality that other people are missing and feeling the same way.  I hope that soon you’ll be able to safely go outside, see your friends and loved ones without the constant fear and worry. ❤️
I hope that soon your grandma will be able to safely see her loved ones and that you are first in line to give her a big hug.   Does your grandma get cards? I’d love to send her a card! I’m also in the sub for random acts of cards and I always sign up to send to those in homes right now to brighten their day ❤️
🤣 this made me laugh because my sister works at a grocery store deli and she tells me this all the time when she comes home. We always vent about our days and this is her #1 top peeve.   I hope soon you will be able to have a safe family gathering and that you won’t have to worry about customers not respecting you and your coworkers by not wearing masks or pulling them down to talk. I hope that soon you can relax in the beautiful weather with friends ❤️
I totally get it.   I hope that soon you’ll be able to safely leave your house and not worry that someone is crossing paths with you. I hope that you’ll be able to go to the grocery store and not need to sanitize your hands afterwards because you’re afraid you picked it up by touching something (unless you want too) and I hope that someday soon other humans won’t be a threat. I hope we all can find our love for each other again ❤️
I don’t think it’s weird to want to try to make a covid memory quilt. I think quilts historically can show something important in the quilters lives. I think it’s be great. There are also many awesome subs for sewing you should check out.   I hope that you can safely get back to game nights soon and your friends can “ooo” and “ahhh” over your progress on your covid memory quilt each time ❤️
I hope that you’ll be able to safely go back to concerts soon and see more metalcore bands and mosh safely ❤️
That’s awesome! I hope you and he can safely enjoy performing and watching him perform again soon
Being a spontaneous person right now must be so hard!  I hope that soon you’ll be able to safely walk out of your door and decide to go the movies...no wait the park! And then see a nice shop across the street and go in and find something amazing and on your way out decide to go to a new spot for a bite to eat. ❤️
I totally understand that. My girlfriend and I have a big distance between us and Skype is great but not the same as seeing someone in person.   I hope that soon you’ll get to see your loved one and hug her and go to your favorite burger place and go out to a store or a movie and just enjoy time together. ❤️ hang in there
I hope that soon you’ll be able to safely take your grand baby out places and get to show her all the wonderful things about the world ❤️
I’ve been to a few on your list.  Why do you want to go to Santa Rosa? It’s super close to me and not a whole lot going on there
India thanks bud
I’m right there with you. The hidden beauty of it all is the fact that we all now have an even deeper appreciation for it. The first concert we go back to will have another layer of joy that we’ve never experienced before. It’ll be exciting :)
Ugh I’m so sorry! I feel like 2020 had a fantastic lineup! Hopefully we can see our artists soon!
You are so so kind!! My favorite artists is lil peep and Mac Miller so sadly I won’t be able to see them in concert but I had bought myself justin bieber, Harry styles, and weezer tickets So I’m hoping to see them real soon!!
Who are your favorite artists???
She's 8 months, so she was born about 2 months into all of this. My best friend's baby is days old. It will be so nice when we all get to see if each other again! 💛
I truly hope you get to see your lady sooner rather than later!! 💕
Thank you! I love my job! I can’t imagine what I would do otherwise.
I haven't either! I'm excited to experience being in another country for the first time! (kinda)
Thank you. I really appreciate that!
Oh, well all types? I like making eva foam Armour and I also work with fabric.   I do mostly female characters but I am slowly learning crossplay techniques and cosplaying male characters (I'm currently working on The mandalorian, Bruno Bucciarati and Lan Zhang, all male characters)  I post most of my work on my Instagram [Nella_Paulina ](http://www.instagram.com/nella_paulina) feel free to check it out if you want
Thank you so much, I really can't wait for that day to come <3
Aww I’m on the fence about moving back and my dad says he would kick my butt if I did lol but god I miss him so much and I’m just so thankful he is next for the vaccine. He isn’t nervous about it at all, he talks about the polio vaccine and how it was the same fear of the unknown... but he says he’s ready for it. Those dad hugs are priceless. 🥰
Ohhh how wonderful that you have your dad and sisters help, that whole it takes a village is so true. His laugh I miss so much, it’s so deep and from the pitt of his belly but so warm. His hugs are well the hugs only an amazing daddy can give. 🥰🌹
Thanks! I hope so too!
Hmmmm the game of life or talisman
Yeah same here, I'll wear them until it's no longer the norm. Thank you, let's pray this covid gets sweeped under the rug!
Yes! I look forward to not having to think every single detail through and just hang out places: coffee shop, bookstore, playgrounds. I will be the town sloth!
Aww I'm so sorry to hear that. That has to be really difficult. Hopefully soon! I'm hoping with the new change in leadership we will be able to get vaccinated soon and things will ease up!
Thank you :)
Thank you! :) hope it happens lol!
Thanks! I also miss going on vacations lol.
I think a brewery... I was able to visit wineries this summer because most were outdoors. What about you?
We have done a few. It helps that spouse works for an airline. This was going to be her first trip outside North America though.
This time I was going to go to London, Paris, and Rome. I had been to Germany on a Youth Exchange in high school and the UK when I graduated college. I just love it so much. I found a place that is group tours and you can do monthly payments which is so much easier to do. I just love it so much and didn't think I would be able to afford it so soon but I made it work. Getting it cancelled at the last minute was heart breaking but now I will get a 'free' (since it's paid off) trip either this summer or next depending on covid stuff. It will happen eventually and I just have to keep telling myself that! Then I can finally make pasta in Rome and see the Eiffel Tower 😊
Yes. Any and all ways :)
Thank you!! ❤️
aww thanks for sharing that! It's got to be hard these days to have a fun, social job and not be able to do the social part of it!!
That would be nice to do!   Last year I had a trip to Hawaii booked and paid for. At least I got all my money back but I would rather go on that trip. A dream vacation would actually be to japan though!   For a concert my husband got me tickets for my birthday last year for 2 bands I really like. Magic Sword and Dance with the Dead and of course that was cancelled as well. 😩 I was really looking forward to that.
Framing is good too!
I was supposed to study in France last summer! I wanted to backpack around Europe (mostly eastern Europe, it's cheaper) too and I'm still hoping to do that c:
Thank you so much! Hopefully one day! 💖
Philippines 🥰 and thank you so much! I can’t wait ❤️ I hope you can have a pandemic-free year soon too 😊
That is such a kind hope that you've shared, and I truly appreciate it. You helped me paint a whole mental picture of what the (hopefully near) future will look like. Thank YOU for the support.
I want to visit every single national park. But I think next on my list would be Yosemite
Tyvm!! 🤗❤ I accept!🥰🧸
i work with disabled people but everyone is kept away at the moment So hard
Thank you! It will be great.
Me too!!!
So much this. ❤️
Thank you, even if we have to wait another year or two we still find ways to have fun😊
Exactly!  Thank you my friend. I hope you and yours are able to soak up all the hugs and time wanted after this has passed.  We'll make it!!
Favorite is the hardest when there's so many! And there are such different types.   Renegade at Valley fair will always be special because that's our first one and where we got married. We've ridden probably 150 times over a few years and know it like the back of our hand. There are a few others from that manufacturer that are also really good.   Aside from that I really love launch coasters. Maxx Force at Six Flags Great America is the highest acceleration in north america and it's amazing, it's like being shot from a cannon. Great America is the biggest park within a reasonable distance so we go there really often.   Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point is another launch. Instead of focusing on acceleration you just go ridiculously fast. My husband said he eyelids flapped lol. That was super fun last time we were there.   And one of the other types we really like is a manufacturer called RMC. They make these wood coasters with crazy steel I-beam tracks that do inversions and have a ton of forces pulling you out of your seat. Their biggest one is Steel Vengeance at Cedar Point and it's amazing!   So many more, I could go on all day 😅 but I will say that one of our favorite overall parks is Hersheypark in Pennsylvania. They have a lot of coasters and even their worst coaster is really good and smooth. If you're ever in the area (and covid isn't a problem 🙄) I highly recommend!
So for thanksgiving I made fois gras on caramelized apples with blueberry glaze covered venison, for one, bc he unfortunately had to go to a warehouse for work.   So I would’ve made the fois gras again and some seared steak with brown sugar sage sauce (he’s not a fan of deer) with truffle oil steak frits (and get those fancy steak fry baskets for display) and make some home made garlic aoli dipping sauce, and grill up some asparagus with salt just to be a little healthy haha  Mind you we live in an apartment, I made the meat in an air fryer (it rocks)
Sadly there are no pubs within walking distance of my house :( I have to get a bus!
Sort of anything. I would see what options I had at the time.
Winner is Coming. GoT theme played when we got an answer correct before everyone else 😄
Thank you <3  We were 5 kids, two brothers and three sisters. I had one brother who died of brain cancer, and since then we tried to be close. But my middle sister and eldest brother aren't on speaking terms, so I don't really see it happening soon. Whatever way we go, we'll have to exclude either my brother and his family, or my middle sister and her family. It's not fun. But I can't force them to sort out their problems. And I'm not really on speaking terms with my dad right now, but I'm working on fixing that.   Not that you wanted to know any of this, I just had a moment of melancholy.
The mundane absolutely sounds amazing right now. I hope we get to do all of that real soon.
Haha thanks! Just got to be patient. Don’t want to get others sick right now.
There is a tea shop in my city that is filled with tea pots and cups and fairy stuff. And I really miss it
It definitely does help to be able to vent. Thank you so much. We’ll all get through this! 💕
Exactly! My daughter has no idea either. I had her in October 2019 so we had a few months before things got crazy. But those few months were spent at home mostly while I was on maternity leave because she was so little, and ironically enough, I wanted to keep her away from germs. But little did I know, there would be way more to worry about soon...   It makes me sad when I think about some of the things that we took for granted before without even knowing it. And it makes ever more sad knowing that realistically, things won’t be back to ‘normal’ for a while. How are our children supposed to interact with others and learn socially? I worry about that! We have a small COVID bubble or my mother and father and my boyfriend’s mother and sister. And that’s pretty much it. She can’t play with other little babies. And thinking about it all sort of starts to send me into an anxiety spiral so I have to stop myself. Because she’s healthy, we’re healthy, that’s what matters the most. But still. 😞
I saw BTS once years ago before they blew up (they were part of a show with like 5 other bands) and they’d be fun to see again, other than that I’ll probably let me son decide since we try to go to at least one show a year.
Awww you’re so sweet, I hope the same for everyone ❤️
Ugh having a campaign that actually lasts would be amazing 😂 thank you so much! & thats okay! The main point is just to have fun
Awww thats sweet! How long has it been since you saw her?
Thank you! I have to say this sub has made the waiting soooo much easier :)
Yeah he lives in the US and I'm in Canada...  But thanks! Hopefully we're getting close to having borders opening safely soon!
You're very sweet, thank you!
I hope so!! One day soon.
thank you so much, last time it was karaoke so funny
Hehe, thanks!  What are you looking forward to?
My favourite team is the Montreal Canadiens, we don’t live nearby though so we only see them once a year when they are here for a game. We go to lots of junior games though, still lots of fun, but much cheaper lol.   Thanks ❤️
Thanks so much. I just wish I lived in an area where people took it more seriously. My state (US) is currently vaccinating at the slowest rate. At the current speed, it will take 10 years to reach 70% of the population 🐌 I'm hopeful the pace will pick up soon
Thank you!
Thanks so much friend! I hope so too! :)  She can get mail, and I’ve actually been meaning to send her a little card or something like that too, to brighten her day a little! ;) Thats so sweet of you! I bet the people you’ve sent cards to have loved them! I would say yes, but I’m just not sure how she’d feel about giving out her address. So I wouldn’t wanna do it without talking to her or my aunts first, ha know? But thank you so much for offering! You are too kind! :)
Thank you! That will be a good day
Thank you so much! 💚💚
The list is made by the New York Times.  I don't have access to the paper/their website so I copied and pasted from a travel website that copied the NYT list.  The NYT do a small write up about each destination.  I too was surprised that Santa Rosa made the list.  Not sure what they could say about Santa Rosa haha  I started paying attention to the lists when Oakland made the list a while back in the day.
Absolutely. I think we've all taken stock of what we appreciate and are grateful for. In a dream scenario, who would you go see play music live first?
I hope you get to travel safely soon and have fun with our northern neighbors
I will check it out!
You're lucky! My dad is being cagey about the vaccine. I'm so glad your dad is being super safe and so are you. My dad needs to hop to it! He's eligible for the vaccine too. We moved because we were fairly alone where we were and jobs went remote. Also, where we were was population dense, and where we are now (closer to him and other family) is much mellower, with lots of outdoor space to run around.
I read interestingly enough that it may become the new norm. They were using Japan as an example and saying how it is norm there and is a hold over from the Spanish flu and how as a result they just wear one anytime they go out. They have a relatively low caseload of COVID due to that.
Ha town sloth. I like that.
Thank you. It’s hard but I love her so she’s worth it...sometimes. (don’t tell her I said that 😆)  I hope you get to see your friends soon with all sorts of yummy snacks and games and laughter soon
I hope so too!
I’ve never been but it is very close to my house. My aunt lives just outside the park in the town there.
It’s okay, friend. Sometimes it’s okay to vent and just say things out loud.   It’s hard when different sides of your family can’t get along. I think that it’s important to focus on what is in our control - such as your attempts at mending the relationship with your dad. Your siblings have to decide to put things aside for themselves and maybe they will one day. In the mean team Focus on what what’s best for you and your well-being so you can keep thriving and hanging in there
...right. I know. I’m just trying to respond to everyone’s comments with some positivity.
Totally understand. I had my daughter in July. So right in the middle of the pandemic. So much of my pregnancy was in it, too. Gave birth while wearing a mask.   We have a covid crew, too. It's my friend who keeps baby on Tuesdays. They have two kids so at least she gets that interaction.   I didn't realize how much I took for granted. I thought we would have a baby shower, friends would meet her, and I'd just take her all around during maternity leave. Nope. Instead we stayed home except for me to go to therapy and for doctor's appointments.
Seeing my girlfriend and giving her a big hug
Is your state California cause if so, me too!! We are going sooooo slowly
Ooh a tough one... ideally I would like to see either Pearl Jam or the Avett Brothers! I’ve already seen them and they give amazing live performances. If it were someone I haven’t seen yet.... probably Highly Suspect! What about you?
Thank you!!!
I would love to be close to him again, but the city and state he’s in are super over populated and the city itself is just really bad. I’ve tried getting him to live with me but he won’t leave, we live in WA and he lives in CA. 💚 hopefully your dad will come around.
Ah I read that somewhere too! And how china wears them too becuase they have so much pollution there. It would be cool if we can do the same here
Thank you!
Oh wow that’s awesome. I wanted to visit last year but I could not. I doubt it is going to be this year so hopefully 2022.
Yeah, that's what I figured too. I'm not going to intervene, they need time to work through what happened between them. And thank you for the kind words. I will focus more on fixing things with my dad, and in the meantime I can just be the best little sister I can be.
Yes! I think we all need some positivity this time of year :) much appreciated   (I hope that didn’t come off as sarcastic)
I can’t imagine being pregnant and giving birth during a pandemic so all the kudos to you. You are incredibly strong. ❤️ Everything is so tough, but we’ll get through it!
Cute Love! I pray that day comes soon!  Thank you for hosting this amazing contest! It is a great insight into why the inconveniences we're currently facing are worth it!
SC 🙃 only about 12% the population of CA
Flight of the Conchords. I need a pick me up :)
❤️
2022.   💪🏽
That sounds like a solid plan.   Sometimes people are stubborn for years and years. I hope they realize sooner rather than later what they are missing but if not, I hope you know that they are very lucky to both have a sister who cares about them even when they are stubborn with each other.
We will. :)  I didn't know anything different since I've never been pregnant before!! Ha.
It honestly is so frustrating how it seems to be so unorganized and there is no oversight from anyone to give concrete guidelines
But if it was a serious show Jack White.
I don’t think I’ve ever heard of them! I’ll have to jam out to them tonight :)
They're from New Zealand. They had a small show too :)  [Robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUnibKe_o18)
I care about my siblings a lot. They, my husband and his mum, are all I have left. I went no contact with my own mother almost a year ago, and it's been hard, but also the best decision ever.
Same, she was my first and only so far. It’s all just so weird. 😭
Yup and they just pushed back teachers by 2 months to make room in 1a for government employees. ...while the governor is simultaneously pushing 5 day face to face. Oof. (Also I'm a teacher)

u/HauntedCoffeeCup i will think of you every time I eat one. Yummm. Thank you so much! Plus!!! It’s hard to find mug cakes that aren’t all chocolate. So this is extra exciting! Thank youuu
They look so gooood!
You deserve it :)
You two are both the best :)
Yum! It got there super damn fast too. Did the other part arrive or no? Do I need to scream at Amazon?
I haven’t tried them before, but they *do* look super yum
Aww thank you!!!
No, *you* two are!!
I got them both! I think I got them yesterday, actually. But it came with a bunch of boxes with presents for my mom so I didn’t notice until I opened one of the boxes and saw Moira, that it was for me. Thank you so much! She’s adorable
🥰
Oh I posted this right before you posted her 😂 She’s so cute!
I just thought they deserved their own thanks posts lol

But not the ET you’re thinking of. We had an African Grey  parrot named ET for more than forty years who could say all kinds of things: 10-4 good buddy, c’mere, hello, get to work, get in bed right now, and many other things. He often said unexpected and seemingly apt things that made us laugh. He whistled, chirped like outside birds, meowed, coughed, sniffled and did all the beeps, whirrs and rings in our home. He perfectly replicated the phone so we would ask, was that the phone-phone or the bird-phone?   ET died in the night last night and we are going to miss him. Our home will be so much quieter without him.  This contest prize will be the Funko Pop Fawkes from Harry Potter to celebrate forty years with an amazing pet and family member.  To be considered:   1. Add this [Funko pop](https://www.amazon.com/Funko-Pop-Movies-Potter-Fawkes/dp/B07P82MKGQ) to your wish list.  If you really have your heart set on another Funko Pop about $15, link to it in your post and if you’re chosen, I’m willing to gift that one instead.  2. Share a photo of a bird you love, whether wild or pet and tell a quality you like about it.  3. Tell one thing someone said to you that was unexpected and delightful or funny.   4. Make someone’s phone-phone ring today just to say hello and let us know you did. This is on the honor system.   5. Summon someone by saying “ET, phone home” which is also the randomizer term.  If you are outside the US, please have an e-gift card for $15 with your email on your list in case shipping or the item is unavailable.     This will close at sundown today my time.[contest is closed]
[harpy eagle](https://pin.it/7oSrzWk) ET phone home u/loopyzumab I like the harpy eagle because it's one of the few birds that has a mystical magical feel to it, last night my husband said in a child like voice"I smoked to much marijuanas and my legs are broken" and it was ridiculous. I called my best friend today, just to tell her I love her and to check in. Im sorry for your loss.
i feel your pain. i had a Congo African Grey parrot who I loved very dearly. She would sing and talk to me. Unfortunately I had to rehome her when I got sick and could no longer take care of her properly. The picture I chose to share reminds me of her the most. I found it on the internet. I love how smart African Greys are!  [African grey](https://imgur.com/a/XJzG8uA)  My son told me I was amazing today.  called my friend  i summon u/noimnotsally ET,  phone  home
Not entering - just came by to say I am so sorry for your loss. I am sure ET has crossed over the rainbow bridge and is telling all the other birdies all about his awesome life.  May your pain be eased knowing ET had a happy life. ❤️
Im sorry to hear about ET, it's sounds like he was a really special little dude.  [These are the whiskey jacks](https://i.imgur.com/VNxgPG3.jpg) that hang out in the lift lines. People used to feel them so they are pretty chill around humans and fly to raised hands, ski poles and if none are readily available they'll land on your helmet. They fly off pretty quick once they realise you don't have food for them so you have to be ready with your camera!  ***Don't feed wild animals, folks!***  I called my friend on the mountain to find her, but other than that most people I know are in a 8hr ahead time zone so I don't think they'd appreciate a call now...  Most days I'm on the hill I get compliments on my helmet (it's star wars themed) but today a guy told me that he had the same design on his flight helmet. His son (who was about 6/7) pointed it out shouting "Daddy it's your helmet!!" Very cute and I love it when people notice the helmet.  ET, phone home u/rainbowterfly - you were summoned because you just commented on my bird pic on another thread, so thought you would enjoy this thread too!
I'm not entering as I have this pop but my condolences to you and your family. ET what a great name and great bird. So sorry for your loss 💕
Not entering, but I'm very sorry for your loss :-(
I'm so sorry to hear of your loss <3 sounds like he had an amazing life
Awwww I'm so sorry! I grew up with birds and they are just the greatest pets.  RIP ET! 🌈🕊️❤️  (Not entering)
Not entering, but I’m so sorry for your loss! African Greys are such smart and majestic birds. 💜💜  These are my 2 [budgies](https://imgur.com/a/4cur7cH). Since getting them, I have fallen in love with this cute species. I’m sure u/budgiejen can relate
Not entering, but very sorry to hear about your beloved friend. We have a parrot named Pigeon, and I would be totally heartbroken to lose him. Hugs for you.
2.  This is [Sweet Pea](https://imgur.com/a/2PDZx7t). My budgies are all wild, they’re flock birds. I love them. But Sweet Pea is somewhat tame. He comes and hangs out with me sometimes.   3. Well, I was pretty delighted when you gifted me and explained the reason why. It’s not often I’m credited for saying the right thing. Usually it’s more like the opposite.   5. ET, phone home u/peachy-bird  I’m so sorry for your loss. I’m about halfway through Alex and Me, but I have trouble progressing because I know how it ends.
I’m so sorry for you loss
I'm sorry for your loss🥺
Not entering, but I'm just going to say that I hope ET rests in peace.
ET, phone home  u/KreiaIncarnate  I hope your heart heals quickly.  He loved you and sounds well-loved.  &#x200B;  [This is the Indian Blue Robin.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/68lDXi35xtuz9YicaGoAs8yG7wbivOAwucm8qkZ7JhLYegaYLL54RHvibP0UcxP9A-uPScPmB23I67tQi-34QCK-Dgk0hYlpGj4n3RBYnzT7)  I think they're very sweet-looking and have a tattoo of one.
Not entering but I’m so sorry for your loss!
Rest in peace ET. It sounds like ET had a very loving home.  My favorite birds are [owls](https://ibb.co/kD6J4s2). Hoot hoot! 🦉 They’re just so cute and I associate them with intelligence.  Something delightful my boyfriend said to me was that I looked nice today!  I call my dad every day!  I have a Goku Funko on my misc wishlist that I have my heart set on!  ET, phone home u/sweetiepie333  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest in memory of ET. 💛
I am so sorry for your loss. Birds, especially psittacines, have the biggest personalities and I can’t imagine how hard this must be. ❤️  [This](https://imgur.com/gallery/OjWw6Ge) is Napoleon, aka my fluffernutter. He was the first non-domestic animal that I connected with. May he Rest In Peace ❤️ He was not trusting of anyone when I met him. I started by sitting in his enclosure to read to him, then I took over his care so he could get more used to me and I would always talk and talk to him. I worked on getting him used to enrichment to keep him from being bored but also not scaring him too much. My efforts paid off enough that he stopped angry/stress pooping when I entered his enclosure and instead would chatter at my arrival. It was a friend of mine with actual training and raptor experience that got him comfortable with coming to us and being handfed. That’s how I got that picture of us. All I wanted was for him to like me and the feeling of him comfortably perched on my arm was the best in the world. He’s still my background on my phone. I don’t want him to be forgotten.   Just the other day my best friend who lives in another state called to tell me her library had a bunch of free books including Stephen King and wanted to know if there were any that I wanted. She sent me pics and I picked out two I didn’t have yet that she’s going to mail me and then I picked her out some Kings and a Thomas Harris that I’ve read and think she would enjoy cause she’s been struggling to find a book that’ll capture her attention. A call from my bestie to tell me about free Stephen King books was very unexpected and absolutely delightful.   I promise to phone-phone her later this evening.   ET, phone home u/3pmactivities Do you like birds?
I haven’t got a bird but I am sorry for your loss as losing any pet is just heart wrenching.    I love watching birds in averys though and the colours are lovely. I haven’t learnt how to share a picture yet, I’ll try this link [a beautiful kookaburra ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_kookaburra). Their noises are amazing and they remind me of my time in Australia.   I just called my friend and told her the story of ET. She was sad and couldn’t believe his age.   ET phone home u/pizzaplacegirl
Not entering. I just wanted to say sorry for your loss. Birds are fun. ET sounded like a smart bird. Rest easy ET!
I'm so sorry for your loss. This picture  [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/wKXRsMPcuBs5sijQ8) reminds me of the first pet I ever had. A red Myna bird. He only lasted a day due to health complications, but I loved him to death. The way that he chirped and fluttered around was just so beautiful. I remember just wanted to spend all my time as a kid in the room he was kept in. He was certainly special and a beloved pet. No, a family member.  Someone recently told me that they liked my eyebrow scar. It was unexpected and really wholesome.  I was on the phone with my dad and asked him if he remembered our red Myna bird. He said he could clearly remember him and wished he lived longer with us.  ET, phone home u/sweetiepie333 please come join this contest that reminds us to cherish the ones we love.
Not entering, my condolences to ET. He is in a happy place, where birds of all kinds gather!
i am so so sorry to hear about your ET. :( how long did you have him?   I've been thinking of getting that fawkes for awhile so i went ahead and added him to WL. i happen to love [hummingbirds!](https://i.imgur.com/2vZl7fh.jpg) hummingbirds weigh less than a nickle WHICH MAKES THEM EVEN CUTER. THEY ARE SO SMOL!!!!   one time, my friend said "you're not fat, you're just all boobs." that... that helped me a lot, LMFAO. it felt good.   ET, phone home u/poetniknowit how are you?! it's been a while!!
The harpy eagle looks magnificent! Lol your husband 🤣
Aww your son is a sweetie,I bet that warmed your heart from a teen boy huh🤗 hugs
They are smart! I bet you missed yours.
You can pick another if you’d like to enter. I amended the post to allow for this.
Thank you. He was amazing.
So pretty! We had budgies too and raised some from babies. I like them too!
Aw, pigeon!
Where are you that budgies are wild? So cool and sweet pea is a pretty bird.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thanks for the summons! 🥰
I haven’t got a bird no. I love watching them in averys though and the colours are lovely.
Such a pretty bird. I love owls too.
I’ve ne ET heard a kookaburra- gonna find the sound online.
Thanks for the summons! 🥰
beautiful but only one day? Sad and yet, a lasting impression.
Well I did get him donuts so ... 😂
I miss her every day. She was such a love bug. Her favorite breakfast was scrambled eggs and if you had licorice, she’d attack you for it 😂
It's fine my friend I appreciate it anyways. Hope you are doing okay
Sending you so much love
He's a sweetie, a Meyer's. Message me if you ever need to talk.
Oh no I didn’t mean like wild budgies like in Australia. I just mean I don’t tame them. They just chill in their cages, get free flight time. They’re good about going back to the cage at night if they aren’t already back earlier.
You can still enter by telling about your favorite wild bird species, if you want.
Exactly. Only one day and yet a lifetime full of memories. It's the small things that truly showed me how to appreciate my Myna. If only he had survived.
Lol
Doing well, just gonna miss him.
Oh, nice!
Yes it would be hard :( I only ever had one bird growing up it was a budgie bird but my cat got hold of it..I've always wanted to own a parrot or parakeet only because they love to talk and I find it interesting how they learn so quickly.    Much love hugs and thoughts to you my friend. If there is anything I can do let me know.
Oh, cats are like that. I’m sure that was super sad.
Yeah it was cause I trained them to sit on my shoulder and as an 11 yest old I thought that was pretty cool lol
That is cool!

I love it. Just the right size!
That's good news! How's your back?
Better actually. Heat, ice and the massager helped a lot!  Hope you are on the mend too. ❤️
Excellent! Yes, my back is much much better, thanks.

CLOSED  Low-effort Sunday contest for y'all because why not  Simple question: how many books do I own? Hints: I only own books I really, really like; textbooks *are* included in this total *if* I own them; I picked up a box of books from my parents' house last month which increased the total. Answer is definitely under 150, probably under 100. I don't know yet, I haven't counted them, but I'm very bad at estimating numbers.  -Open worldwide   -Closes tonight (Sunday) at 11:59pm Eastern time   -1 winner, $10 or less, don't link your wishlist but let me know if there's something in particular that you want!   -I previously had "chosen by randomiser" but I'm dumb and the winner will actually be whoever gets closest to the correct number. But use "books" for the randomizer in case more than one person gets it or nobody gets it and multiple people are closest   -DBAD 💕

For my first contest, I thought I'd ask the help of the masses to create new and interesting Activate Your Thinking (AYT) Questions for my high school English class...a cool way to crowd-source open ended questions and give out a few (3) $10ish prizes.  &#x200B;  My class is studying Journalism and each day start with an open-ended question that connects to the unit and gets the class warmed up. Past AYT questions include:  \-Would you ever want to be a journalist?  Why or why not?  \-Should it be illegal for journalists to take photos/videos of the police?

Should journalists be obligated to offer assistance when covering a potentially dangerous or life-threatening situation? Why or why not?   Activate your thinking!   u/TheNUTRONIC I summon thee!
Activate Your Thinking !!  Omg! You know I’ve always been interested in being a war correspondent? Being that type of journalist is crazy dangerous and I have so much respect for those who take on that job. Since I’m so interested in that job specifically I guess my questions are ..  Are journalists receiving enough protection during war ?   How do you make sure the information you’re putting out there is factual and accurate ?   What negative stigmas are there surrounding journalists ?  Are journalists payed enough?   u/Sirmiketheyoung are you interested in journalism?   What about u/huntfishcamp and u/fawn_angel ?? 💕
Thanks for the contest friend! Activate your thinking!  So kiddos: What is an important part of journalism that's often overlooked? For instance, do you know what proper citations are and how to use them? Do you look for ways to incorporate others POV without changing their story to fit your agenda? How does unbiased reporting influence your writing style? What is the difference between first person and third person reporting?  I love this. I'm a library science/ English MA and I get SOO many questions from students about what is a proper citation. It's so important lol.   &#x200B;  Hey /u/late_to_join_reddit what questions would you have for them?
Activate your thinking  Are there things/subjects that should be off limit for journalists?   u/PsychologicalPenguin any thoughts on this?

Activate your thinking!  I always thought about being a journalist like I did with many others but my English writing isn't super great and it doesn't seem like a stable career. Police are public servants so no infact they should have body cameras anytime they are acting in the line of duty. Including plain clothes. The ability to ask the right questions, gives you a different interview then those who ask the typical boring questions.  I'd rather conduct an interview and although stan lee has passed I would've loved to interview him and ask him just how it feels to have such an impact but if I had to interview a live person probably Tim burton or another artist asking why he decided to go dark with art or odd what made him think of xyz. u/Tiikeri23 any questions?
Activate your thinking!  How different is journalism from paparazzi and why?  What is your favourite way of reporting something and why? Ex.

I’ve dabbled in journalism and I love it. I wouldn’t do it full time as it’s not in my temperament, but I do wish I did have the temperament for it.   Of course journalists should be able to photograph/film police. I think of journalists as basically akin to God. In any society, there should be nothing off-limits to a good journalist. By that I mean someone who knows how to keep their sources safe and anonymous.   Asking questions is an essential skill because most people won’t volunteer pertinent information. You have to know how to ask for it.   I’ve been on both sides, asking the questions and answering them, many times. I enjoy both. I like talking about myself, and I like finding out about others. I think I prefer asking questions, though. I just love finding out new things too much.   I would interview Patrick Stewart. I would ask him how he feels about his character of Picard having such a profoundly positive impact on my life.   **My question is: Do you think journalists should receive medals of honour for their service the way military members do? Why/why not?**  u/dimethylxanthine, how about you? Ask me literally any question, and I’ll answer honestly. Activate Your Thinking!!   TFTC. xx
not entering, but what a great idea for a contest!!
Should a journalist be able to voice their opinion when reviewing the facts? why/why not? Are you more willing to read a journalist who produces opinionated content? why/why not?  Activate Your Thinking   u/Johnwoods1023, I'm certain you'd have good questions to add!
activate your thinking  love the question, definitely going to save some peoples answers for my own classes   my favorite thing to discuss when I'm teaching or doing some sort of lesson for teens is about freedom of speech in journalism, is it good? is it bad? should it be limited or under censorship? if yes, how much and how to enforce it evenly? it's also a really good time to do this discussion with all the riots and D.C, just try to stay on the main idea and keep them out of the politics that in the matter  I'm still new so I don't really know people to tag so I'm going to Tag u/Brooklynbookworm so you'll can participate in your own game 😂 good luck
Some interviewees are initially resistant to answering challenging questions. What can a journalist do to help get these interviewees to open up more?   Activate Your Thinking  u/spacesoulboi
Activate Your thinking.  I've been summoned a few times I think lol. I have been thinking on it too.   For news to be unbiased, journalist should be unbiased. At what point does your bias change your reporting or investigation? When do you gain a vendetta?  I imagine no one journalist has come out of this last 4 year political climate with out leaning or vehemently choosing sides. Does that impact the integrity of the news and coverage?
That’s a great moral and ethical question.
That is a great question!
Thanks for the tag!
Oooo that’s a good one!! I’m sitting here like 👀
I can’t do it LOL I’ve been trying to come up w a question re:journalism or being a journalist but nothings coming together!
My question was do you think journalists have a low reputation in most places and why/why not 👀
Thanks for the tag! And great question.  I think that the best that they can do is to be as authentic and factual in their reporting or writing as they can!
Great question!
For you my friend, of course!  When speaking of journalistic integrity, how does a journalist avoid being biased when writing stories and asking questions?
Haha... that was 40 not 49 years. That’s pretty specific.
I posted one earlier. Thanks for tagging me!
My brain is on break right now lol
Hmmm 🤔
Thanks for the tag!
good ones.
I would ask what you're still doing awake and not in bed lol🤣 I'm only joking thank you for calling me my friend I'm getting ready to go to bed myself
OXFORD COMMA IS A MUST
hahahaha. i love the Oxford comma even when i forget it.
Thanks for the tag!
Thank you for the summons! Mine is about whether there is any situation in which a journalist should reveal an anonymous source
Thank you for the summons friend <3
Ooh this one seems fun. Thanks for the summons!
Uhm... that’s a hard one... 😊
I posted one in here thanks for the summon though! I think yours are articulated better too! I forgot to summon someone in mine 🤦‍♀️ haha oops
Thanks for the summons!🥰
Great question, Thank you!
I went to bed after I posted. Are you stalking me? 😴
Hear hear!!
Oh I didn’t see! Thank you! I just like to write and have lots of practice 😄
Lol no I don't think so honey🤣 I was just coming in to answer your tag I slept pretty good last night how about yourself?🐭
I used to love writing too but I think having my phone in my hand all the time has shortened my attention span for things 🤨
Better than other recent nights.
I totally get that. I haven’t written anything in a long time other than stuff for school

It’s a lot of work! Dang upkeep! Lol. But thank you!
Thank you!!! No one can tell I have a beard with my mask on, so it’s always a surprise!! It needs trimmed though!!  Is it the wrinkles in my eyes that make me have kind eyes? I still don’t know what that means! Lol.
Thank you very much!! :)) it’s the nose 😂
Thank you very very much! It’s a lot of work. I take care of it better than my head hair 😂
We can just photoshop my beard onto your face? That’s not weird, right?

Thank you :) I had just finished lunges and wanted to die lol
Thank you, I am really trying. I crushed a workout yesterday and took that picture afterwards.
Hey there :). I look forward to this now weekly to get gassed up.
My shirt is from old navy lol
Thank you, but my style is mostly band tees and button ups, jeans and shorts. Nothing special.
Thank you so much. I got a lot of button ups from Old Navy.
Thank you! That’s them without makeup. My eyebrows are a flex of mine hehe.

Hey, thank you 💛
Ughh no we’ve been over this! You’re the prettiest. ☺️
Good, I’m glad it’s been ok so far. 😉
Thanks! I can only do a nice side braid, if I try to do it in the back it gets wonky haha
Thanks! Its a normal braid, to keep my hair out of the way while I clean haha
Thanks :) I'm probably chopping it off tomorrow 😂
So, the hair dye story... I got it bleached to do [this](http://imgur.com/a/EXcF5we) but the color washed out and was just bleached. So then I did a metallic purple and the purple washed out so I was left with the metallic color 😂
Thanks :)
Thanks :)
Thanks 🥰
thank you! ❤
Thank you! ❤
Haha, it's all my 18 year old daughter.  She has the magic eyeliner hands.  I don't even LIKE liquid eyeliner but she makes it look amazing even on me.  Thank you for the compliment. 🥰🥰
Thank you!  It's all my 18 year old daughter.  She loves to experiment with makeup and wants to be a cosmetologist one day. 🥰🥰
Oh we were!  Until his feed pump started beeping.  Then he woke up and cried for 20 minutes. 🤦🏻‍♀
Yes, it is! My hair used to be shorter, but now that it got some length during the pandemic, I have curls 😂 thank you 💕
Thank you 😊 :D
Thanks! I love the Whiskey jacks, they hang out around the lift lines because people used to feed them until they started getting too fat to fly 😅 But now there's signs everywhere saying not to feed them anymore.  Birds can't read though so they swoop down to raised hands in the hopes of some granola bar crumbs.  I have so many pics of them in my hand but this was the first time I got two!
Aw thank you ❤❤❤
Really? Who is she?
Thank you! 🥰
Thank you! 🥰
Haha thank you! 💕💕
Thank you! 💕
Thank you!🥰
Thank you!💕
Thank you! 😊
Thanks! 😊
Oh my god ... that’s crazy 😭 thank you
Imgur really hate selfies 😥 I’ve seen others get downvoted for it too   Thank you though I - 🥰🥰
They really do 😭 its so dumb and i didn’t know !!
Thank you 😅💘💓
🥺🥺🥺🥺 how sweet
Aww thank you!!! I have about hundred earrings!!! I love them soo much
Thank you soooo much
You’re the nicest 💕
If I could share it I would :)
Wow thanks! Nope it’s all natural...
Thank you!
You’re too sweet 😘
Thanks lady! 💕
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
They're on now but I really hope so too! And thank you! My ponytail is one of those hair pieces I was talking about lol
Thanks! :)
Ty!
I definitely will! :) hopefully on the next selfie Sunday, lol! I meant to do it this week, but we have been crate training/ regular training the puppy, so the days have just seemed to get so busy and full so fast! Haha. But I’m definitely doing it any day now, lol.
Aw thank you! :)
Thank you friend! :)
You. I like you. You've got your head screwed on right 😂
YESSSSS!
Haha why not?? It makes us feel better and it’s fun, too! Here’s to self-care!
Bet he's like, 3rd lockdown and not 1 invite. Fuming!   🤣
As are you 💖
Why thank you!!
haha. why, yes. i dabble in birth charts and it’s realllly fascinating stuff.
Aww! 🥰🥰
youre too sweet <3 XOXOX
Aww thank you so much! 🥰
Aww, thank you! :)
🥰
💖💖💖
It’s the truth!!
You’re so welcome!
Mine was a baby face til I hit about 42. Now no one cards me for any reason. Hurts my old lady feelings 😂
💖💖💖
They’re great! Lol
I tried red once, it looked crazy. Maybe I’ll try blue next time!
That's really fun. I'm a big fan of shorter hair/pixie cuts 😊
It’s been fine. It’s my moms bday. So I’ve been busy all day. Too much time to think is bad for me. My anxiety gets loud. How are you?
Oh cool! What a cutie!
I love those little birds. We had several pairs at the aviary and one who was green that was mean as shit, until you got him out of the cage, then he’d try to love you so hard he’d try to crawl in your mouth. I also think I’m mistaken, the females are the more brightly patterned? I used to know, but I’m slowly forgetting things like that.
Aww cute 😍
You're welcome! ❤
You're welcome! ❤
Thank you 💖💖💖
You're absolutely welcome!
You're welcome! ❤
🤣🤣🤣 I mean he wasn't wrong, but that's freaky as hell
Caffeinated eyes are the best.  I've had my eyes since birth, dont like them.
Haha, I don't think I look very good when I cry either. 🤣
You’re so welcome! 💖
I thought it was professionally done. You did such a good job in my opinion! 🥰
You're welcome! 😘
I could literally drool right now at the combo of pineapple and jalapeño. That sweet with that spicy is hella good!
I’m going to have to check this out. I always love your edits.
🤣🤣🤣 First of all, you're good looking without the edits! Definitely not a turd 😂  Secondly, you really have an artistic eye. I love seeing what you'll do with your photos
Well it looks awesome! I’m really indecisive so when I do use a filter (which isn’t often) it takes me forever to share one and get it to my liking.
😊
Oh I bet it's a beautiful dress! I'd pick the couch too! I don't even own a full length mirror (not that I'd want one yikes!). But good for you for putting in the effort! I live in tshirts and yoga pants 99% of the time!
You got it 😊💕
Yes!
Sounds like a great way to ring in the new year!
No really, I love those kind of teeth, the way they sit. It’s so damn adorable.
Nice! It's lovely 💙
💜💜💜
I'd would love to come there. Where in France are you? I've visited Paris, but think I was around too many touristy things to really appreciate it (though the Eiffel Tower, Louvre, and Arc de Triomphe were all really cool)
Jeeeeez  all that stardust
I love tour long pink hair!!!
I'd love to continually color my hair but I have poopy brown hair so I'm sure all the bleaching would kill it. I did dye it rose gold back in October but my brown hair came in, it looked weird, so I went dark brown.
You rock those glasses!
It is and also the one after with the bird who is clearly very happy to have a photo.
Did you make the hat and scarf? They’re lovely!
Mascne is what I was starting to get, that was annoying.
Haha I usually use a fake tree and I took it down a few weeks ago. I wasn't feeling Christmas 😅 at least you won't have to worry about it anymore!
My hubby has one. We’ve a lot of beard stuff to maintain the dwarves hair
It's the light that shines from them 💛 I don't know how else to explain it
Nahhhh. It’s the whole package!
Nope, totally not weird. Photoshop was made to do what genetics can't 😄
I 3rd, 4th and 5th that. the color looks pretty dang amazing. LOVE IT!
Beats cutting your hair off if the colour ain't right.  I need green hair wig but none exist for men really like that.
Everything is on point. Lips, eyebrows, glasses, wig
I've been buying a lot of clip in ponytails and stuff on Amazon because I just dye my hair way too much lol I like to change it a lot. Wigs can really be hit or miss on how natural they look with Amazon so I haven't gotten one yet.
The UK, we're in our 3rd lockdown and unfortunately it'll not be our last this year. I'm not a betting man but I bet we will have another 3 before the end of the year.
Oooo thank you! I might just buy it 🥰
YW 💖
You're welcome! ❤
Look up Alice: Madness Returns  It's a dark take on Alice in Wonderland. She's beautiful
You are welcome! ❤
Thank you so much 🥺
Amen to that
You're welcome! ❤
Awesome. I like babies, it's just toddler age upwards I dont tend to like that much 😂
you know last time we talked? i was not BS’ing, i did 10 miles on the stationary bike after i told you that you motivated me! thank you for inspiring me to get my butt in gear! :) keep crushing it!!!
Right?  Haha ❤️❤️❤️
Dunno what that is but it looks great.
Dawe, thanks friend! :)
Okay, your pic was looking very dark, and I had exactly the same issue when I uploaded the pic through the app, so I thought it was a big coming from this.  Looking good btw, I didn't even told you! 😱  Edit: apparently it's not the uploading of pics that is faulty, but my app when I view some pics
Thank you 💖💖💖
No, you! ❤️
Ooh, how short are you going?
Ah, the curse of brightly coloured hair. It’s so much work! It looks amazing as is though!
Aww dear
That's super cool!
with the cutest smile c:
Gab Smolders
Lol lame, I know.
It was literally my first thought ❤
Meh, people on the internet can be mean, but you look great
niaaaaaa your selfies are always so cute!!!
Nice! (Not that it made a difference either way. Was just gonna ask for product recs if you used some, lol)
That's totally understandable! I actually wanted to do mine for February but bleaching and coloring black hair is awful :'c  How is training the pupper going? c:
Yes! 🥰💕
Lmao!
You’re too kind 😭😭💕❤️
I’m such a baby to it but it’s all so cool!!
You know what? Red glasses look bad on me too. Maybe it’s just that color?
Me too!
Happy birthday to your mom! Hoping she has a great day! I totally understand what you mean about too much time to think and your anxiety getting loud. I feel that way sometimes too. I’m doing well. Got lots of things accomplished yesterday. 😊
Nah it’s males who get the bright eyeshadow. And the extra blue on the wings.
It was kind of weird. He was acting like a moth who found a lightbulb. I was with my daughter whos 21, and he was closer to her age so she was like WHY IS HE UP YOUR ASS AND NOT MINE.
😂 I’ve had mine that long too. They don’t work very well and are extremely sensitive. Annoying really. I should ask for a refund.
Awww thank you so much! And I love your username. Pizza is my favorite!
Oh it’s so perfect 👌
Its really good, has lots of effects. Some you can try are made by the people who make the app.  I like the ones where its got a shadow over the image like the light is coming through a window net.
Thanks for the compliments 🤭
Yup. I dont think you've posted a bad selfie at all.
Awesome
I’m sitting here smiling like a goon, you made my day
I'm in [Calais](https://i.imgur.com/IzDLnUK.png), totally North, so I'm closer to London and Brussels than Paris! 😂  We don't have the Eiffel Tower or Arc de Triomphe, but have the beach ([snowy beach](https://i.imgur.com/dPMsLuN.jpg) sometimes), and a [dragon](https://imgur.com/a/pTHC3VY)!
Thank you so much!!! I love my pink hair so much!!! It's my favorite thing to do!!! 🤗💕
I have dark brown hair naturally too. If you don't bleach it too much and you don't wash it too much it stays pretty ok. I keep my hair up in a bun most of the time and wash it every 3-4 days. I dyed my hair a shade darker and it was even more unhealthy afterwards. Permanent dye is worse than bleach imo. I bet the rose gold looked cool!
Thank you!!!
Yeah! You cant really see them very well but I crocheted them both. That scarf is my autumn/early winter scarf, its gotten a lot colder now so Ive been wearing my doctor who/tom baker scarf my mum knitted me that wraps around my neck 4 times xD
Oh you bad seed with the fake tree... but I get it! So much easier to not deal with watering it or the needles! I’ve got a pile of Christmas trees in my back yard... all my friends bring them over for the burn pile 😂
My first beard was... atrocious! Then I realized I had to take care of it. So I shaved it off and started over. It’s much much healthier this time around lol. This is as long as work will allow it to be though :(
I suppose that makes sense! I’ll take it :) thank you!
My heart!!! Why do you have to be such a sweetheart? 🥰
exactly! and really??? 🤔🤔 time to start a businessss!!!!!
🥺 [aw shuckkkksssss.. thank you! ](https://imgur.com/a/EejwSst)
yes! i spend a lot of time on youtube watching people review wigs from amazon before i even consider it. i even have a mannequin head on a tripod where i pluck the edges and part and cut baby hairs. it was a new hobby to get through this quarantine boredom. 😂
That’s a bummer! We should probably be under a countrywide lockdown, to be honest. Our first lockdown was not fun, so I know what it’s like.
Oooooh that's really cool looking!
You're welcome! ❤
As parent to a couple of teens-ish and and three-going-on-fifteen I can wholeheartedly understand 😅
Hell yeah. That’s what I like to hear.
It’s a clothing store and thanks
🌹🥰
My hair is down to close to my waist, and with working from home and depression I dont always brush it as often as I should. I think I might cut to just a tad past my shoulders to make it more manageable and wfh friendly haha
Awww thank you so much!!! That is such a nice compliment!!! You made my day!!
Haha sorry none here...I rarely even wear lipstick or gloss!
Ohh yes, that’s definitely tough! I’m just dark blonde, so it actually got really light really fast. I actually missed a couple little spots (thankfully they are small and not noticeable, lol) because by the time I went to do touch up, the rest of it was done! Haha.   It’s going good! She’s still learning, but she’s definitely doing more and more each day! We’ve been really proud of her for sure. :)
I only speak the truth 💖
when’s your bday? i get capricorn vibes from you. But maybe you have a Capricorn stellium in your chart.
Oh, boo to red glasses then! They just look so cool in the pictures online!
Oooh look at you go, being all productive!! I know that feels good! Thanks so much for the bday wishes for my mom!!! That’s sweet of you. She did have a good day. I’m going to try to get some decluttering done today. Wish me good luck. Lol. I hope you’re having a wonderful day
🤣🤣🤣  Momma's still got it ✨💖
Refund would be good but I think an exchange is better. Dont want to be left with none.
Well thank you!!
Hahah. Well I’m glad! Use it and go smile at all the people! Make some other people’s day with them cuties.
Aight, you've convinced me, I definitely gotta come up to Calais. Near London AND Brussels AND you guys have a freakin dragon?! That's sweet man.
You’re quite talented! It’s so cool that you were able to make your own scarf and hat!
Lol yeah I don't like the upkeep 😅 Haha that is smart!
You're welcome 🙂
I just calls em how I sees em ☺️
Not that I've found. Most I've seen seen to be customised from womens.
Not to overdo it but you just look amazing.
How do you go about detangling? Even using a wig brush usually tears mine up and washing like the instructions usually never works and just makes it even worse 😂
This time we have way too many people claiming they don't need a mask because of an illness like asthma or others where wearing a mask may make it difficult but its still safer than not.  Home schooling though?! I could do without that lol.
I've always found her fascinating and beautiful
I'm definitely greyer now than I was this time last year.
Oh, nice! I bet that will look super cute 💖
I'm glad to hear that and I hope your day keeps going swell! c:
Lol I feel like I could do a decent job based only in the amount of brad mondo reacts videos I’ve seen but I’m still too scared. Haha.   Dawww. That’s good to hear. c:
It’s June 8th 1995!!
Wishing you so much luck with the decluttering. I hope it goes well for you! 💕 I hope you’re having a wonderful day, too!
And mama has zero interest in men (or women) so it was doubly upsetting to her. He was super cute too. Kinda wish he’d been calling her wizard eyes instead.
Yes. Being without sight would be a very hard time.
Thank you! I love crochet, it’s so relaxing! One time I lost my hat on the bus so I just made another
I usually cut nobles, so they don’t drop a crap ton of needles. And only water it ever other day. But it sucks leg hairs all the same....
hmmmm. well if there’s a tangle that my brush can’t get, i use my fingers to split the knot apart myself.  i also have seen steamers used on wigs and they snap them back to normal! it’s such a learning curve! haha.
It’s the worst!! My kids just went back to school after a looong hiatus. Online schooling is so stressful for the parent and I really did not enjoy it at all.
Lords yes. Saaaaame
Thankssss🥰🥰🥰. Hope your day is swell too
orrrrrrrr you have my husband’s birthday. lmao. i knew you had familiar energy.
Hey sweetheart. I ended up taking a much needed nap. Oh well haha. Productive in its own way, I suppose. Stay safe this week.
If she has your eyes, it's only a matter of time before she gets one who loses himself in their depths 💙
Interesting! I'll give it a try! Thank you!
Well kids here we off from March to about June and my kid went for the 1 week then they were off again for summer holidays.  Back in September in little class bubbles until Christmas break.  Now off again.
People tell me I act like a Gemini but sometimes not! Whatever that means I need to know everything lol [this is my chart](https://www.costarastrology.com/natal-chart/5117323)
She has blue eyes but they’re darker. This guy was going on and on about mine being almost white. It made me wish I could see them like he did, not like someone who thinks they’re just plain eyes.
It’s so stressful! How do you cope with them doing online school at home?
i see you have a lot of earth with virgo, and 2 in Capricorn. your chart seems really balanced. i’m certainly not an expert, but having libra and gemini (both air signs) and then having those earth signs - it’s balances out.   meanwhile, i have capricorn sun and capricorn moon and about 6 other planets in capricorn. It reallllly sucks because i’m NOT the type to ever take a risk, and i’m always hesitant about change. but i’ve gravitated towards air/fire signs who break me out of my shell and help me live a little lol.
I only have the one and I've learned that teachers are very underpaid.
You are much more of an expert than me! And change is scary! I can really be into change one day and then get really scared another!
This is so very true.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kzd51e/contest_name_my_new_betta_fish/
I recently adopted a betta and need to find a name, but I'm lost and clueless at naming.so for the contest I want you to suggest a name for him!-masculine/androgynous/feminine names ok  contest ends in 1 week.  Rules:  \-US only please!  \-have something on your list 10$ or under  \-1 winner only-DBAD\~  and here's the betta in question!  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/apertaqk3yb61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31e5e667eea3b81329ce6acbb83b8e980f90da3a
Swim Shady  *^(hotter than a set of twin babies)*
Harold! Thank you for the contest! Happy fish parenting!
Eli
Not entering, but I love bettas SO MUCH. I miss mine every day, his name was Winston. He was a purple veil type. Yours kinda looks like a Clarence to me.
Angelus III, Esquire
Cute!  Sheer Khan!  The tiger from The Jungle Book
Your betta is so pretty!  Here are my suggestions:  - Koi  - Tigress/Tiger (It looks like a tiger!)  - Dakota! I named my old betta fish Dakota! I think it’s a very pretty name.  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
Naw cute fishy fishy!   I showed my kids and they said "shark bait" from finding Nemo lol  Thanks for the contest
Amber
Okay first of all!! Gorgeous fish! I love Peaches but honestly a fish that gorgeous can pull off any name!
Pepperoni!! Just cause I like the way it sounds 😊
Aww that coloring is awesome! I miss my bettas. I think Pontus would be a cool name. Primordial God of the sea in greek mythology.
I would go with Fire Opal!   Cause he's a gem ^((I'll see myself out))
Nebula or Cosmo  All the pretty colors remind me of space, such a beautiful fishy 😍
Jimmy   Also he’s very pretty
Salami! Sal for short
What a lovely Betta! The coloring makes me think of a tiger, so perhaps a famous tiger name? Hobbes is a good one (and if you get a second it could be Calvin!) Of course, black and orange are also Halloween colors, so maybe Jack (for Jack-o-Lantern) or Spook!  Edit: Or if you're feeling punny, why not "Late" - because "Betta late than never!"
Adorable! I would go for Cheeto or BB-8 if you're a Star Wars fan.  Thank you for hosting this contest <3
Love the coloring of your new friend! How about Sir Neapolitan Dreamscicle the third. Neapolitan or Neo for short  Or my husband’s suggestion: Sticks. He is a fish after all 😁
Bowie or Ziggy!! His coloring reminds me of David Bowie and his beautiful head of hair!
Reginald. 😬
What a handsome betta. He looks like a Blaze or Flame to me. Or maybe Koi.
L U C I F E R
Tora! It’s tiger in Japanese. Such a pretty fishie
Michael... I feel like he needs a human name.
He looks like he has tiger coloring and/or cheetah spots, so what about Chester (like the Cheetos Cheetah) or Tony (like the Frosted Flakes tiger)? 🙂
Hey friend! I saw your intro post for a little while ago and noticed you said you’re a fan of Monster Hunter, seeing that I am as well, I think a name from the show would be cool and Ive decided my suggestion for your betta to be Jyuratodus. Obviously a water monster would make sense but, not only being a personal favorite, who wouldn’t want a their betta named after such a bada**? Awesome contest idea BTW!
He looks like a Hieronymous to me
Cute fish!! I have a three year old betta, his name is Gorlami. That’s in reference to the film Inglourious Basterds. So how about another Tarantino movie name! You can call him O-Ren Ishii. Or if you like puns, O-Ren Fishy!
So pretty! I say you name him Phoenix
Alpha Betta😄
Ginger.  Thanks for hosting a contest.
Beta like in Finding Nemo lol
Something elemental like: jade, mica, quartz. Or a plants like ash, thyme, elm. Or - weather like storm, cloud, mist, rain.
Cheater because it looks like cheetah spots.
I was thinking of getting one, do you have a suggestion for a tank?  Fred
I think Emery would be a perfect name for this little guy
How cute! You should name them Venus or Mars!
He looks like a felix to me!!
Mateo?
Tiger Lily!!
Steve
Hi!  My betta’s name is Ajax so I’m going to suggest Ajax!  It’s a great fish name.
El Niño fasho or if you prefer, La Niña. Lol thanks!
Murphy!
tangerine! 🍊
Frisky
Migi
Oscar just looks like an Oscar to me lol
Tigger!
Freckles, Bruce or Spaghetti. 😆
I like the name cashew 😊
Lala
Rocky
Timba :) thanks for the contest
Goldie
Fluffy!
He’s beautiful! I’ve been keeping a list of potential names for once I get my next betta. My favorite is Atticus Fish, lol
Dorian
I don't know why, but Rosie seems a fitting name.  I had bettas that bred when I was younger! I do not miss taking care of fish. But if I ever get a tank, it's gonna be a big tank!  [d&d themed wl (for easy mobile access & has cheaper items than generic)](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2B3HG94OUABAT?ref_=wl_share)
I think Jewel is a great name for a Betta!
Mino  (Pronounced mee-no)
Marble. It’s cute, and he looks marbled
Sashimi
Sobek, Hapi or Osiris!  All names related to Egyptian deities that have/had a relevance to water!
Chester like the Cheeto guy!
Goodness, I love koi bettas! He's handsome!  How about Soleil? Or Mango?  Also, are you on /r/bettasfish ?  Really good info on there and lots of great pictures!
I took one look at him and decided his name must be:  (The brave fencer) Musashi  🥰
Betty the Beta lol
hm... my gut instinct says tyr (pronounced like teer), like the norse god
what if you turn the tail and make your beta an alpha.. and name da cutie Alfie. X'D
Nuri or Kimba  but I feel like Kimba suits him better, it means brush fire   and Nuri means my fire in hebrew!   or you even Hades!   This was a really fun contest! I love coming up with names!
Betta buddies! I have a female crowntail named Laurens!  Fish is mighty adorable and I would name fishy Jeremiah, with the nickname of Miah. Why? I don't know. Just like it.
Looks like a Horace
Max. As in Betamax.
Pat, Patrick, Sushi, Chicken, Drake lol
Penelope, Quinn, Bartholomew
Calico, Patches, Cosmo, Spooky
Tiger/ tigger
Chip!
Looks like a Charles to me.
You could always name them Fawkes like the Phoenix in Harry Potter but that's just because I'm partial to Harry Potter lol  Otherwise, Andromeda, Callen, Hubert or Bangol come to mind...just because I like those names :)   Thanks for the contest friend!
I love the thought of Wanda because of the movie A Fish Called Wanda. 😂  Actually I love giving pets human names. I had a mouse named Howard Hughes once. I just love naming pets things like that. And then adding "little" to it so I called him "Little Howard Hughes".  Maybe name him after a famous person you like! He could be "Little Keanu Reeves" or something!
Nice
aw! veils are so cute ; o ;
That was my first thought, too!
Aww! My sister named her cat (RIP) Shark Bait, lol.
😈
yes! my 100% recommended suggestion is no less than 2 gallons. preferably 3 gallons and above. the tank i bought was 50$ and comes with filter and light and lid. its on amazon, marineland 5 gallon portrait its called
Petco will occasionally have a $1/gallon sale on tanks. That’s how I got a 10gal for my last betta. He thought he was hot stuff with all that space to himself! Also if you keep an eye on Facebook marketplace/Craigslist you might find a good cheap tank...that’s how I got my most recent 10gal for my next fishy.
Right?!
I love the name lol ever since finding Nemo I had a goldfish named Henrietta lol he lived got 7 years was really amazing.
I might just buy one of those, thanks
Heh, just found something on marketplace, thanks for the ideal.
I agree that a 3 gallon minimum is what you’ll want, but 5 gallon would be preferable. You can check out r/bettafish for more info!  Petco will occasionally have a $1/gallon sale on tanks.

Finding Nemo is such a cute movie. I can't wait until my kiddo is old enough to wanna watch animated movies- I'm gonna be having a whole list ready for her 😂
It's very fun my kids love anything Pixar, disney, dream works lol first movie I took my eldest too was frozen and she still likes it lol finding Nemo is my 7 year olds favourite.

Muhahahaha! Yes it is I, John. And it is time to enter the Woods (see what I did there). I will bend your mind as I distort reality and blur the lines of what is real and what is not. You are about to take one step beyond into the Twilight Zone.   As the activity states, you'll be described as a supernatural creature or being. Example, werewolf. I'll tell you about your life, how you became this way, and perhaps more! I may also link a picture of the creature/being if I can.  Just leave a comment saying something about yourself or something that happened to you recently.   Onwards and upwards my friends.
I became friends with the “scary” boss at work. He’s actually awesome!! Thanks for the awesome activity John!
Oh fun!! I recently had a nail in my tire.
Let’s see....something about me...I’m stubborn and emotional 😂
John !!! Back again with these awesome activities. Do me!
Oh, boy. Let's hear it, John!  Edit: Here's something that happened to me recently. I got to clean the house. That was kinda fun.
John, these things are the best. You are the best!  I went for a run this morning for the first time in a reeallllyy long time, and definitely felt like my lungs were gonna freeze up.
Yay, I love these! Hmmm... what's something that's happened to me recently...  I dyed my hair pink yesterday!
Oh this sounds fun.   Today I tried to lure some blue jays over from the trees across the street. Tossed some peanuts on the driveway and waited. Went in, came back out, they were gone. Tossed a few more out, went inside, came back out and they were gone. So I picked up my bag of peanuts (standing in the garage with the door open) and before I could get my hand out there were 3 blue jays sitting on the pavement 3 feet away waiting like children who’ve been called to get a popsicle. I’ve made new friends here and now I’m stupid excited.
Ooo! I live in Hawaii for school and my partner just moved here so we are doing a bunch of touristy things since he has never been here before. Yesterday we went to the Dole pineapple plantation. It was a fun day trip and I got to eat some dole whip. It was pretty good even though I don't particularly like pineapple.
Me! Me, John!
Omg you are so fun. I'm a boring mother of two that loves to crochet and works retail and goes to school for nursing. 😁
oh this sounds like fun~! 🌸 hmm.. accidentally spilled some cereal earlier today and slipped on it while cleaning it up somehow.. clumsy..
I'm a social studies teacher currently snuggled up with my cat while my husband is in the other room snuggles up with his cat.
This sounds like a lot of fun, and I *love* creative writing like this haha.  Recently my friend and I have been looking at fairy outfits to wear to my sister’s Renaissance/Fantasy themed wedding later this year, so maybe you can use that for something ;)
I dyed my hair today in our basement while my bf's dad was down there too walking on his treadmill listening to polka music! LOL Funny but true!
I had a dream that I was wolverine
I had a dream where I yelled at one of the customers at work 🤣
Uhhh I googled yesterday if you can keep a fox as a pet in Germany with the full knowledge that I don't have a garden/enough outdoor space and also own 2 cats   But you can dream right
That's amazing!!  You my friend are Homonculi! You are believed to be a creation of alchemy gone wrong. Perhaps someone was attempting to create a human and instead... They created something far more dangerous. Yet, all you want is cuddles and to be loved. Only if people got to know you.  [pic](https://images.app.goo.gl/9i8nU8S5Pr45hEDX8)
Oh jheez, that doesn't sound good.  You are a Mazzikin. In Jewish mythology, Mazzikin are invisible demons which can create minor annoyances or greater dangers. While this may sound dangerous, perhaps all you desire is to have someone loyal, understanding and empathetic. You often want to express yourself but can't find the perfect words to say. Maybe this invisibility is really a call for understanding.  This is what you'd look like [pic](https://images.app.goo.gl/t4DAvsvUmKNems439)
You are a ChonChon.  The Chonchon is a mythical bird of the Mapuche mythology (and later also present in the Chilean folk myth and in southern Argentina) that announces misfortune. The Chonchon has the shape of a human head with feathers and talons. Its ears, which are extremely large, serve as wings for its flight on moonless nights.  [Pic](https://images.app.goo.gl/YK4W4UEzGhpWFLgo8)
Awww thank you!  You are a Gremlin! A Gremlin is a mythological creature similiar to a fairy or goblin which had their origins during the World Wars, in which they were said to cause havoc on aircraft - a trait which they have been continually given since their creation, though in time their destructive nature has come to include almost any type of technology.  You turned into a Gremlin after you ate one too many tainted pieces of chocolate. You decided to wash it down with some delicious iced tea but turns out it was just acid. This dangerous combination turned you into a Gremlin!   [Pic](https://images.app.goo.gl/Fy4VrMRY5eMevWsu8)
Sounds like an interesting day! You my friend are a... Kitsune! These are foxes that can shape shift into humans. Stories depict legendary foxes as intelligent beings and as possessing paranormal abilities that increase as they get older and wiser.  You were raised as a kitsune after being abandoned by your human family as a baby. They all gave you a bit of their magic until you were able to shape shift into a fox on your own. You are the young queen of the kitsune people and are trying to lead them in the right direction. You have battles with werewolves and vampires who want to invade your territory. As well as humans who try to eradicate your entire race.   [Pic](https://images.app.goo.gl/4rLdUoq7Y7WnLtBSA)
Thank you so much! And ahhh I know how you feel. Being indoors for this long has certainly affected our athletic ability.   &#x200B;  You are a Wendigo! In the north woods of Minnesota, the forests of the Great Lake Region, and the central regions of Canada is said to live a malevolent being called a wendigo (also spelled windigo). This creature may appear as a monster with some characteristics of a human, or as a spirit who has possessed a human being and made them become monstrous. It is historically associated with cannibalism, murder, insatiable greed, and the cultural taboos against such behaviors.   [Pic](https://www.legendsofamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Wendigo1.jpg)
Ooooooo! Sounds adventurous! Better update your cute lil avatar :)   You my friend are an Aswang! Aswang is an umbrella term for various shape-shifting evil spirits in Filipino folklore, such as vampires, ghouls, witches, viscera suckers, and werebeasts. The Aswang is the subject of a wide variety of myths, stories, arts, and films, as it is well-known throughout the Philippines.   In your case, you are a werepigeon! You were working at a local office paper supplier when you were on top of the roof eating your lunch. Suddenly, a bunch of pigeons attacked you! They wanted your food! You fell over the edge while the pigeons were attacking you and you fell on top of electric wires. After that you fell down into a gigantic manhole that was being used to store nuclear waste. Yeah... your life hasn't been easy. One of the pigeons fell with you and suddenly you began to feel strange. You had the sudden urge to peck people and poop on New Yorkers! You flew out of the manhole having been reborn! You now fly across New York rooftops on the days and nights when a full moon appears!   [Pic](https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/a8ogKbe_460s.jpg)
AWWWWWWWWW Omg that is so incredibly cute and I'm so so so happy for you! Your new bird friends will love and cherish you forever :)  You are a Leanan sídhe! The leannán sídhe (fairy lover) is depicted as a beautiful woman of the Aos Sí ("people of the barrows") who takes a human lover. Lovers of the leannán sídhe are said to live brief, though highly inspired, lives. The name comes from the Gaelic words for a sweetheart, lover, or concubine and the term for inhabitants of fairy mounds (fairy).   [Pic](https://www.generatormix.com/images/creature/leanan-sidhe.jpg)
You my friend are a reptilian humanoid!!!  Reptilians are among us. Blood-drinking, flesh-eating, shape-shifting extraterrestrial reptilian humanoids with only one objective in their cold-blooded little heads: to enslave the human race!  You are posing as a human and infiltrating this subreddit to figure out why us humans like to be kind! We're onto you :0  [pic](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/unCYsw7p__QedeBxffn3P3m5yok=/0x220:3024x1795/960x500/https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/old_wire/img/upload/2013/11/05/AP844034666622/original.jpg)
You are... a Wood nymph! A wood nymph or dryad is a tree nymph or tree spirit in Greek mythology. Drys signifies "oak" in Greek, and dryads are specifically the nymphs of oak trees, but the term has come to be used for tree nymphs in general, or human-tree hybrids in fantasy. They were normally considered to be very shy creatures except around the goddess Artemis, who was known to be a friend to most nymphs.

You my friend are a... Centaur! A Centaur is a magical creature whose head, torso, and arms appear to be human and are joined to a horse's body. They are, however, their own individual species, and thus are not half-breeds. They also have a rich history and are known for being naturally talented in Healing magic, Divination and Astronomy.  You are territorial and will protect your home and the ones you love!  [pic](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/f/f4/Centaur_Pottermore.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/259?cb=20120510141530)
You my friend are a mermaid! Yes indeed... You are a creature that appears to guide sailors but perhaps you are more of a siren as you attempt to drag their ships down and punish them for being in your territory!
John hits the nail on the head again! You’re magic John!
It wasn't awful. I luckily have tires covered under insurance.   Also, that sounds like me honestly.
I’m terrifying 😂
A gremlin 😭😭 well you chose the cutest picture ever . Also what a funny way to turn into a creature . Youre so funny and cute !!!
Well. At least I can answer the question, "What does the fox say?" now.
Duuudee. Wendigo are so metal. I am down for that!!
Being attacked by pigeons is a literal fear of mine and that bird man will stalk my nightmares 🤣🤣🤣
That’s neat. Guess I’d better get busy finding a human lover 😂
I always suspected I might be ;)
Yo I'm all about that centaur life!
heheh how amazing, thank you!! 🌸
Haha, thank you! I'm glad you enjoyed it :)
I'm glad they were covered under insurance.  And I'm glad what I said was accurate :)
😂 😂 😂 Hmm more like an adorable little threat
Awww, your comment really made me smile! And pftttt tell me you're not as cute as that gremlin! All cuddly and able to be squished
LOOOOOOOL This was so bad yet so good. I love it!
Awesome!!!
LMAOOOOO couldn't have been a better pick for you clearly xD
Haha, well I'm sure there's a list of humans who would love to be loved by you!
Thanks! And yeah it was scary accurate!
pffhshs adorable 🥰🥰
Clearly 😂😂😂
No. No there aren’t 😂 And if there are they’ve been playing a great game of hide and seek for 18 years.
Haha, well I just have a way of understanding people. I understand a few things about you that most people might not notice.
Hmm, I feel like you don't give yourself enough credit.   You're cool, fun to talk to, a forest witchy person lol, interesting and a little mysterious. Most of all, you're compassionate and empathetic. I've never really spoken to you and yet I've noticed a lot of those things in the way you carry yourself around this sub. You are genuinely someone that people like. Anyone would be happy to have you in their life as a friend or a significant other :) I honestly mean that.
Maybe they haven't been playing hide and seek. Maybe you've been looking in all the wrong places thinking that they were hiding, when in fact they just want to play a game of twister with you :P
People who are able to understand people like that have always fascinated me.
It’s really because I haven’t been looking, and my idea of flirting is seeing a cool person and avoiding eye contact.
Well, if you'd like to message me, maybe you'll find out some more :)
Awwwww. Hmm well some people will definitely notice that.

u/hungupon I thoroughly enjoyed your writing quest, and I love these stickers!! They're the perfect size for my planner and I'm already using them :D
I love it!!
waoh pretty! 🌸
Oh my gosh I love these. Maybe having aggressive stickers for my planner would motivate me to do things I don't want to do lol
Oh my gooooood those stickers! I try to be kinder to myself but those are hilarious!   (And hell yeah, f\*ck trump)
Yay so glad!!! :D

We're making Scones soon. Not to brag but it's a team effort. Just like Shrimp tacos and Ceiling fans. What's a team sport in your house? Will pick 2 Winners, based on chuckles and randomness. Ends 1-18-21 7:00pm EST. Sorry US only and have gifted before.
Folding a fitted sheet
Ohh I made some beautiful lavender and lemon scones a while back. 💛 team effort in my home would be making tamales it’s a lot of work but so much fun to do it together. Thanks for the contest. 💛
A team effort in my home is making tamales! My husband and I recently started the tradition for Christmas and it takes both of us.  Another true but funny team effort is bathing our cat! We adopted him from a shelter and he’d been a homeless street kitty so we decided that one bath would be a good idea. Holy moly, it took all of my husband’s strength and me washing him as fast as I could to get it done without being torn to ribbons lol! I’m so glad we won’t have to bathe him again!
Making tamales 🫔 in a team effort we have stations for things which is fun
WE TALKING BOUT CEILING FANS?? I KNOW THE MOST AMAZING, MOST HUMBLE, GREATEST CELING FAN THERE EVER WAS!! ITS MEEEEEEEEE  Hah enough with the Allen Iversen/Yukon Cornelius combo.... My wife and I just cut our dogs nails and gave them both baths! Definitely a team sport as one has to hold a dog down while the other cuts the nails! It’s always a hassle but it is fun:)
Appeasing the cat overload.
1. Worming cats: One holds and wrangles, the other gets the pill down.   2. Mealtime: I cook, he eats.   3. Groceries: I buy them, he carries them in, I wipe them down and wash fresh produce, he puts them away.   4. Toilet paper: he uses the last piece and gets out a new roll. I actually put it on.   5. Communication: I talk. He listens.
The biggest team sport in our house is cleaning followed by taking care of the dogs!
Everything is a team sport in this house, but sometimes we switch roles. One of us ignores something for so long that the other becomes passive-aggressive or annoyed and winds up doing it themselves. It's a great system, really.
Yum, scones! 😋   A team sport in our house is wrangling our daughter for bath time. Now that she’s walking (and running lol), as soon as we take her diaper off to put her in the tub, she runs away. And she has on more than one occasion peed on the floor while running around without her diaper. It’s like she immediately knows she’s not wearing it and can make a mess. Giving her the actual bath is easy, it’s the before and after when getting her dressed that’s hard. 😂
Our team sport is panic cleaning whenever the boyfriend's parents inform us they're coming to visit for a few days 👀   Also giving our pitbull a bath. He **hates** baths.
My family loves dumplings so we team up on making them 😜 my role is eating of course
I love scones! Meal prep is definitely a team sport in my house.  I do the cooking, he does the dishes as I go, and we portion out the food together 💖  Also cleaning the bathroom. He cleans the toilet and sink, and I clean the tub/shower and the floor.
A team effort in my house... is vacuuming the floor...  We have two itty bitty bitey dogs who REALLY enjoy attacking the vacuum cleaner! Our old vacuum cleaner had to be retired early because one of them got ahold of the hose too many times and dirt would just spew out of it lol! So now, vacuuming in my house consists of one person vacuuming and the other person holding two barking pups lol
A team sport at my house is def painting the house. First part is deciding the right color and the right *shade* of the color. Takes about 30 min of deliberating. Tape the edges, and apply plastic paper on the floor takes all of us. Tall people get the ceiling and upper side of the wall, short people get the lower side of the wall and help the tall people. We have to keep each other in check for the slackers. Someone is also in charge of food and music. It's nice fam bonding moment where we roast each other too  Thanks for hosting! Good luck making your scones
Oo our team sport is 1,000% chasing the neighbor's dog off our lawn. Me, my husband, our dogs, the neighbors kids, the neighbors' kids' cousin, everyone is involved at this point. It's quite the comical scene. 8 people chasing a tiny white dog as it frolics through my newly planted flowers.
First off lol what type of scone? I love cheese ones!!!  Our team sport is when we got to the rest room and there's no toilet paper. Simply yell out to one of the 4 kids in the house and they promptly go to the cupboard to get you some.   Also it's a team sport to get things off the top shelf. Simply lift the non heavy 6 year old up and he can reach the top shelf items with is long arms.   I dunno if these count haha but I feel it's a team sport >_<
Making the best wings! always a competition to who can make the best flavor and perfectly cooked wings !
Ooh what KIND of scones? I really love these cheese and onions ones I've made in the past they are REALLY good.  The only team sport that's in my house is football b/c we live in WI and the Packers are kind of a big deal, lol. I'm not into it but my husband is :)   Fave fun with your scones! Thank you for the contest and share scone pics!
Our team efforts include getting either cat into the carrier for a visit to the vet, going for walks, solving Wheel of Fortune puzzles (also a competition), and grocery shopping (pre-Covid). Now online grocery shopping is a team effort. LOL My mom adds to the cart from her laptop, I add from my PC, and on occasion, my dad needs me to add items for him (my parents are divorced). Then we nitpick each other for what the other one added. One of us picks up curbside and then I wash down packages with soapy paper towels in the mudroom (no heat), hand them to my mom who wipes them dry, and leaves everything on the counter. It takes both of us to put groceries away, too. Tada!
ooh what kind of scones?  &#x200B;  Cleaning the fridge is definitely a team sport. It's a relatively small fridge for the number of people we have in our house! Yesterday I found a tupperware of breakfast eggs and potatoes that I made exactly a week ago and then promptly lost in the abyss. Luckily I found them just in time and had them for breakfast today. I am still missing a couple packages of tempeh, I think one of my teammates was overly enthusiastic last time we cleaned the fridge and threw them out 😅 which like, props for cleaning, but I was going to eat that!
The best team sport in my house was bathing my dog! My dog HATED baths. He somehow always knew when it was bath time and refused to get picked up when we wanted to take him to the tub. When we would finally escort him to his inevitable demise, he would frantically make attempts to escape the tub. When he would bath, he would refuse to move and shake all the water off him making the bathroom a mess and getting water all over the mirrors. When he finally got out of the tub, he would do the same thing - shake all over you and every mirror in sight. Then, he would SPRINT out of the bathroom and onto EVERY SINGLE RUG in the house. He would rub his hair against the rugs to get dry and sprint from rug to rug. It was another scramble to catch him so that he could brush his hair. THEN, when you finally started to brush his hair, he would constantly try to escape! And whenever his hair would start to look nice, he would shake and ruin it all. That dog was such a handful! 😂  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
Hahaha making stuffed shells was a team sport in our house on Thursday. I held the shells open and my husband squeezed in the cheese mixture
Everything is better as a team 💋
Our team sport is making wontons/dumplings.
Biggest Team Effort is getting my dog Thor out the front door and past my porch cat Kitty, see Kitty it a dog lover but Thor is not a cat lover yet lol so its always an adventure, Kitty will follow at a distance every time he goes out lol I'm confident one day they will be friends :)
In my house, finding where the dog poo-ed is a team sport.  If she keeps around with guilty eyes, we know the hunt is on!
We like cooperative board games, and identify this mess :)
Scones are awesome!   Our team sport is the Saturday full house clean. We all have our responsibilities to take care of, and we function very effectively!
Scones are hard to make!  Awesome payout for the effort though. ❤️  We do games as a team but it is out cattery that makes us a real bonding pair. Plus, a spiky ouchy hedgehog!  Many bellies to feed, clean up after, and snuggle (best part) except the hedgie - he’s not a snuggler - LOL
I love making scones! My favorite to make is lemon blueberry.  A team sport in our house is chores because one of us does the task and the other entertains the baby
Th e biggest team sport in my house is cleaning.  I hate it and misery loves company!  Thanks for the contest!
our biggest team sport is mopping up the whole house! 🌸
Care of our son.  I miss being there.  But right now, just working so we can save up money so my husband can do creative things and we can have a life together.
Team sport is making stew.  He does the things I have a hard time doing now like peeling the potatoes I do some of the prep. He stirs. It’s freat
The biggest team effort for us is washing and drying my dog. Getting him clean is not the worst, but drying him off is a feat. He's a runner and it's a team effort to wrap him in a towel, hold him and use the blow-dryer.
A team sport in my house is making the bed, and also making fried chicken or mozzarella sticks
Mopping we have two male dogs so it's done everyday
Biggest team effort is doing laundry. We wait so long to do it. We also have to take it all to a laundry-mat. It takes up almost a entire day having to do it.
Yum! Scones are delicious!   Bathing my 2 medium sized dogs is a team sport! It is difficult and messy work! My husband bathes them and then I clean the wet and furry bathroom.
The boyfriend's half of chores 😂  Literally just told bf several times today to sweep but he's very easily distracted. Finally started doing it myself but then he took the broom from me, swept for 10 seconds and got distracted again. I came back into the kitchen and there was a pile of dirt I swept up and threw away lmao
Omg I loooooooooove scones!! I haven't had one in forever! Enjoy!  Disclaimer: don't read the following while you're eating... 😆  The biggest team sport in my household is squeezing our dog's anal glands. 🤮 She is incapable of expressing them herself like most dogs, so we've had to do it for her once a week for the past 4 years or so. Our regular routine is he brings her into the bathroom, I'll express her (he can't stomach it) while he keeps her calm and distracted, and then he'll bathe her while I go vomit. 😂 Prior to Covid, my husband would regularly go on business trips for several weeks at a time, and it was the absolute most difficult thing in the world to do it by myself.  Thank you for the contest!
Since having a son, being a team has become even more important for my wife and I. Some of the team sports for us with our 3-year-old son:  - Getting dressed and ready to leave the house - Brushing teeth at bedtime  - Giving each other time to nap, especially as all 3 of hs are home all the time during COVID - Standing by each other's word and encouraging one another when we say something like "that's the very last cookie you can have" :)
Cleaning my dad's room always ends up turning into a team sport. He just flat our refuses to do it himself and I get too overwhelmed to do on my own (plus, with the way his room is, I would just start going through and throwing stuff away because he's pretty much a borderline hoarder).
Taking the small children to the pool or ocean... two of them are absolutely fearless (a mermaid 🧜‍♀️and a baby shark 🦈- it’s like wrestling alligators, i tell you) and the other is a landlubber. 👀🤣
Honestly anything that we can't reach. I'm 5'0 and my mother is 5'1, so it becomes one of us climbing onto the counter and passing the stuff down while the other spots and grabs. This only ever needs to happen when my 6'2 step father isn't home.
A team sport in my house is feeding our senior cat, Smokey. She’s constantly crying for food, but she can only eat a little bit of food at a time. We can’t leave food out because the other cat will eat it all. So, whenever she cries, we give her a little bit of food.
Yesterday, dying my hair blue became a team sport. I needed my husband's help to get blue goo off my face and to make sure I didn't miss any spots!
Last night, we experienced the extreme team sport of putting together a baby gate that swings open (for my mom's new puppy [Coco](https://imgur.com/gallery/8ECdwUM)) First, we had to find the directions (they were hidden in the Styrofoam). Then, we got our glasses because the print on the directions was practically microscopic! Next, we gathered the gate pieces and tried to figure out A from B from C. Then, we opened the bag of screws wrong and they went EVERYWHERE! We started putting it together with the screws, but we did the gate upside-down (oops!) Then, we un-did the screws and flipped it around. And we re-did the screws. We thought we were done... but then we had to get the plastic circle things screwed into the wall (whew that was a workout!) for the rubber stopper things to fit into to secure the gate. We finally had the gate in one piece, the plastic circles on the walls, the rubber stoppers on the sides of the gate... but the gate wouldn't fit in the space in the hallway!!    Moral of the story: Measure everything!      Also, we finally re-did the plastic circles on the walls and the gate now fits and is functional! Whoohoo!!
A team effort at our house is deep frying food. It starts with Mr Lover wanting fish for dinner and that translate into me seeing that we have all the mess out, what else can we deep fry?! Pickles, cauliflower, bananas. \\ (•◡•) /
Yesssss
Um can you send me some? Lol hahaha
Mood!  We have 6 inside and just as many outside.  It takes us both to keep bellies fed!  😻
It’s great you two work together to wrangle the little girl! 🙌🥰  Just gonna put this out there... take the diaper iff and sit her on the potty! Then chase her around if you must 😉 She’s not too young, and her going as soon as the diaper is off may be a sign that she is ready to start potty training. I missed that boat with my kid and we are now struggling with the potty training. I don’t know it all, but if i can help a friend avoid a (potential) mistake i made, then i totally will. 😉 good luck!!! ☺️
Blueberry and lemon.
Blueberry and lemon
Look into a UV flashlight. Also good for finding glow in the dark rocks.
:)
I am too tired and read this as "Since shaving a son" I had to read this over a few times!
☺️
Ahhh thank you for the advice! I’ve actually had someone else mention that to me too! Might be time to get a potty. 😳 She’s growing so fast!!! 😭❤️
yum!!
Good idea!
Hahaha oh boy, that would be a very different type of team sport, one I don't want to play.
Anytime, my friend! ☺️ they really grow way too fast... gotta keep up 😉🤣😭💜

My favorite holiday is Halloween. What I enjoy about nature are animals. I love animals especially ones with fur. Thank you for the warm welcome!
My favorite puppet was Sam-E. He was a robot puppet made out of recyclables and other items I could find. I thought he was the most complicated puppet I made. His mouth and eyes moved. He could also put his eyes back into his head. Part of the fun of puppet making is visualizing and problem solving. I like going from concept sketch to the finished product and seeing how close I got.
Hello! Cookie dough ice cream
Hi there!
Thank you!
I like to draw, make puppets, and play video games.
Not read but listened to the Illusion of Money by Kyle Cease
I am a freelance artist. I draw caricatures and cartoons. I'm living in Los Angeles
Deadpool
Wow, that's super cool! I was in a musical in high school and we made paper mache animal puppets and they were sooo hard to make so I can't even imagine doing something super complicated like that!
How are you doing?
ooo fantastic hobbies!! What are some of your favorite video games?? What kind of puppets as well??
I’ve never listened to an audio book! I’d like to one day but I’m a bit of a fidget. Hope you’re enjoying the community:)
That’s cool! I’m for Orange County but live on the east coast now. My family is all in the valley though
I want to make Jim Henson, Avenue Q, or Sesame Street kind of puppets. It can be. I just watched a video where Adam Savage visits the studio behind Avenue Q in New Jersey. He goes through the process of making one puppet. They have three guys working on one puppet (four if you include Adam Savage.) They made I don't know how many puppets for Avenue Q but it was a lot.
I'm doing ok. How are you?
My favorite games are StarTropics, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, and Doom 2. I make sock, rod puppets, and ones made out of recyclables.
Wow, that is impressive!
Doing well! Watching 17 Again.
I havent gotten around to playing Doom 2 yet but I really enjoyed Doom 1! I havent played the others actually! The puppets sound cool! You said you like drawing as well, do you have anything in particular that you like to draw?
I like Doom 2 because of the variety of enemies and the double barrel shotgun. I beat Doom 1 on Hurt Me Plenty (Medium) difficulty.   I like to draw caricatures and political cartoons mainly.

I love to read, and I love to encourage others to read, too, so I'm doing a book-themed contest! I want to hear about the BEST and WORST books you've ever read! This is my first attempt at a contest, so I hope I get this right :)  Rules:  1. Describe either the BEST or WORST book you've ever read (for worst books, it's okay if you didn't manage to finish it, so long as you read enough to explain!) 2. Tell me what the story was about, and what made it your "best" or "worst" 3. Have at least one book on your wishlist for $10 or less 4. Monday evening I will pick one "best" and one "worst" (not the same person) to gift with a book from your wishlist  **Edit:**  Winners chosen! Sadly, a few of the people whose "reviews" best caught my eye did not have any books under $10 on their wishlists,  but I did find some who met all the rules!  For best book, u/huntfishcamp ! Your description of Kushiel's Dart is intriguing, and you did a good job conveying what you enjoyed about it!  For worst book, u/sleepy_pickle! Your rant about Sundays at Tiffany's made me smile - I almost want to read the book just to laugh at how bad it is!
The best books I ever read are the Hunger Games series. I like the dystopian theme and having a cool main female character. It was something different, when it first came out. Katniss showed bravery and went against the damsel in distress trope we often see in media.
The WORST book I have ever read was Sundays at Tiffany's. Such a stupid book. It's about this little girl who has an imaginary man friend because she was lonely as a kid. She grows up and forgets all about this imaginary man. Well, this woman now is going about her stressful life when the powers that be told imaginary man that he was going to be made real and he needed to watch over her again. First, who are these powerful beings that can change imaginary friends into real actual adults??? And how did he just become real??? No answers! So the story continues. The man starts hanging out with the lady and whadyaknow? They fall in love. BUT WAIT! Is that even allowed for imaginary real man friend to fall in love with a human? I have no idea how it ended. I threw it in the trash. I lost brain cells trying to wrap my head around everything and it just didn't make sense. Some weirdo thought it made sense enough to make a Lifetime Christmas movie out of it even though the book had nothing about Christmas in it. My brain comes back to question it every now and then. Now that he's real, what is he going to do? He doesn't have a SS card or a birth certificate and so he can't work or apply for a mortgage. He has no family, he didn't come from a mom and dad. Will he be able to even have children??? IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!!!  Alright, I need to stop thinking about this book. I'm all worked up now!  (I have a book wishlist)
Best book was The Girl on the train- had my captivated quickly. The worst book ... don’t think I have ever read a bad one. Every book gets me in some way.  Sorry
Ok, so throughout the years for school and such, I've read John Steinbeck books. I've always found them to be miserably depressing. One day I decided to give him another shot, after finding Travels With Charley in my local library. This one - for those who don't know - is a non-fiction work of his. And is was so, SO refreshing and lighthearted in the way he captured his trip across America with his dog, Charley. It was so absolutely lovely! At the time of his writing, there were troubles he witnessed regarding segregation, and a few other regional 'personalities' whom he wrote so vividly. I was utterly impressed. It really resolutely with me, and I count it among my favourite books.  A year later, after reading on so many "best of" lists that East of Eden was incredible. It's a giant book - but I was determined! Travels with Charley had renewed my faith in Steinbeck. Well, I got probably 400+pages in before I was absolutely FED UP with the miserable, despicable, horrible characters that fill that awful book! I don't care how many people say that it was the best book they've ever read, I REFUSE to continue dragging myself through that WRETCHED novel.  ...so... I guess it's just the one of his that I adore. LOL.
The WORST book I ever read was Ethan Frome. I was taking AP English in high school and was given a group book report assignment. I was lucky to be taking the class with a small group of friends and we decided to do the report together. We picked the book at random from the list of classic books to choose from and by the time we realized how big of a mistake that was it was too late. Only one of us actually finished the book (gaining serious respect from all of us lol) and we ended up watching the movie together after school. The movie was just as awful but thankfully was much shorter than the book.  We decided to do a puppet show for our book report which I will describe in a second after explaining the book.  Ethan Frome is a drawn out tale of a man (Ethan) cheating on his sick wife. His wife hires a young woman to help around the house while she's sick and Ethan immediately becomes obsessed with this girl. Of course the girl immediately falls in love with him too. The whole book acts like Ethan's this huge victim because his wife is boring and nags. Its not convincing and basically all of the characters freaking suck and are never developed. Ethan and the girl kiss once and then of course that means they're meant for each other. Ethan's wife decides to fire her because she's a bad housekeeper and is flirting with her husband. They get super sad about this and want to run away together but they don't have money for that. So they decide that they should kill themselves...by sledding into a tree. This does not kill them but it breaks both of Ethan's legs and he spends the rest of his life crippled. The end.   So the puppet show. We made a little display of a snowy hill with a tree at the bottom. We had a sled and drawings of two people glued to popsicle sticks. We put the display on a desk and knelt under it and held up our little "puppets." At some point one of my friends hit her head on the bottom of the desk and almost knocked over the whole display. We basically had them say "Mattie, I love you so much!" "I love you too!" "But we can't be together." "This is so sad, we should die" "I know, let's sled into that tree." The entire time we were smothering giggles because we were a group of all girls and one of my friends was trying to do a manly voice and it was awful. Then we put them in the sled and moved the sled down the hill and when it would have hit the tree I yelled "poof!" And threw a bunch of fake snow (glittery white stuff people put in their Christmas villages) through the display. Then we snapped the popsicle sticks and held up the broken puppets and just had them screaming. Then we couldn't hold our giggles anymore and basically all collapsed on the floor laughing.   The teacher always tried to say something positive after people presented so I'm pretty sure he said something about how "3D" our puppet show was. I think he was a bit horrified of all the fake snow (which also ended up in our hair and basically everywhere) but long story short we got an A.   Anyway...yeah Ethan Frome is the worst book I've ever read but it did end up being on of the most fun projects I did in high school. 😅
BEST (for me at least) would be Life of Pi, about the son of a zoo owner in India. He gets interested in religion and ends up practicing three very different religions at once. Some stuff happens and he ends up on a raft in the middle of the ocean with a tiger. I’m in the zoo field and loved the take the author took regarding zoos and have even used quotes of the book in speeches I’ve given in defense of zoos. I of course love animals and they played a key role. While I’m not religious, I loved the idea of practicing multiple religions. I liked learning about different religions, it was intriguing and I loved the way the protagonist felt about God and how he chose to worship Him in a unique more freeing way. And then the end was just too perfect.  WORST On the Road by Jack Kerouac about being a vagabond, part of the Beat Generation, in the late 1940s. Doing drugs (so many drugs), driving cross country anywhere you want to go, staying with friends, listening to jazz. Nothing else happens. It’s just a bunch of that. I would love to live a life on the road, and while I found a bunch of quotes I liked, there was no plot whatsoever not even like a tiny one if you tried hard enough. I did not enjoy the book at all. It was a huge disappointment.  Edit: If anyone disagrees with me about On the Road, Id love to hear what you thought of it and why :)
The best book I read was Animal Farm (George Orwell). It was really a great insight on the basic problems in the socio-political structure of the world.  The worst book I read was The Alchemist. I just didn't understand the whole plot. I was kinda liking but when it turned all supernatural (where he turns into the wind), I lost my interest. But that's just my take. Most people seem to like it though.  Thank you for the contest! Books are awesome. They take us to beautiful and wonderous journeys from the comfort of our couch!  Yo, I would really appreciate if you could share your best and worst OP, u/captain_asparagus
Ugh one of the worst books I've ever read was *The Cabin at the End of the World* by Paul Tremblay. It's such a stupid book. It doesn't even make sense! These terrorists break into a random cabin and torture and murder the family there, making them make stupid "him or me" survival choices (but they kill everyone), and it's mostly full of the terrorists wandering around pontificating their thoughts on the state of society. IT IS SO BORING AND STUPID. It doesn't even make any bloody sense. It's one of those books that thinks it's high literature and saying something Deep and Important, but it's just all surface level bullshit. I can't even give my copy away, because I don't want to subject anyone else to its absolute nonsense.   God I hate that stupid book.  Thanks for the contest lol.
My worst book will be a little controversial I think. The Kite Runner.   And it’s not because it isn’t a good story, or well written. It’s purely personal preference. I just don’t like “real life” type stories! And I may be missing out because I know people who rave about it, and I know that the book is critically acclaimed and has won awards. I just couldn’t get interested in it.   I think it’s because when I read a book, I want to escape into a fantasy, made up land or situation.
Best book tale of two cities it’s dickens version of les miserable but the characters are more relatable. worst ever in gods green creation the crucible. Basically puritan girls sleep over gone wrong cos they were doing witchcraft and blamed everyone else for it cos they didn’t want to get into trouble. I begged my English teacher to kill me I hated that book.
One of the worst books I’ve ever read was called Dragon Storm by Lindsay Buroker. The concept was okay but the plot of the book was not even close to resolved. It just felt like it needed another 100 pages. And I know some books especially in a series don’t resolve the plot fully, but this just felt like there was so much on the table even with side plots and characters. I ended up finishing it because it was short but man I felt high and dry after.
The best book I ever read was Circe. I just find Circe to be such a relatable and aspirational character. And I think it elaborates on The Odyssey perfectly.   The worst book I ever read was called City of Thieves, which is about two guys who are trying to get out of Leningrad during WWII by collecting wedding cake ingredients. Apparently, the author screen-wrote and produced the GOT series, which makes sense, since it was one of the most garish, misogynistic, and pointlessly sex-filled books I've ever read. The characters are shown to be subsisting off of book binding glue, but they also have enough energy to "do it" in front of like ten people who are trying to sleep? Excuse me? My eyes? Are men really like this?
The best book I've ever read is Kushiel's Dart (I know, I'm a broken record about this book, but it's *so* good).  It is the story of a young woman who is raised to serve the goddess Naamah, but is found unfit to serve. Her marque is purchased by a man who trains her in the arts of covertcy. Though she thinks she plays the games of men, the breath of the gods blows hard on her neck and they set her against the forces of destruction with naught but an untried sword priest by her side.   Themes: All knowledge is worth having; that which yields is not always weak  This book is NSFW.  I have several books under $10 on my Books and Puzzles wishlist. Thank you for the contest!
Best Ugly Love by Colleen Hoover it is a heart breaking romance or love lost and love found. It is amazing i have read over and over and cry and laugh and everything in between. Fun fact I used some quotes from this book for for my mom eulogy because we had a relationship with great live a d ugly love , and have meet Colleen several times she is a phenomenal person.   Worst book which I hate to have to say but it was The Mister by EL James I loved her 50 shades books but The Mister lacked depth and emotions I was so disappointed with it.
I just started reading this year so my library isn't that big, but the worst book I've read was the sleep experiment. I hated the format of the book from the start - reminded me of a textbook. The story is about this scientist doing an experiment on two patients where they would be subjected under gas that would make them stay awake indefinitely. The main character sounded soooooo struck up from the start. It felt like the writer wanted to make him sound like a good guy in the begining so you wouldn't think he's a bad dude but omg he was so pretentious. He made me angry the whole book and I wanted something bad to happen to him. In the end, he did get what he deserved but I felt like he needed more torture than that. The death was so random too, like I didn't want a random person that we never met to kill him, I wanted someone like Chad to kill him. It was kinda creepy tho the way the author told the story so I give props to that
The absolute WORST book I ever read was Fifty Shades of Grey. 🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢   Listen, I can get down with some bdsm ALL day. 😈😈 But I do NOT need to read 5 thousand times how "Anastasia bit her lower lip", with the reading comprehension of what a 5th grader could read.   I realize the book made qua-trillions of dollars, but is that REALLY the writing or did the content sell the book?? 🤔🤔 Lets be honest. 🙂
The best book I’ve ever read is The Fault In Our Stars by John Green! It’s a drama and a love story about a cancer patient and a boy she meets at her support group.  The worst book I’ve ever read is the notoriously bad Naked Came The Stranger. This book is known for being bad because of the huge amounts of sex included to the point where the book was incredibly vulgar. It was later revealed that this book was written as an experiment to see if any book could succeed as long as there was sex in it.  I have books on my misc. wishlist just so that you can find them!  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
Best: History is all you left me  - Adam Silvera  This is a story about grief, love, heartbreak, loss and memories.   The main character switches from his real life to all these memories about him and the person who passes away.   It's written amazingly and it's one of the only books to ever make me cry!   The ending is awesome and very unexpected!  I wanna read it again now.. But I have way too much to read!  (Adam Silvera is an amazing author so any of his books are recommended! He is also very open about his depression on instagram in his stories which has helped me a lot!)    Worst: What if it's us - Adam Silvera and Becky Albertali  Sadly, this book is by my favourite author! But the cringing is just too damn much, I'm sorry!  I read this book once but when I tried again I had to stop because it was too cringey.  The thing is: The main characters are great, the book is gay that's also great. But the plot is not that great. So much happens where you just think: God, why does this have to happen? And not in an 'this author is so great but this is infuriating' but in a 'I can't stand this' kind of way. It's hard to explain! I wouldn't give it a 0 star rating but not a very high one either! But I can't think of any worse books I've read!  Edit: I'm sorry, I didn't realise it said Either! Would you like me to remove one of them?
Ugh worst book I ever read was “founding brothers” about true founding of America. I love history! I love learning about it and this book was the worst thing ever. I read it in high school, and 11 years later the book still makes me mad. The first chapter of the book is SO good! And the rest of the books is absolute garbage. Literally would rather lick sand than read that book. It is the only book I have ever not finished. And I got 3/4 of the way through to really give it a chance. It. Was. The. Worst. Ever. So awful. 30/10 do not recommend.
The worst book I've ever read was *The Grapes of Wrath* by John Steinbeck. I read the whole book, but I only finished it because it was required reading for a college class I was in. It was dry, yet dripping with heavy-handed symbolism that made my head hurt. I couldn't follow the plot, and all the characters were mean. I think what made it so bad a read for me was that there were no redeeming characteristics in any of the characters. It was devoid of goodness; it was missing hope. I look for a book to bring me joy, and *The Grapes of Wrath* certainly didn't. (But I do like other works by Steinbeck!)
Worst is impossible. I've quit a few books in my time.  Best is hard. I guess one of my most favorites is Geek Love. I adore the first page.  It opens:  “When your mama was the **geek**, my dreamlets,” Papa would say, “she made the nipping off of noggins such a crystal mystery that the hens themselves yearned toward her, waltzing around her, hypnotized with longing."    I mean, who could resist such a fanciful opening? Then it goes on to capitalize on a fascinating theme born of the author's visit to the Portland Rose Garden. What if instead of hybridizing roses, someone hybridized people? The characters in this book are a couple who missed the carnival lifestyle that was fading and decided to optimize pregnancies by altering their offspring in utero to create freaks that would help keep the carnival alive. It's a horrific but noble and spellbinding effort that leads to complicated family situations.  I highly recommend it.    I have a Booklist under my main wishlist that has all kinds of books under $10. Thanks for the contest.
The Ray Bradbury Report is the worst book I’ve ever read. It’s about how the government has been using clones to harvest organs. An original finds his clone and tries to help him escape. It sounds dope. It was the most boring thing I’ve ever read in my life. And what wasn’t boring was unnecessary.
Well other than Harry Potter the best book was The Guest List. It was full of suspense and the chapters switched character perspectives which I loved!   Worst book was The Topeka School. I don’t even know whAt it was about.  I was confused the whole time. Maybe I wasn’t thinking deep enough about the story but I just did not comprehend what was happening. The characters weren’t memorable or relatable and the ending made no sense.
The best book I've ever read was Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. I just found it extremely entertaining and interesting and I finished it quickly.  The worst book I've ever read was The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern. No plot, all over the place, and too many characters. The writing was very pretty, but that was all it had going for it.
The worst book I’ve read was called “How to Annoy Your Coworkers and Get Away With It”. I was expecting amazing pranks, jokes or something fun I could do. This was an amazon purchase and it only showed the front cover, which looked pretty decent. The book arrives and it’s a 12 page book, if that’s what you want to call it, with black and white picture pages on the flimsiest paper. The ways to annoy your coworker were 2 sentence little jokes like “Call your coworker by the wrong name for a day” and the rest were even lamer.  After page 4 I tossed it. Haha! So not worth it.
Admittedly my best book if often the one I just finished. But one of my fav books is always Howl Moving Castle. I like the book waaaay better than the movie.   Basically there's this lovely lady and she's the eldest of 3. Her sisters go off to be boss bitches and she's like "I gotta be boring and run the family business". But then this bitch witch turns her into an old lady. So she's like "Imma go ask that Himbo wizard for help". But when she gets to the Himbo wizards castle he's missing so she makes a deal with the fire demon instead. And now she's like a cleaning lady and she has to figure out the contract the demon and the wizard made. Shenanigans shenanigans true love sassily ever after.  I like it because it subverts a lot of common fairy tale tropes and is super funny,  and Sophie (MC) takes no shit from her himbo wizard (Howl).
This might be controversial to say, but one of the worst books I ever read was “Catcher in the Rye.” I found Holden Caulfield insufferable.
The worst book I ever read (well, started) was so bad I forgot the title. It was a small paperback I bought at a used book store. It was all black with an orange drawing of a cut-up snake. Every sentence was vulgar and disgusting. I am not exaggerating! In the preface, the author basically said he was annoyed that his publisher wanted him to write another book, so he did as disgusting a job as he could. I didn't get very far into it. Only book I've ever thrown away for its content... didn't want to impose an intentionally terrible book of filth on someone else.
The best book I ever read is the Lemon Tart by Josi Kilpack. It’s the first of a 13 book cozy mystery series. It’s not the best book because of its story, I did love it, but it’s the best book because it sparked my love for reading. I had never loved to read. After I had my daughter 4 years ago I discovered the series from my mother in law. I read the whole series of 13 books in 2 months. I was hooked. I’ve kept reading ever since. It will always be my favorite book.  The worst book I ever tried to read was 50 Shades of Gray. Just not my kind of book.  Thanks for the contest!
Best book I ever read is The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. It has iconic characters, space and fantasy, and tons of humor. And I’m not a particularly easy person to make laugh.   Worst book I ever read—well, I couldn’t finish it, but The American Scene by Henry James. James loves wordplay, and his sentences are the kind where by the time you get to the end of one you forget where you’ve started. On top of that this book is almost nothing but scenery! So boring, but in a way that makes you angry.
Hi friend! Thank you for the contest!  The BEST book I've read lately is "The Immortalists" by Chloe Benjamin. It has magical realism, which I love, and then it is also just a very sad albeit entertaining story of siblings that are bound together by magic. It's not campy or over the top but it evokes the importance of relationships and why we should keep those closest to us near and dear. I loved it and would gladly read anything else she's written now.
The worst book I’ve ever read was called Coming Home To You. It was a typical country romance book. I only made it about 1/3 of the way through because I swear it was the same story line as every other book like it. City girl meets country boy blah blah blah. I couldn’t finish it lol and I don’t think I’ve even tried to read any romance book since then
Best book any harry potter book friendship and magic worst book twilight creepy guy watching you while you sleep no thanks
I love the Hunger Games, and I love how many young people started to love reading because of it! I know a lot of people don't like how the later books were handled, but in some ways that was my favorite thing about the series; the author did not shy away from dealing with PTSD issue, and did not try to sugar coat societal problems with a happy ending and a perfect set of "good guys."
Haha thank you for your very passionate explanation! That sounds like it would drive me crazy, too!
I've picked your entry as one of the contest winners, and a book should be arriving for you on Wednesday! Thanks for playing!
Hey, that's awesome that you're able to love them all! What was The Girl on the Train about?
I'm going to resist the urge to instantly disqualify you for listing East of Eden as your worst, because I'm definitely in the camp that has sung its praises. To be fair, it's not so much a "this is really fun while you're reading it" book as a "this makes some really profound statements about the world and the author has some incredible insights into human nature" kind of book...in short, the kind we English teachers love but don't take with us on beach trips ;) I will have to check out Travels with Charley, though!
I wish I could have been your teacher, that sounds hilarious and creative!
I love your puppet show story!
Thanks for the details on Life of Pi! I've had that one recommended to me a few times, but I feel like I never really had a clear idea what it was about. As for On the Road, it's one of those books that I want to "have read" much more than I want to actually read it, and your description only reinforces that!
I tried to read a Kerouac book, might have been On the Road, and I couldn't.  I didn't get far into it.  Glad it was a library book.
I've taught Animal Farm a few times, and I really enjoyed how it used symbolism, but in a way that was clear and straightforward enough for my students to recognize and understand!  I read The Alchemist too, and while I wanted to like it, it just felt like it was trying way too hard to be really deep and insightful while actually being shallow, vague, and frankly trite.
Haha sounds like you have some pretty strong feelings there! I hate when an author sets out intentionally thinking they're going to write something, as you put it, Deep and Important, and really have nothing more to offer than shallow pontification.
I love The Kite Runner, but admittedly, Hosseini did a much better job with A Thousand Splendid Suns.
I'm very much the same way! I have a copy of The Kite Runner that I still have yet to read, despite countless recommendations, because realistic fiction just bores me. I much prefer the imagination of fantasy and sci-fi, the wild creativity that some authors put into developing whole worlds, magic systems, technology systems, etc.
I read The Kite Runner. I enjoyed getting to learn about a culture I didn’t know anything about. I did not enjoy the story as a whole. It was SO DEPRESSING. Well written, told well, but goodness gracious I was relieved to be done. So I see why people like it so much, but totally understand not liking it. I’m glad I read it because of what I learned. But I’ll never read it again. I’ve heard A Thousand Splendid Suns by the same author is even sadder if you can believe it!
Aw man! I loved the Crucible, and the movie! It’s (loosely) based on the real events surrounding the Salem witch trials so maybe that’s why it felt so frustrating to you. Cause it WAS basically a Puritan girls sleepover gone wrong (+ mass hysteria + well, Puritanism lol) and feels so stupid and pointless now
I've read both, but it's been a long time since then...I've generally enjoyed Dickens's works, though, and I think I liked Tale of Two Cities when I read it. (I *loved* Oliver Twist as a kid, but I think part of that was just that I enjoyed how adults would fawn over me for being an elementary schooler reading Charles Dickens.)
I'm sorry it left you feeling that way! What was the premise, or what was the story about?
Wow, City of Thieves sounds...very weird. And not in a good, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy kind of way. More in a "thank you for warning me so I never read that" kind of way.  I've heard a lot of good things about Circe! I tried listening to the audiobook of Song of Achilles by that same author, but unfortunately it really wasn't for me.
Oooh, that sounds like an interesting one!
That is awesome that you were able to connect with a book on that level, and even cooler that you got to interact with the person who wrote it, too!
Interesting! I've found sometimes really good authors can craft a character you "love to hate," but a bad writer can just as effectively make you hate a character they want you to love!
Ugh....that's not a genre I would've gone for even if it *were* well-written, but I've heard from many people who do enjoy such that it was anything but. But you're absolutely right that choosing a popular subject matter can bring an author a lot more success than applying great talent to an unpopular subject.
That's fascinating to hear that they wrote the whole book as an experiment! Crazy stuff!  And I know a lot of people who have LOVED The Fault in Our Stars, as well as John Green's other works. Not my genre personally, but I always like to know some good books to recommend for people who enjoy that sort of thing!
That's fascinating that both your favorite and least favorite were by the same author!  (And re. your edit...I did intend for people to pick one or the other, but it seems like almost everyone so far has posted both, so you don't have to remove anything.)
Why did it make you mad?
Thanks for the warning - nothing like getting tricked by a beginning that's nothing like the rest of the book.
Definitely don't read The Red Pony.
I haven't read this one since high school, so my memories of it are only vague...I do feel like I've enjoyed his other works more, though!
I read it in my 20's.  Probably couldn't have in high school
That sounds fascinating!
What a shame, it sounds like such an interesting premise; I hate to hear that it went to waste!
I'm sorry The Topeka School was so confusing, that must have been frustrating!
I hated The Night Circus too! But, sooo many people loved it. I'm glad it wasn't just me. It took me so long to finish. I kept pushing through because I hoped it would get better.
I personally really enjoyed The Night Circus, but I can see how it wouldn't be for everyone. I did feel like there was a lot of build-up without enough payoff in the end.
Oh man, that sounds like a real let-down!
I didn't even know Howl's Moving Castle was a book LOL. Well, now I have a reason to read another book...after I watch Howl for the first rime.
That sounds fascinating! I had heard of How's Moving Castle, but I didn't know what it was about!
It definitely seems like that's a "love it or hate it" book!
Wow, that's crazy that an author would do that!
I love to see a book spark that love in someone!
The Hitchhiker's Guide is so much fun! It's such a unique kind of book, and because of that I know I can't recommend it to just anyone, but I love it!
That sounds like a fascinating read with some great themes!
Haha I agree with the comment on Twilight, that's the kind of thing that gets you a restraining order or arrested IRL!
Totally agree. It gave young girls a positive role model too.
Oh my goodness! Thank you so much! Remember: never ever EVER read that dumb book.
it was about an alcoholic who was living a lie, used to make up a story on her commute to work every day as she saw a house with the perfect family in.  But one day she saw something going on and decides to investigate it.  Its great - gripping, murder, who done it type of thing.
hehe - appreciated! And yes, you certainly should give it a spin! I would highly recommend trying for the Centennial Edition of the book, as it included his Appendix at the end, which apparently wasn't included in other editions. It really finished off the book in a particularly wonderful way!
Haha the best part was everyone's reaction when I threw the fake snow. No one could see the bag in my lap so it was a big surprise. The teacher looked a bit horrified for a second (probably because he was thinking about trying to clean it up) but he had a good sense of humor about it. He was also the director for our high school plays so I think he respected props, he just wasn't expecting it 😅
Thanks! I was chuckling to myself as I was writing it because it's a fun memory and my husband asked what I was laughing about and I told him it was the Ethan Frome Puppet Show and he didn't remember that story (which is rare, he's usually heard most of my stories a million times by now) so I got to tell him too!
Oh you’re so welcome! I’ve learned it’s not for everyone as my mom dnf’d it after really trying to like it. But I was interested in a lot of the aspects so to me it was phenomenal. Do the details make you want to read it more or less now?   Your best bet is to just look up best quotes from On the Road and skip trying to suffer through the rest.
Absolutely! They create whole worlds, and to me that’s so much more enjoyable to read!
I think a lot of my problem was the writing style. I hate Shakespeare too. Now catcher in the rye that’s a guilty pleasure read
I really enjoyed bleak house
The story was about the shifting balance of dragons who destructively appear in certain spots of the world. It’s very much like How to Train Your Dragon except not for kids, but there just wasn’t enough world building that would have helped the slower plot.
It's so, so good! It can be read and enjoyed on its own, or you can dive into the world of Terre D'Ange and read the next 8 books in the series as well
Yea it was awesome when I first met her it was a few months after my mom passed away actually which made it even that much more. ♥️
Wow sounds about right. The author pic looks like the main character to me, can't help if he maybe was describing himself 😅
Its sad but true. She was the "first" to become mainstream because of a, content, and b, she had a blog for YEARS with over a million followers who were waiting with bated breath for her book release. Ugh. It's absolutely vile. Worst writing I've ever had the displeasure of reading. I couldn't finish it. 🤮
Because it is deceiving. The first chapter reads like a riveting action novel and the rest of it reads like a high school text book. I don’t mind when a book starts with the expectations really low and then goes no where but I feel like I was tricked when reading that book. I was so excited only to have my joy for it lit on fire and then thrown into the dumpster LOL
I mentioned the book to my sister after posting this, and she just replied NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO because of how terrible it was LOL. For sure absolutely avoid it!
Thanks for the heads up!
I read it with my book club and not a single one of us liked it. I think maybe I would have liked it when I was a teenager. It's definitely not just you that didn't like it! I realized it wasn't getting better when we started getting chapters from the clockmaker's perspective. While I liked him, I was like "does literally every single character in this book get a whole chapter devoted to them? This should just be a background character"
It was lol!!
Like I said, it's one of my favs. I was absolutely devastated the first few times I watched the movie because it's WRONG. Like glaringly, change half the things wrong. But now I can enjoy it as like a rewritten fairy tale style interpretation of the original story.
Read it it's great!
It is so great !!!
It sounds like one I probably wouldn't seek out to read just for fun (I'm more into fantasy and sci-fi), but also one that wouldn't be *unpleasant* to read if, for example, I knew I would be teaching it.
Ohhh I see! It’s because it’s written as a play. Totally understand and agree with you there. I wanted to read it like a novel and how it’s written totally interrupts flow!
I've picked your entry as one of the contest winners, and a book should be arriving for you on Wednesday! Thanks for playing!
What grade do you teach? My English teachers were always my favorites. But then I took philosophy, lol. Yet I majored in Zoo Science and those professors vary wildly regarding likability 😅
I just couldn’t get into them at all. I also hate to be forced to read something but I’ve gotten better at that as I’ve gotten older. High school me was like nope
Oh my gosh, thank you!!!
I've got 7th grade this year; mostly I've taught 7th and 8th, though I did some "special" classes with 6th graders as well as one year of 10th. I'm glad to hear you had some English teachers who had a positive impact on you!
Totally fair!
Ooh, very formative years! Gosh, junior high had to have been the most difficult years of my life. And I remember how kids acted back then. I commend you, lol. I could handle children and maybe teenagers (even though I’m 25 and they still scare me, lol) but preteens?? Couldn’t do it. 😅 Do you have certain books you usually teach?

I’ve always wanted to have my tarot’s read. I find them so interesting
Your card is the six of cups  The past will be a positive influence, and you have the opportunity to take a moment to appreciate all you have learned and accomplished in earlier times. Old friends or acquaintances may brush back into your life, which offers your a fresh perspective on your present and hope for the future
Your card is the five of wands, inverted  You may feel wronged or misled and may feel you have not deserved some current circumstances brought about by the decisions of others. Stay out of resentment as much as you can; it doesn't help move things forward
Your card is the emperor  Protection, advice, and/or support are coming from a trustworthy make figure. He may be authoritarian or seem old fashioned, but he has strength of purpose and is worth listening to, especially when it comes to issues of building playing lasting support structures
Your card is the hanged man  You may need a time out. A situation that causes a feeling of "stuckness" is an opportunity to step back and get fresh insight and perspective. You may need to give up a particular belief or dream in order to be open to new understanding. You may be waiting for someone else to make a decision, unable to make your move until it happens. Don't waste energy fretting about what you are powerless to change. Trust that in time you will have what you need to move forward again.
Your card is the four of pentacles, reversed  You may be feeling undervalued right now, almost like you aren't receiving any reward or recognition for your efforts. Don't let this cloud your ability to see new opportunities where your abilities will be better recognized. Temporary setbacks or disappointments can get in the way of your focus on a positive future. Focus on the good and watch for new opportunities.
Your card is the king of pentacles  Practicality will bring you security and contentment. Focus on stability and be sure to keep your promises.
Your card is the three of wands  In the development of projects, events speed up and both communication and action increase. Your efforts are working, particularly when they involve more creative ways to approach problem solving.
Hello my friend :) Your card is the knight of wands  This is an inspiring and creative time, and what you have been seeking is starting to materialize. Things are likely to be speeding up now, and what you need for success falls into place.
Your card is the eight of pentacles   It's time to invest in yourself. Opportunities are coming your way that bring reward. Your needs can be met by these endeavors, if only you reach out your hand to accept.
Your card is the six of swords  After possibly a long period of difficulty, harmony is restored and you can take some time away from the commotion. Things may not be completed, and that is okay. A break is available to you. If you choose to take advantage of it, you'll return to your work with renewed energy
Your card is the ace of cups  It's time for a fresh start of a passionate nature that has the potential to bring fulfillment, creativity, and contentment. Should you choose this path, it will be a time of bliss.
Your card is the four of wands  You're in a good place right now. Matters of reinvention of the home may come up and are more able to be realized now. Appreciate this time that you have been given and spread positive feelings and you will receive positive results
Your card is the three of swords  It's time to address a painful situation. You've been deeply disappointed. As hard as it is, the best path forward is to accept the situation, knowing that something better will emerge in its place
Your card is the ten of wands  You've got a lot of your plate right now. It's easy to be overwhelmed with everything that's going on. You may need time to work through a few things and let the dust settle before moving on to the next. Have patience. You'll get through this with hard work and determination.
I tell you what, we really do! Would you like a reading this evening?
Your card is the seven of wands  Your goals are worth pursuing, no matter that the way might not be easy. Perseverance gets you where  you need to be. You may need to sustain faith over a long stretch of time before you see results, but changes are very good that you will see them
Your card is the five of swords  This card suggests that you may be facing a problem that doesn't have a viable solution. It's time to find a way to leave the situation and not waste another ounce of energy on it. Choose your battles wisely and focus on the good things in life.
Hi! So it's a new deck and I'm still trying to get a feel for its energy. The markings are slightly different and may be interpreted in a different way than I would with the Hanson-Roberts deck that I've been using for quite a while.   Your card is the sun  This card points to positivity, success, upcoming fun, and warmth. It's a moment to appreciate where you are. You're still growing, and it's important to appreciate times of rest and feelings of security.
Your card is the page of cups  There's a youthful energy around this time that favors expression through music or art. There is a dreaminess and possibly unfocused energy, which may point to the need to be more grounded. Additionally, you may find yourself called upon to provide guidance to others.
Your card is the four of cups  Monotony may be manifesting in your life. As the excitement of new ventures wears off, there's an adjustment period of a new "normal" setting in. This is a time for contemplation, meditation, and re-evaluation. It may be time to let go of some things to focus time and energy on others.
Hi! I have had a nice weekend, thank you! I hope that you have as well.  Your card is the wheel of fortune  Change is coming, and it is likely to be a positive turn of events. You will benefit from spontaneous success and joy as circumstances change unexpectedly for the better. This may manifest in more than one way, so keep an eye out for the good things life has in store for you.
You may feel as though you are losing faith due to something on the horizon. Don't let this get the better of you. Things will look up. Make sure that you are not so focused on the problem that you lose sight of those who love you and are standing by to help.
Your card is the eight of cups  An established relationship, though not necessarily a romantic one, faces an important decision. Long-term thinking is important here. Weigh your options carefully so that you'll have confidence that you've made the right choice.
I love it! I plan to do this every Sunday, as long as I have the time and energy :)   Your card is the page of swords  You are going to need to keep your wits about you and rely on your astute judgement of character to successfully navigate a situation. Intelligence is key, but you're not in this alone. Look for a helpful mentor who comes your way with practical advice.
Your card is the six of pentacles, reversed  You may be either offered a bad deal or denied something that is owed to you. Avoid relying on others to be true to their word this week. Listen to and trust your intuition. You will see through the illusions to the truth.
Your card is the six of wands  Obstacles are overcome and a breakthrough of some kind is imminent. Good news, success, and completion of tasks is at hand. You may feel like you are finally moving forward after having stalled out for a while. Success is coming, as well as a well deserved reward. It's time to celebrate!
Your card is the nine of pentacles  Disputes or issues relating to the home - family, neighbors, or the building itself - are now beginning to resolve. This is a good time to relax, appreciate what you have, and perhaps even treat yourself to a small luxury.
Your card is the empress  This is a good time to revel in the stability and harmony of your home. The woman in your life is such a positive influence. She brings beauty and abundance into your life. This may be a good time to do something for her, perhaps with art or some other creative pursuit.
Thank you!  I feel a bit of peace going into the work week with that!
thank you!
thank you so so much! 💗
Thanks! 🙂
Thanks so much!! I love this!
Oh interesting! Thank you!!
Wow that’s the second time someone has pulled the six of swords for me! Thank you!!
This is actually super relevant thank you so much!
Thank you for the tarot reading!!
I rather see someone who needs it get if that makes sense but ty friend
Thank you so much
Hahahaha my problem is I’m really hoping to win one of these big lottos 😂😂😂 no luck huh?  Thank you!
Thanks for my reading
Ooo interesting!
I searched it and it is so interesting! It says that like I could be a water sign and I am! *pisces*🥰 and it said like my financial situation and how I need to be through with investing and omg I literally just inherited some money and was thinking of investing!! And it said about love as someone is single that I should go forward with my crush and it said they are probably younger and that part is true too. Everything was right it was SO weird.
Wow. That was spot on! Probably time to start looking for a new job.
I’m so glad you’ve had a nice weekend :)  I needed to hear that. It’s nearly 1am here and I’m stewing over things and your reading has given me a boost, thank you 😊
Thank you so much for the reading! Hopefully the relationship reveals itself for me
Nice, thanks!

You're quite welcome :)
Lol, yeah, I'm guessing it's time to put energy into something else :D  You're quite welcome <3
You're quite welcome!
That's awesome! Because it's a new deck and I am still tuning to the energy, I just did a general reading, but it sounds like the specific applications really match what you're experiencing in life right now! It's good to know that I'm starting to key into the energy properly :)
I'm in that boat as well. Definitely contemplating a change with everything that's been going on this year. Hugs, if you'd like them.
I'm so glad. You are quite welcome <3
You're quite welcome. Listen to and trust your intuition. You know what is best for you. If your gut tells you in the upcoming weeks that something is off, pay attention <3
You're welcome!
You're quite welcome <3
You're quite welcome!
I was telling hubby about how much we have in common lol
I LOVE spiritual stuff, I wanna like go see people in person to have readings and stuff!
Thank you!
I was telling my husband about you, too! We made gluten-free spaghetti and meatballs for dinner and I was telling him that if it turned out any good I needed to give you the recipe. Side note, it was baller and I'll message you about it
One of the things that I'd love to do post-Covid is get a spot at my local occult shop where I can do readings in person. I love connecting with people and reading cards for them.
You're very welcome :)
Nice ty

Thanks so much u/Johnwoods1023, for your kind words. And sorry this was a touch late, it was a rough weekend! I really appreciate you taking the time to write something so lovely. Halina is loved and missed, but there is relief in knowing that she is no longer suffering.   I hope these gifts are helpful to you!
Thinking of you always, reach out if you need anything XOXOX
Thank you so much my friend! I appreciate this a lot. These are some products I've been wanting to try for a while now as they can potentially help me. So thank you!  Halina was lucky to have you. And I genuinely mean that. With the family friend grandma I mentioned previously, she told me that she loved to spend time with me because I listened. This is much like you with your amazing "Jewish Grandmother" Halina. I'm sure you'd listen to her all the time, and just appreciate spending time getting to know her. To have her wisdom passed down to you and to know that she would always be on your side. I know you'll miss that a lot, but I'm sure that she would say she was lucky to have you in her life. I can tell you brought a lot of joy to her. So thank you for doing that. Even though I only knew what you told me about her, I'm sure that one conversation with her would have left a lasting impact on me.

That looks like a really sweet book! I love picture books and little kids books...I don't regret teaching an older group, but some days I wish I could have storytime on the carpet!
Thank you so much! You are amazing u/soulisgreen 💛💛💛
It is a great one! I absolutely agree, I do a lot of tutoring with older (3rd-6th) and I love them.   Teaching wise my heart is in K!! We have been remote so I miss the carpet read alouds too  😭💛
What grade do you teach? I loved being read to by the teacher up through 6th grade.
I'm  teaching 7th grade this year, although I've also taught 8th and 6th (and 10th for one year, but that was NOT for me!)

[US Residents only, I can’t afford international shipping at the moment. I’m sorry😔]  Good morning, or afternoon depending on where you are located! I’m doing my first giveaway here on RAOA. While I know it’s not much I wanted to giveback for once. My family often gets me movies because it’s an easy gift and they know I collect them. Now I have too many in my 1 bedroom apartment!  I am giving away parts of my collection that I either have duplicates of or just no need for! The choices are below!  [RAOA Movie Giveaway!](https://imgur.com/gallery/uKAhEfE)  Please comment below the number bundle you’d like to receive and why! I’ve categorized them into Horror, Comedy, Drama! They are all still wrapped and new except for the Austin Powers movies!  I will be randomly selecting 3 winners via PM today and tomorrow. The giveaway will close at 6:00 PM on 1/18/21 (Eastern Time)  You must be comfortable with me sending directly to your address!  I will update as I choose winners!  Thanks and happy watching,  ForzaRebic  Update: [Current Standings for each bundle!](https://imgur.com/gallery/QmogIIu) I’ve decided that I’ll do the drawing tonight around 10:00 PM eastern time for each bundle! Ideally would like at least 3 for each! So let’s show #1 some love!🤓  4 hours left!!
Number 1!!!!! We're the Millers is so overlooked, and it is so good! Austin Powers shag you very much! Jason Bateman is the best straight face comedian!  Awesome giveaway!!
\#2, please.   I'm a huge movie fanatic. I own quite a bit of movies (thousands; I've lost count). I especially love Horror. But, I noticed that I *didn't* own a single movie from #2! So, that's why I'd particularly like to win that particular bundle. Thanks for hosting this giveaway; you're very kind!
Not entering just want to say this is awesome of you!
I got with #3 Drama mainly because I haven't seen any of these films. Yes I know. I haven't seen Braveheart or Gladiator? These are classics but for some reason I haven't seen them yet.
Number 2! As my username suggests I love horror movies and I don’t have those ones yet. Mild confession I don’t own a lot of movies currently. Been trying to slowly build up the collection.   Horror movies are my happy place. Have a bad day? See some other folks deal with some fictional misery and bam life’s not so bad.  That sounds bad but it helps lol.
If i was able to participate due to being in the UK I'd pick the horror bundle
3! Gladiator and Braveheart are some of my favorite movies and I have wanted to see the others! Especially the judge! I am just watching The Godfather for the first time and to be honest, it’s the first thing I have seen Robert De Niro play a dramatic actor. He’s fantastic! I can’t wait to see more.
3. I love dramas and Braveheart & Gladiator are great and the only ones I’ve seen in the bundle. I don’t own any of them. Thanks for the giveaway!
I'm not entering but what a fun cool idea! I just went through my dvds and might have to steal this haha. Also don't forget about Media Mail shipping! It will save you a fortune.
I love dramas.  I live alone and sometimes just need some new material to watch!  This is awesome!

😂 I laughed wayy too much while reading this comment
Got you in for #1! All three bundles have their first contestants!   Thanks for sharing😊
I have you entered for #2 my friend! Best of luck😊
Thank you!
I have seen them all. They are all fantastic films, but keep in mind they’re typically a little longer then you’re average movie lol.  Gladiator is my all time favorite. When I had to go to my grandmas for Christmas growing up she only had 1 VHS tape the entire 14 years of Christmas we visited her.   That one VHS happened to be Gladiator. It’s such a bad ass movie especially when it was made.   I’ve entered you for #3!😊
Added!
SuperGee94, I just tried to check the shipping for shipping to UK and it’s a little bit outside of my price range. I should have clarified and I apologize :’(

Hello everyone!! I’m new around here so I guess introducing myself is the first step!! I’m extremely excited to be joining the community and think that the concept is genius and cannot wait to meet and get to know all of you!  Call me Beau! I’m a 19/F who is turning 20 in about two months. I live in Ohio and I’m currently attending tOSU as a sophomore and studying Criminology with the intentions of going into criminal law!! I just moved out on my own into my first apartment recently so I’m just now getting situated into the whole “real world” and “adulting” thing and it’s going surprisingly well! I was just recently put onto antidepressants for extreme depression and anxiety so slowly but surely things are looking up and I’m feeling better. ( It’s getting better all the time, can’t get much worse! 🎶 ) It’s been difficult being new to both a university and city during a global pandemic and I’ve been struggling with loneliness quite a bit lately seeing as it’s a struggle to meet new people right now, but the Internet has been really helping me to feel connected to others so communities like this one are heaven sent!!   First and foremost, the most important thing to know about me is that I’m probably the biggest Beatles fan you’ll ever meet — I eat, sleep, and breathe the Fab Four. I’ve been a Beatles fan since I was about three years old and it just sorta stuck (my mom was really hoping it was a phase, but alas, here we are~). My favorite Beatle is John Lennon and my favorite album is Rubber Soul!  Some other musicians that I’m really into are Peter Frampton, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, any solo Beatles, Mother Mother, Billie Eilish, Wallows, The Front Bottoms, Marina and the Diamonds, Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey, Lady Gaga and The Driver Era!   Beyond normal genres I am also a huge musical theater nerd and my favorite musicals are Falsettos, In the Heights, Hamilton, Legally Blonde, Heathers, and Bonnie and Clyde!  Another huge aspect of who I am is vinyl record collecting! Ive been collecting albums for about six years now and have been getting really into the hobby again recently!  I’ve spent an unhealthy amount of money and time building my collection during quarantine seeing as I didn’t have much else to do, and I’m currently trying to convince myself not to splurge on a nice player! I currently have 197 albums on vinyl and am extremely excited to soon pass the 200 mark.  I really enjoy watching movies and television as well! My favorite films of all time are Goodfellas, Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood, The Florida Project, Call Me By Your Name, and The Shawshank Redemption. Films are my escape from my mundane day to day life and keep me sane.   Some TV shows that I’m really into are American Horror Story (my absolute favorite), The Umbrella Academy (I’m 100% a Klaus Hargreeves enthusiast), Stranger Things, The Office, and I’ve been getting my really into Saturday Night Live lately.  A huge part of my life as of recent is the fact that I am two months into a long distance relationship! I have a girlfriend (20/F) that lives in Serbia and it has been a ton of fun getting to learn her culture and identifying the key differences between ourselves based upon where we’re from and where we grew up! Our distance is an incredible 4,900 miles/7885 kilometers and much of my time recently has been spent FaceTiming, interacting with, and watching movies with her!!  Fun facts about me: I was born with twelve fingers (extra pinkies on each hand), my favorite color is pink, my Meyer Briggs Personality Type is ENTP-T and I’m a Pisces, I love grizzly bears and they’re my favorite animals, I have two cats that I’m obsessed with — an American short hair and a Maine Coon named Samson and Delilah, I’m currently trying to learn how to play chess, I enjoy caring for succulents and have three, I know American Sign Language, and I’m really advanced in Color Guard (flags, rifles, sabres that accompany marching bands) and have performed all over the US doing the activity including Paul Brown Stadium, Ohio Stadium, Lucas Oil Stadium, and even in the Disney World News Years Eve parade!!   Hopefully I was able to express who I am well enough but please feel absolutely free to AMA!! I look forward to interacting with all of you and joining this incredible sub!   Beau :)
I'm in Ohio too!!
Hello and welcome! If you ever need or want someone to talk to you can reach out to me!
Welcome! You've certainly left an impression with that HUGE intro! I love it!! We seem to have a lot of TV shows in common!
Hi! Welcome to the sub! Enjoy this amazing community!! What is your favorite dessert??
Welcome!
Welcome! You already sound much more successful in life than I, so I know you'll get through any challenges that come your way. I totally understand that feeling of loneliness, even though I'm rarely actually alone. Just remember, all will be well.
Welcome
We have so much in common and I would love to be friends if you ever want to shoot me a pm!
Hey man! Welcome!
Hello and welcome!!!!  If you could turn into an animal at will, what animal would you choose?
Hi! Welcome! What's your favourite fictional object?

That’s so cool!! It’s always so awesome to meet people from around here! Is it snowy today where you are in the state? It’s been snowing off and on here in Columbus all day!
Hi! Thank you so much, that means a lot! It’s such a pleasure to meet you and I definitely plan on taking you up on that offer!! :)
Impressions are so important so that’s quite the compliment! :) I definitely got a bit carried away talking about myself BUT I regret nothing because it was way fun, haha. It’s so cool that we’re into the same TV shows because the ones I mentioned are my absolute favorites and much of my free time is admittedly spent binging them! What’s your favorite show?
Hiya! Thank you so much, I’m so excited to be here!! My favorite dessert is definitely cake but it has to be vanilla with vanilla frosting!
Thank you so much! I’m so excited to be here!!
That was such a kind and uplifting message, I really needed to hear that this week! Thank you so much for sharing some reassurance and positivity, it really means more than you know!
Thank you so much!! Happy to be here! :)
That makes me so happy! I’m so excited that we have a lot in common, I could use a friend!! Absolutely!
Hello hello! Thank you so much, I’m super excited to be here! :)
Hello and thank you so much!! I definitely have to say my animal of choice would be the grizzly bear. It’s my favorite animal and would be totally cool to be able to turn into at will!!
Hi there and thank you!! I definitely have to say my favorite would be lightsabers just because they’re so badass!
Thank you so much!! It’s absolutely one of my all time favorites, it’s so incredible! It’s a comfort movie in such an odd way. It’s so sad but the characters are so relatable. I wish more people would watch it simply so I could talk to them about it!
Thank you so much!! I’ve been desperate to get a Beatles lyric tattooed on me but I always chicken on! Now I HAVE to know which lyrics yours are of! My favorite song has always been In My Life, how about you?
Hello there and thank you so much for the warm welcome!! I think that my three best attributes are definitely my humor, interest in learning, and how ambitious I am!
This reply is entirely too late because I missed it in my notifications and I’m SO glad that I noticed it when checking for new comments!! I’m so excited that we have so much in common!   Firstly, I love love LOVE Mindhunter and have been a huge fan since the beginning! Not too many people know about/enjoy the show so I’m overjoyed that you do! I haven’t seen Better Call Saul yet however I read that we have the same personality type so that interests me! (ENTPs are notable as lawyers so it doesn’t surprise me). And I’m absolutely going to check out True Detective ASAP!!  I have not been adopted yet but I’d LOVE to be! I’m just beginning to learn the ropes around here now and it’s still pretty confusing and overwhelming so it’d be great to have someone to help and a new friend!! :) And I’ll definitely put my birthday down!  Thank you so much for leaving such a kind comment, I really appreciate it and look forward to getting to know you!!
Sadly I'm in the north but Columbus was really pretty when I visited! :)
Of course! I love that you know ASL! I took ASL in high school but it’s been a while and my college stopped offering it so I’m very very rusty haha.
Well my favourite show isn't one you've listed, my favourite show is Supernatural!
Yum!!!! Sounds delicious!
You're welcome! If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to DM me anytime.
Yay for knee friends! Expect to be summoned often 😅
ooo good choice! My husband would agree with it a lot  lol  bears are his favorite animals!
It feels so real, did you know the Disney scene was filmed on iphones without Disney even knowing? Love that fact
Good choice!  Here Comes the Sun is backwards on my chest so I can read it in the mirror as a reminder better times are coming. And then I have Ob-La-Di on one wrist and Ob-La-Da on the other, as a reminder that life goes on, of course. I told myself I'd never get a lower back tattoo, so Life Goes On is there, ironically. Due to that my artist said he'd do it for no extra charge 😂   Blackbird has always been my favorite but it hasn't made it's way onto me yet unfortunately.
I'm patiently waiting for season 3, I've seen all the documentaries about serial killers that Netflix has.  also please don't watch Better Call Saul unless you have seen **[Breaking Bad](https://youtu.be/Pev38s3xPgM)** first.   I've taken the Myers–Briggs personality test 3 times and the results say I'm INTJ-T  “The Architect” and I totally agree  here you can watch / download True Detective :  **http://rarbg.to/torrent/vflo1t9**  **https://www.hbo.com/true-detective**  I'll adopt you : )
It is so beautiful!! I’ve only been up north once to visit Sandusky for vacation but it was beautiful there as well!
It’s so cool that you took it too! I started in high school as well and now I’m picking it up at university so I’m pretty rusty myself, haha. It’s such a shame that your college doesn’t offer it, it’s such a necessary and applicable language!
I love Supernatural so much, I was debating on whether or not to include it! That’s definitely one of my all time favorites!!
How about you, what’s your favorite? :)
Thank you so much!! I have a feeling I’ll take you up on that offer! :)
I look forward to it!! 🥳
They’re definitely the superior animal, haha. How about you? Which animal would you choose?
I read that! And about how most of the actors were just people and kids staying in motels around Orlando with no acting experiences just like their characters. And it’s incredible that they found the actress for Halley on Instagram, she was definitely one of the strongest parts of the film and all these facts are probably why it has such a realistic feel to it!!
The Here Comes the Sun tattoo is such a lovely concept, I’m obsessed!! So is the Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da one!! That’s so good, oh my god! That’s funny because Blackbird was never even one of my favorite songs in particular and still it’s the Beatles song I think I’d get tattooed on me if I had the chance. There’s just something so resonating about “Take these broken wings and learn to fly.” Now you’re making me seriously consider getting some ink!
I agree! They stopped offering it because “it wasn’t foreign
Omg yesssss another SPN family member has joined!!!
Gosh! Probably a good pineapple upside down cake!!
I would say a hawk! I want to be able to soar through the sky!!
Wow I just read a couple interviews she's done after filming, I never have much thought and just assumed she was an actress she killed the role and is scared of being typecast which sucks!!!
I certainly would support the idea! But totally understandable if you didn't, lol.
That.. makes a frustrating amount of sense. I mean, they aren’t wrong BUT it’s so necessary!
YESS! I’m obsessed! I’ve admittedly spent days at a time binging it, haha.
That sounds so good right now, I could go for some pineapple upside down cake! What a solid answer. My favorite fruit AND my favorite dessert in one!
That’s such a cool choice! I might be second guessing myself now that I think about how bears can’t fly... haha :)
I know!!! So frustrating and just ughhh
Yesss samee I have the anti possession symbol tattooed on me! I am SOOO obsessed like its my lifeee
We deserve it we should get some!!
haha  true  but they are beasts in a good way! lol  and great swimmers!
I wouldn’t be able to handle my university not offering ASL, I’m not built to learn an actual foreign language haha
That is literally SO cool! That’s such an awesome tattoo, oh my god!!! I love that so much!
I take it back, you’re right! If lions are kings of the jungle then bears are definitely kings of the forest! 🐻
Honestly, same... it’s so hard for me
Wait I saw you are a Pisces! Me too!!
Pisces are superior!! When’s your birthday? :)
March 14th, yours?
March 11th, almost birthday buddies! haha
Omg so close!!😂
Close enough! All that matters is that March babies are also superior!!
Yesss we are on a different level!

Give Me Suga Sunday  I’m hum I’m diabetic (have been all my life) so I have to watch the sweets. I do have some keto low sugar brownie bites on my wish list though hopefully that counts.

Yay Gimmie Suga Sunday. Something sweet about my weekend is I’m about to finish the book I’ve been reading and I’m always excited to finish one and start another :)
Gimme Suga Sunday   Yesterday my family got together to help my mom pack things up put them in her basement or put aside for donations as she is getting her house painted this week. It was sweet to see everyone working together and it made things get done so quickly. We will head back over in a week or two to put everything back once it is done.
Gimme Suga Sunday!   I’ve had a very laid back weekend. Got my chores done throughout the week so all I’ve really had to do is laundry. Feels good to lay around sometimes!
Gimmie Suga Sunday 😁  I got to see my niece! She's almost 4 months old. I hadn't seen her since she was like 6-7 weeks old, she'd grown so much already, it was so sweet 😍  Also, I ordered an Indigo tie dye kit so we can make matching family shirts. Just need to get us some tees. And a wee little tee for my baby girl ☺️
Gimmie Suga Sunday   Have a great Sunday lovely lady sweet thing this weekend is I am starting Bridgerton book 3!!!
Gimmie Suga Sunday!     My weekend was filled with sweetness from my SO. I'm going to see him soon (we're Long Distance) and the entire weekend was filled with sweet affirmations. I absolutely cannot wait to see him, and I'm so happy to have him in my life!
Gimme Suga Sunday  My weekend started sour but ended on a sweet note! I had to do my quizzes which wasn’t fun, but the sweet part was when my brother threw my stuffed dog at my head when I was sleeping.  He knew I wanted the stuffed dog so he went out of his way to wake up and get him just to chuck at my head. So touching
Gimmie Suga Sunday  We just moved in with my boyfriend's mom and it's so sweet! Now we just gotta start saving up for our own place

I had cake and cornbread with honey already but up on the list is cookies and candy! Lol
I've spent my Sunday switching between working (yay) and playing on the Switch with my son (genuine yay), so not too bad a day on balance!  And hey, I've got snackage on my wishlist that I only added yesterday by happy coincidence, so it's time for Gimme Suga Sunday!

Gimme suga sunday! Something sweet today is we just discovered a new cool cooking show!
Gimmie Suga Sunday  I ended up going back to my bestie a house in chicago and her one dog paypay sat down and would not leave my side for an hour or was so sweet.
Oooooh, I need some suga!!! I just did a one month challenge without extra desserts or sugary treats and I could REALLY use some candy in my life lol.   Today I get to see my best friend for the first time in two months. We are allowed to have small outdoor gatherings again so I am going to her place to sit around the fire. I can't freaking wait. I might even cry when I see her.
Gimmie Suga Sunday   My sweet fiance went round my island in animal crossing collecting all the fish I dumped on the beach because Im a lazy butt!

Gimmie Sugar Sunday!   I made a Milky Bar chocolate cheesecake this weekend, I don't often make cheesecakes but this one turned out so well! 🙂 Well, the other half says so anyway!  Happy Sunday everyone!
Gimmie Suga Sunday :)  Something sweet about my weekend is my cat has wanted to be around me a lot recently. She loves me but is a strong independent cat who isn’t particularly snuggly. She’s laid with me so much recently. Not just in her usual spot by my pillow or the bottom of the bed, but pressed up against me. And she sleeps so soundly, it makes me so happy that she trusts me enough to relax like that because she’s a very anxious cat.  [Plus she’s so cute when she sleeps](https://imgur.com/gallery/FLmcxkb)
Gimme suga sunday :)   Something sweet about my weekend is that I spent it making valentines. I’ve never made valentines before so it was extra exciting for me! Now I can’t wait to mail them out :)
Gimme suga Sunday!  I’ve spent the last hour cuddling with a kitten!
Gimmie Suga Sunday  My weekend was sweet because I got to spend the weekend with my husband and pup. It was nice. Thanks for the opportunity.
Gimmie Sugar! My cat is turning to such a little cuddle bug and I love it. I think it's because of the cold.
Gimmie Sugar! My weekend was sweet because I got to sleep in.

Gimme Suga Sunday   Something sweet about my weekend is that I got to spend time watching One Step Beyond the TV show with my mom. It's been a long time since we've done anything like that, so it was quite special.
Gimmie suga sunday! Went for a 3 mile hike today which was a good workout:)
Gimmi Suga Sunday   Getting time to spend with my newborn son is always sweet

Gimmie Suga Sunday! Woohoo! :)   Something about my weekend- We have been watching football and now we are watching Halloween! We have also been working on crate training the puppy this week, and she’s been doing pretty good this weekend. We are proud of her!   Thanks for hosting!
Gimmie Suga Sunday!  We had a movie night with my friends on saturday. Not like in person or anything, but we all watched the same movie at the same time and talked about it via messenger. It was fun
gimmie sugar sunday
Aww family time is the best! Oooo what board games have you been playing? :)
Snap! Type 1 diabetic since I was 11 so careful with the quantity and frequency of when I have sweets but I do have a sweet tooth 😬.
Haha, I love this!
We've been playing a LOT of Mysterium since that one is really good as a group. And when it's my husband and I, we do a lot of Disney Villainous. We're always coming up with new types of tournaments lol.
Sounds like a lot of fun! I’m a huge Disney fan so will have to have a look into the Disney Villainous :)
Me too! I love everything Disney, and Villainous is really fun. I highly recommend it :D

Closed   My First Giveaway!  I haven’t been as active on the sub lately because I’ve been busy crocheting!  I’ve made washcloths and soap savers. I’d like to give two lovely people a set of two washcloths and a soap saver.  So, the rules of this giveaway are simple.  1. DBAD 2. Be in the US 3. Be willing to give me your address so I can mail them to you 4. Tell me what handmade items mean to you  That’s it!  Giveaway will end Monday at noon central time. I’ll choose 2 people then and mail items on Tuesday. Good luck!  [https://imgur.com/a/DxR38Lm](https://imgur.com/a/DxR38Lm)
Not entering because I have plenty of washcloths, but I did want to say that those are adorable! You're really good at crocheting.
Not entering but you did a great job on these
These are gorgeous. I have several made by a friend. What a wonderful giveaway.
Handmaiden items are really special to me because they’re made with love, time, and care. Anyone can go and buy things in a store, but to have something made for you is a lovely and unique thing.   Thanks for the chance!!
These are amazing!!! So so proud of you! I love handmade items because you can really feel the love!

Those are beautiful 🙂 I spent hours and hours cross stitching mario and princess peach many years ago. I fully recognize how special made with love pieces are 🙂
Congratulations on your first giveaway! ✨🎉  Those are beautiful! I would love a set of washcloths and soap savers. Hand made items are special to me because they are not only made with hard work, but love, time, and care. Those who make hand made items pour their everything into their craft and to me, that’s the most wonderful thing about handmade items.  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
I love handmade items.  I love quilts and afghans and table doilies... I think I'm in the wrong era
I would rather receive a handmade gift than store bought. I know whoever made the item worked really hard on it and is proud of it. I get to show it off and promote their work. Especially if its a single parent or someone just starting to open a business, or a side gig. I get to help promote them and help them become financially  independent! By getting handmade gifts and stuff I get to help someone truly achieve a dream.
oh how pretty! 🌸 handmade items are the best because they are made with love and care and a lot of hard work and effort! 💗
I love handmade items I recently started crocheting
Not entering but very cute!!
You did an amazing job on these! They look so neat and tight!   I love homemade items. You can feel the love that went into making them.  Plus they normally last longer too!
Not entering but these are so nice!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kzfxt5/discussion_whats_your_favorite_retro_video_game/

For me it is Mega Man Battle Network 3 Blue (2002).  I remember an aunt  bought it for me as a present one day we want out. I haven't seen my  aunt in years due to some family problems, but she's always been sweet  with me. I played until a boss that was too freaking fast in a Zoo and  gave up on it for months, maybe even a year. After that, I went back to  it and was able to defeat it and a short month or two after that I beat  the game. I haven't played it since I was a kid, but the first thing  that comes to mind is my aunt. Video games can seem silly for some  people or immature, but they have always helped me have a connection  with other human beings, one way or another.
Oregon trail. Is that retro enough lol. Let me rephrase that.... The original Oregon trail from the 80's.
The original Kings Quest (1984). It was my first PC game with graphics and stuff. Lots of good memories of that game.
Super Mario!
I used to love Aladdin. Haha. I’m pretty sure it was 1993 or so. I spent hours on that game.
I use to play this game...now it was on a ps1 demo disk it was called tomba I was obsessed with it lol it wasn't even the full version of the game lol I would replay over and over I've always wanted to get the proper copy of it but goly it's a hot market game
Hmm... For years I have been searching for this computer game that my brother and I used to play. I remember being about 7 years old and coming home to play this superhero game with him on the computer. It was a time where we customized characters, used superpowers, and followed along a generic story. But it was special because we were close and would bond over it. I only recently found out the game is called Hero X. It's the same case with this old pc racing game called Rollcage. We would bond over it. Over the years we've grown quite distant, but the pandemic has once again forced us to spend more time with each other. And while we're not as close as we were as kids, when we bond over things these days, it reminds me of playing those retro pc games together.
I have two favorites: one is Tetris and the other is Arkanoid. I’ve got Tetris 99 on the switch, but I haven’t found a substitute for Arkanoid.
I used to be obsessed with Commander Keen. I remember when I was feeling nostalgic in high school, I got really excited to find a website that let me play it on the school computers.
Does A link to the past count as retro? Or do I have to pick something older.  I loved the story, soundtrack, and gameplay that felt way ahead of its time. It was actually four seasons and the other GB one that got me into the series, but ALTTP was just phenomenal and has held up really well even today
hmm. I think I have to go with Kirby's Dreamland and Kirby's Dreamland 2.   while I think OG Sonic and Mario were the first video games I played, Kirby was the first video game I personally owned. I got a gameboy when i was about 6 and my mom got me Kirby and I was SO excited. and to this day Kirby games are such a delight to play
My favorite will probably always be Banjo & Kazooie (1998). Super Mario 64 may have been the best N64 platformer, but Banjo & Kazooie was my baby. So many unique areas, characters, tight gameplay, AMAZING music, and graphics that still hold up. They knew how to do a collectathon the right way.
Joust! Or the original Zelda.
Ms. Pac-Man at the arcade.
There’s a fairly unknown PC game called The Neverhood that was my absolute favorite when I was little. It was a claymation game with a lot of puzzles and stuff to progress the story. If you’ve ever played Earthworm Jim or Skullmonkeys, it’s the same art style. I’m pretty sure they’re made by the same people.   For console I will always have a special place in my heart for the original Sonic game too.
Not incredibly retro but the Nancy Drew games on CD.
Super Mario or donkey king.
Wario Land. Played it for hours on end until the battery ran down.
Alex the Kidd who apparently is just called Alex Kidd these days.  Someone playing it https://youtu.be/yasiyS7dkcU
Is [*D*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(video_game)) retro?
Donkey Kong 64! I really hope they rerelease it on switch (or I hope I can find a cheap N64 since my parents got rid of my childhood one a long time ago lol)
My favorite is a game for the PS1 (later released on the PSP as a PS1 classic) called Battle Hunter. It’s kinda like D&D battles mixed with board game movement and an RPG story (not much, but enough to make sense of gameplay).
i have a HUGE soft spot for the classic Mario games, but i would say my all time favorite retro video game is the sonic the hedgehog 3! it really got me into gaming.
My favorite is Tekken Tag Tournament. I have so many memories going to the arcade at my local hotel and wasting quarters trying to beat the final boss. Such a simpler time....
Tempest
That's such a beautiful memory :)
I had Battle Network 3 White! I remember going through that game, getting to what I thought was the ending, and then realizing there were still multiple paths to go down and things to do. Then that happened AGAIN! Such a giant game for the GBA
Hahaha yeah. I think that anything that came before PS3 is retro now. We're far removed from a lot of games haha :) I've never played it. Have you seen the small retro console they sell to exclusively play that game? You should give it a go!
Classic! Don't break your axel or get dysentery!
Woah Woah Woah! Was that the old RPG game that you could type answers into for your attacks and stuff? 0_0
Wow, never played it. There was a remake or sequel recently, wasn't there? I remember my first PC game being Age of Empires and a Sesame Street learning game haha
I love all the Mario games!
Oooh nice, on SNES or Genesis? It's my understanding they are different
Tomba? Wow. Sounds super obscure!!!
Oww, that's so cool! I had never heard of those games. Looking at them now, those are some deep cuts right there! My brother and I grew apart too. It's a shame, but we used to play a lot of games together or watch each other play. I remember him playing Silent Hill 4 only on Saturday mornings when I was in the house because it was f*cking scary back then hahhaa
Ohhhh Tetris! Classic but also soooo stressful
Yeah any game older than 10 years is retro imo. I love Oracle of Seasons. It's the only 2d Zelda I've finished. I tried playing A link to the past and been wanting to go back because I didn't finish it. Have you played the sequel? I've heard it's good too
This is my favorite answer. One of the best video games ever made, let alone best Zeldas. I should really play that one again soon!
Oh, that's so cool! I've heard great things of those two games. Nostalgia hits me hard when thinking of being a kid playing games. It was all so simple back then.
Oh god, a claymation point and click game? I'll have to check it out. Claymation has always been a rare thing in video games.
I would say it is! I think the 90s are retro. We're 30 years apart of the beginning of that decade! It's hard to believe
Hahaha my parents threw away my PS1 and my brothers SNES. But the SNES was thrown away because my sweet dog pissed on it once hahaha I haven't played that one, but love DK Country on SNES
Wow, never heard of that one. Played a lot of PS1 games back in the day but never that one. You like Dungeons and Dragons?
Is that Sonic and Knuckles? I hear great stuff about that game and it's a shame Sega doesn't want to release it on modern platforms. They've re-released the other 2 countless times. On another note, I love S. Mario Bros. 3 and 2. 2 is such a weird title.
Oh, boy. I remember going to an arcade machine in a local restaurant I used to go when I was a kid. I played a lot of Metal Slug on it and spend a lot of quarters on it hahaha. I used to play Tekken with my brother all the time on PS1. I liked the character that is made out of wood, that one was my favorite.
Thanks John! Is there a favorite of yours? Edit :Nevermind I read your comment haha
Yes, it's awesome! I remember the end-game and the post-game being particularly hard. There's speculation they'll release a collection with every one this year! Hope we can replay 3 on modern hardware again soon!
No I haven't. I'll have to look it up. I remember sitting in elementary school playing it all the time.
Yes!!
There was! I tried to play but it’s very, very different.
SNES.
😂 😂 Omg exactly! We'd play horror games too like when the original slender came out or resident evil. It's a shame that siblings grow a part over time like that because at the end of the day, if they lose their job, their house, their friends, and their status in life, the only thing they have left is their family. Which is why it's so important to reconcile. I'm in the process of that and trying my best but it's definitely frustrating at times.
Yeah. The weird art style coupled with the bizarre music I think are what really sold me on it. The game itself had some pretty funny parts too. I don’t want to spoil anything if you plan to play though. But I really hope you enjoy it if you can find a way to check it out!
Yes, I haven’t played a lot recently, but you can still find me tossing around character ideas with my friends and what not for when I do play again :)
i think sonic and knuckles came out after 3! 3 is the one with emerald hills.
For sure! Just commented about it :3
Ohhh I would love that. Well you've brought me on board for buying a collection. Would be perfect to replay them on the Switch.
That's cool. Look, here it is [https://www.amazon.com/The-Oregon-Trail-Handheld-Game/dp/B07B61BFSW](https://www.amazon.com/The-Oregon-Trail-Handheld-Game/dp/B07B61BFSW) It's freaking crazy how now games that needed a big computer can now run on small devices such as that one.
Ahhh! I always wanted to play that game when I saw it in the movie Big. If I remember correctly.  Edit : never mind big had a different game lol
Man, there's this HBO documentary on Slender that really creeps me out hahaha I've never gone anywhere near the game.   It is frustrating. I think the same you do about family. Sadly, it's very very difficult and quarantine makes it even more so. Each one of us has it's priorities. I guess time will tell.
Oh I thought they were the same one hahaha I've only completed Sonic Advanced 3. That one is great :)
Oh wow, that's freaking awesome. Thank you!!!!
Omg! I know the documentary you're talking about. It was wild! I'm lucky I never watched it growing up or else I'd have slender nightmares haha.  And you're right, time will tell.

CLOSED - WINNER WILL BE CHOSEN AND SHARED WHEN I WAKE UP TOMORROW 😂  So another year has come and gone, and it turns out I'm 26 at the end of the month. Who knew?! (I did, I obsessively count down every single year from new years day 😂)  As much as I enjoy my birthday, it's always been a bit of a let down; I ask a bunch of people to come out and everyone always says no. I'm still very bitter about my 16th birthday but that's a different story...   So here's the rules;  - Have a birthday in January - if you happen to be born on 28th Jan you might get an extra surprise for being my birthday twin!   - Tell me your happiest birthday memory   - Have something for £15 or under (local currency equivalent)  - Link your wishlist cause I'm on mobile  - DBAD   - Include 'It's my birthday!' for the randomiser   - Contest closes at 10pm GST on Monday 18th January

Ah happy early bday! January babies unite 🙌 My bday already passed on the 4th.   My happiest birthday memory was when all my family were able to gather for my birthday. Most years it's always hard to have us gathered exactly on my birthday becuase of work and school, but that day was really special. I don't do much on birthdays anyways beside having cake 🎂  It's my birthday! Thanks for hosting   [Wl](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3RNLYTU0A1RX2?ref_=wl_share)
It's my birthday!   Well yesterday was my actual birthday. And yesterday will be the happiest memory!  I had cards to open!! I've never had anything to open on my birthday! And folks I'm 51!! My son made an amazing elevated spaghetti and garlic bread dinner!! I spent the day talking with family and friends on several different platforms!!  Yeah yesterday was damn amazing. Happy birthday January babies!! 💕  Edit https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1AK35UH3JU9U1?ref_=wl_share

My favorite birthday memory was when I was younger and all of my grandparents came over for cake to surprise me.   [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/36CJ9MEF5VGH2?ref_=wl_share)
I hope you have a fun one my friend 💛 I remember going on a road trip across a few states with my best friend. She played a song for me at every piano we found. We also stopped at every ice cream shop and got a bit sick, but not enough to make us stop eating ice cream.  Today’s not my birthday, but It’s my birthday! Thanks for the contest 🥳💕  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/YNK11TYESXYM?ref_=wl_share
Not entering because I wasn’t born in January but my daughter was and I just want to wish you a very happy birthday!
Its my birthday 5th January   A fave memory i had was when my grandma got me the newest phone  that I'd always wanted and it made me so happy  [Wish list](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/334J8I5EFBKQW?ref_=wl_share)
HAPPY ALMOST BIRTHDAY! You're an Aquarius right? My birthday was on the 15th, but my sister's is the 24th. We always had to celebrate together which kind of made me mad, but THIS year my cousin went into labor with her first baby on my birthday! We were all hoping he would come on the same day but he ended up being born at like 2:30am on the 16th! I really love that we're going to have close birthdays now because I have never really been super involved in any kids life from birth and I feel like him and I will have a super close connection now, or at least I hope we will :) You'll be saying "It's My Birthday!" very soon. Congrats and thank you for the contest friend !!  [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1GGXE887TDO20?ref_=wl_share)
It’s my birthday. No it’s not, my birthday was yesterday, the 16th of Jan and I turned 29. And honestly, I spent it and today too, in a really depressed mood for a number of reasons, yours included.   Maybe my happiest birthday memory was a year my girlfriend at the time made a lot of effort to get some friends together to have a surprise party for me. I was actually surprised and it was a great little party. She made my favorite food and we played board games lol. It was honestly perfect in hindsight. Maybe that was the only time I got real effort on my birthday, even though I always do it for everyone around me 🤷🏽‍♀️ but say what.   Anywho, I wanted to wish you a happy birthday in advance and let you know that whether or not people show up for you doesn’t matter as long as you show up for yourself (in general for life I mean). I hope you enjoy not just the day but all the days coming after. Hugs!  [my list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/4BM8Z0ZUFWGN?ref_=wl_share)
It's my birthday!  Tomorrow, the 18th! My happiest birthday memory was probably last year. My cousins and I went to get coffee and then had the best time at a cat cafe! Happy early/belated birthday to all January babies! <3  [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/118XBEQBGJGRM/ref=cm_sw_su_w?ref)
Not entering. I just wanted to wish you a Happy Birthday! My Birthday was on the 11th and I’m 36. 26 is a great number. Cheers to many more years!
It's my birthday! Not today, but I'm turning 20 on Tuesday/19th\~  I think for me my happiest memory might be my 16th birthday. We were visiting relatives for some weddings that were going on before my birthday, but on the day of my birthday everyone decided they were going to go to visit the new in-laws for the day :'D I cried a lot when they told me (I was upset for no reason lol) The next day it was just me, the kids, and my uncle at home, so he ended up taking us to McDonald's for my birthday (the closest one was an hour away) \^\^  I'll be honest the McDonald's birthday did feel a bit childish since I was older, but it was still really nice of my uncle to take us! On Saturday after that we properly celebrated it with the whole family so that was fun since I rarely see them so most birthdays are with less people  This year I think I'll just get cake and play video games all day (after I'm done with classes) since I'm not sure if anyone will visit thanks to COVID 😅  Happy early birthday!

Happy Birthday to everyone in this contest!!  It’s my 25th birthday today! Unfortunately, bad things tend to happen on my birthday, but my favorite memory would be my 18th birthday. It was a Friday and as a senior I only had 3 classes to attend, and all of my teachers had wished me a happy birthday! And one of them had the “class clown” stand on his desk and sing to me lol. I live in a rural town, and we have a theater, but it takes a long time to get new movies out here, I don’t know why. Anyway, my mom and sister picked me up after school and we drove two hours til the next town and had dinner and a movie! We had Port of Subs (fast food sandwich place) and saw the movie Frozen! It was a good time :)  [Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2GL9076GM3C08?ref_=wl_share) :)

I love this! Happy almost birthday friend! And it’s my birthday! Haha. ;) My birthday is January 22nd!   I have two happiest birthday memories. One is from when I was around 5, and it was the first time it snowed on my birthday! My dad surprised me with extra presents, and we played in the snow and made the most epic snowmen! I was so proud of them. I just remember having such a blast playing with my dad all day, lol. The second one is my 15th birthday! I had a couple girlfriends over, and we stayed up late listening to music and hanging out, and my dad pranked us, lol. At one point we had a snack food fight, and my friend threw a chip from across the room right? I kid you not, I caught this chip in my mouth from clear across the room! It was seriously the most randomly epic thing I’ve ever done! Haha. I just remember it being such a fun night.  I love this!! Thanks so much for hosting! :) [List!](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2AS8YDKOUBBB1?ref_=wl_share)

I spy a few yellow things on my wishlist, but these are two options:  I read a book review of [Breath: The Science of a New Art](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0818ZZNLR/?coliid=IFXXCLLP0257V&colid=LW5PLYRJL7QK&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) a couple weeks ago and added it to my  Book List. I'm one of those people who sometimes holds my breath without realizing it when I'm thinking or reading. I think it will be interesting to discover what the science and thinking on breath and breathing shows other than, obviously, you need to do it to stay alive. You wouldn't think a book about breath would be bright yellow would you? But it is.  Another option would be [Pokemon bandages](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BDP3J41/?coliid=IYXG5EJWQZNQZ&colid=3GTBW8ULHQGRI&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) which would be a huge hit with grandkids. They are in my $5 list.

Not what I was thinking, but the world does need more of that! I'll give you a hint, it is on your default list.
It smells like heaven in a bottle and my daughter favorite.

It’s good to stop and enjoy little things that bring happiness and to be grateful for what we all have
I do.   I'm laughing because I'm not a trendsetter and not at all interested in trends. I was being sarcastic.
Oh I’m not either I just do what I like

STROOPWAFELS!!! [waffley caramely goodness!!](https://www.amazon.com/Daelmans-Stroopwafel-Minis-Caramel-5-29/dp/B015JSOXM8/ref=mp_s_a_1_12?dchild=1&keywords=stropwaffles+caramel+dutch&qid=1610907129&sprefix=stropw&sr=8-12)
These [mini stroopwafels](https://www.amazon.com/Daelmans-Stroopwafel-Minis-Caramel-5-29/dp/B015JSOXM8) are SO GOOD!! The thin, sweet waffled cookie is filled with a layer of caramel vanilla-y goodness and they are so addicting!
Congrats on your first contest and thanks for hosting! What a good idea. I'm suggesting that you try [authentic sweet paprika made in Hungary](https://smile.amazon.com/Hungarian-Sweet-Paprika-50gr-1-76oz/dp/B004UU2KXQ/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-nc-drs1_0?cv_ct_cx=Hungarian+paprika&dchild=1&keywords=Hungarian+paprika&pd_rd_i=B004UU2KXQ&pd_rd_r=a35154c2-f2b5-4bf0-9433-b74d1b29c165&pd_rd_w=9QGRS&pd_rd_wg=GmeKG&pf_rd_p=a64002b9-9c26-4361-b8a1-b0f5a4835670&pf_rd_r=GTVNCB3E8V7KCPA8MZWN&psc=1&qid=1610906363&sr=1-1-38d0a374-3318-4625-ad92-b6761a63ecf6) with Hungarian peppers. It has such a bold yet not spicy flavor and will make all your foods taste good. I use it on everything, whether I'm cooking a roast or sprinkling it over popcorn (that's actually my favorite use for it). It's on my Snacks etc. wishlist.
Pocky - [https://www.amazon.com/Glico-Chocolate-Covered-Biscuit-Individual/dp/B01N2PNHXC/ref=sr\_1\_3?crid=2K8V7JFCSQJY5&dchild=1&keywords=poki+stick&qid=1610906644&sprefix=poki%2Caps%2C189&sr=8-3](https://www.amazon.com/Glico-Chocolate-Covered-Biscuit-Individual/dp/B01N2PNHXC/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2K8V7JFCSQJY5&dchild=1&keywords=poki+stick&qid=1610906644&sprefix=poki%2Caps%2C189&sr=8-3)  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  I mean who doesn't love a chocolate covered cookie in stick form?
These are my most favorite snack ever. Gummy peach rings! I’ve loved them all my life. I don’t know how common they are in the US stores but I found them first in Costa Rica. They’re peachy, the perfect amount of sweet, and gummy. You might like them 😊  https://www.amazon.com/Yupik-Ring-Gummies-Peach-Pound/dp/B07TTNDCGN
OOOooOooo I just made a snack list last night! I added [these](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07QTC4825/?coliid=I2IR03RL4QMSM2&colid=2VQU4RZ40H7AR&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) and am so excited to try them! They look yummy and I have loved all the other ones I have tried before! Thank you for the contest! Happy snacking!
While the brand I have in my wishlist is USA based, these [seaweed snacks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YQ7VHYV/?coliid=I3NHW6RBGXZVDU&colid=30W9G825IOETW&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) didn’t originate here and aren’t something you’ll normally find to snack on at the convenient store or gas station. They are super thin but cripsy and they kind of dissolve in your mouth rather than breaking into pieces like a chip. I like them because they are very healthy, not many calories, you can eat a decent amount without feeling guilty, and they taste like the ocean which is my favorite part.   Thanks for the fun contest!   (The ones on my wishlist say there’s only 6 left in stock. If I win and they’re out, I can probably find some more for less than $10. Just let me know)
If you like yummy crunchy wafers, you’ll love [Cocosette](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WH7GFF7/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glc_fabc_wdjbGbES8EJFX?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)! Cocosette is a candy that we eat in Venezuela! It is a crunchy wafer cookie filled with coconut cream and it is like heaven on earth.   Don’t like coconut? That’s okay, I don’t either - but I like Cocosette anyway?! I’m weird. 😂   Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest and allowing me to share some of my culture with you! ✨💛
If you like potato chips, you should try [Prawn Cocktail Crisps](https://smile.amazon.com/Walkers-Prawn-Cocktail-Crisps-25G/dp/B00U9WMVAG/ref=sr_1_3?crid=DF0O9R096YPC&dchild=1&keywords=prawn+cocktail+crisps&qid=1610914793&sprefix=prawn+co%2Caps%2C171&sr=8-3)! I was hesitant at first, I'll admit, but they're actually quite delicious....they don't actually taste like prawns/fish, but I suspect the flavor is more based on "cocktail sauce" - it's slightly sweet and surprisingly addictive!
Not entering because these are too expensive on Amazon [Yummy German "biscuits" cookies](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0005YMAZ4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_nspbGbF1WXY5S) it's a German brand and if you can find them in your local market they're like half price, soooooo good!!!!
If you like sweet & savory combinations, I'd recommend [honey butter chips](https://www.amazon.com/Honey-Butter-Korea-Potato-Snack/dp/B01K9A9V50/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=honey+butter+chips&qid=1610909318&sr=8-3) (Korea)! According to one [review](https://www.thejfg.com/2015/07/21/calbeehoneybutterchip/), they would describe the taste as "eating a baked potato with **sweet** honey butter...the **flavor** was straightforward, but bold in its clarity. SUPER buttery, **sweet**, and **salty"**  And as someone who've tried and fell in love with these, I would second this review!! They described the taste perfectly :D  edit: I understand that it's over $10 so this may not qualify for the contest, but still a great snack nonetheless 😁
This is such a good idea for a contest!   If you like creamy chocolate, you will love these [Twirl chocolate bars. ](https://www.amazon.com/Cadbury-Twirl-Total-British-Chocolate/dp/B07QQLNW1V/ref=mp_s_a_1_16_mod_primary_new?dchild=1&keywords=twirl+cadbury+chocolate+bars&qid=1610928570&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sprefix=twirl+ca&sr=8-16#aw-udpv3-customer-reviews_feature_div)The chocolate has an amazing amazing flakey texture. These are my favorite chocolate bars ever and I wish I could find them in the US.
I absolutely adore kimchee but I couldn't find any under $10. Really, it's an amazing snack food. You can eat it with rice, with meat, but really it's terrific straight out of the jar. I adore it so much but it's not on my list.  So my next favorite is in a completely different taste arena. It's [Strawberry Pocky Sticks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004LYU6QE/?coliid=I2SEN1IXKVUN47&colid=1S58ACXE1Q17Y&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)  These are absolutely amazing too but in the munch and crunch sensation with a bright spot of strawberry sweetness. I like to eat them buy crunching tiny bites all the way down the stick. I rarely but them for myself but they are a favorite snack. They remind me of a crisp biscuit cracker with a glass of strawbetty Nestle's Quick milk.  Yummy for the tummy!
I have this [tamarind candy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000GK068/?coliid=I28SRVZE0XEGEE&colid=2LL0TB8F8FFH7&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) on my list! It's a Mexican candy and it's one of my favorite Mexican candies.  Do you like sweet things? Do you like tangy things? Then you will like tamarind. My mouth literally waters when I think about tamarind. There is nothing else that makes my mouth water like that just from thinking about it.
Not entering, but you should definitely try stroopwafels! Sooo good!
Not entering because I've never left the country, but Louisiana is like its own country... right? Order yourself some pralines (made IN SOUTHERN LOUISIANA) and enjoy yourself a sweet treat :D
I have Cadbury Wispa Chocolate on my “Under $10” list: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074SH5BY1/?coliid=IIU04XHHB6EZ0&colid=2N4ADE9WHK34Q&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it  I heard the European chocolate is a lot better than American chocolate. And this type sounds so good.
I chose u/ricenoddles honey butter chips! Thanks everyone for playing, and thanks for all the great snack suggestions! I can't wait to try all of these!

Yea! I’ve had Obed like that but not the exact one! So I’m excited to try them!
If you like the seaweed in sushi then I’m pretty sure you’ll like these!
These are wonderful: [teriyaki nori strips](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MZYVY0B/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_imm_t1_2MqbGbKSYPFTY) grew up devouring these. Nowadays i just buy the packs of nori snacks at Costco.   *side note: these are an international snack, but where i live, lots of Asian snacks are commonplace and can be found at convenience stores. Does that disqualify them?*
I used the raffler and it picked reese's peanut butter cups but I had polished off a bag a week earlier so I gifted them and bought sweet ginger candy because I'd heard mixed opinions but I liked them. I don't know how I missed your entry I just read it now, they look pretty good would you recommend the sweet or spicy senbei?
AHHH thank you so much!!! I can't wait for you to try them!! They're sooo good 🤤
It’s Korean fermented spicy veggies. Think spicy pickled  cabbage, carrots and bokchoy. Delish!
RIGHT?? This is why I can't have too many of them because they're addicting 😅
Oh, thank you!! They sound awesome! I put them on my wishlist.
You should try the ones i linked above ^^^
Cool! Nope, that doesn't disqualify them. They're still in the running! :)
Oh man! What are the odds of that!?! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣 ginger candy is good 👍 was it gin gins (hard or chewy candy) or like candied ginger? I prefer gin gins to candied ginger.  You probably saw “cracker” and scrolled past. 🤣 anyway. For senbei, i think sweet is better. For arare, savory or spicy is better. ☺️
:D :D
Oooh! That sounds amazing!
my friend had to forcibly take them away from me LMAO
enjoy!!
Cool! 😎 i don’t wanna piggyback on someone else’s entry, so i’ll go enter my own. But, you may also wanna try these [spicy nori rolls](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01M6WOPIE/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glc_fabc_tVqbGbEF9TE1P) So good also 😉
They are chewy individual wrapped liked Werther's, yeah the senbei definitely not like a "cracker" I do eat crackers just too dry sometimes
😂😂
Thanks!
Oooh, okay thanks!
Oh yum! Sounds like gin gins. So good 👍  Yeah, senbei is a whole other kind of “cracker” ☺️ yummy.
No prob! ☺️ I love snacks, so i get carried away 🤭🤫🤣
I totally get that!

[CLOSED] 4:51pm EST  Do you have a face and want a mask to put on it? No, no, not the kind you wear for CoVid. The kind you use to pamper your face.   Rules are simple.  - Have a face  - Have a facemask on your wishlist. *Sheet masks, clay masks, gel masks, or even mask ingredients. They all qualify.*  - Make a top level comment telling me about your favorite face mask, and how you like to do it.   Are you someone who throws a sheet mask on and continues doing your daily tasks? Do you like to spend time mixing your mask up, slathering it on, drinking something nice, closing your eyes and listening to music? Do you like it with friends or alone? **Just tell me how you like it.**  - Summon up to 3 friends.   - Don’t be an eggplant emoji.   Contest ends today when I’m done with my afternoon work tasks.
I have a face so this is for me.   I like to do face masks especially the ones that have exfoliating ingredients.  I Kinda like to feel on my face. I haven’t got any high quality ones that I just go for whatever I can find but I do like the fresh feeling afterwards. Oh I forgot I especially like the peel off ones that feeling is amazing  I’m tagging u/brendaishere u/noimnotsally and u/vexedkitten94
My fave face masks are the Tony Moly Sheet masks! They are delightful and always leave my skin feeling amazing! What about you guys?? u/bobacupcake u/alopez1592 u/PsychologicalPenguin
I love sheet masks so much.  I wear glasses so I can't do much while I'm wearing the mask. I take that time to just relax. I usually will put on a r/letsnotmeet narration video on YouTube and listen while I'm wearing a mask.  My favourite is the Yes To Tomatoes one. I can feel that slight sting/tingle which makes me feel like my zits are really getting zapped!  I also did skin gritting last night with a clay mask. Got a little bit of junk out of my pores.   u/humble_ceiling_fan u/3pmactivities  u/vexedkitten94 do you have a favourite sheet mask?
I love all kinds of face masks, I like to mix it up! My favourite is probably a peel off mask. I have this cucumber one that I really like.   I usually put on a mask and then have a bath or I get cozy in bed and watch a show!   u/late_to_join_reddit u/victoriachiang u/Vindictable do you guys like face masks?
I love clay facemasks! I put one on and do other self care, like shaving, doing my nails, or soaking in an epsom salt bath 💖  u/Salt_Rogue, u/hungupon, u/Lucy_Leigh225 do y'all use facemasks?
Tbh I use alot of mashed up banana and put it on my face to dry up my pimples. I'm one of those people who like to do things while having a face mask on but my husband has told me I need to stop and I'm not going to heal faster if I keep doing things. I have only ever used one sheet face mask and it was from a beautiful card I got from a special person in this group :) I have worn a facemask to the mailbox back home once too lol I typically use clay type ones I wonder if the charcoal one is good? Suggestions are always appreciated.   Anyway u/fictionEF u/hsks23 and u/overthinkee1234 care to join in the face mask fun!
I have a really highly rated clay mask on my wishlist. I’ve never used a mask before, but my face hasn’t felt completely clean in a while and I would love to give it a deep clean so that I feel better. I’ve been too scared to just get a random one from the store cause I know some kinds give some people a red and burning reaction. The kind on my list is something I would have to mix up, so I hope it’s not too hard and a regular bowl and spoon will work. I’ll definitely share it with my mom and Nana cause they could use some pampering too.   u/3pmactivities u/kitty-purrs u/toootired2care
I normally use sheet masks I’ve gotten from an Asian market. I like them cuz I can slap them on and do whatever else around the house for 15-20 min.  I do have a bubble clay mask I’ve been wanting to try I just threw on my list though. I’m very interested in how it feels and how it leaves my skin vs a normal sheet mask.  u/TheGreatTyrant u/ughhhfine u/late_to_join_reddit
hi! i loveeeee hydrating masks! i like to put mine on after a shower. While i have it on, i hop in bed, put on a good show and fold laundry. Once i’m done, i take it off and apply on my neck chest and hands!   thank you for the contest!   i know you like masks too u/haileyh38 u/aviatrixvixen   do you u/bobacupcake?!
I love sheet masks,  I love the chill time when I use one too, a little time to rest and help my skin. My favourite one at the moment is a Garnier honey one. It's so smooth and silky to apply and always makes my skin feel healthier. u/SJRDSJRD bought me an amazing face mask once, and our friendship blossomed! So I am very thankful for face masks (both kinds)
I love hydration masks. Got a really nice granite moisture bomb which just makes me feel great.   I would like to tag a newbie u/Bitter_Joke1589 and  to enter their first contest
I love clay masks so very much they make My face feel so refreshed I like to do one whole Listening to a pod cast.   My favorite is the Aztec clay one I found on Amazon.   u/parrottrolley u/huntfishcamp u/tmrajgray
I love face masks so much.  I just added some to my list that I love, I'm almost out again!  I love to give them as little gifts to friends and coworkers if they're having grumpy days.  Nothing makes me feel quite as happy as putting one on right before bed, chasing the kids around with one on 🤣 or having one on in the bath.    u/uppercasemad knows a lot about skin care, I think!  u/Butterflycm might enjoy them too!  u/Generations18 how about you?
I like sheet masks because they probably require the least amount of work (no rinsing off required). I usually have oily skin but in the winters my skin gets a bit more dry so I like to put on a hydrating sheet mask after getting out of the shower. I also like face masks that help promote clear skin and keep acne away. I just want flawless skin 😭 I usually just lay down for the recommended time of wearing it because otherwise the mask will just fall off.   Do you guys like sheet masks u/josephineismyhero , u/hsks23 , u/megaxxworldxx ?
Oooohhh! I love a nice relaxing face mask!! Typically I like putting on a face mask while either taking a hot bath or binge watching Netflix. If I happen to have an alcoholic beverage in my hand it would make it even better 😜  I tried a sample of an overnight/sleeping mask recently though and I LOVED IT! I woke up to hydrated, soft skin and it was lovely. I want to try some others. So if anyone has any recommendations for reasonably priced sleep masks hit a girl up 😂  Thanks so much for hosting!!!! ❤️  u/megaxxworldxx u/josephineismyhero u/tmrajgray you ladies are definitely more than deserving of a nice relaxing face mask!!
Thats so my boyfriend, he loves to steal my sheet masks. The other day he said dont forget to get masks when we go to the store, and i was like we bought a pack of 50 last day, what happened to them, he was like not the covid ones , the comfortable ones. And i was literally rolling on the floor . I was like since when are you possessed with this ?
I have a face!  And I have undereye masks on my misc. wishlist! (I hope that counts!)  My favorite face masks are the TonyMoly ones! I just love how they make my skin feel and the variety of different kinds there are.  I like to sleep with my sheet mask on! Is that weird? 😂 I feel like that way I absorb EVERYTHING.  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
I love face masks. My favorite brand is Freeman clay masks because I like to play with the clay although I also have sheet masks. I put them on and then wait. I find it’s a nice relaxation method for me then. I’ve gotten my BFF to do them with me sometimes. She’s finally coming around.
I've never tried one, wouldn't know where to begin! ☹
Thank you for the tag! 😀
Hello thank you for the tag I will say that I've never used to face mask in my life maybe I should try them
Thanks for the tag! I love face masks they’re the best
I'm not a huge face mask user because I already have pretty good skin, but I have this gel stuff that hardens into a cucumber mask and it's very refreshing
ooh any mask with aloe in it is nice, it smells lovely and softens the skin really well! 🌸💗
Tell me more about “skin gritting”?
I already commented but I like the ones that peel off slowly. Feels so great 😂
Thank you for the tag! My favorites are super moisturizing gel masks (because of my dry skin during the winter) or the black pore masks (because I like looking at the gross gunk from my pores afterwards lol). 🤣
I never actually tried a face mask before 😅
Obsessed.  With facemasks. ❤️❤️❤️
Hey sadfacenobody!!! Hiiiiii!!! Thanks for thinking of me!! I’m not a face mask person but my mom sometimes forces it on me LOL I’m actually pretty grateful when she does bc my face really needs the attention! Whoops heheh I really need to take better care of my skin!!
I like them but have such a huge collection 🤣
GIRL I LOVE FACE MASKS. I’m into skincare. My BFF is into makeup. Between the two of us, we should have great face routines but instead we haven’t combined our knowledge lmao
I love Rhassoul clay for drying up deep acne. It’s really fantastic. You can mix it with oils or essences that you like, or just with water.
I’ve done the banana peels many times! 😉 Now i gotta try the mashed banana 🤔 i like the clay ones too. I’ve only tried a couple of those preset pouched ones, they are so weird. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣  Yeah, please listen to him and take it easy... i know us Polynesians are stubborn and can’t sit still, but you need to get some rest, at least. 😘
Ohh I like this thanks for the summons!
I would also like to try the bubble mask. I sent some of these as a gift recently and she posted a photo. It was hilarious! u/Gwinblayd, what did you think of those?
Thanks for thinking of me, Kitty-purrs!!! I’m so not a face mask person but I really should be!! My facial skin is going downhill super fast!!! Aging sucks!! lol
masks are awesome, i really like the aloe ones! 🌸💗
Thatagirl!! ♥️ masks are always awesome!
Thank you for the summons 😍
I LOVEEEEE FACEMASKS!!! 😹
Yaint got a wishlist link!    I lol’d at chasing the kids around in a mask.
I actually suck at face masks lol. Does anybody have any good recommendations?
Sorry I missed this, i was napping. But I enjoy a good face mask about once a month. I get a kick out of the pore cleaning ones, and LOVE the moisturing ones.
You should totally put some on your list!
Can you believe I have never tried a mask??
Thanks for the tag friend! I love masks! :)
An overnight one sounds cool,  I would like waking up to good skin
Thanks for the tag friend! :)
Ha hahahaha lol that’s so funny.
Yep, those count. Those are my favorite kind. To put on after slathering a chlorophyll mask on. Primo!
You take an oil cleanser and cleanse/massage your face for a few minutes and then rinse with warm water. Next, apply a clay mask for 10-15 minutes. Wash that off.  Finally, massage the oil cleanser again for a few minutes, a bit harder (but don't scrub or be really rough!). Rinse with warm water again. You should see "grits" coming out of your pores. Little black bits. YMMV depending on your black head situation. I didn't see a ton of grits, but there were definitely some. My face is so soft today now!
Yes! Those are so satisfying!
I love looking at all that junk too lol.
You should! They feel nice and it's relaxing :)
Me too! I can never have enough of them haha ❤
Haha aww 😂 I love the feel of my skin after a nice face mask :)
That's fair 😂 I just know you, like me, could benefit from some self care right now 💖
Get on up in this contest, then ❤️
I have alot of issues with black heads on my nose they are really deep deep. I had one of those sucker things but didnt do anything lol
No problem!
I absolutely loved them! They made my face sooo soft and hydrated. Plus it felt really cool while the bubbles were coming up, lol.
Ohh I didn’t know they made them in sheet form. I love her pic though! It’s amazing!
It does! I’ve been trying to stay ahead of it but I think it’s winning 🙃
Who me? What now?   Haha, in this house they're called baby frighteners.
I like the sheet masks that have aloe, the ones on my list are good and the ones from the body shop are too!  Just slap it on for 10, peel off and enjoy your baby soft face!
Currently looking for some. I actually had some on there before but recently got them for Christmas.
Whats stopping you?!!
Gasp!
He even stole the one you sent with the toaster. I went to the bathroom, and i found it in the dustbin. I asked him did you use that too. He replied you can keep the toaster to yourself, let me atleast use this🤣🤣
Whaaat. I use oil cleanser already so I can do this right now! How cool, thanks for sharing that.
I’ll try one soon!
It does feel nice, doesn’t it?! lol and yetttttttt I still don’t do it 😂😂😂 I think I will this week!
Absolutely! You deserve it after your treadmill session!
Just entered! Thanks for the tag!
Have you tried fruit enzymes or lactic acid? That will soften the blackhead material so it can be more easily removed, and with continued use you should see some good prodgress. I use the lactic acid to help unglue dead skin because I’m aging and I don’t want that dead skin pile up to speed up scars or wrinkles. Lactic acid is more gentle than glycolic acid but you can use either or use the first then work up to the next, The Ordinary brand makes great product for super reasonable prices. I use quite a number of their products (they only make single ingredient products so you can target your regimen with only exactly what you need) and am very happy with them. It’s a Canadian company and they use very high quality ingredients. You can go to their website and send an email, explaining your skin type and issues, and they’ll have a person email you back with a list of exactly which products and in what order are meant for you. I found their products hugely confusing before sending that email, but they helped me make great sense out of it all.
My friend swears by those Boscia pore strips and black mask for blackheads. I haven’t tried it, but i should.
Do you feel a big difference? I wonder if I used one every day for a month if my skin would improve! I keep seeing in one of the skincare forums that some sort of prescription cream or moisturizer or something is the best? I have no idea when it comes to skincare lol
Now it’s there 😂
LOL what a hilarious term for them? Clever and hilarious.
Oooh, I'll have to raid your list when I get back home.
Oooh. I’ve only used the TONYMOLY sheet masks but they were pretty lovely. They have so many kinds too.
It is kind of a thing that slipped through the cracks😄
I know. Blasphemy🤣
HOW RUDE. That was for you, not him! Tell him he now owes you one, and if he wants masks he can join RAOA and get his own. Boys are ridiculous.
You're welcome! Let me know how it goes. I was nervous about using an oil cleanser as it sounded counter intuitive. But I might be a convert now!
I was dying 🤣
That sounds really great! I'll have a look into it. I dont typically have issues with pimples but I have since having my mirena removed but this is great advice thank you! 💕
I’m not that great at skin care. I use those sheet masks maybe 1x a week. They’re supposed to be super hydrating and I don’t wanna overdue it. I wash with noxema, and then go over my face with witch hazel. I also use a moisturizer with sunscreen. But there’s so many products out there it’s hard to know what you really need for your skin!
Weird.  I didn't touch it.  Who knows, the internet is angry today I'm finding.  I wonder what I did to make it so mad?
❤️
YES! I loveee tonymoly sheet masks! I probably have more than enough sheet masks but I just can’t resist the cute packaging and all the different varieties
Nah. But if you’d like to try one, hows a good time.   It’s sort of like putting a targeted moisturizer that can’t evaporate quickly on your face and letting it sit. Some feel sticky afterward, some just make ya feel glowy and soft. I make peel off ones with gelatin and herb infusions, or mix up clays and carrier oils. Sheet masks move easily though so those are nice when you can sit still and just relax.
🤣🤣
Yea it’s pretty amazing for me. I use the Innisfree oil cleanser with apple seed. Holy grail stuff. That brand has been phenomenal for me, and it’s the only cleanser brand that’s never irritated or broken me out. Korean skincare is light years better than anything in the US.
I don’t generally have any acne, but I do look kind of dry, and haggard when I haven’t exfoliated. Lactic acid is just a great exfoliation for the things on your skin that you want off.
It gets too overwhelming for me LOL
I've seen some videos where they look like they are pulling people's skin off, intense!
Yes! Anytime I hear of some new skin care product or method, if it's Korean I'll try it.
I’ve tried one of those. Elizavecca Hell Pore does it 😂 Its so awful.
I'd be afraid to pull my nose off my damn face🤣

u/supermarvelous310 Terii! These stabby thingies look super legit. This is the most forceful force gift I’ve ever received and I will try my best to use the force for good! I honestly thought these were nsfw at first but I’m glad you explained them to me. 😂 Thank you for thinking of me and my safety! ❤️
What are those used for?
love this!
I also thought they were NSFW and.... while I’m not into that sort of thing anyway.... I couldn’t imagine how that would be pleasant. 👀  But then I realized they were self defense 😅
You're gonna have to explain them to me as well, is it like a self defense weapon?
why am I slightly shocked many don’t know what this is 😂 but I’m loving the pun “FORCEFUL FORCE GIFT”.  hey hey I told you it can look like it but it isn’t 😉. I would warn you... maybe 🐣
Self defense
This is relevant to sharpening pencils to get that super, super sharp point to poke your friend with... just permanent lol.
Yea, they are
How are they used?

i LOVE the sandman series
u/ssmith71608 Thank you so much for this graphic novel. The art is beautiful and the stories are quintessential Gaiman. I am about halfway through it (I started reading it last night) and so far, I am loving it. I don’t know if you enjoy Gaiman’s graphic novels, but if you do, I highly recommend this one! So far, it is one of my favorites. Death is such an charming character. Thank you again!
This is an awesome graphic novel, and I absolutely love that cover art!
This was my nickname in high school. She is my favorito
Me too!
You’re welcome! I may get a copy for myself. It sounds delightful. 😊

ATLA is the best!!
Is that the second book? It was soooo good!!!
waaoh that is so so awesome!! 💗💗💗
You’ll get there!    You have patience girl! I teach middle school/high school for I don’t have that patience. 😂😂 I can be politely sarcastic with the older kids, they get it and make comebacks. I love that part! Plus when they get in trouble they usually own up to it in the older grades.   I hope you end up in a wonderful district and enjoy teaching! I know it can be challenging, especially in the beginning, but you will get the hang of it after your first full year when everything is second nature.
Thank you so so much u/cme423 you truly honestly brightened my whole day maybe even my whole week haha. I had been wanting this book so much since it came out but just couldn't justify it. I definitely know how I'll be spending my free time for awhile! Thank you! (Also please excuse the crazy hair haha).
Isn't it though?? Ahhh it is hands down my favorite show of all time
It is! I'm so excited to read it! I need to finish the book I'm on first but then it's getting devoured haha
This is cme423 , I need to sync these two usernames somehow, I’m still new to this. 🤪 You are more than welcome! You are my first gift ever on this sub.  I hope you enjoy it!  Honestly, seeing you so happy just made my day!! Thanks from one teacher to another!! 😃
Oh no did I thank the wrong person? I was going based off the note I actually never got notified for the gifted post so I was extra super surprised haha. And I am so excited to read it. I have another book I was reading that I'm almost done with so I'll probably start it in a few days or wait until the weekend haha. Thank you again and sorry if I thanked the wrong person.  Also what grade do you teach?
You thanked the right person. I signed it with my old username (the one I use for redditgifts). It was my mistake, I had messaged someone from the other site right before I sent yours and confused them. 😬🤪😂  I am a high school teacher, 9-12th grade math. When the generator pulled up your name I read your introduction and thought how perfect my first gifting is to another teacher!
Oh I see haha I'm sure stuff like that happens all the time. Full disclosure I am currently only a sub because of covid I couldn't finish my credential program and am hoping to finish up my student teaching in the fall. I can't wait though and right now I am loving getting the hands on experience even if it is a little complicated right now because of everything. You are brave to teach high school haha. I'm definitely getting a job in elementary if I can once my credential is done hopefully 4th or 5th grade but we'll see what jobs are available haha.

CONTEST CLOSED WINNER PICKED SOON,  So this is my first official contest hopefully I’m doing it right.  I wanted to join in on all the fun. Been a member for a few weeks now and everybody has been so awesome and cool to chat with. I wanted to do a contest and I’ve finally come up with one.  So as you know (and if you didn’t know) I have recently started picking up and taking lessons for acoustic guitar. I come from a family of local musicians. My grandad aunts and uncles had a jazz band until he passed and my 99 year old uncle still plays the saxophone to this day. I always wanted to play ether guitar or piano but decided ultimately on guitar because it was my mom who passed away dream to play and although she never got the chance to learn I have the old guitar she bought and planned to learn on.  So all that said here is my question  1 what instrument do you play?  2 if you don’t play an instrument, what instrument would you like to learn?  3 any tips tricks or helpful advice for a beginner like myself just learning to help moving forward  I’ll pick someone to gift to by tomorrow morning. US only for now thanks   Please link list as I am doing this on my mobile  Be kind and upvote each other to show love
Congrats on your first conest! I am just not musical and don't play anything, but always thought I'd like to play the handpan drum. I heard someone playing it in a park once and it just sounded so magical! My husband plays guitar and he says one tip is to just be patient because it takes time to learn, so don't be hard on yourself if you aren't amazing right away.   Thanks for the contest!

Thanks for the contest! I hope your lessons are harmonious and leave you feeling accomplished!  1. I played flute. 2. I would love to learn piano. 3. Practice, practice, practice!  [Wish List](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2W6CHFQSXY0M?ref_=wl_share)
Thanks for the contest! I played trumpet for a few years and got decent. Id love to learn violin. I actually have one, but am just so overwhelmed trying to teach myself. My tip would be to learn to sight read music if you can't.  Eta [Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3SJXYVRMYUCH1?ref_=wl_share)
Congratulations on your first contest!  I play the piano and I also play handbells/chimes. I've dabbled in acoustic guitar, electric base, and tuba as well.   When it comes to learning a new instrument, remember that anything can be learned, but you have to crawl before you walk and walk before you run. Set realistic goals for yourself and don't skip practicing scales and arpeggios. I know it's more fun to skip straight to full pieces, but you gotta learn the controller before you can be any good at playing the game.   Depending on the instrument you are trying to learn, color coding your sheet music can be very helpful as well! If you have questions about that specific to the instrument you are learning, please feel free to DM me and I'll help brainstorm how you can apply it.

I *used* to play the Electric Guitar in High School. Sadly I got married straight out of HS to an abuser and consequentially stopped playing. I tried picking it up again after getting a divorce, but I realized rather quickly that a few mental disorders (namely my anxiety and slightly my CPTSD) were preventing me from re-learning the trade. I can play a little up until I start getting anxious, and then I continually mess up; I can't seem to focus when anxious. I want to try overcoming my anxiety in order to play again. Believe me, I miss it so much! I really do!
I play guitar and bass and drums. I recommend learning scales and chords. Working on fingering the right positions is important and forming callouses and muscle memory of those formations.
1. I am a jack of all trades master of nine when it comes to instruments. Flute. Piano. Clarinet. Saxophone. Base clarinet. Veyella. Violin. Mandolin. And singing.   3. Experiment. Seriously though. Okay with things until you find the one that calls to you.   [a wishlist ](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/11FDGVCVAGF7H?ref_=wl_share)
1. I'd love to learn how to play the flute.  2. Practice. Practice until your good and then practice until you hate the song.   [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1ZDUE43H92KKB?ref_=wl_share)
Wow 99 and playing the sax! Not entering as not from US but want to share 😊  I can play the piano, but since I've moved out I haven't had a chance to practice without one. As a child I played the cello too.  I'm pretty poor at sight reading and relied so much on muscle memory in my fingers to play pieces. So I recommend you to keep practicing sight reading - even better if you don't have to read the notes and think "oh that's a G" and then find G on the piano/guitar. Better to associate the note straight to the hand position. Hope that make sense!
I play the piano and used to play the clarinet. I feel like the first thing you need to learn is the keys or chords depending on the instrument. Once you know these you need to learn things like how long to hold a note or things like getting louder or softer, faster or slower. I was not very good at the clarinet but I really love the piano and found it relaxing to play. [my list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/D0ED3F0T4VXC?ref_=wl_share)
I tried teaching myself guitar when I was younger but I lacked the discipline to stick with it 😩 I was also in orchestra in 4th grade and played the violin. I absolutely loved it but due to crappy budget cuts at the school, they had practice during recess. As you can imagine, that didn’t sit well with most kids, and by the end of the year it was just me and one other girl. The other girl didn’t want to continue the next year, so there was no 5th grade orchestra. When I went to middle school, they said I had to have had both years of orchestra to continue 😡 I really wish I could have continued with it through private lessens. I often think about trying to pick it up again.   My advice would be to stick with it and practice a lot. You seem to come from a musically inclined family, so I think you’ll have no problem picking up on it!   I’m also super amazed at your uncle still able to play sax at that age. Go him!   Thanks for the contest!   [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3UPFGP0VHUQQ?ref_=wl_share)
Hello! Congrats on your new hobby! I used to play piano, but stopped after a few years. If I were to pick up an instrument again I would want to learn how to play the banjo. I love how it's an instrument that can change the whole vibe of a song. Like Mumford & Sons without the banjo is just boring. But the banjo makes the songs come to life. My musical tip for you would be to make time to practice every day! Even if you only have 5 minutes to spare, it is better than nothing!   [Here](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1BVB8G71MFKBJ?ref_=wl_sharev) is my wishlist, and thank you for the contest!
I think you will really enjoy learning guitar! I also play acoustic and electric guitar. I’ve been playing for about 10 years. Unfortunately, I haven’t been practicing nearly as much as I should anymore.   My best piece of advice is to try and play a little bit every day. Even if it’s just 5 minutes. It’s so easy to get out of the habit, especially once you feel like you’ve learned a lot. It’s important to stay consistent. It also will come as a form of stress release :)
I went to an elementary school that was famous for music, but I can't play any instruments unfortunately. I would like to learn how to play the drums. There are many free resources online like YouTube.   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3SMGYP8PVEXZ5?ref_=wl_share
I play the guitar as well! I highly recommend Marty music on YouTube! He’s amazing and such a great teacher! [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2Y59YGF7YB3WC?ref_=wl_share)
1&2. I used to play clarinet, for three years but I want to play guitar  3. Watch YouTube videos! Also "hot cross buns" is a simple song to learn for most instruments  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1428Q483KXEE3?ref_=wl_share
1/2: I used to teach myself piano. I'd like to  start again.  I have it here,  and some beginner practice books but I honestly cannot find the motivation tp sit down and practice again.  I don't know why, I had so much fin with it when I played before.   3: I did my best practice when I was consistent. Practice every day,  even if it's only 15 minutes.  And while it's fun to play it is also a lot of work on your brain.  Reading the music, translating what you read to movements that make the sound, cpnsgantly remembering  which note is played how,  all while listening to be sure it sounds right... It's work.  So don't be afraid to take breaks or have some shorter practice sessions. Don't be afraid to go back and re-play easier pieces sometimes. Do what you must to keep it fun, and let your mind rest,  otherwise you will burn out and not enjoy it as much. It will make practice easier to stick to.   Good luck, have fun!  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2OBSCQ38RW8I5?ref_=wl_share
Congrats on the first contest! I can play some percussion, primarily djembe and cajón. I accidentally taught myself how to play because I'm really into video games and played so much of the game Rock Band while in high school. The game trained me on how to keep rhythm independently with hands and feet as well as gave me an ear for beats. I've never had much experience on an actual drum kit, but I've been able to keep up other percussions well enough to still play regularly for my church band on Sundays :)  I know almost nothing about music when it comes to reading music or keys or chords or anything, so my best advise would just be to keep working on rhythm. Try to keep a steady tapping beat while listening to a whole song (simple enough) and then do it again but add in a second counter beat, THEN do it again with those too and add in some kicks. Grabbing anything to bang on like pots and pans can be a fun way to practice and learn what sounds good.  [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2X0P3KVA3HGJP?ref_=wl_share)
Hi! It’s exciting to learn an instrument!  So I play the piano and drums and have kind of been learning the guitar (but I stopped when it came time to learn bar chords lol). Anyway, one thing I highly recommend is to try to learn things that you love to play. Learn your favorite song on it! Learn a fun tune! Some people just focus on learning exercises and etudes but you learn better if you love what you’re doing!
I used to play trombone in high school. I haven't played since, and I'm not sure if I still remember how. The best tip I can give you is to never stop playing. I wish I hadn't stopped.    [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2C27S36776I42?ref_=wl_share)
I don't play an instrument, but I did have the chance to take a few guitar lessons as a kid. I had to stop, but would have loved to have been able to continue playing! I really think I would have enjoyed it, but for whatever reason, life had different plans.   The only advice I have, is to make sure you stay in a place where you can enjoy the music. Don't ever let it become work!   [wish list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1Q0348RYYQO6Z?ref_=wl_share)
I use to play the piano. I had to stop the lessons because my parents got busy. I would say it's all about practice. I was pretty bad at it but I practiced everyday. Naturally it comes to you and you wouldn't need a music sheet. And enjoy the flow of the music across your body as well. You can add a lil spunk to your performance through your body. Even though I'm not a musician, I absolutely admire their talent, and love seeing symphonies and orchestras. Thanks for hosting!

1. A lot. My primaries are cello and tenor recorder.   2.  But I’d still like to learn piano.   3.  Practice. Every day. Even if you can only get 10 minutes in. Make sure you build up your muscle memory. And your brain memory.  Edit: [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/38TVM8K6SO74Y?ref_=wl_share)
I hope you're enjoying your guitar lessons!!!  I don't play an instrument but I've always been interested in playing either the guitar or piano. It would be nice to actually learn one day. I mean, I can play smoke on the water on the guitar but that's it 🤣   Since I don't play an instrument I don't have much advice for you but I will say...stick to it!!!! Just keep practicing. Set a daily or weekly goal of how much time you want to dedicate to practicing/lessons and commit to it!!  Thanks for hosting!!! Have a great day!!
I have a ukulele and I'm dreadful at it! I thought it would be a good beginner instrument, when really I want to play guitar. I enjoy singing, even just in my car :)  My husband plays bass, and used a lot of online tools and video. And just plugged away at it every day, even if he only has 5 minutes, so just keep practicing!  [list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/K569SKGXAREL?ref_=wl_share)
My family all played an instrument growing up. I picked flute. My kid tried it for a year since I still had mine, but then gave it up. Last year she started teaching herself ukulele. She likes that much better. It is all about the practice and connection I think.  https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B08925PDN4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_NMebGb5504S14?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

I used to play piano because I wanted to make music! Wish I could continue it but lessons are an investment I can’t afford right now. I hope you get to learn an instrument you love soon 💕 all the best :D  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/YNK11TYESXYM?ref_=wl_share
I have played recorder, piano, and guitar. I don't play any of those anymore, but a couple weeks ago my housemate pulled out her guitar and I got to play a couple songs, it was nostalgic! If I ever get to retire I may take it up again.  Tips: pick a couple of your favorite songs and learn them! If it's a super complicated song to play, find an easy version of the chords (they are probably out there) and play that, but make it a goal to be able to play the complicated version. You'll feel so accomplished when you can play all those power chords and finger-picking instrumentals.

Hi Friend! Congrats on picking up a new instrument!   I played French Horn in middle school, violin in elementary school and have since taught myself how to play piano. I'm not amazing but I love playing and I love making music.   my only advice would be to Practice, Practice, Practice! Don't get distracted and give up like I did. Once you get it , you'll be a pro before you know it. I have a friend who's never given up his dream of being a rock star lol, but he knows everything about guitars and really loves challenging himself and I think once you get there you'll be obsessed! I'm excited to see where you go with it :) Congrats!   [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1GGXE887TDO20?ref_=wl_share)
I don’t play an instrument, but I would like to learn how to play the piano! I’ve been listening to beautiful music performed on the piano and it has inspired me to learn.

https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/MUN3KTE8KP4Y?ref_=wl_share  I used to play trumpet and saxophone, but haven't for years.  My best advice to a newbie is play music you enjoy.  Then it won't seem tedious!
I always wanted to play acoustic guitar! So I actually bought one and when Covid slows down and work slows down a little I’m going to learn! Good for you and hope the learning goes well!   [wl](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2F7L0SAH3GLPW?ref_=wl_share)
I played piano for a while in high school cause i took a couple classes. I didn’t practice much at home though cause I only had a keyboard and it just wasn’t the same. Then I graduated and moved away for college and when I finally had time to play again I had forgotten a lot and just couldn’t do it right. And idk where to relearn fingering.  My advice is play every day when you can and never get discouraged enough to quit. Just keep working on it and one day you’ll do it right and then again and again until you can officially play the song.    https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/30W9G825IOETW?ref_=wl_share  Thanks for the contest!
1. I play the piano and clarinet, and as of this summer, I can play a mean recorder :p  3. I made this mistake when I was younger, but don’t overlook fundamentals. Without them, you’ll be setting yourself up for failure down the line.   Also, not sure how applicable this is for guitar, but if there’s a pair of notes or part of a lock that’s giving you some trouble, or just a little rougher than the rest, don’t brush over it.   As my high-school band director said, “make it your bitch”. Practice it two notes at a time. Practice it faster and slower than written. Practice it legato/staccato. Practice it with different note lengths. If you can play it in all of these wacky ways, the normal will be easier by comparison.   Most importantly, don’t forget to play music that you like. Lots of people I know lost interest after playing classical pieces over and over again. If there’s a song you like, try to learn it. Don’t make music a chore!  Good luck!!!

I’m so glad you are learning to play the guitar in honor of your mother.  What a beautiful thing to do for her.   I don’t play any instruments. I’d love to play either the piano, because it would be most useful for me at my church, or the violin because it sounds so beautiful.   Once my daughter is a little older I’m going to put her in piano lessons. She really wants to learn now but she is only 4 and can’t read yet. But soon!   Good luck with learning your new hobby/skill! Thanks for the contest! [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2V0AE6R80B0FP?ref_=wl_share)
That’s amazing that you are learning to play guitar for your Mom. What a lovely way to honor her!   I don’t play an instrument, but took piano in high school and I loved it! I loved the sound and how almost powerful it made me feel while playing, if that makes sense.  I think the only advice I can give you is to not get discouraged. I’m the type of person who can get frustrated that I’m not good at something and then want to give up. But keep pushing through, keep practicing, and you WILL be great! And don’t put too much pressure on yourself. The fact that you’re doing this is awesome!   Thanks for hosting. ☺️ [Wishlist!](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/11C0MQ6JE1OTV?ref_=wl_share)
Ohh, I love this! So exciting that you are learning guitar! My partner plays guitar, has for 14 years or so now, and it always amazes me how amazing he is at it! Haha. He’s actually about to start teaching one of his younger teenage brothers how to play. He’s really excited about it, I think it’s going to be really cool. Good luck on your musical journey! You got this!!   1. I used to play piano! I’ve forgotten a lot of it now, but we had a piano keyboarding class in elementary school, and I was always a couple books ahead of the class. Plus, both my grandparents had pianos, so I’d play there too! My daughter actually got a little keyboard for Christmas, so we’ve been having fun with me teaching her some of the easier little songs I remember, lol.  2. Like I said, I don’t really play piano anymore now, but I did always want to learn guitar! My partner has taught me a few little things, but the left brain/ right brain of it is really tricky for me, lol. It’s such a cool instrument though!  3. My partner said learn chords, learn scales, and learn songs you like, lol. He’s been saying how he wishes he had learned scales and things when he first started. He taught himself, and didn’t have YouTube to help at the time, so he didn’t know about a lot of stuff like that. It’s so helpful in just understanding how it works on a hit more technical level. He’s also talked before about how when you’re new or when you start playing again after a while you have to build the calluses back up on your finger tips. The more you play the quicker they will form. So when you’re first learning you kind just have to push through the discomfort for the first couple weeks until that happens. Don’t hurt yourself or anything, lol, but it is a thing to know. And most importantly, from me, just believe in yourself, keep practicing, and don’t give up! You got this!! :)  Thanks for hosting! This is awesome! [List!](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2AS8YDKOUBBB1?ref_=wl_share)
Music is so exciting! I come from a family of cello players! My grandparents met while playing for their city's Orchestra as first chair sharers!  I don't play any instruments, but I am a vocalist! I am a contralto! I want to learn how to play the double bass or the saxophone. The DB just sounds... amazing. Learn as much as you can! I have a hearing disorder that wasn't diagnosed until I was 25! I used my ability to pick up on notes by listening to sounds and not looking at notes, because to me none of that matched up. Now I'm in a professional music fraternity and I want to branch out in my musicality and I can't read sheet music.

Music is a great and wonderful thing. I'm glad that you're willing to learn an instrument.  1. I play Bass Guitar, Guitar, Clarinet/Bass Clarinet and Trombone 2. I would like to learn Saxophone. 3. LEARN SONGS YOU LIKE! Learning songs you like will make you more willing to learn it. You shouldn't be forced to learn a song you hate. Also, take your time, practice, learn some chords and take breaks so you don't get a Repetitive Stress Injury(RSI) or Tendonitis.

Handspan drum is cool you should totally do it lol   Thanks for entering
Yea I love the piano as well. I’m practising alright so far so good
Practice seems to be the most consistent and practical advise. I’m taking it to heart
I’m taking lessons over zoom and my teacher is teaching me to read music as well :)
I play the violin. I’d be willing to help you over video chat. Feel free to DM me
Thanks for entering I might take you up on your offer for help sometime!
A jack of all trades!!
Wow that’s impressive!
Haha! I was just about to write that I play piano and clarinet
That’s actually my teachers method of teaching. I’ve only had like 4 lessons but we are doing a little of everything.  Sight reading, some Spanish song I can’t pronounce scales and a Demi Lovato song off one of her earlier albums that I chose called Don’t Forget.  She’s keeping me busy and I’m trying to soak it all in like a sponge.
You can still play. Many communities have concert bands you can join. You’d just have to rent a trombone, or maybe buy a cheap student horn if that’s affordable to you. I just learned to play trombone for my concert band!
That’s actually really good advice thanks.
Maybe someday I will!
I wish I did when learning guitar but I was very young and did not understand the importance.
Thats so kind of you!! I'll definitely keep you in mind for if I'm able to find time. Thank you so much for offering!!
I'd be happy to help! What instrument are you currently learning?
And master of none 😂
Sorry I meant none. Lol. I just messed around a lot
Very cool! Well keep to it and you’ll be a pro in no time :)
Thank you for the encouragement! That is a great idea!
Of course!!!
Acoustic Guitar 🎸
😂😂😂 hey you can’t win them all
Nice! Yeah, scales and chords exercises are gonna be your best friend right now :)
Big facts! I'm pretty good at handbells, but I haven't had a piano in my house for a decade, so those skills have suffered

I hope the world comes to a point that we don't have to wear them.
I hope the same thing.  Even more than the masks, I hope enough people get vaccinated.  I'm not holding my breath, though...
I hope we never wear one after we find the cure
My hope as well!
That is my hope and dream also!
You're very welcome.
That’s amazing! As an organ recipient I love masks. Thank you for caring about others.
I’m an organ recipient. I started wearing them before America heard of Covid. I’m going to wear them long after.
That would come after everyone wears one sadly
Alot of people wore masks before the pandemic. Including Asians from just protecting themselves and others from the flu it's ironic how people use to laugh at them  .
Then what's the point of social distancing and locking down?   How often do you reuse that mask? Do you ever wash it in a hospital grade washing machine? If not then the mask doesnt work.   It's sad that people like you think "omg if everyone would just do what I want them to do I could be happy"   The virus ain't going anywhere even if everyone wore a mask.   If you are that worried about what everyone else is doing you should buy yourself a respirator that has replaceable filters. That would protect you from others no matter if they have a mask on or not
You must be an antivaxxer too huh
the point of social distancing, the lockdowns and the masks isn’t to make the virus go away. it’s to help flatten the curve, so the hospitals don’t get overrun again. do your research! ;)
I hope you have a good day

Hello everyone! I wanted to really quickly say thank you to everyone that reached out to me this weekend and all those that tagged me in different contests and discussions.   I have been very overwhelmed and stressed by work this past month and also have been just. .in general down. So . I decided this weekend to completely step away from EVERYTHING. I didnt work, I didnt get on any social media or reddit, and I just spent time on me. I do apologize for not responding to tags or messages until now but I actually made my husband hide my phone for teh majority of the weekend lol.   Overall, it was a success I think. I was able to do a HUGE reorganizing of our place, I played a bunch of video games and watched some TV. I read some and I just, in general, took a break from everything. The kids were also with a relative this weekend so the entire weekend, I cooked nothing lol.   I am fully back now and I think I am in a better place for it. Thank you, everything, for being amazing!   &#x200B;  u/late_to_join_reddit thank you for tagging me in different posts and for all of your interactions with me! Also, I didnt know that that subreddit was there!!!  u/hungupon Thank you for the tags and for thinking of me!   &#x200B;  And everyone else that sent me a message, responded to some of my older messages. .everything.  (also all the people that sent me a TON of snaps  hahah)
GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS IM GETTING A COVID VACCINE ON WEDNESDAY!!! IVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXCITED TO BE STABBED!
QOTD: Lately? Mac n cheese. Why is Bunny having mac for breakfast? because she’s with her husband’s family and her mother isn’t there to shame her into eating peasant’s breakfast ;)  TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!! This is the birthday I wanna brag about, because now, I can shamelessly order 2 for 1 margs at Chili’s, and as per family tradition, going to a casino! Yay for 21st!
Good morning everyone! Let’s see brewed coffee, on my 2nd cup. Clipped all my printed out coupons. Hoping it warms up soon so I can finish weeding the carpet of weeds that has built up in the back yard. Going to have to transplant my chocolate mint soon the water roots are growing nicely. Making surf and turf breakfast for dinner tonight. Might make murder cookies idk.   QoTD: a good stuffed French toast with yummy cream cheese filling and mixed berries.
Morning.  Feeling a little down, I didn't get the job I applied for so feeling kind of bummed. It's still snowing here,  so another day inside of coloring and diamond painting.  How are you doing?   Hope you all have a wonderful day.

Happy Sunday!!!  Today was a good day for a 1.2 mile walk, I've got a corned beef brisket slow cooking in the stove, and I'm grading all the math tests. I'm super thankful that this is a three day weekend!!!  I hope everyone is having a magical, restful day ✨  QOTD: Egg bites! I make mine with bacon and mushrooms or sausage and spinach
Good morning <3  I haven't been around a lot, and when I have.. I've been mopey and sad and whiny about missing my bf. I want to apologize for that.  qotd: breakfast sandwich. sausage, cheese, english muffin. *Maybe* egg, depending on my mood (I very, very rarely enjoy eggs)
Hi friends!!! Hope everyone is having a restful/relaxing/amazing sunday! ❤️❤️❤️ so much love for this wonderful community!
Hi everyone!   The snow is already gone :(  I'm back at my dad's, ready for another week of babysitting!  Qotd: Toast with slices of boiled egg
Happy Sunday,  Don’t forget to WEAR A MASK. & STAY INSIDE (if possible)♥️
Y’all. I did a thing today  [Marci ](https://imgur.com/a/TDJSer5)
Good morning! I've got coffee, so I'm happy. I'm not sure what I'll be doing today, other than watching the Browns game. Very excited!!😁  QoTD: French Toast
Good morning everyone! Today I think I'm going to spend time working on drawing things I usually avoid drawing (hands, feet, backgrounds maybe?) and journalling some more. That's quickly become a pass time that I do quite a lot now. Later, my dad and I are going to watch Attack on Titan together. He's started watching anime with me, and it makes me super happy. So far he's watched My Hero and Fullmetal Alchemist. :) I'm glad we have something to bond over like that. I'm going to take him to a convention when things go back to normal! <3  I hope you all have a great day today. Remember, someone loves you! <3  qotd: Definitely waffles, coffee cake, and tea!
Hi! New to the sub. Hope everyone is enjoying their Sunday. I've mostly been lazing around drinking coffee and watching YouTube before getting into "extreme cleaning mode".   &#x200B;  QOTD: Pancakes!!
**QOTD:** Waffles. Particularly Waffles made in my Millenium Falcon Waffle Maker.
Morning all! All the laundry has to be done today, it's getting out of hand.   QoTD: pancakes or waffles!
QOTD: French toast! I’d love to learn how to make it but that also seems potentially dangerous bc I’d want to make so much.  Currently in bed after working a midnight to help a coworker, cuddling the dog & bf :)  Lots of cleaning to do later  Edit: I basically have to make French toast now bc of the responses lol
Oh man, we watched Pete Souza's "The Way I See It" last night and it was fantastic. Highly recommend it if you haven't seen it yet.   QOTD - Lately I'm loving breakfast burritos. With a little sri racha :)
News alert: husband ate rice and sunflower butter for the first time in a year. I'm trying not to make a big deal about it but it's two big things I can add back into his diet. Thank christ for his allergist and his psychologist. I'm reeling.
I had cake for breakfast. Because it's Sunday, and it's time to do as I please.
I've had a pretty chill day.   I guess I needed a little rest.  &#x200B;  QOTD: I am a breakfast sandwich addict.  And at this point in my life, it isn't a secret.
QoTD: Buttermilk pancakes drenched in real maple syrup  I was really rooting for 2021 to be a better year, then after 3 days of urgent bladder issues I felt incredible pain I haven't felt since my UTI after my appendix burst over a decade ago. After a visit to the hospital,  I have been prescribed 2 useless painkillers to pass a 3mm kidney stone. It';s going to hurt when the Toradol wears off, I was finally comfortable for the first time in days
Oh man, I love a sausage and eggs breakfast. Hash browns included. Sausage is legit my favorite breakfast item.
Today I'm turning 21! Thank you everyone who wished me happy birthday yesterday!  /u/insomniatica Happy birthday to you too birthday buddy! Jim Carrey and Michelle Obama were born today too.    QOTD: Depends on my mood.
Hi raoa fammmm! i deep cleaned the house today - it was long overdue. I’m feeling accomplished and now i’m relaxing in bed, about to start some skincare since i woke up and my dehydrated face was NOT it. 😅    qotd: i love carbs for breakfast 😂 but toast with butter and jelly is a staple for me.
Hour and a half until game time! I did my makeup to match the Saints colours! And red beans and rice for dinner! Yay! Hope everyone is having a good day!
Heading to bed but I really just wanted to give a HUGE shout out to everyone who really lifted my shitty spirits up so much!! ❤️❤️❤️ I can’t express how grateful I am to have you guys in my life!! ❤️❤️❤️  u/gdarn16 u/johnwoods1023 u/doesyawannasnog
Happy lazy Sunday!!! I hope your day is as amazing as you are. It's snowing again here so boooooo to that. My wife tested positive for covid..... So that's fun!!!! Haven't got my results back and we took the test at the same time so I probably tested negative. Definitely biscuits and gravy and hashbrowns and you can't forget bacon.
I woke up craving chicken fried steak! I should learn how to make it lol
QOTD: I like waffles. But only the frozen kind. Preferably chocolate chip, blueberry, or cinnamon.   We're just playing with baby girl today. She's currently sitting on the rug talking to her toys. It's cute. I bought her 3 new onesies and 4 pants in the next size. Plus a jacket that is a little big now but she can wear it for awhile. All I lack are coveralls for sleeping and maybe a few neutral onesies in case we change her a lot! Haha.   I'm making some kind of pot pie with cheesy garlic biscuits for dinner. I haven't decided exactly what I'm going to do but the biscuits will be part of it.
QOTD: I love ham, cheese, onion and green pepper omelettes! I also love Trader Joe’s chocolate croissants.   I haven’t been on this subreddit in WAY too long. I’m so excited to be back. This community brings me such joy, and I love talking to all of the awesome and unique people we have here
Morning friends! I'm feeling really good today! Going to make brunch and watch movies all day. Hope you had a good week.  QOTD: [Ayyyyyggggsss](https://youtu.be/qRdNc7QmDzA)
Yum!!! Breakfast is my fav, love cooking potatoes o'brien with scrambled eggs, tiny cubed ham,  and a mixture of shredded cheeses along with some biscuits and gravy and bacon!!! And ice cold milk to boot!!! And now I know what I'm going to make today lol :)
I am insanely happy with our new, free couch. It was a lot of work and getting it in and set up went a bit late last night, and how worth it!! Reading the paper, lounging, and not gonna move all day til it is time for yin yoga. 🧘🏻‍♀️ Surrounded by squishmallows, husband brought not one but five (five!!!) new ones. This is my happy place 🥰💞🧘🏻‍♀️💜💕
QOTD: I don’t know that I have a single favorite. I do really like bagels with cream cheese.   What’s everyone’s plans for Sunday? I have to run an errand and then more cooking and laundry await me, as always.
QotD: BACON and HASHBROWNS! I could eat them until I puke. So delicious.   Not sure what I wanna do today. Haven't been in the dice making mood. Not really any games I wanna play. Might binge the new season of Disenchantment on Netflix. idk.
Guys, I finalized my birthday camping trip for Fed 13-15. It’s gonna be colder than a witches titty, but I’ll have 3 days and 2 nights of lounging in the Smokies by The Little River with a campfire, books, wine, snacks AND WIFI so I can also reddit. That last bit will be a lifesaver since it gets dark at 6pm. I literally cannot wait. No 24 hour shift, no monitors beeping, no butt cleaning, no being peed or spit on, no being yelled at every 5 seconds, no waking up every half hour. Just... forest and rushing water. And books. Oof, I gotta buy some physical books. I’m so excited I woke up thinking about what I need to pack.   What are you guys doing today? I slept late and it felt great. Having some coffee now. Being excited. Life feels a whole lot different when you have something to look forward to. It feels magical and uplifting.   **qotd** Coffee. I’m not a breakfast eater, but if I were it would be something like Belgian waffles with blackberries and whipped cream.
About to have my lunch. Still a long way to go before I'm done with work today. My skip level boss wants us all to take off for MLK day. Some last minute notice on that and double the work today. I'm very seriously peeved by the whole thing.     QOTD: Bacon, it's not just for brekkie though.
Morning all! Okay, I'm going to do it, I'm going to get up AND GO ON A RUN! I haven't ran in months, but I know my body will thank me for it. See you guys in like an hour.
Hello everyone! BACON!! Yum...
Good morning everyone!! I hope you're having a good day!!!  My day is good! Trying to sell a lot of stuff today. Hopefully I can get some money!!
Happy Sunday everyone! Another beautiful day to rest and relax. I can't wait for my toddler to go down for a nap so I can read the entire afternoon.   Qotd: eggs, bacon, chocolate milk, doughnuts
My brain fog is thicker than maple syrup in a bowl of oatmeal on a cold day in Saskatchewan. Stephen King looked at my brain when he was looking for inspiration for *The Mist.* You might as well turn your car off; low lights will reflect off this fog as much as your high lights will.
Happy Sunday everyone. How are you doing?
QOTD: Waffles!   &#x200B;  Hello friends! I haven't need very active lately because the semester has started again, but I definitely miss interacting with this group!   &#x200B;  Has anything interesting happened to you this past week?
Watching Wandavision while I jump rope and suddenly I'm aware....Paul Bettany would be a pretty good pick to play the lead in a David Bowie biopic. No?
zzz accidentally overslept again! 🌸 feeling a bit of guilt about not being productive enough this weekend and just trying to rush through things now! 💭 hoping that you all are doing lovely, don't forget to stay hydrated and remember that someone loves you! 💗
Made bread. Love it. Going to mess with the air fryer function on the instant pot soon for some sweet potato fries. Yum
Hope everyone is having a relaxing Sunday! We had a super lazy day here and we got bacon ranch pizza. Yum!   QOTD: I love breakfast foods. Though I rarely have them. 😩 I love breakfast sandwiches and banana pancakes with strawberries on top. Mmmmm!
Happy Sunday, Butterbeers!  My wife got me a Harry Potter Funko Advent Calendar for Christmas, since I love the lego ones so much, and I've been opening em 1 a day in January lol and today I got Luna Lovegood! with the 3d specs!   Hope everyone's having an awesome night!
Hey friends! I'm re-reading the 5th Harry Potter book. OotP is my favorite book! I also had Christmas dinner with my mom finally! It was great!
Chillin with the furbabies watching football. New here and super stoked to find a group like this. I love gifting when I can work it into the budget. 🥰  QOTD: BACON!!
QoTD: Cinnamon rolls or crepes. I can’t decide. They’re both fantastic!
QoTD: Being an Indian, I am proud to say that my favorite breakfast item is Aloo Paratha (Potoato stuffed flat bread) with curd.  Goddammit, I'm hungry now.
Hello everyone! I am new to here, and it seems to be a very friendly group!  Breakfast is definitely my favorite meal of the day... And eggs are my go-to. A breakfast w/o eggs is not a good breakfast for me. I'd sometimes pair it with some toasts, smoked salmon, sausages, and avocado. I only have time to make myself a big breakfast like that on the weekends, though.
3 good things today:  1. My birthday was great!!!  2. I scored some birthday money, mini m&m cookie earrings, the first season of Sonic Boom (with action figures!), and a lovely house plant.  3. I found some boss stuff that I want on Poshmark!!  ACCOMPLISHMENT: NOTHING. IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY!!! 😂  VALUE PROVIDED: Gave my mom in law a present. 💝
I lost 13.5 lbs eating clean for 6 weeks.   It's by birthday.   I just had pizza, diet soda, and cake.   I feel like a slug in the middle of a quagmire made of sleepy.
I’d second comment that hello!
Qotd: biscuits n gravy
Happy Sunday! My headache is still lingering but better than yesterday thankfully. Planning to take it slow again today and play board games with the family, but also hoping to go on a walk with my husband :D Sending you all positive, calm vibes and lots of joy!   QOTD: I actually really love a bowl of yogurt with cherries, chocolate chips, and granola. But I also won't say no to Hungarian palacsinta (basically crepes) filled with prune butter, apricot butter, or cottage cheese!
Good morning everyone!  ☀️  My boyfriend is picking us up coffee from the coffee shop right now, so it's looking to be a super nice morning!  I'm happy I only have one tutoring session scheduled today at 11 as I need to finish up some work and do some cleaning at my apartment.   QOTD: I love omelettes with spinach, tomatoes, cheese, and bacon! A close second would be an almond croissant from the bakery near my apartment.
My favorite breakfast item would have to be toast. I hope everyone is doing well today!
qotd: potatoes.
It's to early to think of words to type  QoTD: **BACON**, buttered toast, croissants, biscuits, bagels (I have a bread obsession)
Did nothing I wanted to do on the first day of my weekend (gardening), but did shoot some hoops with the kids, so that's a win.  QOTD:  If I was to be entirely honest, I don't really eat a "traditional" Breakfast.  I do shift work, so don't usually get up until just after lunch time, so sometimes the first thing I eat is a sandwich of some description.  If I was to stick to traditional breakfast foods, **Bacon, Eggs & Hashbrowns** for a hot breakfast or **Sultana Bran** for cereal (unless I'm feeling cheeky and have some of the kids **Cocopops**) would be my favourites.
QOTD: Waffles, bagels, and muffins  Don't see much happening today.
Lighting is a constant battle here. My husband thinks he's a vampire, while I prefer the room nice and bright. So we have this lamp in the living room that the toddler likes to have on. This morning, he asked if he could turn it on, and I said yes, but that we had to turn it off when Daddy came into the living room. I meant when he was actually in the living room to stay, but my sweet, literal child is now standing guard at the lamp and turns it off every time my husband passes through. 😂  QotD: I'm not big on breakfast food, but I do love a good blueberry muffin!
**QOTD:** I'm currently quite hungry... so let me tell you what I like for breakfast. (Muffins sound wonderful, since you mentioned them...) Carbs. I like carbs. Pancakes, waffles, french toast. I will make myself eat some eggs, but they're best with a bunch of melted cheese. Toast is decent. Fresh, warm biscuits are good...
Well damn. My college campus got placed into a massive quarentine, which means I won’t get to see my friends very often, if at all, over the course of the next two weeks. I know it’s necessary and a good thing but I’m scared and hurt because I was just starting to work on my depression stuff with friends snd get better at remembering to eat more often and not just being sad a ton but now...now everything’s screwed.
Good morning friends! We finished the boy’s engagement “ring” last night. It’s huge and takes over our entire kitchen table. But he’s happy and now we’re on the hunt for a custom furniture place to make a coffee table big enough for the falcon. Yay!  QOTD: coffee. Always coffee.
QOTD: anything fresh baked! I usually just have oats and granola though.
hey!!
qotd: ooh how do i pick? i love a fry up, hash browns and sausages and beans. but i love waffles too, with chocolate or syrup. and i also love toast. maybe i love breakfast food more than i realised
Hello! Good afternoon from Scotland. Im just waiting on my mum to call so we can do virtual wedding dress shopping!  QOTD - Hollandaise sauce. Eggs benedict is my favourite thing in the world.
Yay for Sunday! Best hop to the fun!   QOTD: Anything without sugar. Like avocado toast, or breakfast tacos :)
Just applied for a job I did as a volunteer for garrison command at a military base I lived at. Hubby pushed me to apply cos I was great at it. Fingers crossed that I at least interview with air command for the job. I miss EFMP soooo much! I made 3 egg omelettes with 2 cheeses and bacon for brunch. Contemplating going back to bullet journaling but finding the right dot grid journal is my down fall of life. I can deal with minimal ghosting but not full on ghosting of all the drawings and layouts.
It it almost afternoon but I still am under the covers. :)  QOTD: anything with a runny egg. Poached, over easy, soft boiled. I don't discriminate.
Fire is going, house is clean, Arya's napping, and the chicken is prepped for the smoker. It's a good day.  **QOTD**: Coffee
lately i’ve been wondering what my constant headaches are from. i usually chug water if i have a bad headache ahhh   qotd: i love me some home fries or tater tots yummm
Happy Sunday all! I hope you all have a lovely day.   I’m still in bed, sipping coffee. I was late to sleep and so late to rise.   QoTD - I love all breakfast foods but I think tacos are my favorite. Followed closely by Cracker Barrel pancakes.
howdy y'all!! so today, of all days, is the day my kitchen sink decided it was no longer going to work. my landlord has been in and out all day trying to fix it himself, but i really think he should call a plumber 😂 he's just duct taping everything and hoping it won't leak  so how's your day been?
Bacon 🥓 and kings Hawaiian French toast.
QOTD: French toast is the clear winner for me, but I love breakfast food in general...especially when someone else does the cooking! Plus, what other meal can you name where we count desserts as actual meal items? Cinnamon rolls, donuts, sticky buns...mmm...
QOTD: I love pancakes, waffles, and french toast equally. I seriously can’t decide 😩 but my go to whenever I go out to get breakfast is French toast! I also love hashbrowns, but the really good shredded ones that get super crispy when cooked 😋 I always have to put ketchup on my hashbrowns if I eat at a restaurant but I never do it at home! My dad has always given me such a hard time about this 😂
This semester is off to such an awesome start...... My roommates truck wont start so I cant get into classes. The book for one class is unavailable and its needed to get access to the tests and labs. And i still have the same incompitent teacher for another semester
QOTD: Hashbrowns.
I’m trying to make a list of good things that happened in 2020 and it’s quite empty lol. That’s what I get for trying to be positive I guess  QOTD: biscuits and gravy
So much school shit to do. Slept until 3p yesterday and noon today. Luckily I am off tomorrow, but hopefully I get enough done tonight that I don’t have to spend my entire day off doing school crap.  Still trying to find a planner I like. Such a pain in the ass.  Hope your day doesn’t suck monkey monkey peener. 🦥🦖💜
I've had a fairly lazy day today. Played some Bioshock, took a nap with the pup, & ate some leftover spaghetti. I'm dreading cleaning up -- I really suck at it. 😅  QOTD I love most breakfast foods! But a classic pancakes or waffle breakfast with an over-easy egg or two & some bacon (even better if its venison) is 👌🏼👌🏼
Spent the better part of yesterday setting up my new [PC area](https://imgur.com/YWRW4Ix). I am absolutely loving it. I finally have enough room to hook my VR back up!   **QOTD:**For a savory breakfast? I love me some biscuits and gravy. For a sweet breakfast, gotta go with pancakes made with Bisquick mix. They just taste so good!
I just tested positive for COViD. I literally have no idea what to do with myself. I thought I was doing everything to avoid it. 😩 As for breakfast foods, I like muffins. Always.
Perhaps this has already been posted here, but you can get a free games from BigFishGames with the code FREEGAME990999!
Hey there friends! I hope y’all are having a good day! I haven’t been on as much as usual the last couple days, but I should be back to normal this week, lol. Love y’all! Don’t forget that you are awesome! :)  Qotd: umm. Cinnamon Toast Crunch and pancakes with crispy edges!
I'm just sitting here, thinking about french toast. I want to make french toast in the morning for my girls. My blood pressure has been really high the last few days with all the stress about my mom and I've been trying to relax. French toast is not stressful, it's yummy.
One of my neighbors has left their dog out on their balcony for the past week, and it has been barking until 2-4 am every single day. I finally walked over to their apartment today and they are gone. I'm terrified they packed up and left, and the dog has been left there alone without food or water in the cold. I'm this close 👌🏻 to climbing up there and getting the dog myself. I called animal control, but of course, they're out of the office because of the holiday. Best I can do is email management and hope that they can do something. My heart is breaking for this dog who has been left alone and just wants to go inside. People like this should. not. have. pets!  Edited: To clarify, I don’t know if the dog has been outside for an entire week. I’ve just been listening to his barking for an entire week.
I got the Subway Surfers characters I wanted! Yay!
I slipped and hurt my back. Any tips to get better? I have to work till 29th at a stretch and i cannot sit longer than half an hour here
I love breakfast foods but my favourite is pancakes.
Scratched my face while I was sleeping last night. 🤦‍♀️ Forget the baby apparently I need those mitten things LOL
Am I the first comment?!! I love hashbrowns !
Hi all!  I'm browsing amazon and adding things to my cart I can't afford right now as a form of retail therapy :) that Buy Now button is unfortunately my kryptonite but so far I'm resisting!  QOTD: I don't usually eat breakfast but when I do I love anything with bacon!
Hey guys. I’m getting time mixed up because I’ve been having medical issues. So now I’m awake at 2 am. Anyone else around?
QotD. Poached egg on toast.
Good morning everyone. I woke up feeling stuffy. It has been super windy here which is killing my allergies and I moved lots of stuff for my mom yesterday. Today I am looking forward to relaxing at home, reading my books, checking emails and playing games. Hope you all can relax too! Also, waffles sound amazing, I may need to make some
QOTD: hashbrowns
Qotd: waffles! ♥️♥️♥️  Today is a slow day. Might go to the mall to return some shoes. Maybe get replacements cause I reeeeaaallly dig them just got them too big!
My favourite breakfast item is frosted flakes cereal
QOTD:  I love pancakes and hashbrowns.
Qotd:  definitely taco John’s breakfast burrito. They are amazing  Today I’m off work since I’m feeling bad again. Fortunately I arranged it yesterday as a precaution. Now I’m half falling asleep eating ritz bits. Made some masks yesterday for Valentine’s Day.
QOTD: Smoothies 🍓🍌  Happy Sunday! I hope you are all having a wonderful weekend!! Big Hugs 🧡
Good morning everyone!!!  QOTD: scrambled eggs with bacon.
QOTD: bacon or a bagel with cream cheese
I have this gi normous canker sore 😢 it pains me so much not to eat normally   QOTD: bagels with cream cheese! And kolaches 😋
Happy Sunday everyone! I am just chillin on the couch watching Korean shows with my halmoni. I’m a bit nervous for the week as I’m taking care of her and we have a large language barrier between us. Next semester I’m going to try my best to find a Korean language course!   Are there any other biracial babies here that don’t speak languages fluently. I promise I’ll learn soon!
Ahhh I finished my audiobook last night and am already 3 hours into the next one (it's a trilogy). It's so good but also having my buds in listening to the book makes it way easier to get stuff done around the house too.  QOTD: my favorite sweet one is when I make buttermilk pancakes from scratch (I even make the butter/ buttermilk) but my favorite savory one is avocado toast with lemon and tomato.
QOTD-bacon 😋
I'm so happy that the holidays are over and my schedule has returned to normal! I'm now only working 40 hours a week, and I have weekends off. Happy Sunday everyone!   QOTD: Eggs benny, chilaquiles, huevos rancheros, some crazy ass apple pancakes, bottomless mimosas, other things of that nature.
Breakfast is the best! I love any and all carbs, give me all the pancakes and waffles and potatoes! 😆   This has been a really rough week for my family, please send any positive thoughts, prayers, or good vibes. Just being in this group is a big help, you’re all so wonderful. I hope everyone has a great rest of the weekend 💕
I’m on my break at work and I would love nothing more than to go home lol  QOTD: eggs, avocados, sausage, coffee or tea!
QOTD; tea.
Is Billy ok?!?! lol I usually see him posting these :) but glad to see another friend taking over the daily/nightly duties :)   I took ritalin for the first time this morning b/c I have ADHD but in my 38 years ( ew I don't like saying 38 ) I've never been diagnosed. It basically feels like a drank a bunch of coffee, which should it feel like that? I thought it was supposed to calm you down. Anyway, I know I have ADHD , I just don't know what course of treatment is the best one. Does anyone else on here have it?   Also, went to this metaphysical store yesterday and totally got ripped off, but that's fine, supporting local businesses and all. There's this really fun place here called " American Science and Surplus" and they have SO much random stuff, and if you know me,  I LOVE random.. anyway, I got a bunch of really cool amber jars and they were only 55 cents or something crazy cheap and then I got those nose glasses I posted a picture of last night because I love goofy sh\*t like that. They also have a bunch of random medical supplies like lab coats, beakers, hemostats and things like that.. I bought a couple different hemostats because I thought it would be helpful with picking up thread in my sewing machine ( I have tendonitis sometimes doing close work like threading a needle is hard) .... Anywhoodle.. this ritalin is awesome.. time for something fun ...  QOTD: my jam has been jimmy dean breakfast sausage lately.. it's a guilty pleasure, but it's so so good.. don't ask me how many packages I have in my freezer, it's embarrassing.
QOTD: A nice runny fried egg! And tea, all the tea.
yesss breakfast. my guilty pleasure since i was a kid was to eat exactly 2 mcdonalds english muffins without ham.  those things can give me chills just eating them haha!  other than that my second fav breakfast is probably the egg and cheese omelet my partner sometimes makes. we put tapatio or other hotsauce on top and i go nuts for it
I tried a Salvadoran breakfast last week and *oh my god*. Fried plantains, with over easy eggs, black beans(puréed-like) with sour cream and queso fresco.     Honestly still think about it every morning since.
I have taken *two* naps today. 😴  My poor kitter is sick after getting a vaccination yesterday. She's so miserable. I wish I knew of something I could give her to ease her stomach upset.
I've mostly finished my essay so now on the horrible fun of doing the referencing for them before going back for final edits. As much as I hate this part, it is also really satisfying getting to slowly close tabs once I've finished with them.   Looks like I'll probably be staying up all night though, because I'm just so paranoid about missing out something important and because it takes me a long time to do references because I hate it. Luckily I have my previous one to use as a template to help so it should be quicker. I've got tasty treats as a reward for when I finish too, and while procrastinating (by tidying the kitchen) I found the ingredients for making delicious chocolate truffles so might make those as a surprise for my bf for helping out so much!  QOTD - Jianbing, it's a Chinese breakfast pancake (savoury) and it's incredible! There's a Chinese street food restaurant in my city that does super good authentic ones that taste just like they do in China...only way more expensive.
Sarahah seems to be broke.  I'm looking for alternatives and ask.fm seems like a good option.
This weekend was way to short.  No usual considering I worked until midnight Friday, and go back 7am tomorrow.  It was a busy but somewhat productive weekend and played lots of video games with my kids - to wet to force them outside.
Saints are losing with less than 5 min left in the 4th quarter. Not a very happy camper right now. They've been doing pretty damn good all season but the first game I watch where the football fan in me finally comes out is just...ugh. Maybe I'm bad luck ._.
I got my brain into a funk tonight. So now I'm focusing on the positives.   1. The sun was shining and there was no wind.  2. I am lucky to receive my second covid shot this week.  3. Baby girl smiles and laughs when we play.
My leg area pain is coming in strong tonight and it brought me to tears and it’s hard to walk. I can’t wait for my doctors appointment in a few weeks.  Have the first of my “book tour” meetings coming up this week and I’m both nervous and excited. Recently released my second book and have the third book in the works right now. Super excited. They’re not very big or probably won’t ever really be that big but ol well.  Working on a silly stop motion video to enter into a thing to possibly win a grant tour trying to pay off student debt.  Anyways, I hope everyone has a wonderful evening!!!
I was going to read, but my Kindle is dead because I forgot to put it back in airplane mode.  Oops.  Now I don't know what to do.
Hope your day was good and your night is restful! Take care and hydrate! Hugs
Sitting here with electric amethyst dye in my hair. Well, half my hair. Unfortunately my friend, who did the dying for me, said it doesn't look like it's going to take very well .. but I'm leaving it in for a few hours, so we'll see.  My kitty is still sick. I want to just cuddle her, but she doesn't want to be touched so I'm just staring at her and frowning. Poor dear.
Hash browns, with or without cheese
QotD: chocolate chip pancakes, eggs benedict, and hash browns
Struggling a lot tonight with feeling worthless. I keep trying so hard, but all I do is fail and I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm honestly at the end of my rope..sigh.
Hey all! The next two weeks are going to be interesting with not being able to see my friends at all when I just started to get to see them again. Time to see how depressed I get.  QOTD; I think my favorite breakfast foods would probably be sausage, lox, or pancakes.
The last 24 hours have been really weird with one of my boyfriends (I have four, well now three).   One of my boyfriends lives across state from me in Seattle, his name is Bobby. I'm pretty sure he's got some mental health issues that he never disclosed, but being in a long distance relationship is always a little difficult. To be fair, we've been together since October/November but we've only been together twice for about a week at a time. I truly do care for him, and part of being polyam is knowing that your lover loves other people. So the first thing he tells me this morning is that he fell in love. Okay - that's cool, I love my three other partners. But he's choosing to be monogamous but we can still be friends. I don't do that - if you're my ex, you're my ex and not my friend. Lucky for me as soon as I said I'm not friends with any of my ex's he blocked me on social media - which made it an easy choice to delete him from my phone.   Does it suck? Yeah, but that's life. I am kind of bummed, but he truly wants to be a father (he's already 40yo) and I cannot have/nor do I want children.   **QOTD** Tamales and eggs are my favorite breakfast food. Have you ever had just the perfect runny egg over top of a steaming hot tamale packed with spicy chili? So. Good.
Good luck cleaning!
Hey our trash day is tomorrow too! Well technically it’s Tuesday, but tomorrow I have to roll the cans to the road so to me it’s trash day.
I SHARE A BIRTHDAY WITH BETTY WHITE?!?!
Glad to hear you were able to take that break — that's so important! So glad you're feeling better now <3
I didn't know something was wrong or I would have checked on you! I'm glad you're doing better now! I definitely have to step back sometimes soon just to have less to focus on and make life feel a little a more mellow.
I'm glad you were able to do something good for yourself!
I'm glad you had a good relaxing weekend!
I totally took a tiny step away from life today, too! But you were able to get stuff done! Yayyyy!! I just curled up into a ball and slept lol !!!   I’m really glad to have you back but more importantly glad you’re in a better place! That’s what matters the most! ❤️
I'm so glad you got a break this weekend! Having a no kids weekend and some time to refresh is what everyone needs now and then (shoot, I feel like I could use one lol). Play any good video games?
woohoo, stay safe until then.
I was going to offer to stab you, but I feel like that's just a bit too creepy.
Great, take care bud ❤️❤️❤️
Happy birthday 🎈🎂🎉🎁🎊🍰🥮🍾🧁🥳
Happy 21st!! Hope you have a great birthday :)
Happy 21st birthday!!! 🎉🎂🥳
Happy birthday!!
Happy birthday! 🎂🎁🎈
Ooo I love different mint varieties. Chocolate mint sounds good. Also what are murder cookies??
Sounds like a productive day! 😀
Don’t worry! I also haven’t been accepted for any jobs either. There’s a lot more jobs out there so don’t give up
I've been turned down by so many jobs and one day out of the blue scooped up my dream job. You'll get there love 🥰 send coloring pictures!
Their loss, obviously. There is something better out there for you. Like double blonde braids, my husband was turned down by job after job, then landed his dream job. It will happen for you too. ❤️
Don't worry — it just means there's something better on the way! Enjoy coloring! Maybe I'll do some of that later too.
Happy, happy birthday to u/DoppiScully22, u/insomniatica and u/kiss_my_clitoris. Make a wish!
Happy birthday everyone 🎊🎉🥳🎁🧁🎂🎈🥮🍰🍾
Omg so many birthdays! Hope you all have an amazing day!!
Happy, happy birthday to u/sugarcookiebunny and u/ricctp6. Make a wish!
Happy birthday u/ricctp6!
Happy Birthday everyone and u/ricctp6! Any fun birthday plans today?
Happy birthday everyone 🎂💥🎉
Happy birthday to all!
Wow happy birthday to all!
Happy Birthday everyone! 🎉🎂
HASH BROWNS YES  I completely forget hash browns exist sometimes, but they are so so so good.
I hope your day is perfect!
Beef brisket sounds so good!!
Corned beef brisket sounds amazing! I'm on my way LOL
Corned beef brisket! I'm jealous and adding that to my meal plan for next week thank you.
Oh god corned beef. Kill me. I would eat that til I got sick. With cabbage, and this mustard sauce my aunt made once. I have no idea how to make that stuff but I know it’s got vinegar in it, and when she told me not to smell it while it was cooking, I didn’t listen and nearly blinded myself on the steaming vinegar fumes 😂
You don’t have to apologize for having tough days. We’re happy you’re back
No apologizing! You're allowed to express how you feel!
Hugs, friend!
Sending you positive thoughts!
You’re allowed to be mopey. And you’re allowed to be sad. Don’t apologize. Venting is good for the mental health. Keeping it bottled up is not good for you. I’m sorry you’re having a hard time though, and I hope things change soon so you can feel better.
So much love for you 😍
Have a lovely Sunday!
Hope you have an amazing Sunday as well <3
I’m in love! What breed is she?
Adorable! 😍
Awww cute!
awe cute
have a great day!
Good morning  ☀️☀️☀️  I hope you have a nice day :D
Journaling is so fun. Hope you have a great day!
What are you watching on youtube?
Yum, pancakes are so good. What are your favorite kind?
Welcome! I feel that extreme cleaning mode coming on too, but I just did that Friday so mine won’t take long. I love to clean.
Nice! That's how I feel about my Olaf waffle maker lol
I did 10 loads last week. God speed
Love both! I even bought myself a small waffle maker to start making my own lol. And reading your post reminded me I've gotta do laundry today too BOOOO lol, good luck to us both!!!
I love love love doing laundry. Oh I just love it. Mostly love the result, fresh linens on the bed, but the process is fun too.
I love pancakes.
Yep I'm on that today too. Good luck!
Oh gosh French toast is super easy. Mix up a few eggs real well, lay the bread in, flip it over to coat both sides, pick it up to let the excess drip off then put it in a hot skillet. Cook, flip, voila!
It's super easy to make a good french toast. I used to make it all the time and burned myself out on it.
French toast is pretty easy! Take your bread of choice (honestly, a thicker bread will work better). Then in a bowl you're going to scramble some eggs. I also add milk and cinnamon when I do it. Mix, dip bread, put in the pan. After a bit, flip it. Thicker bread does better just because it doesn't fall apart. Cinnamon swirl bread is great for this, too.  Like pancakes, your first one may not be great. But you'll get the hang of it.
French toast is pretty easy! I think I should make it tomorrow for breakfast
I love french toast
A spicy breakfast burrito sounds good! What are your favorite fillings?
Oh man, I've heard good things about The Way I See It. I'll definitely have to check it out. Where did you find it streaming?
Im not up to speed if youve been sharing dietary issues but Im so glad for you both. Progress is always amazing!
Woohoo!
what kind of cake?
cake for breakfast is the best! 🌸 hope that you enjoyed it! 💗
Breakfast sandwiches are the best!!
Ahhhh I hope you feel better soon 💜💜💜
I hope you feel better!!!!!!! Sending all my love!!
Oh no, I’m sorry! Hopefully it passes soon! I’ve never had one so I can’t even imagine that pain. ☹️ Sending hugs!
so sorry, when I had one I was admitted for surgery, waited 3 days and it passed on its own (worse than child birth).  There is a hospital 2 hrs away that uses ultra sound to break it up.  I wish they did that everywhere.
My favorite kind of breakfast too!
Ugh that sounds so good lmao!
Don't forget Betty White! She's turning 99 today! 😯
Happy birthday fellow Capricorn! 💜 I hope you really enjoy yourself today! Turning 21 was funny for me because I went to a restaurant and i was excited to pull out my ID for my drink anddddddd they didn’t ask for my ID. 🤦🏻‍♀️😂 The one time they didn’t ask!
Happy birthday to you!
Happy Birthday!
We've pretty much finished up our cleaning too! Yay for clean homes! What's your favourite kind of jelly?
It feels so nice to have a clean space!! I hope you're able to get your skin back on track!
I definitely need to do a deep clean - I made a start today and did some tidying of the cupboards to move stuff around and make space to get a few more things off the counter as we just have a huge pile of stuff as we just don't have enough storage space. I'm hoping over the next few weeks to make a significant effort to go through and use as much of it as I can to free up space.   I always get really motivated to tidy at night though which limits what I can do, can't do anything too noisy otherwise I'll wake my bf up!
Sounds like a good day!
And u/tinawebmom u/purpleteasoul u/space_noodlers
Anddd u/Kitty-purrs u/so_appalled_ u/shinpurple   If there’s anyone I missed I’m so sorry! Sooo sleepy and have total fog brain right now!!
Of course friend!! We are always here for you!! ❤️❤️💕🥰
<3
Awww!!! I'm so grateful for you!! I hope you have a wonderful sleep! <3
Oh no sending positive thoughts to you and your wife!
Yum! Definitely check out pinterest! And if possible, buy cube steak. Don't try to pound yours out. It's not worth it.
Fried chicken batter on chopped steak patties? I honestly have no idea, but that stuff is delicious.
Pinterest
I prefer frozen waffles too!
YUMMY, all of it sounds devine! And I'm with you this place brings me tremendous happiness!
I never had Trader Joe's chocolate croissants but they sound like something my husband will love. We'll have to keep an eye out for them whenever we're back to going to Trader Joe's.
Welcome back!
Woohoo! Sounds like a great day :D What movies are you thinking of watching?
That sounds phenomenal.
Wow, yay for couch! I still need one, tbh....our bed is in the living room 😅
Congrats on your new couch!!
Bagels are tasty. My plans are being at work, so, normal day.
I haven't had a bagel in awhile. Yum.  We're going to watch Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. It's my kids first time watching.
Ooh a new season of disenchantment :D. I vote we binge that together.
Coffee is wonderful. And your birthday trip sounds fantastic! Like, that is all I want out of life. LOL  Enjoy your vacation! :)
Bacon all day every day.
Have a good day too, friend!
good luck! Are you selling things that you sell for work, or are you trying to get rid of everything that does not spark joy?
That was me last weekend! It was baaaaad! Fog so thing you could probably scoop it with a spoon! Rest, a healthy lunch, and caffeine helped somewhat but really it took a day for it to really clear.
Aw I'm sorry brain fog sucks :-(
Oof my brain fog is brutal too. I genuinely feel like I’m losing my mind sometimes. 😳
For such a foggy brained day, you sure wrote this clear as a bell!! Hehe
I hope you feel better
Happy Sunday to you!
Happy Sunday to you too! Did you have a good day?
How’s your semester going?
Now that you have said it, I dont think there is a better choice
Ohhhhh yes yes yes
Sending massive hugs!!! I hope your day is going well!!!
Whoops! but sounds like maybe you needed the sleep so that's something you needed to do too probably!
Wait...instant pots have air fryers?
Omg yum! Enjoy!
That pizza sounds great! I was gonna have a slice of leftover pizza but ended up having a little boston creme pie instead lol
Ooh yum!!
I love Luna Lovegood! I actually have a pair of her spectraspecs! But they're hard to see out of lol.
How fun!!
Welcome! We are a friendly bunch. As a vegetarian I still agree that bacon is one of the best smells in the world!
Just to let you know you flair link isn't working :)
I agree completely
I had to look it up because I've never heard of it before and man you are right, that looks so good. I just had dinner and yoi are making me hungry again haha
Aloo paratha omg its been so long i had it
Hey welcome welcome! The people here are the best - you chose a food place to join 😊 also eggs are number 1. Easy, cheap, healthy, tasty in a bunch of different ways... yup, definitely eggs.
I’m glad your birthday was good!
Happy Birthday! 🎁🎈🎂🎉
Happy birthday bud... 13.5lbs in 6 weeks wow. What did you eat?
Slug of sleepy is a MOOD I practically had to drag myself out of bed this morning for my classes.
I made that for breakfast yesterday!
I hope the headache finally eases off! Enjoy your day!
What’s happening with the headache? Is it a tension or sinus headache? Try some electrolytes and see if that helps. If you’re even slightly dehydrated a lasting headache can develop.
Ohhh coffee :-)
With or without jelly/jam? I like apricot or cherry preserves on mine.
Toast with good butter is delicious.
Give me all the carbs!!
Aww your poor child!! I am the same as you, I also like it bright, but my SO wants it dark and gloomy. The struggles
What was his 'Ring'?
Good morning.
good luck, i hope you hear from them soon
cozy Sunday!
Oooooh that sounds amazing!
Sounds lovely!
Lots of things could cause constant headaches. Do you wear glasses? Constant headaches could be related to needing to update your prescription? Or you could be dehydrated. Or if you usually drink caffeine but haven't recently you might be having withdrawl symptoms. Could be the lighting in your house causing eye strain. Or well a whole number of things.
Mmmm potatoes for the win!
Happy Sunday! Have a great day!
Happy Sunday! 💕
Oh gosh! I hope it gets fixed!!!! Sending so much good vibes!!!
Ugh landlords suck sometimes. Always the cheapest and easiest fix, instead of spending a little extra time or money to really fix the problem. 🤦🏼‍♀️
I could never really handle desserts for breakfast. They're like an evening/after dinner or with tea type of thing for me usually 👀
Try starting with 2021 and do it daily! Just because nothing amazingly grand happens doesn't mean it can't overall be a good year! Which...I know that sounds weird to compare to 2020 but I'm sure you get what I mean.
Good luck with your school work!
Yeahhh school shit is kicking my ass too.
Lazy days are the best, good luck cleaning!
That setup is swaaankky! Nice job. I have a goal to build a PC like yours someday, and maybe even play Cyberpunk once it's not quite as broken.
So sorry, I hope you recover quickly.
Aww I'm so sorry to hear that! I wish you a fast recovery!
I hope you feel better soon!
Oh no, I hope you feel better soon!
I love crispy edges pancakes! Good choice 👍🏽
❤️❤️❤️
French toast is great!
Aww, that's so awful.
Thats ridiculous, how could someone do that?
[deleted]
Oh no my heart breaks for the dog. I've seen neighbors leave their dog out in the extreme cold/hot weather and it's just so cruel.
Woo! It's the little things that can bring so much joy.
I like prescription muscle relaxers and CBD rub
Right? Amazon makes shopping so easy that it's dangerous!
You still up?  I tend to wake up in the middle of my sleep period, which is already shifted later than others' since I stay up late.  Update: I'm going back to sleep, as I can't keep my eyes focused on the screen.
Thanks and have a relaxing Sunday! I hope you get to read a lot.
Yum
Let's see these babies
Hubby likes the cinnamon Frosted Flakes
I'll raise you fruity pebbles!
Bagel and cream cheese is the best 👍
Oh no! Do a warm salt rinse! Those help me sooo much.
I listen to audibooks too while I get things done around the house. I'm in the middle of a series and I can't stop listening. My husband gifted me waterproof ear buds so I can listen in the shower.
What are you listening to?
Yum!
Hooray for normal schedules!
I’m sorry you guys had a rough week. Sending you positive thoughts!
All the positive thoughts and vibes being sent your way 💙
Try one score and 18? My understanding of ADHD meds are that theyre basically meth and get your body up to speed with your brain. I dont know, I have undiagnosed ADHD (but highly suspect it as does my therapist) so no experience of treatment.   That store sounds super cool!
I just started Ritalin too! For the first few days, I felt that way as well. It calmed down after that, and my concentration is through the roof!
poor kitty, I hope she feel better.  One of my kitties had all but 4 teeth pulled on Friday.  The other cat (the pushy one) hissed at him for over 24 hrs.  It was so hard.
I noticed that too! Whats your favorite color?
Ok so it wasn't just me. I went to it this morning to link it to the post and it was in another language and all screwed up. So I just said forget it.
I love ASKfm honestly, though it's kind of weird now that the "shoutout" feature is a thing.
I feel you. Im not a Saints fan, but it’s impossible to not respect Brees. His career definitely deserved another ring
Good luck working through the funk. It’s definitely not easy or fun, but hey hopefully things will start to look up!
Good luck with the dye!
That's a bummer.  I'm glad you didn't have a hard decision over deleting him from your phone.
Im cleanin... cleanin dis plate of pizza. Lolll. Thank you!
Yes. My husband seems to be a procrastinator with the "ill take it out tomorrow" and then has too much to carry out. Leaving a bunch behind so I end up having to crawl my big ass out the bed too dang early and clean up. Lol so I spend my sunday gathering as much trash as I can so I can get some additional zzz's.   I need motivation.
❤️❤️
❤️ Absolutely no worries. I typically dont reach out or say anything so pretty much no one knew. lol I just didnt want to leave everything hanging and wondering why I was all of a sudden not responding to things!   I greatly appreciate it! I just have a lot of work lately and I also have a few stressful events coming up in the next month that were weighing on me. I am in such a better place now. (especially now that our place is almost all the way clean again We put christmas away finally hahaha)
❤️❤️ Thank you! It was so needed  haha
❤️❤️
🥰  🥰  Thank you!!! sometimes its needed haha  Especially from work!
Hahah exactly! Yes! I played code vein quite a bit and then tried a bunch of new ones like sea of solitude and calling of the sea! I also played don't starve! Lol we just got gamers pass for Xbox so tons of new games to choose from!
Hahaha I appreciate the sentiment though LOL
THANK YOU!!!
It’s a recipe from the /r/old_recipes sub. It’s more or less a molasses spice cookie but very addictive.
Kinda very much a lazy day as it didn’t get warm enough to weed the garden area, but I have made length on scarf 5
Thank you 💜
Thank you. I hope I find my dream job....I just don't know what it is yet lol
Thank you I appreciate that 💜
Aww thank you so much!! :D I wish I could see my Grandma and Pop today, but they live a few hours away :P
Thank you!! ♥️♥️♥️
Thank you! I wish I could go to the movies and have a “regular birthday” lol but I will watch something at home! :)
THANK YOU!!!
Thank you! I made one over my coffee this morning 😉 happy birthday to all my bday twins!
Thank you!!
Thank you! No not really lol my husband made me favorite dinner last night so that was great! Feeling grateful today that he's still around.
Thank you ✨  I hope yours is as well 💖
I'm so excited! I'm gonna serve it with some roasted onions and green cabbage
Lol, come on over! I hope you also like cabbage 😂
You're welcome! Corned beef brisket is always a good choice 😃
😂😂😂 It's so good. Any time I can get my hands on it I can't help but buy it 😂
❤️️
Thank you <3  I just feel like maybe I've been spreading my sadness.. a lot. And I hate to do that.
Hugs! <3
Thank you <3 <3
Thank you so much <3 <3
Right back at you zap friend!
Thank you so so much!
You’re too sweet to me ❤️
A jack-zhu. A fancy way of saying a shitzhu jack Russell mix
Thank you!
Thank you! You too! 💕💕
I usually pop on Rachel Masky or Leena Norms. Their videos just feel so cozy.
I like the classic buttermilk ones with loads of butter and syrup! Not the healthiest but so goood.
I like cleaning too!
😭 thank you!
I got a waffle maker off of fb marketplace and my husband loves making us waffles on it. Hr always adds a little vanilla to the batter and it makes such a difference!   Oh no. Yes, good luck. Put on a good show, that's what I think I'm going to do to get me through it.
You are welcome here anytime you want some extra 😂 I just folded and put away the baby's. It was the easiest, but now I feel done.
I'll usually do egg and sausage, and occasionally I'll throw in peppers, green onion, salsa, etc.
We watched it on Peacock!
Thank you! He became 118 lbs and was hospitalized bc of food allergies and some neurological problems (combat related) which were exacerbated by PTSD. Finally has some meds for the neurological stuff that's working and is working w an allergist to keep the allergies under wraps and a psychologist for help adding some foods back in.
Dude straight upppppp I'm so happy
Birthday cake-flavored cake!
They really are.  But because "muh depression" and too lazy to cook, I'm getting Chipotle for dinner!
Thanks, I hope so too. I asked google and learned it can take up to 6 weeks to pass one! I can't believe some people get these things all the time. The pain is intense
Thank you
This is my first one. All I can compare it to is a urinary tract infection without the burning pee sensation - in my case, a pilled back muscle. It's sore, in a deep aching way until the pain builds to an intensity that;s insane
Ouch, they made you wait that long? How big was it?  The hospital I went to is a teaching one. They tend to have more of the latest stuff, although I think I had like ten people present for my last surgery, some just watching
Oh I didn't! Al Capone, Muhammad Ali, and Jake Paul all have birthdays too!
Thank you! That is funny. Can't wait till I get to do that lol.
Thank you!
Thank you!
well my favorite is really Apple butter. But i normally keep Strawberry in the fridge. You??
soooooooo you’re me. haha. i also like to clean and organize at night. i like to do pretty much everything late at night - it’s when my motivation kicks in. 😂 i’ll be exercising at midnight!
Big hugs💜💜💜💜
Hugs and loves!
I can say the same thing to you. You’ve been great to me, too. Sleep well girl. I’m going to bed, too! Good night!
It’s been fun chatting! 🥰
Oop, was already asleep!
I know and I freaking love you guys sooo much for it!! ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you, but she's fine. She kind of had a slight cold a week or so ago and really didn't think much of it. Never lost sense of taste or smell. Soo we never got tested. Well we are going on vacation in a couple weeks and just wanted to get a test and what do you know she came back positive.
They're just consistently good! Plus I can eat it without using a fork and plate!!
Soo yummy! You have to let them sit out overnight before baking. But it’s well worth the wait!
Thank you :)
One Night in Miami is up first
I was seriously just about to set up a spare bed!! No shame 😎🥰💞💞
It's gently used by neighbors, but excellent quality and style, so.... new to us! 🥰🥰💞💖
Bummer! I hope your work day goes well!
Nice! Such great movies, I hope they enjoy them!
That’s all I want out of life too. Coffee and camping 😂
You tooooo!!!!
Just selling things that don't bring me joy!
It is going fine so far. Just relaxing.
So far so good! I'm enjoying most of my classes, but there is one that I know is going to kick my butt this semester.
thank you!! 💗💗💗
thank you! 💗
The one I have does! It’s a duo!
Mmm Boston cream pie is equally as good as pizza in my book haha!
Ha, awesome! I'm so happy! I love these tiny little funkos !
I love it :D
I am having a hard time figuring it out. Lol
Thank you! Oh I love food. And I cannot live without eggs lol
Thank you, luv!! ☺️♥️🌈
Thank you!!
LOTS of fruits and veggies. Meats at lunch and dinner. Some nuts or sweet potato after any work out. I followed a plan called "Betr Health" which eliminates a bunch of inflammatory foods and foods that people usually are sensitive to. That's the first month, and then they add foods back in the 2nd month (that's the stage I'm in now). It re-balances gut-health and I love it! I can eat as much as I want, as long as it's within an 8-9 hour window of time (so it's partial intermittent fasting). But it's great!!
Ughhh SUCH a mood!
Yum! I  am also so carbie, I like to do home fries too (no shredder for hash) . Man but biscuits and gravy for camping, too. -dreams of food-
Thank you!! Have a great day as well 🥰
I think it's a tension headache but I will try electrolytes just in case! That's a good idea, thanks :D
I would argue it depends on my mood, but with usually. My mom used to make it with cream cheese and jelly. I use butter and jam when I do it. Apricot is my favorite but blackberry is a close second.
Agreed!
Yes please 😋

mm yeah i have glasses but never really wear them. i wore them all day today and i think i’ve been fine so far so maybe it’s because of that.
Thank you! As you can tell I am hard at it. Ha ha  May I offer you some entomology for your entertainment?
Haha thank you!
I've been enjoying it on my rig with very few issues. So far my "biggest" bug was a body that glitched through a wall I couldn't loot. And my PC is almost 4 years old now, bought it back in '17 and tried to get it as "future proofed" as I could at the time. She's capable of all games and VR so she's doing ok. Probably won't need to upgrade her for at least another 2 years.   And thanks! The setup was all I wanted for my birthday. So I took the $600 stimulus and went to town. The monitor was literally the most expensive component. My plan is to do streaming eventually. I have a buddy who does it and he's going to show me the ropes so I can get into it too.
Thank you.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Thank you a ton.
Right?! Soo good! Thanks! :)
The police refer to animal control and say there’s nothing else they can do.  To clarify, I don’t know if the dog has been outside for an entire week. I’ve just been listening to his barking for an entire week.
Sorry must have missed you.
😊
Iike [thiiiiiiis ♥️♥️♥️](https://imgur.com/a/bC8ldVi)
I never heard of them before! Is it very cinnamon flavoured?
Fruity Pebbles is my favorite cereal!
Yes! I've been doing that all day, helps a little but eating is still a pain 😂I gotta bear with it
That's so cool! I didn't know they made waterproof ones. My boyfriend gifted me galaxy buds for Christmas because I found out they are the only earbuds that actually fit in my ear (my brother and I got weird ears from our mom lol) it was such a game changer to not have to use headphones haha.  What series are you listening to?
It's called the Everlife series. The first one is Firstlife, then Lifeblood, then Everlife. It's about a world where there are 2 afterlives to choose from (your Everlife) and the main character is torn but both realms really want her because they believe she might be the deciding factor in their war. It's very interesting.
Thank you so much ✨
Thank you, I really appreciate it 💕
Oh jeez :(
Red, yeah red.   Yours?
Yep, Arabic. I chose English but then nothing.  I've found Tellonym and Ask.fm are the best alternatives.
I'll look at that tomorrow in more detail I think.
Thanks! My hair needed it. So did I, haha
He's a decent guy (I wouldn't have dated him otherwise) but the fact that he instantly blocked me shows he's probably been hurt by an ex before.
I'm the same. I don't want anyone to think I'm just being extra mopey and trying to get pity. Or burden anyone with my probs tbh. So I just dip out here and there until I'm better mentally. I wish you all the luck in everything coming up! 💙
You're welcome! 💚💜
That's so nice to be able to choose from whatever. Don't Starve is the only one from those I've played, but it's excellent. I really want to check out Sea of Solitude on my PS4 one of these days - it looks absolutely beautiful.
You're welcome, then! :)
Yw
Sounds great!
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
Oh, no I hope everything is ok with him! I know you’ve shared a little in the past. And that was awesome of him to make your favorite dinner!
Thanks!💕
I do!!! Sounds so good :D
Yea it’s expensive but damn it’s delicious. You gotta try that mustard sauce someday. No idea what it’s called but it’s “mustard sauce for corned beef” and it has vinegar in it. Fuhhhh. So good. But don’t sniff it while it’s boiling 😂
Nope nope nope, this place is for support 💙
You’re welcome!
Sounds delicious! I don't have a batter preference but I do need them to be blueberry. Blueberry pancakes are my fave!
Sounds yummy!
Hmm, with that and The Office on there now maybe I should check it out.
Oh wow sounds like quite a journey! Im super happy for you that hes making progress
That’s fantastic!
Excellent!!
Yay for chipotle! So good 😋
The wait was for OR time, it wasn't an urgent surgery, I wasn't going to die from it.  I'm kind of glad I didn't have the surgery.
I LOVE apple butter! But for jelly it's gotta be grape. I've been working on a jar of candy apple though. I have some carrot cake jelly I'm suspicious of but curious to try.
Yeah it's after midnight here and I've just finished doing all the dishes and cleaning some of the counters. I have a huge urge to clean in the bathroom but that's mostly just to avoid my essay so I'm avoiding it for now but might do it when I need a break.
Thank you! ❤️
Oh that's good that she's feeling fine at least! Where will you be going on vacation?
Finger foods are superior
Yeah definitely sounds worth it! Yum!
For sure!
Hm I don't think I've ever seen it
New to us is awesome, yay!
The wiki has step by step instructions! It's also much easier on the computer!
Wow sounds cool
I’m just being super nosy rn but thanks for the detailed info! I have gained so much weight after being put on antipsychotics and have been so depressed because of it. This diet sounds like something I would actually stick to.
Haha, now I’m craving some delicious carbs!
Thank you💕💕
Oh boy, I’ve had a tension headache for 3 solid months. Started thinking I had a neurological problem. Went and got new glasses Monday and haven’t had a headache since.
Hmm I love blackberry, too! Sometimes I like my toast with just butter, also.
Oh WOW... I bet hes a happy boy! Mines just finished choosing our joint engagment 'ring' - a fancy gaming rig!
Could be! If you don't wear them like you should you could be causing a lot of eye strain.
Nice! I bet your screen is beautiful with that nice monitor. I've considered if streaming is worthwhile myself, but I'm mostly on console these days (which can make streaming harder) and feel like an old man now that I have a kid haha. If you do get a stream started let me know - I'll check it out!

That's ok. :)
Ooooh love them 🖤
Hubby says it’s like Cinnamon Toast Crunch but with Frosted Flakes
they seem okay now
Mint green!
Alright! Admittedly, I think a *lot* of the messages I've received have been auto-generated (ASKfm seems to deny having any involvement), but it's still pretty fun regardless.
Nice :)
Ah, makes sense.
Thank you so much!!!!! Really!
It really is stunning. They did a great job and its kind of relaxing too!
May I just comment on how much I appreciate that your reddit avatar matches your username. It is fantastic!
Oh it is
He's doing wonderfully and that's what I'm so thankful for!
💖💖💖
Lol, I'm going to look it up!
❤️️❤️️❤️️
You know I don't think I've ever had a blueberry pancake but I love blueberry muffins!
I think their basic sign up is free, that's what we have
Thank you! Yup he has been devolving all year, we thought he was going to die in September, changed hospitals and moved to try and get better care, eloped in October after all the scares, and have been dodging covid all this time lol he's been gaining weight and doing so much better since we moved and it's all I can ask for.
It really is.  It's a great way to get fresh food when I'm too lazy to move.  (I went on a walk today, and that's it.)
Would it have been invasive surgery?
I know this is bad and we shouldn't be traveling and all that but we are going to Mexico to an all-inclusive resort. The way I look at it is we have to get tested before we come back to the states now so it's really no different than us being at work except no work lol.
Absolutely.
Ok I think I got it now maybe...lol
Thanks so much!
It really is! Now if I could just stop feeling like poop after my birthday meal, that'd be peachy! 😂
Omg me too!!! Abilify is not my weight's friend, let me tell ya!! But at least I'm not seeing & hearing things!! 😅  Check with your insurance and see if they'll cover Betr Health!! I found out that my insurance covers a wellness program and the quiz I took on their website paired me with Betr Health (I'm SO glad I picked them instead of a place that would have me count calories!!) I'm disabled due to mental health, and don't have much dough, so I'm on both Medicaid and Medicare. I'm on the Blue Shield Promise Plan and they're covering it 100%. They even sent me a wifi scale and said that since I've stuck with it for so long, they'll send me a fitbit too!   But if your insurance *won't* cover it, I can see if I can screenshot some stuff for ya (shhh don't tell them haha). Part of the plan is having a coach though, who you talk to via the chat feature on the app. You take pictures of everything you're eating and they let ya know how you're doing and guide you (they chat to you once a day M-F). So I highly recommend the program, over just eating the foods. But yeah!! Let me know! ☺️♥️🌈
Oh wow glad to hear it was just the glasses! Yeah I had a headache in the back of my head in 2018 and it lasted for months so I had to get all these tests done and go through all this anxiety but thankfully nothing was actually wrong. And eventually it just went away!
What is it about butter? Lol it’s so good
That’s so cool too!! It’s nice to have a practical ring lol
They refuse to do anything related to animals. Our animal control is also law enforcement, and they are the ones that handle it. I do not understand how in the world they are not available 24/7. 🤦‍♀️
Luckily I live in the middle of a desert and it hasn’t been too cold at night this past week (49 degrees F tonight). It’s probably a tolerable temperature, but definitely not comfortable for anyone, even a dog. I was trying to see if I could throw a blanket and some food up there but I can’t without damaging property or breaking my leg in the process.
That sounds delicious I’m gonna see if they sell them at the superstore today
That's good 👍
Ooh thats a nice colour. All greens are nice.
Of course! Message me if you ever need to talk!
Thank you! :D
I’m so glad to hear that!
Oh man you need to have one. They're so good because the blueberries get kind of burst-y and juicy.
Oh cool, I didn't even know that.
Oh my goodness thats so scary! Sending gentle hugs to you both!
well they would have cut into me to get to it.  Don't know the details since we didn't get that far.
Yeah as long as you're being really careful about it and making sure you're not potentially exposing other people, I don't blame you for wanting to get away for a while. I hope you enjoy it!
Looks like it works now! Also, it shows what may be your real name.  If you want to change it, you have to change the name on your public profile.  Or you could just make it your first name only, since that's in your username, so it's no additional info.
You're welcome! Looks good now!
That sounds amazing! I’m disabled too because of mental health and epilepsy so something like this would be a huge help for me.  I never look into any extra insurance help because I just assume that I’m gonna get turned down. It’s already hard enough getting approved for SSI. 😢 I’m gonna check today for sure.  Thank you THANK YOU so much for all this info. You have no idea how helpful it is to me.
Well I hope your head feels better soon. It’s miserable to have a headache. Absolutely miserable. I have chronic dehydration too, which always gives me headaches so I always keep these Nuun hydration packets around, and use at least one a day. Found a new one that’s watermelon flavor, which isn’t my favorite, but they’re pretty damn delicious.
It is!! One of life’s greatest yet simplest pleasures.

Please try to convince building management to open the apartment and check on the dog
Yw
Haha how's your day/night/morning/evening going?
Maybe the next time I'm at IHOP!
I had two abdominal surgeries that were laparoscopic. But the less they need to slice and dice you the better I totally agree
Thank you!!!! She's symptom free so I'm guessing she can't spread it. And the resort, from every thing i have been reading does an amazing job at sanitizing and keeping everyone spaced. So we should be ok.
Thank you again!!
Absolutely, luv!!! I hope they'll cover it for you!! ♥️
Oh cool I think I'll order those! Thank you <3
Me too 🙁
I’ve been on the phone all morning trying. 🤞
It's going all right.  I already ate dinner, now I'm just relaxing.  I should go check on my laundry in the dryer, though.
Yum! Let me know what you think if you get them :D
my tubal ligation was laparoscopic.
Hm I thought you could spread it even if you were asymptomatic, but I'm no expert and absolutely not a doctor so definitely don't quote me on that!! And oh that's awesome then at least you can feel relaxed and not worried while you're there! That's the best.
Just FYI, I wasn't the person you were speaking to earlier, but I saw you'd been having trouble and decided to give your flair a check. :)
Bleh laundry well, I hope you have a great rest of your night, and that your laundry is dry and warm and full of cozy sweaters! (because they are the best LOL)
I will!
I haven't got it and been around her the whole time so I have no idea. Lol
I appreciate it. I love this app but still learning.
Thanks!  I'll probably have to run the dryer again, since our washer's capacity is bigger than our dryer's.  It has a few hoodies in there, but it's ok that they're still wet, since I've got one on now!  How's your day/night/whatever going?
Haha well that's good evidence then!
Yeah, it can take some time. :)
It's going well! I have a 3 day weekend, and my dog who hasn't been well just gave me the cutest little happy tail wags! My mom also made me lemon bars so I'm pretty lucky! They are my favorite! It is night here as well too.
Nice!  Three day weekends are amazing.  I'm glad your dog seems to be doing a bit better!  And lemon bars are soooooo good!
Me too! He is a trooper so he will be fine, just a few more weeks of crate rest. And yes they are! I had to agree to putting an app on my phone that tracks my driving to get them. O_O but lemon bars, so I say it's a fair trade haha
Aww, good.  My dogs would hate that, since Pumpkin has separation anxiety and Dude is very active.  So I'm glad he's tolerating it!  The app is kinda creepy... But probably a decent trade-off.  Is it so you can get a discount on insurance?
Yeah Goose is crazy active and lets us know he objects to his captivity. But his wild man days are how he ended up hurting his back, so jail for 6 weeks is his sentence!   And the app is super creepy, it's like some thing that is used to inform others if you're in an accident, like who in your family is the closest, etc. But it tracks such unnecessary things too like your average driving speed, etc. I moved out of the house like 6 years ago, and am a full adult but my mom is a ball of anxiety. She has been begging me to get it for years and I finally caved since I actually did end up putting my car insurance company's app on my phone.(Gotta get those amazon gift cards for gifting!)
Aww!  What kind of dog is Goose?  Poor baby.  That does sound super creepy...
He is a frenchie. What are Pumpkin and Dude?
Pumpkin is a long-haired dachshund.  Dude is a mix, and we have no idea what of.  He looks like a huge Jack Russell Terrier but too big to actually be one - he's 50 pounds.
Wow! I feel like I need pictures now lol.
https://imgur.com/a/6Zz3GHh
T_T I love them.
Aww!  They're really sweet dogs.  Do you have any pics of Goose?
I have a album of the whole zoo we have LOL https://imgur.com/a/Y6PNwWR
Aww, what cuties!  I love Agent's name!
Thanks! She got it by being a creeper as a juvenile. She would just barely peek her head out of her hide and watch us for hours. Reminded me of a secret agent, so that's what we named her!
Aww, that's a cute story!
Haha she’s a cute gecko I get none of the credit!
Hahaha! :D

So so so kind John!!
You are so sweet!
Oh my gosh thank you! I was looking at these again today actually!  Thank you again!
You never fail to impress me John!
No problem :) I hope you enjoy them! You deserve it and more.
Thank you! This was nothing but appreciation for an awesome user of our subreddit :)

I got the worm! Mmmm those egg bites are awesome with a nice latte or chai latte
I got the worm but not really because I just woke up
I got the worm is my new favorite randomizer phrase.  Happy Sunday!
I got the worm!   Ooo I’ve never had any of the egg bites before!! They’re always sold out or not available around my area for some reason! 🤔   Super sweet of you to give away $15 for starbucks!! You rock!
Lol. Appropriate winner
I got the worm   Boss and I would love to share a cup! Yummy for our tummies!

Happy Sunday. I got the worm and loveee some yummy coffee.  P

I got the worm... But it's still sleeping because it's 5 am. Good morning!
I got the worm!  Not because I wanted it, but because my cat decided he was starving and my son never sleeps in, and then my brain was all like, "did you order the right size blinds?"
I got the worm! I wanted to sleep in so bad today! But my son said no no. Lol good morning guys
Not entering but I love this!

Thank you!
I’m a medical student and i’m currently studying for an exam on the physiology of the heart hehe :)
Lol. God bless
Oh, that would drive me crazy! I would literally have to put up a post-it with the measurements at every window until everything was installed, or else I'd spend every hour second-guessing everything.
I'll be waiting with "baited" breath.  Pun intended   🪱
Yo, I've been up since 3:30. I took the dog out, did 1.2 miles on the treadmill, and I'm about to start grading 👀 Sunday Fun-day 🤣
Only for a little while, though, right? You'll get your morning peace time back in a few years 🤣
That's awesome! I slept in (for me anyway) yesterday and it was so nice
❤️❤️❤️
Oh wow! Best wishes for your studies!
Tbh, that's exactly what I've done. Which drives my husband crazy, but he can deal with it 🤣
😯😯😯  I went to sleep at 11 and woke up at 6:25 and am taking a rest lol
Yes he can! It's for the greater good!
Oh girl, go back to sleep 🤣 I'll message you if the randomizer chooses you

[closed]   Blue Monday is the name given to a day in January (typically the third Monday of the month) to be the most depressing day of the year.   That may or may not be true, but I don't want anyone to feel blue, especially tomorrow. It is a tiny contest for some joy!  Rules:  - Your task is to say a compliment to yourself! I know it's not always that easy, but be more kind to yourself!  - Tag someone and make that person smile!   - Open for everyone (if you are not from UK, please have a gift card on your wishlist).  - Link your wishlist.  Contest ends tomorrow (Monday) about 7pm BST.
Hmm... I really like my voice. It's something I've learned to accept over these past few years. Apparently people have always loved the way I sound but I just didn't believe it lol.  [WL](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/2VFPTZ592S5I?ref_=wl_share)  u/Forsaken-Usual-7510 is an amazing human being and friend. She's always there for others and recognizes the uniqueness in them. If only she could see that she herself is a unique and special person. She is like a bonsai tree that has had to weather many storms, and yet she's still standing. That's because her roots are strong and centered within her empathy and compassion. Her strength is unmatched and not even a riot could stifle her.
Goor luck to everyone tomorrow!  Compliment to me: Good job on those tests last week!  u/AlexEastonGaming Thank you for always standing by me and dealing with me whatever happens!  https://www.amazon.nl/hz/wishlist/ls/1HPKMK87GGQW5?ref_=wl_share

I come from a family with a history of alcoholism, and while I’m not a full-blown alcoholic like my bio father, I’ve been relying on drinking WAY too much as a coping mechanism during the pandemic + my dissertation stress. I decided around Christmastime that I was going to cut out all weekday drinking after the 1st, and by god I’ve actually stuck to it. I feel a lot better and I’m exercising a little daily too. I’m really, really proud of myself, and my husband is so proud, too. I’m also smoking less, and I visibly dropped about 5 “alcohol puff” pounds in a week, so I’m looking much healthier, too. I’m incredibly proud of myself right now.   Thanks for the contest. I’m tagging you, u/dimethylxanthine, even though it’s your own contest. Because you’re my beloved little scalloped potato and I love you more than words can say.

Hi all! I just found this sub and am super excited to see what it is all about. It looks like a fun place! I am a 40F with a spouse, teenager, and 2 senior cats. The little free time I have is usually devoted to reading (anything from Jane Austin to Howard Zinn,) Netflix (usually a show not in English if it is just me watching,) and Gilmore Girls (to the extent my kid is named after characters.) My spouse is super into Star Wars and Marvel so I have learned enough by proxy to enjoy those fandoms as well.  If you ask me to do something that requires me to move I would say I enjoy swimming, but since I live where the air sometimes hurts your face and 2020 took away my summer pool thus adding lots and lots of lbs, I have recently gotten more into yoga (anything that ends in a shavasana can't be all bad, right?)  Feel free to AMA since I don't know what to really include here.

Thanks!
Yay for kitties! I love your profile pic. I have an orange tabby too!
Thanks for having me ☺️
So hard to just pick 3... Pride And Prejudice, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Fahrenheit 451 are all up there
Nobody makes me laugh as much as Rocket. Shuri is the most underutilized.
Marmalade is a 14 y.o. orange tabby. We adopted him and his sister Jinx (a tortie) when they were 8 weeks. Jinx passed from cancer 5 years ago, and last year the fam talked me into getting Nox who is a 9 y.o. tortie. Nox has the exact opposite personally of Jinx (which means she loves all people and has just learned to tolerate Marm.)  Edit: spelling cuz my autocorrect and ocd don't always get along
Thanks!
My spouse news a dog person too until I changed that. Lol! The thing I love about most cats over most dogs is you have to earn their love. Most dogs seem to love anyone who will give them a minute of attention. Cats decided when you have earned the right for their affection, making it so special.
I lived abroad in Brazil in high school as an exchange student, so I watch a lot in portuguese so I don't totally lose my second language, since it doesn't get used much. (Coisas Mais Linda and 3% are my favorite there.)  I really got into Asian dramas from various counties for a while (Crash Landing on You, Love Now, Boys over Flowers, and Good Morning Call.) Right now I am hooked on a Turkish one I found, but each episode is the length of a movie so it is taking a while (Love Me as I Am.) In my Netflix "continue watching" list there is always Gilmore Girls and a non-English drama within the first 3.
Hi!
Anything with chocolate usually. My grandma used to make something we call chocolate chip pie that I have to have every Thanksgiving it basically like a pecan pie but instead of pecans it uses walnuts and chocolate chips.
Marmalade and Nox! Nox is really more my kid's cat, Marm is my little shadow.
My imaginary lottery winnings will go to an indoor pool (since I live in the cold Upper Midwest.) 😆
I am still a newbie so I don't do anything crazy, but eagle is a good challenge for my balance right now.
Thanks! Where in Australia? I have a few friends from there.
Hi! Favorite holiday is Thanksgiving. All the family time without the extra stress of stuff. I love gifting things people truly appreciate, but not the forced aspect of it that Christmas brings. Thanksgiving doesn't have that!   I am definitely a water baby and all aspects of nature that I love tend to reflect that. My favorite animals are turtles. They go hand and hand with cats on my ranking. I even had 2 pet turtles at one time, but when my kid was a toddler I was spread a little thin and found them good homes where they got the attention I used to be able to give them.   I was a PCA for 4 years. Not with kids but it was one of my favorite jobs ever.
Thank you! Am am enjoying looking around and getting a feel. I can't wait to have a contest or something but need to get a feel first. Will definitely have some questions when I am ready for that so I will let you know!
Hi! Constantly changing but my favorite English language shows on Netflix (other than Gilmore Girls which is my favorite show ever) are Outlander, Lucifer, and Cursed. Non English list is much longer but the top ones are 3%, Coisas Mais Linda, Boys over Flowers, Good Morning Call, Crash Landing on You, Love Now, Love Around, Love Cheque Charge
Pão de queijo e cafezinho  Brazilian cheese bread and strong sweet coffee. I could eat that every day.
Thank you her name is ginger ;) what’s yours?
I hope they bring you lots of joy. I love my cat because she brings cuddles on her own terms and makes sure I stop what I am doing to pay full attention to her.
You're most welcome!
Oh that's so fun and such a good way to retain the language. I took 6 years of french and remember nothing. Maybe I need to start watching some french shows.
Wow how delicious!!
How sweet! They sound like little darlings. 💖
I've been practicing yoga for years and I'm still a newbie LOL. My body just isn't that flexible! Eagle is a good one for sure. I love dolphin!
New South Wales, just outside of Sydney.
oo I have read boys over flowers but havent gotten around to watching it yet! If you like horror, Marianne was fantastic! Its in French! And I LOVE Bring it on Ghosts, which is korean!   I will have to look into a couple of those! I recognize a lot of their names!
Mmmm sounds delicious!
His name is Marmalade. Named him after the orange tabby my grandmother had when I was growing up. He also has a few no nicknames that are NSFW, but we love him anyway! Lol
For sure! That's what I love about cats too. It's an earned affection.
It is suprisingly helpful with comprehension.
I have a couple friends in NSW. One in Newcastle and another in Sidney (originally from Port Macquarie.) The 2020 plan was to visit finally... Bit then 2020 happened. Lol.
You have to watch the original Korean one. The Meteor Garden version (same storyline but in Chinese) is ok, but not as good. I don't normally love horror, but have seen Bring it on Ghost and enjoyed it. If you liked it try Oh My Ghost. There is a Korean one and a Thai one. They aren't the same and both are good, though I maybe prefer the Thai one a bit more.
:) that’s too cute I just love cats :)
Ooo I will check it out!! Thank you!!!

This one's for my late and great dog, Buddy  [Make Me Smile - Sam Ock](https://youtu.be/E5SkV02_Hhc)  My adolescence was horrible, but Buddy was a dear friend and a constant source of happiness in those dark times. I used to dance around the house listening to this on the speaker with him. Even though it's been 3 years now since he passed, my feelings are the same.
I haven’t any friends, so I dedicate [Sisters Are Doin’ It For Themselves](https://youtu.be/drGx7JkFSp4) to my mom and sister!!
u/TheNUTRONIC I have no idea who you are, but I saw your name while browsing the directory on the User Tools Page, and the first thing that popped into my head when I saw it was the song called [Clown Prince](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYr4Or60uwU) by Aussie Hip-Hop Group, Hilltop Hoods.  Edit: Where I saw the name
u/late_to_join_reddit this song is for your heart. I love you.  https://youtu.be/2FMtxACKlYM
I'm dedicating one of my favorite songs, [I'll Get By](https://youtu.be/A1m0xdTN56E), to u/ssmith71608. This song has gotten me through a lot of anxiety and tough times, and hopefully it can help you too during your hard days. 💛
Hahahha it’s perfect

Welcome Em,  How do you like working at a library? Is it too quiet or do you find it’s exactly the kind of peace you were looking for?
Welcome!! What are your pets’ names?
Welcome aboard! How are you today?
Welcome! Any favorite books?
Welcome to RAOA, Em.

Hello and welcome
Hi! Welcome to the sub! Enjoy the wonderful community 💕 What is your favorite dessert??
Hi Em and welcome! I’ve worked in libraries and loved it! Do you enjoy your job?
Welcome to the family! What's your favorite movie/series?
Do you have to shush people?
Welcome!  I used to work in a library too.  It was much more... Wild... Than you'd expect.   What do you like to do outside of work?
Welcome, Em! Do you like working at the library? What do you like to read?

Hello and welcome! Whats your third favorite dinosaur?
Ohhh, working in a library was one of the jobs I hoped to one day have when I was a kid :-) What is your favorite aspect of your job?
Hi Em!! Welcome to you and your fluffballs 🥰
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Hi. I have a dog too. He’s a nightmare but funny. Tires me out. What kind of dogs do you have
Hello and welcome!! Libraries are so calming! What are your favorite genres?
Hi! Honestly working there is a mixed bag. Sometimes it is quiet and I can read an entire novel and have nothing happen. Other days everything is happening and I haven't had a chance to sit down half the day! I do love it when it's busy and people need me to do something. Sometimes it is just a bit too slow for me though.
Thanks!!! Bella, Holly, and Pookie!
Thanks! Doing pretty well, thank you for asking!
Ahh that's super hard. I usually go by genre or author but favorite books overall probably Paper Towns, The Giver, and Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.
Thanks!
Thank you!! ^_^
Thank you! I like your name!
Thank you!! This community seems so nice already! I love anything chocolate! I'm a big fan of ice cream and I usually either have Ben and Jerry's Half Baked  or Häagen-Dazs chocolate peanut butter. What about you?
Hi! I do like it! I wish I could do more but alas I only have a B.A. in English. So I'm trying to get M.A. in library science to become a reference librarian! What kind of library jobs have you had? I'm a circulation assistant currently.
Thank you :D Hmm I love Dead Poets Society and I'm a sucker for disney movies! The Lion King would be my favorite of those!   TV series - I've watched Gossip Girl and Gilmore Girls a lot. I don't often get through many series though. Maybe I just get bored easily?   What about you? What are are your favorites?
I work at an academic library so conversation is usually welcome. Though if people get to be so loud I can hear them from my desk, then yes I do. But it is a rare occurrence.
Oh I can imagine. We have some wild times too. Did you work at a public library? I mostly like to listen music, podcasts, read, and watch tv!
Mostly yes, but some days I'm ready to quit right there and then. I love to mostly read YA fiction and memoirs but I am constantly trying to expand into other genres! I'm trying to read 50 books this year and am half through one.
Oh gosh I don’t really know too many dinosaurs! I’d say Bob, he never does the dishes.   Seriously though probably Maniraptora.
Oh what did you end up doing instead? I like being able to help students! I'm able to help them with their research a bit when the reference librarians are busy and it makes me so happy when I see them understand and really get into whatever it is they're researching.

Thank you! My fluffballs say boof and meow!
Happy New Year! OH BOY HALLOWEEN. I love horror movies and being scared and dressing up and decorating and just everything about Halloween!! Oh I think my favorite thing about nature is that it just is and lets you just be you. Also birds of all kinds. Where I work I often see Killdeer and my backyard has seen its fair share of Cardinals!   Oh when I was a substitute at the very end of my time working I was basically a classroom assistant for a teacher who taught high schoolers with special needs!   Hugs back!
I have a collie and a lab!
YA fiction is number one!
Pookie! Love it. Nice meeting you, hope to see your name around here often!
I'm glad you're doing well!
Thank you.  How are you?
Those all sound delicious! I really like pineapple upside down cake and macaroons 💕
Same! I worked circulation and shelved books. Nothing too exciting but I enjoyed it. I have a BS in history (minor in English) and I dream of getting an MA in Library Sciences so I can be an actual librarian. Good luck to you and I hope that you accomplish all your goals!
No,  I was working at my campus library.  But at the begining of 2020 I was working in my city's public library but with the education department for a homework support program, not as a librarian.
Aw man I hear you. Oh cool! YA fiction can be so good. My goal is 75 but we'll see if I make it haha. I think I'm on number 6 now.
I'm a center manager at a wellness and recovery center :-) Awww that's so wholesome!
Well there's a lot of Halloween people here so you're gonna be making some new friends. I'm not a horror person I don't have a good heart and I usually turn the sound down lol I now working in a high school with special needs children and I absolutely love it. And I do agree nature is one thing that allows you to be who you are. Hope you're having a wonderful evening
Yes!!!! Do you have a favorite author? or favorite books?? I love the Poison Study series by Maria V Snyder and the Splintered Series by A.G. Howard
Thanks! I'll try and do more than lurk lol. Seems like a nice place!
Thanks! I hope you are too!
I'm doing well! Just hanging out. Might do some laundry in a bit. How are you?
> macaroons  Macaroons are different than macarons, right? Or are they the same thing. I like those little french cookies.
Yup that is basically the job but I convinced my boss to let me do more! Thank you :D I've actually been accepted into a program for this fall! I hope your dream comes true as well!
Ah okay. Did you enjoy the homework support program?
Wow 75! I hope you make it! 6 is great considering it's on the first month of the year!
Do you like being a manager? Lol yeah I guess! I just loved research as an English major and it makes me sad when people just do an assignment because they have to and not because they love their topic.
I’d love to meet other Halloween fanatics. That’s fair! Horror isn’t for everyone.   Thank you! I got some cleaning done and am now watching a movie. Hope you are too!
Super cliche but John Green. I also like Robin Sloan! I feel like my favorites are constantly changing.
I'm good. Just watching tv and playing some staffe stardew valley while it snows.
I also like the little French cookie ones 😂😂 those are the ones I’m referring to if there is a difference 😂😂
That’s so awesome!! Congrats and thank you!
It was one of my favorite jobs honestly. It's made me consider pivoting and not really following the career. I graduated for so there's a lot of thought to do ha
Thank you! Yeah last year I did 60 but I kind of had to make up a LOT at the very end of the year, so this time I'm hoping to get a good start in case I falter later in the year lol
It has its pros and cons :-P I'd say the biggest con is now I'm the one to blame if anything goes wrong haha
Be sure go to DAILY thread,daily n u will meet tons of new folks. Enjoy your stay!!🐭🌻
Ooo  both write so many good books though! My all time favorite author is Naomi Novik!
Oh a cozy Sunday! I live in the south so we rarely get snow. What's stardew valley like?
I think there is! I never know which one is which! Someone I knew during undergrad would make the french ones and bring them to school! Free macrons!
Thanks!!
It's interesting how something can make us go down a completely different path! What was your original plan?
You managed to read 60 books in 2020?! That is incredible!
That sounds overwhelming!
I’ve never heard of that author!
It's a farming game with little quests to do for the town folks. It's quite fun and a bit addictive lol. I'm from Montreal so we have snow for 5 months lol
I'm still on my og plan haha.  Research scientist.  Doing some cell line developing and research at work currently. Developing covid vaccines etc.    I'd need to get back into school for any pivots and I'm not ready to alend the money on that yet.  Especially consoderog since I'm still I school for my masters and can't actually work on it cause covid. Have to start the research h all over too 😩
Just barely! So 75 is going to be quite a challenge but fingers crossed :D
It can be, but I'm grateful for the opportunity since most places would require a degree for the position I'm in :-)
ooo Uprooted is the best! Favorite book!
That sounds adorable!! Woah 5 months of snow!! We get the tiniest bit here and everything shuts down!
:0 Woah that sounds intense! And yeah I can understand not being able to do stuff cause of Covid! I hope everything works out for you! Maybe 2021 will be a better year!
I believe in you!!!
I'm happy to hear you appreciate it! That probably makes you like it even when times are tough.
Oh fantasy. Not really my taste but it seems like a cool book!
Ya it takes a lot for us to shut things down but I love it.
Yeah same. Either way we both have work we can do so that's a plus already for 2021 haha
Aw thank you, friend <3
It does help, and at the end of the day, a job isn't worth sacrificing my happiness so I try to leave the work problems as work and remind myself that it really is just a job. A job I love and that is way more fulfilling than most other jobs that are available here, but still a job. The boyfriend and dog are what matter most to me, so I enjoy the time I have with them as much as I can :-)
Haha fair!!
Oh! I'm glad you enjoy the weather! Lots of people live where I do because they wanted to escape that kind of weather. (Pretty popular place to retire)
Yes it is!
Welcome! :)
That's wonderful! It sounds like you've got the whole being an adult thing figured out.
I bet they do. Winter is not easy for older folks
The only problem is that since we live by the ocean our winters can get to be just as bad as northern winters. Though I guess the upside is that we don't usually get below freezing.

Honestly speaking, I've lived in Dubai for 9 years before moving to Canada. And while I much prefer small towns these days, as a tourist Dubai is just absolutely beautiful. The skyscrapers are like nothing you've ever seen. The malls have fake snow for skiing. Literally anything you could imagine is present there. The food is incredible. Even the American fast food chains were delicious, although the Arabic food is definitely the best. For instance, they had their own local version of fried chicken in which they gave you hummus and naan with it. Trust me, it's soooo delicious.  Also Dubai is quite modern in terms of laws. You can literally get pork from a shop or liquor while a mosque is 500 metres away. The only thing that might be annoying if you're not used to it is the morning prayer call from the mosques. They'll wake you up at around 5 am.   There's places to visit like the half underwater hotel on Palm Island. Or the amazing water parks :) there's tons of fun things to do with kids. If you want to visit a more interesting side, you can even go up towards the mountains of Fujerah which are incredible. Or to hot springs that will make your skin feel brand new again. Especially your feet!  The best part is that Dubai is quite safe and doesn't have the same risks as Mexico or Thailand may have. I can definitely give you more information if you'd like!
I would choose Thailand. Depending on what your kids like, but there's a lot of cheap food there. There's also sporty activities if they are into that too.
Probably Mexico. They have fewer rules there for teenagers to inadvertently break and get into a lot of trouble for.
Since you’re a single parent traveling with teens, I would go with whichever has the best deals. Idk where you are based, but airfare alone can get quite pricey on long flights. That being said, I’ve heard southeast Asian countries (like Thailand) are extremely cheap once you get there. You can pretty much live like a king for like $100/day including food and lodging. It’s just getting there can cost a lot of money depending where you’re coming from.
Hm I think I would do whichever the group was all most interested in. Maybe a group vote and see which place comes out on top. I think Thailand might have the most learning experiences but the Caribbean or Mexico could be more relaxing if you just do a resort.
What’s the costing of food like?  The vouchers I have will cover flight and accommodation for the week
I would probably do Thailand or Dubai! I think there would be more for the teens to do. Though I've never been personally, I've watched travel videos.
caribbean !
Thailand or the Caribbean (because I live here) 😅
I’d say Dubai. Pretty teen friendly as in lots of fun touristy stuff to do but since it’s a pretty conservative Middle East country (way better than most) it’s very family friendly. You can chill in the beach in a bikini, wear clothes you can in most western countries and enjoy alcohol if you’re a tourist but safety is great in most places and is very tourist friendly.
Not exactly those places, but related - Boracay in the Philippines. It's been a while since I was there but when I went it was white sands, beautiful water, and a tiny island without even cars on it. Once you actually got there everything else was really cheap compared to a lot of other tourist areas. It was one of my absolute favorite trips.
Caribbean gets my vote and my boys would agree :)
Caribbean!  I have only been to the Caribbean and Mexico but the Caribbean wins out.  Your teenagers would love the beaches, the snorkeling and the other activities too.  Whichever you choose ... enjoy! 😀
Caribbean
Thank you. This is amazing.
Can I ask the boys ages? And what they do there? My two are 13 and 15 and are total opposites of each other. I would have to have two separate holidays to keep them happy.  They need an itinerary, as much as I do really
No problem! Happy to answer any other questions you have
Now they are 24 and 21 and they too have always been opposites. In the Caribbean if one likes the ocean the other can still have the hotel pool, and brothers on vacation will always find something to bond over. There are also tons of activities and places to explore with a large tourist population so safety is good. Mexico is very unsafe even at tourist locations. Dubai is the middle east with very strict laws that are very different. Ive been a single parent for many years and the best way to decide is for you to look each countrys tourist saftey and local laws/customs, then when you have 2 final choices show your sons and see which they like more. This is just how I did things and it worked well for us, hope this helps and hope you have a safe/great time!!!
Many thanks. I have one of each. The boy is sporty and active, the girl is definitely not and has autism. It’s such a hard decision.  Basically I booked a holiday before Covid but has been cancelled now so have to use the vouchers on these places. I haven’t got to pick yet so will do plenty of research and look at what you said. Plus I get so anxious about things it worries me going alone. But I’ve saved for 4 years for it. We will enjoy it. Thanks so much

/u/claricia obligatory who's your favorite doctor?
Ooooh thank you! :D  Also THAT IS A HARD QUESTION. The Fourth Doctor is great, but I also really love Matt Smith's Eleventh Doctor. I think that's because when Smith got the role, I was just about to hit my mid twenties and there was a lot more I related to than when I was a child. Tennant's Tenth and Capaldi's Twelfth are also pretty high up there on the list. I have not yet seen any of Whittaker's Thirteenth but I'm hoping to fix that soon. :) How about you?
I'm very partial to Tennant, he will always be my absolute favorite. Matt Smith and Capaldi are tied though and were also amazing. One of the things I really love about Dr. Who is that each one has a distinct personality and way they approach the doctor but it all makes sense, especially the way they talk about them (the man who regrets, the man who forgets).  I've seen a bit of Whittaker and while I like her well enough (the transition is always hard) I feel like the writing got way too in your face political. I liked the more subtle politics/"just be a good person dammit" messages of the previous seasons.   Also haven't watched much of the old stuff, I found it kind of hard to get into, but I should give it another shot one of these days.   How bout companions? I'm a Pond fan, but Martha was pretty good and Donna eventually grew on me. Rose was my first and definitely special for that, and I liked her Bad Wolf thing a lot, but she often kind of annoyed me.
> One of the things I really love about Dr. Who is that each one has a distinct personality and way they approach the doctor but it all makes sense, especially the way they talk about them (the man who regrets, the man who forgets).  Yes! I look forward to seeing how each new Doctor comes to life. How will they differ from the last one? What will carry over? How will they dress? I love to see it all come together and how their personality meshes with their companions.  > I feel like the writing got way too in your face political.  I've been hearing a lot of the same thing about the writing. A lot of people feel like her Doctor is being stifled by it, so she can't shine in the role the well that she would with better writing. It's a shame. I guess I'll see how I feel when I can finally get around to being able to watch it.  I LOVE Amy, Donna's second for me, followed by Martha. I absolutely do not at all like Rose at all. She irritates me so much. Not-Companion Companion fav is River. I would die for her. lmao.
Absolutely on River, one of the best characters of all time!

u/stopitlaura, my new buddy caaaaaame!  I love her so much. I usually play purple (because my baby sister wants pink and i acquiesce every damn time), but i wish i could play Pink so she’s perfect and i love her so so much!  I shall call her Temmie after one of my favorite gamemates!
How cute!!! I’m playing this game right now!
He is so sus!
How cute!!
Lol!!! You’re so sweet! I’m so glad it arrived safely, and made you happy! :) it was a lot of fun to make.
I love that name! Temmie sounds so adorable.
Ooooh some lilypichu vibes. She’s cute and so are you. 🥰
We should make a thread in the discord or something so we could play an RAoA game sometimes!!
I just had to look that up, but yes. So fluffy and cute!!
Lol. She plays the pink avi in among us and has a Pomeranian named Temmie. 😂

Closed  Hey all! I’ve been MIA a bit these last couple of weeks, but I’m still here! I got hit with some devastating news after New Years and it sent me into a nasty depression. I’m not 100% but I’ll be okay.  Anyways, I like the idea of being a consistent gifter, so I promised myself that I would host at least one contest a month this year so here is January’s contest!   Rules are:  -DBAD  -Must be active in RAOA   -US only (Sorry international friends)   -Comment the color you associate with January   Winner will be picked at random. Contest ends Sunday the 17th around 6pm PST
Light blue ❄️ I hope you feel better soon ❤️
White! Snow snow everywhere!
A deep step above navy blue!   I’m sorry you’re going through some stuff. I’m glad you’re back and always here if you need to talk 🧡
January is storm blue for me. Not in a bad way, it’s just the color that immediately came to mind.   I’m sorry you got terrible news. I’m thinking of you.
Welcome back! I hope you start to feel better soon!  I associate the month of January with this color ❄️ for obvious reasons!  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
Hugs :(  White.
I hope things get better soon💕  I see white and blue when I think of January.
Definitely blue! Whenever I see a shadow cast on a blanket of snow during a sunny day, it looks blue to me. And the cold also reminds me of blue 😜 Like always my DMs are open in case you want to talk about anythin.  Thanks for the contest 💙
An icy blue for sure! I live in the Midwest so usually it’s just a snowy, cold mess.
Hugs  Light blue
Gray.   Sending a power blast of positive rays your way.
Polar ice blue   Have a great day and chin up!
Sending you positive vibes!   Burgundy color is what I associate January to be.   Thanks for the contest
Blue-gray.  Thanks for hosting a contest.
Thanks for the contest! I hope things turn out ok for you, just do your best, and find somebody, anybody to talk to when things get bad please ❤️  I associate January with white. It’s the beginning of the year, there’s (usually) a blanket of snow everywhere, and we have no idea what the next year holds - it’s a blank canvas 🤍
Sonata blue perfect color for January  Gives it a pleasant winter vibe
hoping that you are okay, giving you a hug! 🌸  baby blue is a pretty colour for january! 💗
Hey there friend! I’m glad to see you! Sending all the love. ❤️  The colors I associate with January are red and light blue. Red for Garnet, which is my/ January’s birthday stone, and blue for winter/ snow / ice! :)   Great question, I love it! Thanks for hosting friend! I hope it’s a good day!
Virtual hugs! Hope you feel better! 🤗❤  I think White for January. Still have that end of winter vibes for me.
hey, i'm sorry you had some hard times. :( i hope things get better for you soon!  january is very grey to me.
I associate the color blue for January. Cold, frozen, sparkley blue. I always paint my nails blue in January. It's such a contrast to the Christmas colors of December. Feels like such a new wintery color.
Sorry to hear things aren't so well for you :( I hope things will start looking up for you soon!  I always associate January with a pale, icy blue. With Christmas and Valentine's Day dominating the colour schemes for the other two Winter months, it seems fitting it should have an actual Winter colour.
I'm so sorry to hear that you've been going through some difficult times. Hugs, if you would like them.  January is slate blue, the color of the crone's hair as she exists in my imagination.
I hope life gets better for you.  And white and green because january makes me think snow is melting.
I'm sorry you were hit into sadness. I'm glad you're back.  January blue. Yesterday was my birthday. It's normally a sad day. But this year between cards and all the love in here it was the best yet!!  I hope you have things a lot easier from today forward. Thank you for the contest.
I'm so sorry for your hard times...depression hitting hard here too so I feel ya.  It sucks but I'm glad you're here.  January is a cool, clear blue, almost white, like the color of a blue sky reflecting off snow, but the edges are dark, deep blue and a little bit of red sort of flaring on the very edge before it turns into black.  Yay synesthesia, always making things complicated!
Oh. Hope things get better.   January associates with blue
January is a crisp light blue. I hope it only goes up from here
The color I associate with January is a light blue   I’m sorry and I hope things get better for you ❣️
I associate light blue with January  Hope you feel better soon
I associate gray with January because of the gray sky when it snows.  Thank you for the awesome contest!!!
I associate light blue with January! Thank you and i hope you feel better!
Baby blue 🙂 its a hopeful color.
Thank you for the contest and I hope you are feeling better soon.  I associate dark red (wine) with January. The birthstone for January is garnet which is a rich, dark red.
Light blue. Like from the Frozen color palette.
I'm so sorry you had some devastating news.    I definitely associate light blue and white with January.   Thank you for the contest. ❤
I hope things are getting better or more manageable. I’m sorry to hear that you’re not yet at 100% but I’m glad you’re being strong. :c   If you ever want to talk, my inbox is always open. Or if you want to get spammed my semi-funny tiktoks, I’m your girl.   <3   Personally, I’ve never associated January with a color but it reminds me of new beginnings and the end of winter vibe (even though it’s just the midst) so maybe I’d say a pale blue fading into a pastel green. c:
I hope things keep getting better for you! Every day is a new beginning.   I associate January with a warm gray. Not a negative association, more like a blank slate.
I hope things get better for you soon! Thanks for the contest! I associate January with peacock -blue.
I'm sorry to hear you haven't been doing well, and I know I'm just an internet stranger but I sincerely mean I am here if you ever want to talk. Life can sometimes be a rollercoaster, but you are strong, and you will get through this.   For me I associate January with a very pale gray. Basically the color that the sky always seems to be here. I used to consider it the most depressing month of the year, but my now husband takes offense to that since his birthday is in January LOL
DBAD?
It depends on the time of the month, but I’d typically associated January with a white or silver sparkle/glitter!
Oh no sorry to hear about your bad news :( Sending you positive energy and thoughts!  The color I associate with January is a sparkling gold. It reminds me the champagne people might drink to ring in the year and represents that each new year is a new opportunity for us to spin straw into gold by working toward our resolutions and keeping a positive mindset.  Thanks for the contest! :D
Hope your month turns around and good news comes your way!    I associate blue with January because it’s cold and I think of ice and snow.
Hi, I hope you find a way to feel better! Depression is no fun, and it seems that winter months amplify negative feelings, even without having terrible news come your way.   January for me is associated with a dingy light grey. Like the color of snow filled clouds on an overcast day.
Wishing you the best. I associate a bright blue bc it's still winter, and I try to start off the year bright :)
I'm so sorry about your news. Sending hugs 💛  I think I would say I associate ice blue with January. It's cold and snowy, but also new.!
January is grey with black speckles.  I hope yours gets better💛💛
I think I associate light blue with January, for snow and ice. Even though those things are scarce where I live. Thanks for the contest and I hope you feel better soon!
Sending you lots of hugs and love! Don’t forget to take care of yourself ❤️ I associate January with the color light grey! It reminds me of the worn snow! Thanks for hosting!
♥️💛   I would said light red and black for January.   *hugs*
I would probably say a light blue (almost pastel) and  white.  I hope you feel better soon!
I think I associate shades of blue with January. Like the light kind of minty blue makes me think of the light reflected off of fresh snow! But dark, deep blue reminds me of how early it gets dark.
I don’t know why but when I think of January I think of the color red. It’s probably because I don’t like January and red makes people angry
blue-grey, i hate january, and i hate that the sky stays shades of grey all month rather than turning real blue
January is blue for me. It's cold and dry. I don't like winter very much.
I've never considered what color I associate with January, until you asked. The color that immediately came to mind was Red. I can't offer an explanation, but I guess mine's red!   I do hope you continue to heal from whatever is going on. I'm sorry you're dealing with depression, period. It can be such a cruel illness ❤️
I like to think January is or would be the color Baby Blue because another year was just born, it’s cold, lonely in a big world,  and feels like a new baby boy who just  needs to be cuddled.
My birthday is January 30! I think of January being a nice icy blue, not like a bright/vibrant blue, kind of grayish. Thanks for the contest!
I always hope for snow in January so white is the color I associate with it.   I’m sorry you are not feeling great. I hope things turn around for you.
Oh, no...  I hope you will feel better.  :(  Give your squishmallow a hug for me.  ❤  Happy New Year!  The color I associate with January is blue, because it's hella cold.  XD
Boo for depression! Are you feeling better? Stay hydrated, you don't need to be depressed and dyhrated.  I would say January is blue
Aquamarine.  Not just blue, but aquamarine.
I hope you start feeling better!! I associate the color white with January! A lot of places get snow and my fingers turn White because of the cold!
Dang. I’m so sorry for your bad news and your struggle. Winter is tough in normal times without that. Here, I’ve written you a poem:  The sun hangs low   On the horizon  Something awaits  It is the return  Of light  Beneath the earth  All things wait  To grow  Never alone  Filled with hope  For spring
I'm so sorry to hear that you're having a tough time :( I hope it gets better soon. Sending love <3  I usually associate January with an icy blue color. January always feels so cold and bland and it's definitely my least favorite month.
I feel like January is brown. Everything is dead, occasionally covered in frost or snow which then leaves behind mud. It is not pretty to look at.
Thank you for hosting a contest and wishing you the best in support as you overcome your depression.  I associate January with the color white, as in a new slate and new beginnings, empty and void initially during the winter, a blank canvas waiting to be colored by the seasons to come
January is white because of all the snow here!
I'm sorry you're going through a tough time.  I've never thought of a color for January, but yellow immediately came to mind, so I guess I'm going with yellow
I associate white with January not just because of the snow, but because of the bleakness.
January is blue, but not a bright blue. It’s the blue so understated that it’s almost white. How when you stand outside in the icy wind with your breath frosting in front of your face, everything is quiet and cold and all the color is sapped from the world and you feel yourself turning blue. That kind of blue.    I’m so sorry for whatever it is you’re going through, and I hope everything is okay. 💕
I’m sorry you got some devastating news, wishing you all the best. Hugs.   I associate gray with January. Gray is cold, snowy, quiet, and calm. Maybe a touch of sadness in gray too. Another year gone, new resolutions to complete.
i immediately thought of blue
I'm so sorry for the trouble you're growing through. While it's not much, if you ever need an ear of a stranger to talk to my DMs are always open.  January is grey, with specks of light green for some reason.
I hope everything's okay, if you need anyone to talk to my dm are open. Thank you for hosting this contest.  I associate January with the color blue. Outside the sky is always blue, either from the rain or snow
I mostly associate blue with January. January is snow and a lot of fabrics, wrapping paper, etc depicts snowflakes on blue backgrounds.
White! Because I think of snow, but that's really funny because i have lived in Florida for 20 years now lol
Hey there!! I've been rather MIA on the sub these past few weeks because I've been dealing with depression/anxiety as well. If you ever want to talk, I'd be happy to listen. Thanks for hosting this contest. It's very thoughtful of you. 💗  Blue is the color that I associate with January.
Grey, but cheerful.  It's good to see you back! What have you been doing to take care of yourself?
Usually a light blue color because it’s cold and I associate that color with cold :D Thanks for hosting!!
Glad to see you back. I’m sorry you got some bad news, but I hope things turn around for you soon. ❤️  I associate gray, blue and yellow with January. Gray because the sky is usually pretty gray where I am. Blue because usually January brings a little snow and it’s always cold. And yellow, because occasionally we’ll get a really sunny day that breaks up the gray and blue and it feels absolutely wonderful. The sun always comes out eventually. ☀️  Thank you for hosting!
Welcome back!   I think January is a light blue color.
Dark blue is a January color
I’m so sorry to hear you’ve been dealing with something tragic. I really am. Hugs to you. January makes me think of red, because my mom was born TODAY, in January and her birth stone is garnet. Thank you !  Hang in there. We’re thinking of you.
I’m about to host one as well. I’ve been busy as of late.  I want to say January is white. It’s fresh. It hasn’t quite been stained one color or stood out as a bright/dark shade. I think as it changes into February, it becomes more colorful.  Thanks for the contest.
I associate a winters blue with January like the sky as the sun comes up on a snowy morning
I associate January with white. Fresh, clean, and snow. 😊  Thank you for the contest!
When I think January, I think blue! I Hope you’re feeling a bit better ❤️
I agree, blue for sure! And thank you, that’s very sweet of you 💙
It means don’t be a dick. You’ll see it around /r/random_acts_of_amazon often

u/Bekki37 Thanks for entering my contest! I personally selected your response as one of my favorites and your description for this one really hit a heart string. You are so beautiful even though its not so easy for you to see it.
Wow such an amazing and heartwarming gift!!
Thank you so much :( this made me teary. It means the world to me that you chose this pin to start my collection. I appreciate this more than youll ever know.
Just a bit more detail, we didnt get it finished for him and I feel guilty because i didnt think to help him until 3-4 months went by. Had I been thoughtful, he probably would have gotten to ride on it.  He would work on it and id watch him struggle. I had no clue what i was doing, but he helped me. The first time I showed interest he was trying to thread something with a tap & die set and couldnt get it. When he was in the hospital, I did it for him. The joy on his face was what kicked me off into helping.  I gathered some of the shavings from that particular part. He has some buried with him and I have a lil vial of the shavings too.   When he passed away, I remember walking to the car garage at the hospital. I looked up and seen a cloud in the shape of this pin zoooom by so fast. I know it was "him" riding off into eternity.  Alsooo... My father in law bought the bike from my mother. So, its basically mine some day :).   Thank you again, this is such a precious pin to me as you can tell. Now I can go to sleep all warm and sentimental :)!
You really are such a nice person 💜🙏 i didn’t see your contest entry, but what you wrote here was so beautiful. I wish you the very best! 🤗
I'm so glad that this has such a strong significance to you. Its so hard to lose someone you love. Wherever he is, he'll be so excited the day you ride it.

This is my first time doing a contest, so let’s see how this goes! This contest will have 2 winners!  Here are Da Rules:  1: US only (just to keep things simple)  2: Have gifted at least once before  3: Tell me about a niche interest you have - maybe something you don’t share in common with a lot of your friends or maybe something you feel embarrassed talking about with other, totally judgement free here!  4: DBAD, like I said, judgement free!  5: The winners will be someone I share an interest with, and something I haven’t heard of before but find interesting.  And finally 6: Tag a stranger you haven’t talked to on here yet :)  The end time will be Jan. 22, 2021 at noon (I work nights, so noon is like my midnight). Good Luck 🍀
I love building wood puzzles! I found them at the top of quarantine and they’ve kept me sane. Currently in the process of building all the Disney ones. My grandma-in-law got me a projector one for christmas and I just finished it. [here’s an album of all the ones I’ve done so far!](https://imgur.com/a/H6SH27D)  Hey u/VexedKitten94, how you doin?
I like organizing things and making lists. I have at least 28 in the “notes” section of my phone. And that isn’t the only place I store lists.  u/Cassopeia88
I like to spin yarn! Idk anyone else that does that, lol. I mean, I’ve seen people post pics of their yarn, but idk anyone irl or have any internet friends that spin. So that’s kinda cool! It’s really chill and enjoyable for sure! :)  u/coraelizabethh Hi there stranger! I rolled your name on the random generator! I’m Marissa, it’s nice to meet you! :) I hope you have a great night!

I grow succulents! I love them and have over 30! I also enjoy gardening. I have been growing succulents for three years, and gardening for two.   u/gdarn16 I don’t believe we have met.
Hello! Nice to meet you.   I like to repurpose things, like MacGuyver. I didn’t realize it was a hobby of mine until recently, when i do it a lot more because resources are limited.   For instance, i repurposed some old pvc-mounted banners to make outdoor shower walls and hooked-up a broken garden hose to the washroom sink to run warm water to the outdoor shower. It was a much needed covid precaution and has been working great for months. 👍   u/PizzaPlaceGirl, we haven’t met, and i live your username!!! 🍕🥰 what’s your niche interest?
(I’ll tag u/sadfacenobody - hi new friend!) I collect indie/non-mainstream brand perfumes. Most of them are essential oil based and are scents based off of famous writers or works of art.
I shop thrift stores and the goodwill bins for photo albums, packets of letters, baby books and so on. Then I build the Family trees for the person in the book or photos, contact them and send their family heirlooms  back to them free of charge. It helps me keep my genealogy & kin finding skills sharp, but also it feels good to return pictures to their family.
so i do kind of a niche form of roleplaying! i like to write on livejournal and other journaling sites, and the concept is playing characters you create yourself with the inspiration of celebrities as their faces. i enjoy supernatural storylines the most and i focus on writing homosexual relationships, i kind of feel weird as a female telling people that's what i enjoy. but it's what i do. it's a fun, therapeutic escape.   u/Cardlady2021 hiya! how are you doing?
I don’t know if this is a niche thing or not, but I really love reading manga and watching anime. I do it a lot but I feel embarrassed about it.   Like my siblings are the only people I shared this hobby with, well them and you guys. But I don’t let my friends or other family know.   Like if someone walked in on me watching anime or reading a manga and asked me what I was doing I’d just generalize “oh, just reading a book” “oh what book” “oh you know, I don’t really pay attention to the names of books when I read online”    I hate that I feel embarrassed by it because I really enjoy it.   Hey u/thisISme4now, what’s up? What are your interests? What is the weirdest question you’ve ever been asked?   You are not obligated to answer my questions by the way! So no pressure 💜
I don't know if this counts as niche, but I'm really into cryptography and I enjoy writing ciphers and trying to break ciphers written by other people.  Hi u/sadfacenobody! I don't think we've gotten to know each other yet. What's your niche interest?
A niche interest I have is a fandom called Homestuck! It’s an amazing web comic that I love and cherish dearly.  u/GreenKid94, hi! We haven’t talked before!  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest and allowing me to share my interests with you! ✨💛
hi!!! one of my many interests is BTS. My friends and family would never even consider them because it’s “cool” to think kpop is lame. But this group in particular helped me out of a deep depression. ALL of their content is so pure and positive. Music, videos, shows, interactions with fans are always wholesome and uplifting. To me, the music is great and of course they’re hot, but more importantly, they’re talented, intelligent, creative and very conscious and considerate of their fans. Not many other artists are that dedicated to their fans. I’ve come as far as creating a BTS shrine in my closet - i’m like Helga from Hey Arnold. 😂💜   u/doobadedo what’s your niche/interest?
My interest is serial killers. I love learning about them and just crime in general.   u/doobadebo We haven't talked before :-)
I am interested in wet specimens and bug mounting! Wet specimens are essentially deceased animals in formalin that was ethically sourced! And I love bugs! And I love displaying them! I’m a huge animal enthusiast and having these items makes me feel connected to them! What about you /u/Teaggie
This is a cool contest idea.  I'm a D&D fan, so maybe one of my more niche hobbies is watching the show Critical Role. It's a D&D streaming show that's been gaining a lot of popularity over the last few years. They have a bunch of other shows than just their D&D stuff and interviews with other voice actors. It's really cool to get to know the personalities and relationships between everyone outside of the D&D game. I've even had the chance to meet some of the cast members at Seattle's Comic-Con! Other than that I really into collecting Playstation achievements called trophies. There's a whole subreddit surrounding helping each other and showing off difficult trophies obtained. It gives me an extra goal when playing video games and adds to the sense off accomplishment of completing something extra tough.   u/mc3pio I don't think I've ever spoken with you. What's a hobby you enjoy?
So I have this in common with my friends only because they also did it in class with me and enjoyed it as much as I did. Our ecology assignment was to find a dead animal’s head and deflesh it. I now have a beautiful [opossum skull](https://imgur.com/gallery/AyxX47W) named Percival, or Percy for short (of course I named him). I haven’t had the chance to do it again because school doesnt leave much time for anything else. Ive seen where you can get the same result from burying the skull in the yard for a long time but what’s the fun of that? 😝 I promise I’m not a serial killer nor am okay with animal cruelty. They were already dead and it’s not desecration but preservation and appreciation. Also I love to pick and peel things so it was sooo satisfying!   u/daisiesandink What’s your niche interest?
3. Ive become a little obsessed with the SCP Foundation series - like writing in the wikia, cleaning up content and creating my own characters, and making art of my favorites. Im 36 so i kind of feel like im too old to be a fanfic writing cosplaying stan.    Imma tag u/panicatthehogwarts for having such a cool, memorable name.
Hmmm I have a few things I am interested in. I really love needle felting and bullet journaling! Those are my two ways to be creative. I'm not particularly good at either, but it is honestly just really fun. Plus needle felting has been great therapy for the past 4 years. Nothing like stabbing something 1,000,000 times to make art!  Also does homeownership count as a hobby? My husband (and everyone around me) thinks I am crazy but I LOVEEEEEEEEE homeownership stuff. DIY projects, planning, reading about it, seeing what other people do. I constantly want to talk about it, and plan, and make stuff. My husband literally yesterday said I should do something for myself with a gift card I recently got instead of spending it to fix up our house. I tried to explain to him that house stuff is my joy but he just called me weird. It probably isn't that weird, but if I talked about it as much as I want to I'd be called a loon.  Okay last thing I am going to ramble on about (but hey you said it was a safe space!) is all things baby. I literally spend several hours a week curating a baby registry, combing it over, adding to it, changing my mind, taking things off, researching. Hoping to have some excuse to buy said baby thing. I'm not pregnant, but I am a mama in waiting (via adoption.) So it isn't that crazy. But something I've noticed is that when you adopt no one is excited for you. They're excited you're adopting, but they don't really care about your journey to parenthood. No one asks you questions, no one gives you unsolicited advice on how to parent, no one even asks you how you are coping with the wait. You don't get treated like a parent to be, and you don't get to talk about your excitement with others, or the pain you feel when you are almost matched but the expectant mother chooses someone else. So I'm off here in the corner spending hours nesting for a baby that may come tomorrow, or in two years. LOL If you look at my posts even in this sub I talk about adoption a lot because honestly it is the only way I get to talk about being a hopeful parent. I'm sure it is annoying though so I'm trying to contain myself.  u/bobacupcake we've never talked but you seem cool! What are some of your interests?
I like a kind of logic puzzle called nonograms or paint-by-numbers. The end result is pixel art. I even make some of these puzzles. I also like a hard variation on sudoku called Killer Sudoku or Sum Sudoku, where there are extra regions or cages labelled with numbers, and the digits in each cage add up to the number.  u/jeherohaku, how's it going? What is a Whovian?
My niche interest is recorders. Not a lot of people play outside of third grade. I play with my friends. I prefer tenor.   Hey u/DebStone how’s it going?
Hmmm this is interesting!! I love reading all of the comments. I don't really have any interest or hobbies that are as interesting/cool as some of y'all's so I know I won't be a winner but I am still going to participate! I do love sticker mosaics and I like learning about/watching stuff that has to do with crime/serial killers! And the last one I can think of is THC Edibles. I love experimenting/trying new recipes, putting thc into new fun foods, etc!   u/psychologicalpenguin hiii!!! I tagged you because I saw your answer and got excited! Haha. Nice to meet you 😌
I don’t think I have any niche interests that I’m embarrassed about. I do like learning about true crime but that’s pretty common now, just look at all the serial killer documentaries on Netflix. And Bailey Sarian does her Murder Mystery and Makeup Monday on YouTube that’s very popular! She tells a true crime story while doing her makeup! I love her videos. I do like ASMR eating and trashy reality shows. Those are my guilty pleasure! 😂  Thanks for the contest! u/doesyawannasnog hi stranger!
I’m disqualified but I’m a sport card lover! Always up to new friends!
I love anime! I know that plenty of anime are popular in the states but some of them feel so obscure to us that it gets lonely :P Houseki no Kuni is both hilarious and beautiful.  I also love the Norwegian musician AURORA who's become more mainstream because she was in the famous song of Frozen 2 and a new animated film. I also love bushcraft, board games and seances.   [u/Lucy\_Leigh225](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lucy_Leigh225/) I think we're strangers so I've summoned you xD How's life?
I read a lot that is my main hobby but My one that most I know don’t do is keeping indoor plants 🪴    u/the_monkey_socks hi there
I love talking to random people and hearing about their real life experiences . Sometimes people take advantage of that, and sometimes i learn some invaluable lessons from their journey .
My main hobby seems to be less niche as time goes on. D&D has really picked up in popularity in the past 4ish years. It's been real strange being asked to GM compared to the days when I'd have to really sell the game to get a group together. On the other hand, the amount of accessories and people creating art for D&D is such a boon. I am loving that so many creators are sculpting things I can 3d print and paint at home.   My hobby that is still niche is the 3d puzzles. I've done both wood and metal puzzle kits and they're really rewarding to complete.   u/darth_advocate What are your hobbies?
Congrats on your first contest!! Hm, one niche interest I have is collecting stuffed animals. I'm 32 so it can be a bit embarrassing to talk about, and when people come over and see them all I inevitably get a weird look from them.   Stuffed animals have always brought me comfort and I love looking at their cute little faces. So maybe my living room doesn't look like a page out of a home design magazine because there's a chair full of sloths and various other friends scattered about, but they bring joy to my days.  I'll tag u/caffinatedstories, whom I'd love to talk with beyond an introduction. What's your niche interest?  Thanks for the contest :D
My niche interest would have to be having shrimps as pets. I have a few shrimp in my guppy tank and they're so cute!  u/be_braver I hope you get to really take needle felting to the next level this year :)
tagging u/unicornbomber, who is a friend i haven't met yet!  My niche interest is mixed media and outsider art, which no one in my family or circle of friends in real life really understands or likes the aesthetic of.  I like to go online and follow like minded artists who inspire me
This is a really interesting contest!   I kind of have two niche interests with my husband: rollercoasters and tandem biking.   We have currently ridden just over 250 rollercoasters together and actually got married on one local to us.   As for biking, when we met he really enjoyed biking and I went with him a few times but ended up getting very nervous trying to keep up, especially at road crossings and such. For my birthday one year he rented a tandem bike and I instantly loved it. I can help him out and just enjoy the scenery while he largely takes care of road crossings and other people. Plus we can talk to each other MUCH more easily so it really helps with just connecting and spending time together. We've gone on a couple of 50 mile rides together and are hoping for even more!   Hey, [/u/EL4900](https://www.reddit.com/u/EL4900) ! How are you this fine day?
Not entering because Canada lmao but wanted to congratulate you on an awesome first contest!!!
I really enjoy learning about different methods of food preservation! I like to buy food in bulk, and to can food, but the problem is stuff goes bad quicker than I can use them when I get them in bulk. I pickle food, dehydrate things, and chuck things into my chest freezer.   My current obsession is root cellars. They're a great way to store root vegetables and canned goods! I have watched hours of YouTube videos about building root cellars, and have considered everything from burying a broken chest freezer in my backyard to digging a whole 12x12 earthen structure.   u/fairypants, I don't think we've ever talked before. How are you? What would you store in a root cellar if you had one?
I really enjoy learning about all sorts of dermatological conditions- I especially love cysts, dilated pores of winer, and rhinophyma! Dr. Pimple Popper is one of my favorite tv shows and youtube channels! Everyone I know thinks I'm crazy, but I love it! It's so satisfying to see treatments, and I love learning how the skin works! If it weren't for the costs of going to school, I totally would've loved to have become a dermatologist!  u/NihilisticNoir I don't think we've ever talked before. How are you?  Thank you for the contest!
An interest I have is geocaching! I’m obsessed and could do it every day. I love it and it’s just so fun for me. None of my friends or family do it.   Thanks for the contest. u/BriTalksAlot Hello stranger!
Wow, those look really cool 😎 they must be really challenging. I’d be afraid of breaking a piece and not being able to complete it 😱
Those are beautiful!!
Thank you for the tag, I’m doing well! How have you been doing? ☺️  Wow, those are absolutely lovely! I’m super clumsy so I don’t know if I’d be able to put some of the small pieces together haha!
Those wood puzzles are SO cool!
I too use the notes section of my phone quite frequently for idle thoughts and things to remember later.
Hello! I’m the same way, I have 58 😑 I do need to go through them though.
Though I’ve never done that, I’ve always been kinda interested in the process. That’s really cool :)
That is so cool! When I was younger, I leaned how to card wool, spin it into thread using an old fashioned spinning wheel, and then weave it into fabric using a loom. It was a lot of fun, and I've never met anyone else who enjoys spinning!
Hiii! I’m cora. It’s nice to meet you too! Spinning yarn sounds so interesting!! I don’t know anyone that does that :)
hello hi! thanks for the summon! i wish i had a better green thumb! the only plants ive managed to keep alive are an english ivy, a raven zz plant, and a snake plant! any suggestions?? lol
Actually, this is great, is it cool if I PM you a succulent question?
That’s a really cool interest! I bet that comes in handy a lot more than people give you credit for. Finding creative solutions to complex problems is so much fun 🤩
I collect "special" coins. In the UK they occasionally make coins with a picture on it and it'll have a purpose. So once the made one for the battle of hastings. You can buy these from the royal mint which costs a bit of money but they're also circulated so whenever I get one I keep it in a box and collect them up. Idk what I'm going to do with them but I think they look really cool. ☺️  Also your niche interest is so cool!
Ooh, you must have some really unique scents that are hard if not impossible to come by elsewhere 😲
Hi! Thanks for the summon 😊   That sounds super cool! I've been wanting to try a new perfume lately but have no idea what I would like and don't want to spend alot on something that I end up never using haha.
Aw, that is such a sweet hobby 🥰 I’m sure the family appreciates your time and effort immensely.
I’m good! I’m a CNA loves sport cards and video games. I have an upcoming surgery trying to keep off my mind ugh!!!
Hey! I like plants, cooking, my Cricut, sleep, baths and reading! Weirdest question would be ‘so how did your kids get taken away’. The reason that was weird is because it was assumed. My kids live with their dad because I have medical issues. I told a customer of mine that I was getting my kids that weekend and they said that. I was like wwhhhaaattttttttt.
Thanks for the summon! 😊 that sounds really cool! I don't know if this counts as niche but it's all I can think of. I'm really into astrology and tarot and love collecting basically anything that has to do with it.
I guess technically you can tag me, we haven’t talked yet haha. Hello 👋 (I too play games, am a weeb, and doodle :3)
Heyo! I love Hey Arnold 😂 I haven’t listened to much of BTS but I can definitely appreciate wholesome artists. I need more niche interests, but have a bunch of obscure comedy anime that I can’t find other fans of 😜
MOVE IT FOOTBALL HEAD!
While I haven’t really given them a listen myself, I have friends who are obsessed with them and I’ve seen stuff about them here and there, they seems like really nice people :)
Ooh, what’s your favorite way to get your fix?
Well we have so much in common zap buddy!
Hey Penguin! It's not the same as the real thing but the anime Higurashi has some murder/fantasy mystery which you might like :)
I haven’t heard of them before. What’s something about them that you find interesting?
Wet specimens are so cool!
Hi u/MisterMagellan 👋 thank you for the summons and it’s nice to meet you! My bf has told me about Critical Role and if I was a little less shy in real life, I would love to try D & D haha 😃🙈😊 I appreciate the magic and creativity ❤️  Right now, my main niche interest is what I call snailmail or sending physical mail (letters, cards, postcards, art) through the post. It blends two of my creative interests, writing and art, into something that’s especially fun to do bc it’s getting kind of outdated. It’s also nerdy when I admire the stamps 🙈😆 most importantly though you get to meet and connect with people.   Anyways thanks for the contest, it’s a fun one! u/bobacupcake I haven’t met you yet and I love your name... what is a fun special hobby you do? 💕
I too am a D&D fan :) I haven’t really gotten into Critical Roll yet (though I’ve heard a lot of people say good things about it!)
That is something that I haven’t done before, but the end result looks like it should be in a museum or on a teachers desk or something. Beautiful ✨
You’re never too old to do what you love! My mom is almost 50 and cosplays with me and my sister and has fun doing it. Don’t let something silly like your age deter you from enjoying things ❤️
Okay, I've been on this journey, and it's a crazy paperwork journey. We did have one adoption fall through, and it was devastating. But when you pick up your baby for the first time, that'll be the happiest day of your life. I remember my words to my son, "Come here, honey!" Your life changes instantly. I also remember a negative thing, that for some time I felt like a fraud when I said I was his mother. That feeling did go away! So don't be surprised or ashamed if you experience that. If you have a child of a different ethnic background as we do, you may get odd or rude questions. The worst was a stranger blurting out "How did you get a boy?" We adopted from South Korea, where more baby boys are available for adoption than baby girls. But she just assumed he was Chinese, where notoriously there are many abandoned girls. This woman didn't even say hello first. I assume if your child is the same ethnic background, it won't be obvious to strangers that you adopted. You might get questions about your pregnancy and birth story! The funniest was when I was at the store with my adopted son and my biological son (we're white), notably *without* my husband. And an Asian store employee said what a nice family -- one took after dad, one took after mom! She assumed that my husband must be Asian. It was such a funny but well-meaning comment.  Anyway, enjoy your journey, and I hope you get matched soon!
ooh needlefelting is a lot of fun, that is actually one of my interests too! 🌸💗 i haven't done bullet journaling yet but it sounds like fun, what do you tend to journal about? 💭 hmm one of my more 'obscure' interests is candy making! 🍬 it gets a little messy (and sometimes things go very wrong) but it is so so much fun to just make your own sweets and enjoy them later! 💫   your diy projects sound awesome, my parents are the same way when it comes to house upgrades and such! they made me help pick out new floorings and paint colours and such lol it was fun! 💫   ooh wishing you a lot of happiness on your parenthood journey, that is so so amazing and beautiful! 💗 i do not think that is annoying at all, i think it's awesome how passionate and determined you are! 🌸 what kinds of things are you looking forward to doing with your bundle of joy?
Hey! Also a fan of nonograms - have you ever tried fill-a-pix? It's almost like minesweeper but with pixels.   I'm actually doing pretty well today considering it's about that time of the month and I usually really struggle emotionally with that.   Whovians are Dr. Who fans 😊 Highly recommend if you like sci-fi and haven't checked it out!
Boris Vian (French: [bɔʁis vjɑ̃]; 10 March 1920 – 23 June 1959) was a French polymath: writer, poet, musician, singer, translator, critic, actor, inventor and engineer.

I’ve never tried Killer or Sum Sudoku, but I do love playing different levels of regular Sudoku, so I will def be looking into this 😯
How fun!
I've seen you around, hi! :-)
Heya! The Bailey Sabrina youtube channel sounds awesome and entertaining to watch! I’ll probably check it out later today! I’m currently watching 90 day fiancé and I’m pretty sure that counts as trashy reality tv 😂
You don’t have to participate, you can also find new friends on here :)
I will admit I have played that song on repeat a few times 😅 always glad to see another anime lover though ❤️ I need to find more board game lovers too!
What kind of books do you like to read? And what your favorite plant that you have? :)
I love hearing stories and about other people’s lives. Sometimes you can even gain some new perspective on things that you’re dealing with at the time.
Right?! D&D is so popular now. Seems like it used to just be a thing for the nerd kids and now groups of friends who never expressed interest before are suddenly telling me about how fun D&D is and I'm just like "Yeah, I know." LOL
I’m glad that D&D has gotten so popular because I’ve had people that I wouldn’t think play D&D asking me to play with them :) it’s so much fun, and I get really caught up in the character building 😅
Stuffed animals are the best haha. I wish I had more. What’s your favorite, or if one is too hard, then like top 3?
omg that sounds so fun! There is something so relaxing about watching an aquarium! I always love the shrimps at the pet store! What is your favorite thing about being a shrimp owner?  And thanks!
I’ve heard about this before I think. Isn’t it kinda like someone hides something somewhere with clues on how to find it, and when you do, you take a picture of it and put it back for others to find? It sounds pretty cool, I just don’t think there’s enough people in my area that would do that 😅
Hey there new friend!! I've seen you around 😊 I've been geocaching once or twice. It was really cool!!
The castle took me a solid three weeks. There are some spares of the tiny, breakable pieces. Gotta take breaks for letting my fingers heal a bit lol
Thanks!! They move too!
I’m doin alright! Had a super lazy day.   Thanks!! I love them, they’re super cool to have around the house
But do you have a list of possible recipe ideas? Of video games that you’re interested in? Of gift ideas for family/friends? Of Halloween decoration ideas?  😂
What are yours about?
Thank you! Yeah! I crochet too, so I wanted to be able to make my own yarn to use, lol. But lately I’ve been spinning more than crocheting! Haha. I just have a little drop spindle, not a spinning wheel or anything, but it’s neat! Plus you can use solid color wool for needle felting too, so you can use the same supplies in different ways, which is nice too! :) Id definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in checking it out! It’s not nearly as hard as I thought it would be, lol.
Ohhh, that’s so stinkin cool!! I’ve looked into carding a bit, and it looks really cool! Would definitely be fun I bet. And I bet making your own fabrics sounds really cool too, weaving is just amazing! I’ve watching some videos of people weaving, and theres one person who does the Reddit live stream videos weaving, and it looks like it takes so much dedication and talent! So mesmerizing to watch too. I bet the fabrics you made were beautiful! Did you make like thick blanket like fabrics, or thinner clothing types? I guess I’m really asking like, how small was the thread you’d make with the wheel? That’s so amazing, to make something completely start to finish like that! And I’ve heard those antique spinning wheels can be hard to use too.   I love spinning! Honestly when I first wanted to try it, I didn’t expect to like it as much as I do, lol! I’m definitely no expert or anything, def a beginner lol. But it’s just so chill and cool and fun! I could probably get faster at it if I sat differently, but I like to do it in bed while watching/ listening to the tv, haha. But I have gotten a lot better than when I started for sure! I’m about finished with the first ply of the one I’m working on, and I am so excited to get the second ply done and spin them together. The colors are sooo pretty and I’m so excited to use it! Lol. But yes! I’ve never met anyone who was into this kinda stuff either, so that’s really cool! Love it!
Lots of research!!!!! That’s what I’ve done. And the sub r/succulents
Yes!!!
Thank you! It does... at least i think so. 😉🤣 it really is fun, rewarding, and frugal! ☺️
Wow! 😲 That’s a pretty cool interest!!! I am so curious to see what the coins look like! ☺️ Did you know the US did something similar? We had special picture Quarters ($0.25) made for each of the 50 states, territories, and National Parks. I tried to grab them as I saw them in circulation, but it was so hard to find some of them in mint condition. I did manage to collect all 50 states, and i save every Hawai‘i quarter i come across. 🤫🤣  Thank you! 🙏💜 it’s a fun interest ☺️
I usually use BPAL brand- they have testers for around $5 if that would interest you! They have lots of resell groups too
me too!!! what kind of surgery are you having? i'm having my gallbladder removed on thursday.
How do circuits work? Do you just program it to do the design??   Also! Damn! That’s such a weird thing to assume! Isn’t there also joint custody where the parents switch every week? I’m pretty sure my mom would be super offended if anyone asked her that. Smh. I’m sorry about your medical issues though! 💜
Oooh! How awesome! It’s so nice to meet you. What’s your favorite game and anime?
i neeeeeed more comedy anime in my life!!!! my favorite comedy is Devil is a Part-Timer.
😂😂😂 i miss that show!
if you’re ever interested in giving them a try, i recommend looking up “Singularity” “Black Swan” or “On Manifesto” :))
I love books! I read The Phantom Prince by Elizabeth Kendall recently which is about Ted Bundy from the perspective of his long-term girlfriend and it was really good!
That's why we're zap buddies :-) 💙
It's been a loooooong time since I've watched anime!
With wet specimens my favorite part about them is how beautiful and restful the animals look at eternal rest! It makes me feel as though I have a better understanding of death as weird as it sounds!
yes!!! a fellow wet specimen lover!!
hello there~! 🌸 thank you for the summon! 💗 ooh snail mail sounds like a lot of fun, i would really love to get into that soon but i am a bit too shy to start! 💭 what is your favourite thing to write about? 🌸   hmm.. a fun special hobby i do is plushie making! 🌸 i love making new fluffy little friends, they are so so cute! 💗 i also love to organize, it's like a big puzzle and it is really fun to put things right where they belong and make everything look nice and neat~! 🌸
You know, to be honest I didn't know people still sent snail mail letters until I jumped on this sub - I think that's so cool! There's little as exciting as finding a special letter in your mailbox just for you :)  I really hope you get the chance to try D&D someday! It's definitely the best to play first time with people you are comfortable with; it makes the game much more fun and gives you a lot of freedom to try something new. Even with just one or two friends a first session can happen, so I'm rooting for ya!
Woo! More D&D fans! I would definitely recommend checking out Critical Role, and you can start right at episode 1 of Campaign 2. It started off for me as a way to get introduced to 5e, familiar with the classes and new rules, and kill time. But as it went on I started to learn who the voice actors were and now I just enjoy watching anything with them in it!
Thank you! ☺️
Your mom sounds amazeballs.  So you guys play SCP Foundation??
Thank you so much 🥰 I am so excited for that day.
I honestly just get ideas from Pinterest for bullet journaling 🙈 I use it a lot for lists of things. Gratitude logs, vacation plans, goal setting, etc. Candy making sounds so cool! I remember making chocolate lollipops as a child and it was really fun!  There are so many things I am looking forward to as a parent! I’m excited for the baby giggles and cuddles obviously. But even as they get older I am excited to be able to support them through problems, and see what kinds of interests they have!
I too am a whovian along with my family, though I am verrry behind currently 😅 I plan on catching up sometime soon. I commissioned my friend’s mom to make the 5th doctor’s scarf actual size for my dad one year ;)
Same!! Board games are the best bonding activity for new or old friends 😂 and awe I love the feel when you find a song that hypes you up even after several plays 😜
I love romance and true crime the most but I can pretty much read anything.   I have this plant my mom and grandma gave me when I had my daughter and it’s just beautiful her name is Luna I don’t know what she is exactly but her leaves are green and red and she is not a ponsinetta plant she is something different she is just lovely
Right, i love that
Exactly! The same people that told me "Nah, that seems so nerdy" are the ones asking me to run a game now! I'm thinking of the always has been meme reading your reply.  What's your favorite character design you've seen?
That's great! It's popularity has been so helpful.   What's your favorite character you've made? I personally get caught up in the world building and political intrigue.
My absolutely favorite is [this one](https://imgur.com/a/IrMWtMS). His name is Plattypie and my husband bought him for me one day when I was really down and going through a lot. Now whenever I need cheering up, I look at Plattypie. But we have so many I love. We just got Plattypie another platypus friend called Zappy who's blue and purple with crazy fur. And we have a koala (named Koali lmao) who is the worst at clinging to things but is super cute LOL.
Honestly I just love to see how they interact and swim around! I want more but they're so expensive, the colored shrimp are like $5 per shrimp 😭
Yes it’s an app on your phone and it leads you to the general area and you read about the cache, and then search for it. Some of the ones I have found are big, or you have to solve a puzzle to unlock it. They’re really neat. You’d be surprised as to how many are in your area. What town do you live in?
Oh I didn’t even think about splinters. That’s gotta be painful. But I’m glad they come with extras!
Ok, you might have me beat there 😂
Oh so many things, my favourite skin care products, my favourite bakeries, character centric episodes of shows, to do list to name a few.
That would be really cool to make something for someone that you spun the yarn for yourself as well, like and added layer of attention :) if the opportunity presents itself, I would love to try it out!
It was the thinner, clothing type fabric. Antique spinning wheels are definitely difficult, but once you get the hang of it is a very repetitive process, which for some reason I really enjoyed.   Growing up, my parents were big believers in the whole "know how to survive if society collapses" types, so I learned how to card, spin, weave, and sew (machine and by hand). I learned how to can my own food, churn butter, identify edible wild plants, build both a fire and a waterproof shelter, and many other random skills that were necessary for survival hundreds of years ago.  They've moved on from that way if thinking, as have I, but that knowledge still litters my brain 😂
Sweet thanks! I'm going to look into those :)
All female don’t know yet how extensive   I hope yours goes well
You connect it to a computer and use the Cricut program.   Yeah the dad and I have a great relationship so we have a great set up. The assumption was just mind boggling! I was stunned and it took everything I had not to blow up on her. And thank you❤️ I have several chronic health issues that take a lot out of me. Raising three teenagers on top of owning two businesses would be damn near impossible and they understand that.
All time favorite game is The World Ends With You :) I can’t wait for the new sequel or for the anime to be released!! Favorite anime is always a toughy, so I’ll go with my favorite of last year. I really enjoyed watching BOFURI, and can’t wait for the next season. I think it was based on a visual or light novel, so maybe I’ll pick that up too.  What about you?
You might like the show  [Barakamon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22789/Barakamon)!! It's hilarious and adorable :D
Walmart $15 for the whole series lol but I believe hulu has it.    Catdog tho...
I will have to give those songs a listen then 😊
You know, I have a book about him on my wishlist already, but I think I’ll have to add that too!
I understand where you’re coming from, makes sense to me :)
Ok, awesome :) is there anything wrong with the first campaign, or was it just not that great?  Oh, and have you heard of Not Another D&D Podcast? It has some of my favorite people from collegehumor playing D&D together, so I’ve been hooked since I found out about it :)
I don’t know about that, what is it?
Now we just a board game that involves getting songs stuck in your head 😂
I’ve starting reading true crime books myself, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole of romance books before though 😅 staying up all night reading “one more chapter” 😂
I've almost started to think I need to branch out into some other niche game that's less popular. Warhammer, maybe? LOL.   In my current campaign, a friend plays a rogue and shadow monk combination — it's a super cool mix because you get all the good benefits of being a rogue plus magic. How about you?
My favorite character is actually for Pathfinder since I played as her the longest. She’s a Sylph and she multiclassed Monk and Magus. She also had plans for a type of Paladin for her later levels, we just never got there. She was kinda OP haha.  What about you?
Are your freshwater or salt water? I love watching their little antennae
Well there aren’t even that many pokestops in my direct area, I usually need to drive a bit to really get any good stuff. I’m in South Eastern Pennsylvania. What’s the name of the app?
It’s okay. I embrace my strangeness 🥰
That’s what I was thinking too! I haven’t done it before, but I was thinking it would be cool to spin some blank white wool yarn that I could dye myself too. Like an extra extra layer, lol. ;) but yeah! It wasn’t too expensive to get started either, which is also nice, haha.
Ohh wow! That’s so interesting! Honestly it probably is all really good to know. Not to mention, now you know how to do some cool hobbies too. ;) I’ve always thought canning your own food would be a fun hobby too. We get the homemade canned pickles at the farmers market every year, and they are amaaaazing, lol.
Well I am sending my good vibes your way and praying for a speedy recovery for you
Oh! It's awesome that you guys have a great relationship and figured out a system that works for you! I'm proud of you for remaining composed, sometimes it gets difficult to deal with people that make such assumptions, so go you! That sounds like so much to handle! You're awesome!
sweet! i’ll watch it for sure! i’m currently trudging along One Piece, but i like to give it a break and fit in short series in between. Is this one on Crunchyroll?
yes. catdog, dexter’s laboratory, angry beavers,  courage the cowardly dog. man, i’m getting really nostalgic now.
Do it!!
I’m glad someone does because my parents think I’m crazy!
I haven't heard of it, but used to love collegehumor so I'll make a point to check it out! I've also heard really good things about The Adventure Zone, a more humorous D&D podcast from the My Brother My Brother and Me guys.  Oh no, Campaign 1 is great (I've seen about half of it), but I know it's harder for some people to get into because it's less refined and a continuation of the cast's off-screen game (so you kinda start partway in a story). Campaign 2 is a bit easier to jump right into and you get to meet all new characters right from the get-go. OH! And I'd highly recommend watching it on YouTube (or at least part watching) vs just listening for it on podcast. Being able to see the actors is way more enjoyable and adds to the personable-ness of them all.
Its a fan-made wikia that I’m super into. Check out scp on youtube. There are a lot of awesome content creators, and i especially stan for the *Confinement* series.
Yea I do that all the time with both. Both genres are addicting.
That combo sounds like a blast to play with! My favorite character was a Cathar rogue who was a master at climbing and afraid of dogs. I might be biased because that was my own PC XD.   I'm planning on switching settings to keep things fresh in my next campaign. I'll be doing ravenloft setting starting with Curse of Strahd then building out my own horror story on top of it. I'd like to try Call of Cthulhu eventually too.
My favorite was a rogue Cathar from 3.5 star wars. He was a fantastic climber and afraid of dogs. Pathfinder is a great system too! I've played with it years ago but don't have any of the books now.
They're freshwater! Rn I just have amanos and cherries, but I definitely want to get some blue velvets!
It’s called Geocaching. I’m in a remote town of less than 10,000 people and there’s a bunch out here. But not really any pokestops either
That’s a really cool idea too, so many layers! Just like ogres 😂 My sister has dyed a lot of fabric for her cosplay before, just know there there will be stains, and get a big bucket - don’t use your tub unless you’re ok with it possibly being a different color 😅
Thanks and you the same!
If everyone was normal, life would be too boring 😂
I can see why it’s better to start on campaign 2 then, that’s for the heads up. Going to go subscribe to them on YouTube now actually. I would be so confused otherwise trying to go through the first one, I’m sure 😂  NADDPOD has Murph, Emily, Caldwell, and Jake as regulars with guests like Siobhan and Brennan sprinkled in. Honestly I just love anything with Murph and Emily together, they’re great :)
LOL! That's a good one. My character is obsessed with cows. If he sees one, he basically becomes a useless lump of "Awwwww." Oh cool that sounds awesome! Yeah Cthulhu seems really cool.
Fun! If you want to share some pics I'd love to see them! :)
Ok, I’ll def be checking this area out then :)
Lol, like ogres!! Yes! XD   Oh man, I bet that’s so exciting though! Haha. I bet she’s made some epic pieces. But yes! I think most people use like those metal cooking tins for dying yarn? I’m not totally sure, but the videos I watch show it being done in the kitchen! So fingers crossed I can use something disposable to do it, lol. I am not about cleaning out a bunch of stains! XD I’m dying my hair blue in the next couple days, and like my biggest worry right now is how much I know it’s going to stain everything! Haha
No problem! 😊 (pro-tip, I listen to them at 1.25x speed because they can get pretty long)  And I'll check out NADDPOD! I've already found out on Player FM. Thanks :)
Next time I get some good pics of them I gotchu!
Awesome I hope you find some good ones 😍
Get some towels you don’t care about, some old shirts, and use a pillow case that you’re ok with being blue haha. You can also get some trash bags, cut them open, and they them on the floor as like an added layer of protection. Hope the dying goes well!
Yay shrimpies!
Ohhh, trash bags!! Great idea!! Haha, I hadn’t thought of that one yet. Good idea. Thank you! I think I may put plastic wrap on my work area, the sink, and my ears too, lol.  I’m mostly worried about my shower with the stains! But someone else recommended some cleaning products that worked well for them, so fingers crossed that’s enough, lol. I also am going to let’s the color sit for at least three or so hours since it’s semi-permanent, so I’m trying to decide the best way to do that and still be able to use my glasses and do things. I have a shower cap, but I think I may put plastic wrap around the edges and around my ears before I start. Fingers crossed! This is my first “fun” color and my first time using a semi-permanent, so it’s a little different than what I’m used to.  Haha, I bleached it a couple days ago, and it is soo yellow blonde. XD it’s not orange or anything, just very light bright yellow blonde! My daughter keeps looking at my strange and asking when I’m going to do the blue, lol!  Anyways, sorry for rambling a bit! ;)
The plastic wrap is also a good idea! The less blue everywhere, the better. I hope it all turns out vibrant and only in your hair 😂
Hahah, thank you! Me too! XD

u/HauntedCoffeeCup you are love ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yaaay for toasty toast! Congrats! Very shiny! 💕
Congrats!!! 🎉 i hear you about toasters... we were just talking about them today when someone put on Wandavison. 🤭🤣 so hard to find a good one nowadays. When i was growing up we had two toasters ever. So much more reliable back then. Hope you enjoy your new one!!! ☺️
Never knew a toaster could be sexy lol. This is such a nice, sleek and non-frumpy toaster.  Enjoy some butter toast!  Side story (sorry I like to ramble)... I work retail and someone returned a toaster because it burnt the bread.  Guess they dont know there is diff settings lol.
Hooray for crispy toast!! I’m happy it reached you 🥰
🤣🤣🤣
lolzzzz
❤️❤️❤️ i am jumping in joy

I have an insta pot that’s on its way but it’s not a ninja
I have an instant pot and love it
I have two of them I have the Ninja Foodi grill and the Ninja Foodi. We absolutely love them. But the grill is freaking amazing. We cook burgers, streaks, porkchops, pretty much anything you can cook on a outdoor grill you can cook on the Foodi Grill and be just as good if not better.
I was gifted an instant pot but meh. I already have slow cookers and I didn't like having something redundant taking up counter space, when I could just make the same foods on the stovetop.
I have an instant pot duo crisp, that means it's also an air fryer. I love it so much. There's other functions but I use pressure cooker and air fryer functions the most.
What do you expect to cook in it, I’m researching now
Tell me your favourite things to cook in it
Oh I was trying to decide between the two! Sounds like you prefer the grill
Nothing specific just looking for easy and quick meals
Soups, Asian foods. Honestly I use more than my stove
Yea but if you get the grill make sure you get the one that comes with the temperature prob. It makes cooking meat way easyer. They are a little more expensive, but worth it.
Excellent. That’s what I want to move to
I’ve done pot roast, rice, etc in mine. I have the 3 quart cos it’s just hubby and myself

u/smallgingerlady
Omg this is amazing haha
I love the gif!!
I love bobby!
Bwahaha! Nice ☺️
That’s a nice gifted template
How do you upload moving photos (gifs?)  like this?
Omg thank you!! Also this is a great template lol
“Peggy!  There’s something wrong with the boy!”
I found an app that would let me write on top of a gif and that just uploaded it as a pic :)
Ah okay.  I feel like I’ve tried that before but, maybe not. I like the animated ones. And this is perfection!

u/effective_cupcake_24 thanks for the gifties. Ive recieved one, but I plan to wait a few days to see if the others come before posting a Thanks. Here's a small thingie to say thanks in the meantime 💜
You’re just the kindest!!
Awe, thank you! Yes the items all shipped separately.. the second one is enroute, the third looks like it could take up to a week longer. Hope you are doing well. ❤️

Contest closed  So, I have a confession: I have an addiction to toys of the ... not child variety. I am very sex positive and I am very open with my friends about it. My friends usually come to me for recommendations and I have a couple go to items for those who are just starting to explore or who need something new and fun.  Did you know that orgasms are a great stress reliever? They are! I would like to help you relieve some stress. I will choose one or two winners to receive a NSFW item.  Rules  1. DBAD 2. Be willing to add a specific item to your list, or else give me your address to send it to you 3. Tell me what stress you are dealing with this week 4. If you are comfortable, let me know how many toys you currently own.  I will choose a few recipients by the end of the weekend.
I’ve been pretty relaxed lately, being semi-bedridden, I don’t have anything I have to do but chill. But I got a package and a letter from my ex today, and I’m so stressed about it, I have yet to read the letter 😖  I only own one. But it’s just not very good. I can get it to do the job but I have to really work for it 😅
I'm dealing with the stress of the monthly Red Menace.    I have one toy. She's electric, if you catch my drift.
This is an interesting giveaway lol. Right now I am stressing over my 1 and 2 year olds, they are in the demolition phase... I have been cleaning nonstop... Help!!!!  I only have 1 toy, I haven't really opened my sex life up, but I am open to new things!! Thanks for the contest!!
How fun! I used to own quite a few, but don't have any at the moment.  The next two weeks are a really stressful time because work is ramping up to the end of the semester in two weeks and there's a lot I need to get done in not very much time. Plus, I'm teaching two sections each of three different courses next semester, instead of three sections of one and two of the other like I am currently. My work load is about to go waaaaaay up!
My work has been insanely stressful. I am a hospital pharmacist at a cancer centre, and we just opened up a new unit to admit patients with cancer who cannot be admitted to OTHER hospitals because of the surplus of COVID patients. Unfortunately, there was no money to hire any more pharmacists. So that means we are looking after even more patients.   The unit opened this week, and as luck would have it, I am the first pharmacist to work a weekend with it open! That means it’s just little old me reviewing orders and entering chemotherapy orders for he entire hospital 🤣 This weekend has been the busiest I’ve ever worked!  Not meant to sound like a sob story...I LOVE my job. But it’s high stress, and as I sit here (on call overnight), I’m thinking I need something to relax lol!  And I own no toys myself!
Im somewhat of a prude about sex other than dirty jokes and puns. Maybe I need a toy lmao. That being said, I dont own one.  No particular stress bothering me other than the stupid snow making life difficult as I hate being home.
We are in lockdown yet again and I am stuck at home all day every day with two crazy toddlers. They are great, I love them, but sometimes I truly feel like I'm losing my mind haha.
I own no toys. I do, however, have coupon codes for some, so if I don't win this giveaway, might treat myself to a thingamabob.   This week, I got misdiagnosed with COVID. I had symptoms of COVID and went to the doctor right away. Tested negative with the rapid test, but since I had the symptoms, they issued quarantine orders anyway, said I almost certainly had it, and ordered a PCR test to be safe. They said I'd get the PCR results within three days.  As we wait for those results, my whole family quarantines. My brother had to miss his first day at a new job. My dad missed work--which ended up being lucky because his main coworker got COVID and his whole department got sent home. My mom missed work and couldn't go grocery shopping. I had to FaceTime into my dad's birthday.  On the third day, I call in and ask about it. Turns out they totally lost the test. So I drive down, get another rapid test, and... it comes back negative. So now my Uber Driver account is still suspended for my quarantine period and I can't correct it, but at least I'm not stuck in my room?
I only own one toy but man is it amazing! This week I’m dealing with work stress! I keep getting asked to do things above my pay grade for my company without proper compensation because I’m too scared to speak up or say no! Thanks for hosting!!
[deleted]
Hi! Not entering, just wondering if I could get some of that advice? My fiancee and I have never owned any toys, and seeing as we still live with his mom we're not planning to yet, but what would be a great first toy for two shy people with both a female reproduction system?
I started a new job recently and while it’s fun, it’s a high stress profession and it’s only getting busier.   So um I am fairly certain I’ve actually never orgasmed 🥺
ooh nsfw toys are always fun! 🌸 this week's stress is mostly due to studies and waiting for a job interview! hmm.. aha.. uh.. i have quite a lot of toys actually.. a little too embarrassed to say the exact number but it is in the double digit range 💗
I have a lot of stress about school and my partner's health and other things too.  Thanks for the contest!
Stress: got fired awhile ago, horrible relationship issues, dealing with my friends neuroses, my mom panicking about everything, and still have the god foresaken 2020 Christmas tree up. Lol. Stress EVERYWHERE I look. 🤣🤣🤣  Toys: I ONLY actually own Hitachi. I should def branch out huh??? Problem is, after Hitachi, I have NO idea what to branch out to! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Honestly never bought one before. I've when I was bored and curious I experimented with things at home lol. Spent way too much time contemplating buying one but wouldn't know where to start or what is even worth it.      My stress is lack of sleep combined with family and looking for new work. It's a 3-way stressfest of misery lol.   &#x200B;  Either way, I say this is awesome, and thanks for helping whoever wins! This year needs a stress reliever for all the shit we put up with last year 🤣
Been stressing about my upcoming surgery less than weeks away....  I like vibrating toys more fun but I have one basic non battery operated that’s pretty neat it’s purples . I have currently 4 toys but one favorite.
Oh man...stress this week has been due to work for sure. I had three people come to the shelter and try to throw a “stray” dog over the fence which I stopped and then once I told them I’d help them they tied her up, literally ran to their car and peeled away.  Now I’m worried about the dog who is a Rottweiler and is very sweet but timid. Her arrival was very stressful for her and she is not showing well which means it’s hard for us to assess her which means it’ll be hard to place her.  I have 1 ol faithful now that gets the job done with some effort.   Thanks for hosting and thinking of all our stress levels 😏 this sub is so thoughtful
I own one toy and it’s honestly meh. This week I’m dealing with unaccepting parents (won’t call me my preferred name or pronouns), working in retail through this nightmare, and a breakup! I don’t see this year much better in all honesty.
This week office manager out, clerical supervisor out, new nursing supervisor and everyone needing something from me, I need clones and more hours in the day, too tired to do anything but stay in bed. As for toys I have one but definitely don't enjoy it as much as I should. If picked I will give you my address as I don't know how my doctors or office manager would feel about it lol
I love this contest.   I’m an online dominatrix and I have two go to toys for personal use. I’m always looking to try something new.   I’ve been stressing with trying to get custody of my niece that was taken in a state that has no family in. So we have to figure out how to get her back home. She is six so she is probably really scared and confused. That is the hardest part. I’m having a hard time sleeping due to all this. It’s very stressful and heartbreaking.   Thanks for the opportunity. You are awesome!
Unique contest!  Awesome! The stress I’m dealing with this week is looking for a job. Very excited for an interview next week at a local marijuana dispensary. I really need this job. Badly.  I believe I own 6 different toys. Toys are fun! Toys are great! Orgasms are a HUGE stress reliever! Thanks for the chance!!!
Hehee love your giveaway!  I am stressing about my career recently. I had to quit back when this all started because my work place wasn't taking it seriously and I live with family that is high risk. Can't wait to go back to work.   And I do not have any toys 🤷‍♀️ I tried to look once but there are so many varieties, it was overwhelming I gave up.
i'm stressed about my health... i had to take a trip to urgent care yesterday and the symptoms i had basically added up to "well we don't know" and the meds i got put on make me... nervous. but beyond that, just regular money and political stress.   i currently have... five toys? though i really only regularly use one of them 😅
Love this!! Orgasms are most definitely a stress reliever. I own 1 toy but prefer to relieve my stress with my boyfriend. He is better than any toy I could imagine.   As for what stress I’m dealing with - this world is upside down right now.
Orgasms are wonderful stress relievers- you’re super cool!🌸 I currently have two toys, the magic wand is the classic I’ll always go back to. Work related stress is currently on my mind
I'm dealing with work related stress, as well as a fight with someone I considered a friend over something incredibly petty that's blown incredibly out of proportion, my girlfriend getting covid and her taking his side in the fight, because he went to her first and I didn't mention it to her until after he did, when I didn't mention it to her because I figured there was no need to go to her to resolve a minor issue between friends, he felt differently apparently and did not want to go to me to resolve the issue. Anyway, as a result of that I have not slept more than 2 hours the past two days and I'm just at a breaking point because of it, I have no more emotional or mental energy to devote to, well most anything at this point. As for toys, I currently own a whole 0.
Wifes grandmother plus an uncle just passed a day ago, very heartbreaking. But stressful dealing with work and travel expenses. Oh did I mentions BILLS! Haha We have two babies one is 19 months and the other is 2 months . We barely get anytime together alone so when we do we make the best of it and but sex has been on the lazy side need something to bring us bk to life. Would love to give my wife a very special stress relieved night with a little bit of magic.
This is an awesome giveaway and I’m here for it! At the moment I’m going through a bought of depression and I’m so anxious and on edge CONSTANTLY these days!! Currently I own 5 toys but I’m working on extending my collection and I’m still sort of experimenting.. I didn’t own a sex toy until maybe 2 years ago and I stuck with the one until finally I decided to try some different things. So if you have any recommendations I’m definitely down!!
heeeey sex toys!! ain't nothing wrong with that. :D my current stress is that i will be having gallbladder surgery on the 21st. i'm pretty terrified of what my life is going to be like after because i have leaned so heavily on fatty foods my entire life. i have already made some HUGE changes but it's one thing to restrict yourself and another for your body to literally restrict you instead. so i'm going THROUGH it. this upcoming week is going to be a wild ride for me. :( i currently own three sex toys BUT none of them are designed for penetration, gasp! i really enjoy clitoral stimulation but i'm looking to expand a little bit. with that being said... i have added a few items to a NSFW wishlist. please let me know if you need a link.  &#x200B;  thanks for the contest!!
As a mom of two young kiddos I’m constantly stressed. My job is back to phase 1 because of covid so our hours are being eyed for budget cuts. I could use some... stress relief 😅 I have one toy but have ...toyed with the idea of adding to my collection. Thank you for the contest.
Currently, I am living alone because my husband has moved to West Virginia for a job and I won’t get to see him until May. I have to worry about packing everything in our house, hiring movers and moving three cats all by myself. I work at an animal hospital which is always stressful, but it seems like Covid has made it 20 times more stressful since last March.
I'm dealing with possiblity having covid. I get tested tomorrow.  I don't have many toys and the ones I have aren't that good. I been wanting one of the ones that sucks the lady bits lol
Well this is an interesting contest 😆   This week’s stress is my sister. I don’t want to type a long sob story, so I’ll try to be brief. She’s currently detoxing from heroin and I’m trying to help her through that, after she disappeared on us months prior. There are a lot of emotions in this house to say the least.    I own one, am very much a beginner with toys lol
I love this contest haha! ❤️  Right now I’m stressed I’m general because of raising a toddler during a pandemic. It’s hitting me hard recently that things won’t be back to ‘normal’ for a while. I love being a stay at home Mom to my daughter, but it really sucks that I can’t take her to the museum, to the toy store, to the playground, anywhere without worrying that we’ll get sick. It’s hard being in the house so much. She’s also teething and getting pretty restless so that isn’t fun either. 😅 This isn’t really how I pictured raising my first child and I guess it’s just frustrating and scary sometimes.   I have two toys, but one stays in the closet  because I think it would horrify my pretty vanilla boyfriend haha! I’d love to experiment more though.   Thank you for hosting!!!
This week I am dealing with getting my dad to sign his power of attorney to my sister due to his dementia diagnosis, while looking for a job, going to school, taking care of my kids and keeping the house functional. I only own one toy, it's a wand. I've owned several but they've broken or got lost in a move ect.
I don’t own any toys. Never have. But I am dealing with some serious stress. My parents aging is causing me a ton of anxiety and stress. I can’t escape it. But I won’t get super into it. Thanks for the chance to win!
I am dealing with hours being cut at work due to the holiday season ending (Yay retail!) and some trouble with my ears (I'm so dizzy it's not even funny) It's also really hard to find lesbians in the middle of nowhere :|  I currently own 1 toy! She is small but she is mine :)
Classes start back up on Tuesday, and I am *not* ready to go back at all. School stresses me out like no other, from exams to signing up for high in-demand classes to seeing how much the semester will cost!
Money is super tight right now (hours cut) so that's stressing me out. My spouse is having hormone issues that the doctor can't seem to figure out right now so that is stressing me out as well. And of course the hormone issues are making it hard for her to orgasm and lowering sex drive as well.   So yeah.  We have a few "toys" already but always willing to try something new. (When we do have sex with current issues.)   Good luck to all who enter!
I have been stuck at home for almost 3 month now do to having 3 covid scares, I lost my job do to health problems I've had for almost 2 years now pluse I'm a single mom to my almost 4 year old daughter, I have to finish school but dont have the financial stability at the moment to get a laptop, plus my mom is sick and has to miss work and sooo much more 😭   I dont own any toys but I sure need a stress reliever 😭
[removed]
Right now I’m stressing over financially security, whether I’ll find a job with my degree this year, whether my friends will be okay (two are COVID positive), and the messiness of my life. 🥲  I got my first toy two years ago. I’d never used one before, but it broke and I currently don’t have one. I’ve wanted to explore different kinds but I’m a bit hopeless in that realm of stuff and my cheeks immediately flare up at the thought though. 😖
The 501c3 nonprofit I volunteer for is falling apart. The entire board of directors was basically forced to resign, and all of the staff/ volunteers have been fighting among themselves since November. It’s just getting worse, not better. There’s been doxxing, threats, blackmail, the whole nine yards. It’s disgusting. I’ve just been trying to remind people to take care of themselves, but watching an organisation I love fall apart has been not only stressful, but also heartbreaking.   Thanks for the contest. I have quite a few toys, but only a one or two of them actually help get me off at this point. I could really use something new to help with that. Thanks again!
Awesome contest!  I have in the realms of... 20? Toys and so much lingerie!  I don't need to enter but I'd love to hear your recommendations!
😂 thank you for this contest.  I am working towards a deadline that was already extended, and I'm probably not going to meet the new one. Yikes! Lots of stress.  I own 2 toys, but I rarely use them, mostly because I don't have a partner right now. I would love to try something new though, especially something that is fun for solo play.  Edit: 2 toys, not 4 😅
I actually have a secondary NSFW wishlist lol. Currently I have 4 toys, but I just love to try new ones and collect them lol
This week, I am dealing with the stresses of all of the workload I have on my shoulders! I am sure a lot of us go through this, but JEEZ it was been so stressing to have so much work on your mind.  Thank you very much for hosting this naughty contest! 😈💜
You shouldn't have to work for it.   I say burn the letter :P jk  If you are spending time in bed, you might as well have some fun doing it! Good luck and thank you for entering.
Ugh!   Would she happen to be a Hitachi?
Oh goodness. I can only imagine. Thanks for entering.
You got this!!!!
👀
Oh my goodness. Wow! I imagine you have had been running ragged.   We are going to have to make sure that you have some stress relief after making it through the weekend.
I would be happy to help you pick out your first. I promise the one I have in mind is very small and cute and non-threatening. Toys are LIFE CHANGING!!!
I can't even imagine! Keep your head up mama!
Oh my goodness. That sounds like a whole mess. Im sorry you are going through that, but looks like it did turn out in your dads favor.   If you don't win, but want some recommendations, let me know. I love browsing!
Yay! I am so happy to hear that you have an amazing toy. I believe in you, start slow and set small boundaries by saying no to small things first!
I'll be scouting your list for sure. I need new ideas myself!
I am not sure if I am allowed to share specific links on here but I'd be happy to send you some via a PM if you would like.
Congrats on the new job! I believe in you, you got this!!  Oh man! I know that some people have a really hard time getting there. If you want to talk about, my DMs are always open. I am unsure of your age or your experience, but talking to a doctor about it if you have tried many times before, is scary but can be super helpful.
Oooh yay! Another toy addict. My collection is over 140 now, so please don't be embarrassed. If you win, I might need to talk with you a bit more to find out what you don't have. Do you have any specific toys that you are eyeing right now?
Hugs!
Oh man, you have the mother of all toys. You really don't need anything else haha. Did you know that there are attachments to use on the hitachi? Those can always be fun!
I totally agree and what is a more fun way to destress than with orgasms!!!  If you don't win, I am happy to help you pick something out. I have a few beginner type toys that I like to recommend and they are all under $20 and not overwhelming at all.
Good luck on your surgery. If you need anything, please let me know. I am usually around and love to chat.   I have 140+ toys and I still have an absolute favorite!
Also there is a great store near me that I love that’s women owned and very sex positive. Sometimes I go and window shop
I am so sorry to hear that. It sucks that they aren't willing to use your preferred pronouns. To me, it seems like such a small thing that makes such a huge difference to somebody.   Are you willing to share why the one you own is meh? If you aren't comfortable that's totally ok, or you can feel free to DM me as well.
I wish I could send clones instead of a toy haha!
Do you mind if I PM you. I might have some questions as it is something that I am interested in pursuing. Totally ok if it's not ok.   That sounds so stressful. I have been the advocate for my cousin since she was born and she is now 16. I have fought for years and years and it's been an uphill battle. I understand the struggle.
Sounds like such an interesting career.
Good luck at your interview!
I'd be happy to help you pick something out if you don't win.   I'm sorry your work didn't take things seriously. I hope they did now. I also live with high risk family and I know what the stress is like. Hugs.
I'm so sorry. I hope you feel better soon.   I have 140+ toys and I still only use a few regularly.
It truly is!  Have you tried using toys with your boyfriend?
The Hitachi is the best! Really not much can compete.
You need sleep! Is there anything you can do to help you sleep? Everything will feel just a little better once you aren't so tired.
Oh my goodness! How do you ever have time for yourselves?!?! You are so sweet. I'm so sorry to hear about the losses you have experienced this week. Big hugs to you and your wife.
I would love to send you some recommendations. If you don't win, send me a DM and I'd be happy to talk about some options.   Also im sorry you are dealing with anxiety and depression. I'm all too familiar with both and if you want somebody to chat with, please feel free to reach out.
Good luck with your surgery! You got this!!!
Hey, I had my gallbladder out in August.  Please message me if you want to chat!
Good luck with your surgery. I hope things go well. c:
Hugs! Thank you for entering and good luck!
That is so hard. My best friend has been in a very similar situation with her husband a few times. While I can't relate directly, I know how hard that was for her. I can't imagine having to do that ever but then during a pandemic to boot. Big hugs. You can do this!!
I'm so sorry to hear that. Hoping the test comes back negative. Those ones are very interesting! Very different feeling than any other toy!
I'm sorry to hear that. Addiction is hard on the whole family. Big hugs.
I don't blame you. My husband and I really want to be parents but I have said many times that I don't envy parents right now. It pretty scary at time without having tiny humans to worry about.
Size really doesn't matter haha!   I am sorry to hear about the dizzyness. I have suffered with ear problems my whole life and they aren't fun at all. Sending healing thoughts.
I know all about hormone issues and how stressful that can be. Good for you for being there for her. Thank you for entering.
Big hugs to you!!! Thank you for entering.
Way to go!! The organization is a HUGE job and then everything else on top of it ... you are amazing!!!  Ps. Your wishlist didn't copy to your flair.
Aww! I've been in that position. I once hid because my boyfriend (who is now my husband) was buying batteries for a toy and I was just sure that people knew what it was for. Buying online is so much easier and I'd love to help with a suggestion or two if you don't win.   Crossing my fingers that your friends are healthy. Big hugs.
Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry. That sounds like a disaster. Hugs  Thank you for entering and good luck
Oooh yay! That is a great start to your collection. I would need a bit more information on what you have already before I could make some recommendations. Feel free to send me a pm :)
You don't need a partner to use toys! Good luck on your deadline!
They are like sexy pokemon!
Oh trust me I was tempted, lol. Thanks for the contest! Should I find a toy and add it to a list or are you wanting to send one of your recommendations?
No. I found the Hitachi to be too bulky. She's a pill.
Thank you!  I have a question, if that's alright. Are there any vibrators that don't smell like burning plastic/rubber? Honestly that's why I got rid of mine. The smell was a total turnoff. The reviews would always say that the smell would go away after the first couple of uses but it never did.
❤️
Might take you up on that honestly! I'm always hesitant because I know I need to invest in medical-grade silicone to be safe, but obviously, there's no returning a toy you don't like. The options are just so overwhelming
I’ll sure try!! Thank you so much for the advice!!
That would be nice, Thank you!
waoh goodness how amazing! 💗 i aspire to have as many as you one day! 🌸 i recently have been interested in vibrating toys with the rabbit shaped ears (they look really cute and nice aha), wearable toys, and sucker toys (curious and a bit scared on how they work though)! 💗
Oh, I do know in fact know that! 😂😍 Ya know, I swear by Hitachi, but I'm always curious about these women that say they dont like Hitachi and use xyz instead. Im always thinking, "is there ACTUALLY something better then hitachi???" 😂😂
Ty! I will totally take you up on that offer!
Thank you so much I appreciate it 😊LOL There is always that one favorite everyone just loves the most there is just something special about it.
Who does that?!?! Some people .... geeze! I hope she gets a good placement.   Do you mind sharing which toy you have? Hopefully if you win, the toy I pick can get things done a little easier ;)
It was really really really cheap so it had a tear after like a year and just doesn’t get the job done 🤷
:)
Yes of course feel free to pm me.
My career is owning a business. Being a dominatrix is more for fun and extra cash. It is interesting and fun.
Thank you very much!!
Definitely! Sounds good ❤🤗
I think we used it together once. He gives me multiple intense orgasms that I have never gotten from a toy.
I know, and it's not really helping that I don't know what I can do, I just want to not be so tired right now, because it's certainly not helping me at all
And we sure don’t the only break I get is going to work but my poor wife is just a super mom. Poor thing haha god thank you for your support! Hugs to you as well!
thank you!! i'm keeping my fingers crossed.
Thanks! Yeah, it’s only been a few weeks and it’s been pretty hard, but we can do it.
Thanks, I didn’t wake up today expecting to be comforted on a thread about adult toys but this is the kind of energy I like in my life 😆
Yeah the last few months have been tough but hey what else could we expect from 2020 right?  I am with her all the way thru. No matter what. She is stuck with me.  Thank you for hosting the contest!
Thank you!!! Big hugs to you aswell !! Np ,thank you for being so kind and thoughtful
Yeah, I can't figure out how to get it to stay bc I don't have a PC. 🤦🏽😂   Thank you! I always get so overwhelmed that I give up. Yesterday I made a checklist of each individual thing I need to do in my bedroom so I don't get overwhelmed and I can focus. So far, so good! Taking a break for baby cuddles right now. ☺️
I feel that on such a level. I'm so thankful for the internet and online shopping. I think I'd have an anxiety attack trying to buy in person. >.<   Totally do! It's definitely not my area of expertise, so any help is always welcomed. c:   Thank you for the well wishes. Hopefully they are getting there. :c
It’s been quite the wild ride, that’s for sure.
Yes! Lol
If you have one in mind you can certainly add one. But I have a few in mind as well.
There definitely are. It all depends on the materials used to make the toy. Are you wanting one that is external use only? Internal? Both? Feel free to send me a DM and I can actually link you to some specific ones that I have had great success with.
Absolutely. I have bought many duds honestly. But I have learned which ones work well and are good quality.
By sucker toys do you mean something like the satisfyer? I'm happy to give some review and recommendations. Feel free to send a DM :)
Right? Mine lives in my nightstand and is always plugged in and ready haha! I do have a few others that tie for second place but nothing can beat my Hitachi
You’d be surprised about how many people do that or how many people turn in a “stray” that is theirs. I hope she relaxes soon. She’d be a great adoption candidate to the public but if she keeps showing poorly she’ll be available only to a rescue.  >!Currently I have a clitoral vibrator. I’m thinking I’d love to try something that has the penetrative as well. I’ve been having my eyes on the Lovense Nora that had the penetration, vibration AND a rotating head for G spot stimulation 🤤 !<
Noooooo! That's no good.
My bad, gotcha!
That's amazing!
Big hugs! I have some bedtime stories that I have recorded if you need something to fall asleep to.
She sounds like it for sure!
Haha! Sometimes it happens in the most unexpected places!
That is so sweet. Hugs
Oh baby cuddles 😍🥰  That is a great way to do it! Fun fact, I used to do the same on the weekends, break my to do list down to every small detail including "fun time" lol. It really helped.
I am going to go ahead and trust your judgment. I’m not well versed in this area, haha
Thank you, I will
Have you tried anything like the Hitachi Wand? I’ve always been curious about those. (Feel free to DM if you don’t feel comfortable commenting)
yes exactly like that one! 🌸💗 ooh thank you so so much, you're too kind! going to send a dm! 🌸
Girls best friend. 😍 hahah!
But open to suggestions!!
Poor doggos!  I have heard good things! I have a recommendation for something smaller and cheaper that does both. More of a beginner toy.
Yeah it sucks. But, it’s what I got
I'll take that offer if the thunderstorm sounds I put on don't work
Deal!
The Hitachi is the mother of all toys. I actually have two and I love it soooo much. I highly recommend it.
I’m always open to suggestions
Perfect. Just send me a pm!
Ooh! Good to know. Is it important to get Hitachi brand or are others good?
Feel free to DM me if you don't win.
I have tried a few other brands and they just aren't the same. However, if you haven't experienced a Hitachi then you might enjoy one of the others. I would never go to another brand after trying the Hitachi.
Ooooh, good to know. I'd been tempted to go off-brand and go for something wireless. Is it loud?
Yes, it is a little noisy. That is one of the downfalls. They do have a wireless version as well but I haven't used it myself so can't speak to how well it works in comparison.
Very rad. Any other recommendations/warnings?

Haha aww well hi!!!💗💗💗 you are very welcome! 😊
How are you today??
I am good! Tired though. It was really nice out this weekend so I went on a pretty long walk both yesterday and today. I feel so lazy now. How are you? 😊
Oooh nice weather. I can appreciate that. It’s been cold during the day and really cold at night. Winter isn’t my fave weather. And you shouldn’t feel lazy after two long walks this weekend. Not at all.
It is still pretty cold here but the sun has been out the past few days which is nice. It has been really cold and cloudy lately so I don't even feel like leaving the house alot of the time 😅
I miss the sun!!!! Lol

I would like to award two winners. This will be for US only.  Rules:  1. Live in the US 2. Have gifted in the last 30 days. 3. Tell me what type of books you like. What is your favorite book? 4. What books do you stay away from or find uninteresting? 5. What is one book from your list you would like to have? Why?  Contest will end tomorrow 1/17/21 at 5pm.
I love fantasy and sci fi books! I love different worlds and things that transport me off this planet. I’ve also recently started get into biographies and I really want to learn about the history of the space program, so if you have any recs, I’m all ears! I tend to stay away from romance or historical dramas.   One book I’d love to get from my list is the second “Gentlemen Bastards” book. I’m almost done with the first and I love it so far. I’d love to continue the series!  Thanks for the contest!
My favorite book is the Davinci Code! It’s kinda basic and mainstream but I remember how it just drew me in! It made me feel like I was right there with the characters.   As much as I love the genre, recently I have wanted to stay away from fantasy; they are so much fun but my mind just starts to wander a lot when I’m reading them!   I only have one book on my wishlist but I have been pretty excited to read Obama’s new book!
Books!!! I love it!!  My favorite type of books seem to be true story based comedies! Like anything by David Sedaris or Running with Scissors!! I’m not really a fan of many classic books actually! Like so many of my high school reading books bored the crap out of me and I still remember them after so so many decades!! I guess I’m not too big on dramatic fiction books?  The one book on my list that I’d like to have is Calyso by David Sedaris 😂 can you tell I’m a huge fan?? Heheh  Will tag more friends in the morning as I’m about to fall asleep! For now...  Hey friends!! Tell me about the books you like/love! u/hauntedcoffeecup u/johnwoods1023 u/thegreattyrant
I love beautiful books and those about adventure stories of friends 🥰 My favorite series as a kid was The Mysterious Benedict Society. I generally avoid books with bleaker topics like true crime, horror, or history. I found this one book on my list about building fairy houses which I’d really love to try. Making beautiful things seems to make days a bit brighter. 💜 thanks for the contest Atticus :)
My favorite type of book is romance books!  I stay away from non-fiction books.  One book from my wishlist that I would like to have is Homestuck. Homestuck is a genre-defying comedy sci-fi adventure about a boy who plays a game with his friends. Sounds pretty tame, right? NOPE. It’s so much more than that. I promise you’ve never read a book like Homestuck!  If I am to win, the book is on my misc. wishlist just so that you can find it!  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
Yay books!!! And surprises! I love books. Jane Eyre is my favorite. I like all books but particularly Victorian literature or historical fiction. I love all books but I guess I stay away from like how-to or self improvement books usually. But maybe I should read them lol.  Oh goodness! A choice. Um, probably the book from Lauren Graham. I love her. I was obsessed for years. Haha
I love books so much ahh!! My favorite books are usually in the mystery, thrillers, true crime, or horror genres. One of my favorite books is a psychological romance - The Sea, The Sea by Iris Murdoch. It's essentially a stream of consciousness of the main character, a retired playwright who has moved out to a lonely house by the sea. There, he makes a shocking discovery and becomes immersed in an obsession that he is unwilling to recognize the realities of. All of the characters' motivations are eventually disclosed - be they vanity, lack of compassion, all so cleverly hidden by the disguises they chose to show the world. It's reminiscant of The Great Gatsby in that it is about emotional turmoil and the human dillema when it comes to love. I loved this book and it's one of my favorites because of the concepts it deals with as well as the personality of the main character - both drew me in from the get-go and I was tangled in the story instantly, anticipating what would happen next.   I usually stay away from fantasy books because they rarely tend to reel me in and usually just don't catch my attention like other books do. Also romance books that are heavy on physical interactions aren't my thing at all.   A book on my list that I would like is Migrations by Charlotte McConaghy because it seems like a really interesting book and the synopsis made me want more. It also has a really pretty cover 😅
I love dystopian & Self help books! Weird combo but it works! My absolute favorite books are actually the Hunger Game Series. Catching Fire to be precise. Probably not well written if I read it again, but I loved it when it came out. I don't really like historical fiction or horror. The 4th book of the Ms. Peregrin series is on my "hobbies/fun" list. I would honestly love it because one I didn't realize the series had more books and it is the next one I haven't read yet! Thank you very much for your contest! I love reading!
I like manga/horror/sci-fi/fantasy. I like books that create other worlds, or are unsettling. For that I like Junji Itos work. He makes horror manga. His illustrations bring the unsettling part to the story too. I do have his adaptation of Frankenstein on my list I’d love to read. I also have George Orwell’s 1984 on my list - I keep hearing about all the parallels people are making between modern day things and this book, which from what I’ve heard is also quite unsettling.   I could do without romance and self help books. I don’t think I will ever fully understand the self help genre lol   Thanks for the contest!
Ooh fun!   I like all sorts of genres. Fantasy, fiction, certain classics, some poetry, memoirs and autobiographies, YA, children’s books that are just that good, animal science, horror, true psych stories.   I have a few favorites. If I had to pick one, it’d be The Stand by Stephen King (it’s killing me to not list my other favs 😅).  I’m not into nonfiction that’s not easy and enjoyable to read as well as not an interest of mine. I dislike history, but can enjoy Historical fiction if it’s got other elements I’m into (like The Alienist and Outlander). I don’t like Holocaust books, no matter how well it’s written or what it’s combined with.   The book from my wishlist that I would like to read the most is Away with the Penguins because I’ve heard it’s cute and heartwarming plus it about an elderly woman going to Antarctica to study penguins. I majored in Zoo Science and love animal centered fiction even though I nitpick the finer details.   Thanks for the contest! I love getting to talk about books ❤️📚
This is such a fun and wonderful contest! 🥰  I love fairytales and fantasy. I have a book of nordic fairytales on my list that, not only would I find very interesting, but are tales I can share with my children who also love fairytales. My favorite books lies within a series: Wheel of Time.  I'm not a huge fan of mystery or romance novels. Neither do I find very thrilling or terribly exciting.
Thank you for the contest! Books I like... Well, I'm a big fan of comic books of all variety. Love DC superhero comics and Image fantasy and horror comics. For traditional books, I like sci-fi, fantasy, and non-fiction books that dig into the video game industry. I've also been really enjoying themed cookbooks (with beautiful pictures). My favorite book might be Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - I love the challenges and maze in that one!  I have no interest in straight romance books or historical fiction. I know there are sooo many classics that fall into these categories, but I just haven't been able to get through any of them for fun.  The two books I'm most interested on my list aren't released until April and May (they are both deep dives into the video game industry), but one I am very interested in is God of War: Lore and Legends. It's a retelling of my favorite game through the eyes of the main characters son, with full spread original artwork for the game. It looks gorgeous.
oh i love manga, fairytales, romance, and mental health and meditation books the most but anything is fine! 🌸💗  current favourite book is "demons" by fyodor dostoyevsky! 💭  honestly anything is interesting and fun to read for me! 💫  i would love any of neville goddard's books from my list because his writings never fail to calm me down and make me feel safe and happy! 💗💗💗 thank you for hosting!
Thanks for hosting. I like graphic novels and recently started liking manga. I like dystopian, horror and fantasy. I don't really like non fiction. Any books on my list are fine. I really like the Hunger Games when it first came out. Recently, I like Harleen.
I like fiction with unreliable or surprising narrators, featuring underdogs or misunderstood characters. I don’t like disaffected characters with malaise or inertia. I like memoir (though I’ve read enough with abuse or neglect as the theme), biography, poetry and nonfiction about weather, philosophy, writing, nature, and more. It’s more a question of tone than topic. I find most humor writing not funny. I’d like any books on my list but the most helpful now would be the one by Stacey D'Erasmo, The Art of Intimacy: The Space Between... I am revising a you g adult novel and think it would be helpful to think about my character motivations as I read it.
I really enjoy reading non-fiction, mysteries, thrillers, horror, romance, historical fiction and historical non-fiction. My favorite book is Jane Eyre.  I avoid comics and fantasy because they just don’t interest me much.   I’d love to have the book called She Wolves from my list because I’m really interested in women’s history or the book The Slave Trade because I’m really interested in history and the subject matter.
I like all sorts of books; memoirs, fantasy, dystopian, historical fiction. Honestly, everything but horror is fair game. I can do suspense, but horror is too much.   Untamed by Glennon Doyle is my current favorite book.   Thanks for such a fun contest 💛
Hello, thanks for doing this contest :) I like reading books that other people give me. It makes me think what I’m this book made them think of me and I can to wonder what parts they found interesting that I would also like.  I typically go more toward thriller, high fantasy, or comics/manga. I’ve also been looking up true crime books to read lately. For example, my friend let me borrow and I thoroughly enjoyed Ready Player One (which I feel almost fits all those categories haha)  There isn’t really much I try to shy away from reading, but I guess if I had to, I’d say I’m not the biggest fan of historical nonfiction. Nothing wrong with it, I’m just personally not really a history buff.  A book on my list that I’d like to get is a set of choose your own adventure books I came across. It’s been a while since I’ve read one of them, but I remember enjoying them a lot in school.
Hi, I love to read. My favorites are general fiction and mystery/thrillers. I don't have just one favorite. I have not gotten into Anime. I would love to read The Stand by Stephen King. I read it in Middle School but after the craziness of 2020 I would really like to read it again as I think there would be a lot more I would relate to as an adult.
What a great idea!   I love cozy mysteries and clean historical romances. My favorite book is Lemon Tart by Josi Kilpack. It’s a cozy mystery with recipes included through out the book. It was the first book that sparked my love of reading as an adult. It’s very sentimental to me.   I tend to stay away from horror and most non fiction but I’m really I open to try anything!   I have a goal to read 50 books this year and I’m currently on number 5.  I would love To Love A Governess. It’s by my favorite author, Josi Kilpack. I’d love to own all of her books one day.   Thanks for the neat contest! I hope you are doing well. How is the wedding planning coming? Congrats again!
I love this!  I usually read scifi and fantasy, urban fantasy  and post apocalyptic in particular adw my favorites.  Speculative fiction in general.   Nonfiction, I read paranormal,  gentle/progressive parenting, weird science, arts/crafts, gardening...  My favorite book is probably Jane Eyre, though I also really love The Night Circus,  and Memory and Dream by Charles deLint.   I don't really love historical fiction,  war stories, romances with no other real plot, political intrigue.  I'd love Darkdawn by Jay Kristoff.   I've really liked the first two books in the series and would love to read the third.  They're really really funny, honestly,  plus there's a cat made of shadows, so...
Biological,Romance and true crime are my gosh too   I stay away from graphic novels and financial books.   I have a book about the Nikki and Brie Bella I been wanting to read they are fascinating and I watch there show on tv
I mainly read thrillers and horror books! But I try to be open to most categories! My favorite book right now is Everything at Once by Bill Nye who is my idol!! I tend not to be interested in romance books but I would read one anyway lol! The book I’m most excited about on my wishlist is A Promised Land by Barack Obama because I think he is such an amazing speaker so I would die to read his writings!
I do love a good book contest!  1) I like historical fiction and contemporary fiction. Bonus points if it is also a love story. I don't do cheap bodice ripping romances. I just love a good love story. Outlander is a favorite of mine. I just discovered Mimi Matthews and am on a 3rd novel of hers since December. I just finished Where the Lost Wander by Amy Harmon and I loved all of it. I also enjoy classic lit like Emma, Far From the Madding Crowd, and Madame Bovary.  2) I stay away from horror and gore. It's just not my thing. Fantasy isn't really my thing.   3) I'd love to have the biography of Jane Austen: A Life because I'm a huge admirer of Jane Austen and I would just love to read more about her. She's shaped so much of me, I must get to know her better.  Thanks for the awesome contest!
The only book on my list is the series on currently not only collecting but reading for the fourth time! Terry Pratchett Discworld series is bloody amazing!!  It's humorous, magic, psifi, life lessons and heart warming. It is one of the best series I've ever read. I've read thousands upon thousands and I say this!!  I was gifted by my kids the first and last books in the series. Now I'm working my way through buying the rest. Unfortunately the AH known as Kiki the cat knocked one of the others into the laundry basket and it wasn't caught..... Paper everywhere. Saddest thing I ever saw.....  I'm not a fan of horror, romance (funny I like christian romance though!), real life stuff, or books with awful endings! (into the forest. Wonderfully written horrible ending!)  Thank you for having a contest!!
I like sci-fi, mystery, thrillers, supernatural, historical fiction and non-fiction, romance elements (not straight-up romance), adventure, graphic novels, fantasy, learning, etc...   I generally stay away from self-help and pure romance. Not too big on auto-biographies, but sometimes memoirs are interesting.  I really want the American Sign Language book because I am trying to learn more signs to help my nonverbal children better communicate.
I love most genres, but my absolute favorite is the mystery genre. My favorite book is Brave New World by Aldous Huxley.   I stay away from historical fiction and while I'm okay with young adult books, it's not something I'd prefer. Mostly because I'm 25 and I don't really relate to teenagers the way I used to. I like seeing adult protagonists instead.  I'd be pretty happy with any of the books on my list. :) Although the self help ones would be very helpful for my anxiety problems.
I love this 💖✨  My favorite genre is fantasy literature. I have a lot of Jacqueline Carey, Neil Gaiman, R.A. Salvatore, and Karen Chance. I also own a ton of Dragonlance books. My favorite book is Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey. It's absolutely amazing and I've been reading and re-reading it for almost two decades. It never gets old.  I hope this isn't controversial, but I stay away from Christian literature. There's quite a bit of trauma centered around the Christian religion lurking in my past, and I don't want to be triggered. Obviously I completely respect everyone's choices and beliefs. I just stay away from it.  I have a Books and Puzzles list, and the book there I would most like is called Starless by Jacqueline Carey. She's my favorite fantasy author, and I love everything she writes 💖
I honestly love most genres. My favorite genre is thrillers/mystery. I honestly have not found my favorite book yet. I’ve read many books but none that I can say are my all time favorite.   The books I read least often are romance. I don’t really mind them but I don’t care for them much.   One book from my list that I would like to have is one of the Metallica books. They are my absolute favorite band and I love how deep their songs are.   Thanks for the contest and happy reading!
Oh sounds like a fun contest! I love getting books recommended by or chosen by others; it really helps broaden my horizons.  I like fantasy books and also fiction, whether it's magical realism like Murakami or classics like Hemingway. I'll read pretty much anything. I also like travel memoirs. My favorite book is so hard to say. "The Things They Carried" by Tim O'Brien always holds lots of different meanings for me, and I really love The Death Gate Cycle series by Margaret Weis and Tracey Hickman.  I can't do history books or historical fiction. Something about things set in the past (unless it's a fantasy world) just doesn't hold my interest.  One book I'd like to have is **The Intention Experiment: Using Your Thoughts to Change Your Life and the World.** I love the idea that thoughts become things, and I'd like to learn how to better focus my thoughts and harness them to bring goodness and health into my life.  Thanks for the contest!
Ok so I’ve been watching a lot of book Tiktok and I really want to read A Touch of Darkness by Scarlett St. Clair. It’s a Hades/Persephone retelling. I enjoy romance, fantasy, sci fi and historical fiction. My favorite book is probably Pride and Prejudice or anything by Juliet Marillier (Irish mythology historical fiction) or Madeline Miller (Greek mythology). I’m not a fan of horror novels. Thank you for the contest!
1. Check 2. Check 3. I like science fiction best. I don't have one favorite book, but I have a favorite author, Neal Stephenson. Ok, if I really have to pick, it's his novel *Anathem*. I also read mysteries and action, as well as non-fiction, especially science and memoir. 4. Ironically, since most people feel it goes together with science fiction, I never enjoyed fantasy very much. I also don't like romances. 5. I would like *Angels Flight* by Michael Connelly. It's the next book in the Harry Bosch series I've been reading.  Thanks for the contest!
Woohoo a book contest! My favorite books make me laugh or want to be a better person, or both. Not self-help books, but books that have characters that make you reflect on who *you* are. The best examples I have for that are *Wonder* and *The Violinist of Auschwitz* which made me want to be kinder and braver, respectively. They don’t preach or tell who how to be, but in reading the book you start to reflect on your own self and character. Or, like I said, just laugh out loud funny books because at heart I’m a comedy kinda girl and not everything needs to be serious.    Really the only thing I stay away from is horror. Not because I don’t like the genre, but because I have bouts of nightmares and watching or reading horror is a sure way to get another cycle started. Makes me a bit sad because I actually used to be a big horror fan when I was younger (nightmares started in college).   I’d like any of the books on my lists, but if I had to pick one it would be *Hyperbole and a Half* because it makes me laugh out loud about depression, which is something I usually need. Plus it’s a quick easy read for when I’m feeling down and can’t focus a lot.   Thanks for the contest! 📚❤️
My favorite books are mysteries/adventures with great plot and good surprises, and nonfiction books like biographies, memoirs, American history, things like that. One of my favorite books is And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie. I love the mystery of it all and the suspense that builds with the countdown. The title of the book literally tells you how it will end but as they say its the journey not the destination.  I tend not to read romances (although I do like some smutty fan fic), manga, or anything that outwardly says 'this is going to be sad.' I don't like being sad and I'm not doing to read a book that will put me in a sad mood on purpose. That's not for me.  One book I would like to have is The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee. I would love to read more about native American history, I'm deeply curious about it. (A used copy is great! -also books are on my "fun,games, and music list)  thanks very much for this contest!
Yes, books! Thanks for the contest.  I love fantasy novels, especially tales with adventure and magical creatures. One of my favorite books is *The Ruin of Kings* by Jenn Lyons, and its sequels. It's so detailed, engrossing, and - my favorite - surprising without being devastating.   I avoid thrillers and books with a lot of tension. My anxiety just can't handle that!   I would really love any of the books on my wishlist. If I had to pick one (which I guess I do, sigh), it would be *Ottolenghi Flavor: A Cookbook*, because I want to try out new recipes!
Thank you for the tag my friend! <3
Omg this penguin book sounds adorable!
Omg!! I’ve been wanting to read A Promised Land by Obama, too!!! 🙌

u/VexedKitten94 Thank you so much!!  It's such a great color, and I'm wearing hoodies so often! :D  I got it on Wednesday and took the picture that day, but then I forgot to post it, lol!  Sorry for the late thanks.
so so beautiful!! 💗💗💗
Wooooo!! What a beauty!!! I bet it looks great on ya, too!! I’m so happy for you!!! 👏👏👏
That’s beautiful!
No problem, you’re welcome! I love that color! 😁
Thanks!
Let's just say I'm glad I ordered it to be baggy - turned out to actually fit!  It's not very stretchy yet.
It is - such a great color!
:D <3
Update: I just put it on.  I'm very glad I was going for "baggy," because I got "fits just right"!  "Fits just right" is way better than "too small," lol!
That and purple are my faves!
Haha agreed! I have one at home and they shrink if you dry them in the machine so let them air dry too!
\*checks username* Are we the same person?? 🤣
Good to know!!  I will do that.

YUM!
Nutella! It's off the menu for me right now due to diet. It's cheaper to diet than to buy new clothes.
Yum!!! Hope they enjoy!
How yummy!!
Awesome! Thank you so much. 💜☮️
You are so sweet!  We will very much enjoy it when my family is here in less than a week.

Hi! I am finally confident enough in myself as a human to somewhat talk about myself! After years of awful depression and anxiety, I'm on the right medication to help myself feel like a somewhat normal human!  I am a crazy cat lady! I have two amazing cat sons. Puddin' likes blankets and butt smacks and Houdini likes chest cuddles and eating hair. These two make my world go round.   I am a huge pokemon fan and I'm super loudly and proudly gay!  I also like cheese and beer. They make my life go around.  I work for Target but at a Starbucks, and I truly enjoy coffee.   I have ADHD and I like coloring books that aren't childish but aren't super complicated either.

Hey there!! Welcome to the sub! Who is your fav pokemon! I’m a pikachu man myself!
Whats your favorite drink at starbucks?! Fave cheese?
Hello! Welcome to RAOA! 👋 I’m Lily, it’s so nice to meet you! I hope that we can be friends! Being a newbie can be pretty tricky, so if you need help with anything - or just want to chat - feel free to PM me and I will assist you to the best of my ability! ✨💛
Hi and welcome :) I see we have a few things in common, mostly the cheese, pokemon, and gay stuff haha. It’s great that you feel confidant enough now to put yourself out here! Give your kitties some extra butt smacks for me 😂
Hi! I can tell you I've suffered anxiety and depression and I'm better now! Glad your on your way too! What's your favorite pokemon game? Mine is Emerald and Black 2! But I haven't played one in a long time! Oh, and welcome!
Hurrah for crazy cat ladies! I have three cats. Angel and Jezebel are sisters, and they are love bugs. Angel loves to have conversations with me. Jezebel just really wants to be in my lap. Starbuck is my chonk who I can never get to lose weight without making myself sad when she licks her empty bowl. She is feisty, as her Battlestar Galactica namesake, and routinely tells me of her displeasure with hissing and growling. But ultimately still loves me. IDK, she's a weirdo.  Cheese is good. Not a huge fan of beer, but I also kind of stopped drinking after something traumatic happened. Hurrah for pokemon and being gay! I love Pokemon, but probably not to the extent to call myself a huge fan. Woo queerdom!  Working at Starbucks seems like it would be a nightmare but also full of lots of coffee so some kind of balance there.
Welcome! Whats your favorite type of beer?
Hi! Welcome! What's your favourite Pokemon game?
Hello. What's your top 5 favorite pokemon?
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Do you get annoyed when people order off the secret Starbucks drink menu??
ADHD buddy! Nice to meet...Oh look! Something shiny!  Lol, what’s your favorite Starbucks order?
Welcome! There are amazing fun and such kind people in this group! Glad to have you here!!!
You sound really fun honestly 😄
Hey there, nice to meet you :))  What’s your favourite Starbucks Drink and what blend do you prefer?  I love coffee myself, gives my stomach some pain but man, I can’t help myself lol
Hello! Do you prefer iced or hot coffee?
hey!!! i have ADHD, i am a cat lady, i love pokemon, i have debilitating depression and anxiety, and i'm pretty much gay (i say bisexual but i'm working on things still)! we should be friends.
Hi and welcome to the sub! Hope you'll enjoy it here.
Hey welcome!! I'm pretty gay myself😂🥰
Awesome to have you here and it's nice to meet you :D  I've just recently reached that same perfect mix of medications, so I know exactly how amazing that feeling is! <3 I also love Pokemon! I have an itty bitty card collection and I'm watching the show on Netflix! Who's your favorite? Mine's Bewear, but I also like Koffing because I can go around just saying his name to myself in that dumb voice of his lmao.  Happy to have you join us <3
AHHH yay for being loudly and proudly gay! I'm not so loudly but proudly bi! And I happy to hear you got meds to help you out! Depression and anxiety is no fun!   &#x200B;  :O A TARGET STARBUCKS! That's like the best of both worlds. Did you ever (pre-covid) wander around Target while drinking coffee? What is your favorite coffee to drink? What's a drink you hate making?
Hello and welcome!!! Coffee is life. What are your favorite ways to relax? ALSO, I love coloring
Blaziken is my favorite! I also love Registeel and Klefki!
A grande cold brew with 2 pumps chestnut praline and 1 pump mocha, with oat milk :D
Nice to meet you!
I am so excited to be out there! Puddin appreciates the smacks!
Emerald and I enjoyed Alpha Ruby! The original Sapphire was my first game!  It has been hard but I'm doing a lot better and my bad days, while still bad, are more manageable and easier to recover from.
Cats are the strangest fur sure (haha... bad pun)  Houdini doesn't like men, he was born at a shelter run by lesbians, adopted by my ex-fiance and I (lesbians) and then now lives in a house with 4 women and one man... and after two years of living this way he FINALLY likes the man and only him. Other men and he runs.  Puddin has a nub tail and is also a chonk. Chonk cat best cat.
Abita Blueberry!
Emerald, followed by ORAS
1.) Blaziken 2.) Wailord 3.) Medicham 4.) Registeel 5.) Klefki  This changes often. So... it depends on my mood.
My favorite holiday is Mardi Gras, followed by Thanksgiving!  I enjoy gardening and lizards. Nature is just fascinating all on its own. I grew my own okra this year!
Uhhh maybe? We don't have a secret menu. If you come up and say "I want bla bla." And I stare at you blankly and you tell me it's on our secret menu and then I tell you we don't have one and you get angry? Yes.  If you come up with a recipe you found and want to try, sure! I'll make it! Those are pretty fun and a bit rare, but we've had some fun ones for sure!
Yeeeee
2 pumps chestnut praline with 1 pump mocha cold brew with oatmilk!  My favorite is the Komodo Dragon blend it is savory and heavy yet leaves a sweet taste in your mouth. Just a splash of half and half and it's perfect!
I will walk in snow that's as tall as me with an ice coffee in my hands :3  If I have hot coffee I have either made it at home or it's decaf at the end of a long night.

I have a... moderately larger card collection and have my own TCG seller site as I have a lot of first editions. I love to collect for the art and so far have over 2000 individual cards in mt collection, not counting repeats. Witj repeats I have roughly 5000, including 47 ekans.  My favorite is Blaziken! I always like to say Slowpoke like that "sloooow poke."
I got the day the state (Missouri) shut down! Soooo no! Our SB was closed until mid June.  Favorite coffee is 2 pumps chestnut praline 1 mocha cold brew with oatmilk!  Least favorite drink to make has to either be an ice white mocha with vanilla sweet cream foam and Caramel drizzle. Honestly anything with unnecessary sweet cream foam on the top. Or the pink drink. I hate those damn things. The dragon drink is so much better!
Baths, video games, gardening, and coloring!
Oh awesome!! I’m not going to lie. I only watched like gen 1-2 really so I’m unfamiliar with a lot after but I’m trying to get round to learning the new stuff!!
Blaziken is a good one!
ALSO I really like gouda, parmesan, or goat. I'm not super picky though!
I came to also ask this question and YUM great response. I do the same with a pump of hazelnut and a pump of vanilla. Definitely going to try your way
That sounds delicious. Im lame and usually just get caramel frap. Thats all. Im afraid the barista will roll their eyes and judge me if I try to be fancy. So i keep it simple. How do you feel about orders foe complex drinks?
Really? Mine was a pirated copy of Ruby I friend borrowed me hahaha. I started playing Alpha Sapphire a while back (didn't finish it though) and it was a trip down memory lane. What's your favorite starter from that generation? I love Treecko but Mudkip is way more powerful haha  I totally get what you mean. One day at a time!
My vet recommended a Rx food for Starbuck to help her lose weight, so that meant I had to put the other cats food on the counter where they could get it, but Starbuck couldn't because they are very good at not overeating and just getting food when they're hungry.   Starbuck, on the other hand, had two meals a day. One in the morning before work, and one after I got home. Unfortunately, her getting special food made Jezebel want said food, so Starbuck would scarf her food down, then throw it up after I'd left for work. I didn't know this for a few weeks. I thought she was doing great. Angel has a sensitive tummy and throws up a bunch, so I thought the stuff I was cleaning up was from her.   Nope. I was home one day from work, watched her scarf it down while I was sitting in my chair. Then 15 minutes later, HORK. I gave her some pets and a few hours later, she was desperately licking her empty bowl for SOMETHING ANYTHING, and I was like "Look, doc, she's just going to have to be a chonk."
Haha that's okay. Good choices.
How exciting to happen to own any lizards? Years ago I used to have them as pets along with my birds and my cats and my hermit crabs lol
I tried it once!! I gave the (secret) recipe and asked if they could make it, they totally did! It was some raspberry vanilla concoction with shaved ice?? It was freaking delicious! 😍  And I'm NEVER rude to customer service folks. Over a decade in hospitality management, there is NO WAY I'd be rude to customer service workers. That job is a nightmare at times. So no worries from me!! Haha
That sounds heavenly oh my Aphrodite!   Oooh now that’s complex, I love it! I’ve always gotten the Guatemala Antigua whenever I can but the Komodo sounds more fun to taste xp
Yesss🏳️‍🌈
Yesss love it! What are your favorite games? I love to garden too though right now I only have window gardens lol
I got into the games in Gen 3, never really watched the show past then!
When CP is not in season (My store didn't sell tons, so thankfully we have a lot still), I do hazelnut with it.  I used to do double shots with hazelnut and 2 chai pumps (With half and half) but since I started new meds I have to be careful of my caffine intake.
It depends! If you want a complex drink that'll bring out the coffee and the flavors... great! If you want a sugar on top of more sugar drink... why?  The newest trend is an iced white mocha with vanilla sweet cream and vanilla sweet cream foam with caramel drizzle ALL OVER THE CUP. It's an 800 step process and super annoying and people who get it are usually obnoxious if you don't put enough camramel or foam on it.
Torchic, as it was my first starter and I even named it after myself (I was seven...) It has always had a place and truly is my favorite in the whole game.
No! I used to capture the green ones when I lived in Louisiana. I would keep them in tanks and be upset when they died. I would love a bearded dragon or a blue tongue skink!
I’ll have to play them games again!
Thanks for the insiders info. Loads of caramel is my thang too, but I dont request it. Ill just cry silently later if its not **enough**. Someday, I will be brave enough to request something slightly fancy. So really jist a caramel frappe with one flavor shot :))). I dont like annoying people. If I do, I tip nicely. Especially at restaurants. I make it worth their while to bring me some mayo for my fries. Ive followed the bitchy waiter too much that I know what waiters hate the most. I dont wanna be one of those customers they hate lol.
Oh torchic is cool too. Lot of people don't like that generation but it'll always be my favorite. Have you played Sword or Shield already?
a few bearded dragons on our site people usually post pictures of them.
Extra caramel isn't bad on a drink that gets it already (LIke a frappuccino, no biggy. I'm already going to put it on there I'll drown it for you!)   Also, since it's for a Target our system doesn't charge like a typical starbucks system. When they charge 8 times for drizzle, we can only charge once.
Yep! I have and I am slowly working thru Crown Tundra! I am looking for the birbs now.
Oh niceee! Lol the only starbucks within reason is in Target. I guess Dunkin Donuts is all the rage in NY. I dont care for their stuff, it tastes burnt.   Cinnamon in a caramel drink is my favorite combo tho.
Ooh nice! Here's hoping for a new one soon.

Large amounts of scotch tape, an egg beaters, magic cards, primer, photo stuff, and dried orange labeled "bag." Hmmm.. suspicious. You are either a normal human with multiple interests OR you are commiting a closed room murder!   ... Well, I'm not sure how you could create a closed room murder with this stuff so you're off the hook for now, "normal human with multiple interests."
I love that bear cup! How cute!!!   She may be a small ginger lady, but she has a giant heart.
Very nice!!!!   This sub is a constant reminder that people, for the most part, are still kind hearted...  God bless you all!
Wow! You hit the lottery.
How sweet of her!
Wow, amazing!
OOoo is that bubble tea in the polar bear mug? Awesome gifts!
Demonic Tutor!? Nice :)
u/smallgingerlady Hollyyyyyyyyyy! This was such a kind and overwhelming (in the best way) surprise! All of these things made me so happy and I am so appreciative that you thought of me and decided to spoil me rotten!  The single sided tape is super useful! I don’t know why we only have double-sided at home but now we have single-sided too!   The Magic the Gathering packs you chose for me were incredibly generous and I had such a blast opening them with my husband! I opened one of my favorite cards in Magic!!! I love Demonic Tutor (I have the playmat, enamel pin, and collect the card!) So this was great because I didn’t have this version yet!  The sleeves are very helpful! When the pandemic is over and we play in local game stores again, I am certain I will need to change my deck’s sleeves very often. And I always like to have a few boxes of sleeves on standby. The ultrapro toploader is very helpful as well! I use them to ship out cards and now I’ll be able to ship out so many and they will be protected along their journey!  These orange fruit slices are SO fun! I loved trying them out in iced tea and juice! I’m going to try to use them in fancy cocktails next! They make me feel very hip when I’m drinking. Lol!  The organizer for spices is SUPER useful! Now I can actually see what spices are available in my cabinet. Before I had them in boxes and it was very annoying to dig through to find the one I wanted. Now you have helped make cooking so much easier!  And of course the super generous gift of the hand mixer. I am in LOVE with this whisk attachment. I don’t know if you were on discord that one night I tried to whip egg whites by hand without a whisk. But it didn’t turn out well. Look at how nice the egg whites turned out with your kind gift!! They became the perfect texture to make dalogna chocolate! And I’ll definitely use these to bake too! I’m going to try to make Irish car bomb cupcakes this weekend!  The face primer had a lot of really good reviews on Amazon and I am so excited to try it! I bought new foundation to give it a whirl but unfortunately the foundation came in the wrong shade. And I didn’t want to delay posting this thanks post. But I will definitely keep you posted once I try this primer!  I wish I could truly put into words how much this all means to me. I really really really appreciate the thought, kindness, generosity, and love you put into this wonderful assortment of gifts. You have a ginormous heart and I am so glad to have met you on RAOA. I can’t wait to tell you more about what I end up baking with the hand mixer! Thank you!! <3
How incredible!!
Love this!!
Wow so kind and generous!!! Enjoy !! Dalgoda coffee is delish and yours looks just as good as ever
You deserve it all my friend! You are an awesome part of this community and we love ya :)
Love your penzeys spice collection!! 🥰
I want to make dagona coffee but I too lack a mixer
Wow, super nice haul!! I'm really happy for you! :D
You deserve her generosity. You’re both wonderful!!!
I have that hand mixer and it’s surprisingly fantastic for the price!! I’ve had it for years and use it for so much! And the carrier it comes in is super nice to store the cord and even the mixers if you can lay them in there correctly.
Wow this is awesome! Are katana sleeves actual sword sleeves?
Oooh I love all those penzey spices 😍
I love that glass more than life itself.
That’s so awesome
That’s awesome! And looks like you got some nice pulls too! 😲
Katana’s, a person of exquisite taste. <3
You can never go wrong with magic cards. Anything good?
How does one participate in this?
🧡🧡🧡 happy new year! I’m glad you’re so happy!! I know nothing about Magic so I’m thrilled they’re your favorites! You deserve to get spoiled :)
Mhm.. magic the gathering gamer who also enjoys eating food. You don't have me convinced yet! I got my eye on you for any magic the gathering while also enjoying cooking related, case closed similar, mishaps.
Katana is a brand that makes magic the gathering card sleeves :)
Demonic tutor!! :))
Oh now I feel stupid 🙈I used to love magic as a kid. I kinda want to get back into card games or at least collecting them. Do you play or just collect?
No worries! I do both! :)

[Closed]  Boyfriend dumped me and my mental health has hit an all time low soooooooo contest time so I can cheer one or two other people up.   Tell me one way you cheer yourself up when you’re down and I’ll choose my favorite response(s).   Must have something in your wishlist under $10 and I’m on mobile so please tag it or whatever ya need to do.   💙💙💙
Smoking bud always cheer me up
Sorry for you, I I hope you feel better soon I learned to hack my sadness by doing things for me, such as having a date with myself, doing things that I would like others to do for me or with me, such as eating something special, watching a movie, even self-care, such as wearing masks, manicures, etc.  Something that helps me a lot is watering my plants, it keeps my mind at peace 🌱☘🌿🍃
I’m so sorry to hear that. I hope you’re doing ok.   The best thing to do is to focus on yourself right now. Self care is the best way to get through it. For me, when I’m down and need to have a self care day that means ordering in something yummy (cause cooking is stressful to me), taking a hot shower, getting into clean cozy clothes and re-watching a favourite TV series or movie.   My [wishlist ](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3QA0DVUSNFLCJ?ref_=wl_share)has a lot of different movie and book ideas that could be familiar and cozy to you. To me it being familiar is key (takes away the anxiety of not knowing what will happen).
Sorry to hear that your boyfriend dumped you. Whenever I’m down I like to watch some comedy movies. I know this sounds cheesy but when I’m super down I like to make a list of things that I am happy for. Another thing I like to do is hangout with my stuffed dog lol he always cheers me up whenever I’m down   [WL](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/UDI588ITV7AE?ref_=wl_share)
I'm so sorry. Breakups are so difficult, and have this element of loneliness that single them out from parting other relationships. My heart goes out to you.   One way I make myself happy is through creation. Crochet gives me the ability to make beautiful things and puts a smile on my face and the faces of people I make things for. I can try and teach you how, or if you want a little stuffed friend you can reach out and ill make you one to keep you company.   Feel better 🥰 there's a lot of love on this sub.   [list link](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2F2N3D8PQQ84Q?ref_=wl_share)
Take ALL the time you need and do whats best for YOU now. Take care of your heart. 💝💝💝  I go for a drive and sing REALLY loudly. To the point where I lose my voice for the rest of the day. Skip ALL bad songs and dont use the radio...bluetooth from your phone so you can pick EXACTLY the songs you need. Oh, and buy Reeses. Always buy reeses. 😀😀 Girl, you've got this! 🤗🤗🤗  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1VARIZBPCT63L?ref_=wl_share
Sorry to hear that.  Listen to sad music and let myself cry, and then listen to other types of music, some of it being upbeat. Songs can really change our moods. I hope it works for you.  [Wishlist](https://smile.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/OQ499Q1NOTN7)
I'm sorry you're struggling right now :-( Remember to be extra kind to yourself. Do things for yourself that maybe you wouldn't normally do like order your favorite meal, put on a movie, and eat a gallon of ice cream. Seriously, it helps 💙   When I'm down I like to go on really long walks with my dog. It gives me time to clear my head and try to work through whatever is going on while also spending time with my best friend. I also like to sit in nature with him and remind myself of the simple things that matter and make me happy like the sound of birds and the love my baby boy gives me. He's always happy to spend time with me and he reminds me that I matter 💙  [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/YX5WLKEYR30J?ref_=wl_share)
I snuggle with my cats when I’m sad. They always make me happy.  [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1UP9FH2SB42FS?ref_=wl_share)
I know the contest is closed but I just wanted to say that I'm sorry you're going through this and I hope this change in your life ultimately leads you to greater happiness. If you ever need an internet weirdo to talk to or just vent to, my inbox is open, even if it might be a bit dusty these days
I paint my nails!
So sorry to hear! For myself, it's always either talking things out with my mom or listening to some music and crafting.
Awe friend I’m sorry :’( you’re not alone 💙 my dms are open. I’m sorry you’re going through this.  I like to watch YouTubers when I’m sad, usually helps at least a little bit.   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/YNK11TYESXYM?ref_=wl_share
I am sorry your boyfriend dumped you - I hope that in the end it'll work out best for everyone.   I hug my pets. Well, not hug, but smother them while crying until I feel better. Once in a while when I'm missing my mother I'll bake/cook something that she always did.   Honestly, when people say "things happen for a reason" I want to punch them in the teeth, but I hope things work out for you.   Since you're on mobile [this is my list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/21WUNWSP8IDC?ref_=wl_share)
When I’m trying to feel better after a breakup, making myself look good makes me feel good. Moisturizing, painted nails, makeup, selfies with perfect lighting. And send those selfies to friends so they can build you up.   Hang in there darling, it’ll be okay in time, it’s just gotta hurt first ❤️   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2L0YL8HSON615?ref_=wl_share
Making gourmet coffee snuggling with the cat. Cats are good  Get a cat!  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3D5DDCMII4HHM%3Fref_%3Dwl_share
You deserve so much happiness. I’m sending you many hugs and much love! What helps my mood is making a drink or hot chocolate or something and watching a good movie or taking a bath. Make sure you’re taking care of yourself sweetheart ❤️ [wishlist ](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2Y59YGF7YB3WC?ref_=wl_share)
very sorry that happened to you, please don't be afraid to reach out if you need to 💗 giving you a hug! 🌸  i like to cuddle a plushie and watch something cute like cat videos! 🌸 watercolouring and reading funny stories or a good book (or fanfiction) are also good choices too! 💗  hoping the best for you 🌸  thank you for hosting, here is the [list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1TA7OPM21A3KS?ref_=wl_share) 🌸
I do some visualization/mindfulness techniques to clear my head and then do something that just blocks out the outside world for a couple hours. Turn off your phone/computer. Get some popcorn (maybe melt some chocolate on it), wrap yourself up in a blanket, and just put on your favourite movie. Or read a funny book. Or have spa day.  Just devote 2 hours to you. You owe no one anything for those 2 hours. Be selfish, make it entirely about your happiness. And if sneaky negative thoughts pop up say "not right now, I will deal with you later" and visualize them away for a little bit.  You are amazing, you deserve way more than you've gotten in life, and it is okay to have bad days.   **https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/2RTC8VZFNN08X?ref\_=wl\_share**
First *internet hugs*   Secondly, the absolute best class I ever took was positive psychology. I high reccomend it to everyone. One of the best take aways from the class was a gratitude journal, by writing down 3 things every day stress goes down and life satisfaction goes up. And these could be anything, no matter how little.  I've written *"got to pet a dog today"* and *"did not cry in public"* before.     I wish you all the luck on your journey.     [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2LPTZMLK2FF40?ref_=wl_share)
I eat 😂 so I’m no help and I’m not entering. Just wanted to say that I’m sorry you’re hurting. I’m thinking of you. If you need to chat, I’m here.
I look at pictures of [cute animals](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/591330324475019280/800116931481829396/IMG_20210116_121727101.jpg)
I have all unhealthy coping mechanisms, but you asked, so... medical marijuana, comfort food and comfort movie/tv show. I hope someone helps you with their brilliant idea. I’ll be Thinking about you. Thanks for the contest!
I run contests on this page! :)   I also give myself a pedicure and eat some chocolate with tea.   And... dang it! I'm sorry that happened. Big hug from here, and know that someone will love you and appreciate you even more!
When you're feeling low and rejected, your truthmeter might be out of touch with what's true so trust me on this:  You are lovable.  You are worth loving.  You are loved even if not by the one who disappointed and hurt you.  Relationships are about finding a solid match that will treat you with respect and care. They're about people who are solid in your court when the chips are down.  Being dumped sucks. I'm so sorry. There's no easy way to do the work after except to feel it, admit it, and get back up.  It's hard to let go or be let go of but it is not about your core value as a human being or as someone worth loving.  Repeat after me:  I AM LOVABLE. I AM LOVED.   Even now, as hard as it is to see, you are on the path to finding your people and your tribe, and your beloved.   How I treat my down days?  If it's nice, I grab a book and head for the hammock under the cedar trees.   If it's cold, I grab a towel and hit the hot tub, soak, then come in and call a friend or dive into a book.  Sometimes I make myself write letters or notes to others to distract myself.  A [Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1WGETML5BAD78?&sort=default) seems trite in the face of the loss you're feeling and I'm sorry. I hope you have friends and family who remind you how much you mean to them. I hope you believe it.
I'm sorry to hear that.  Something that makes me happy is reading comic books and manga. I like how I can get immersed in a fictional world. I have a relatively big collection and I enjoy going to my local comic store regularly to pick up something new or get recommendations from my friends.
I'm sorry this has happened to you!   Chocolate lots of chocolate a good movie and snacks are good and watching vines is always fun especially funny ones lol   Even heading down to your local shelter or pet store with animals and spending time with them. Get your mind of things animals are great for that! Take a brisk walk spend time with nature.   Here if you need me only a message away. You will get through this 💕
I started playing a game called geoguessr which makes me happy. You try guessing your location in the world based off of google maps.   List link: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1100ARDCHIWVR?ref_=wl_share
Watching FRIENDS and eating Haagen Daz Chocolate peanut butter ice cream. Friends has been my happy show since I was 18. I have watched it at least 50 times all the way through and it still makes me laugh. And haagen daaz is something that I just don't splurge on too often. So when I do it is a real treat.   Sending big hugs!!   My wishlist: [https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3OANR28EWYLHF?ref\_=wl\_share](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3OANR28EWYLHF?ref_=wl_share)
I give myself a timeline to be sad, and lean into it.  After the time is up I set new goals , treat myself to something special, and fake happy until it feels real.  Sounds weird but it works
I got dumped last month, and I had surgery so I’m out of work. I picked up a new hobby, I’ve been reading like a crazy person and I’ve never liked reading in my life; it’s a good escape.   Also, try painting or needlework. I taught myself how to embroider and cross stitch. You just need to escape.   Bullet journaling helps too.   Keep your head up!!! It sucks. It sucks so bad... try to look at the bigger picture, you need someone who values you, loves you, and WANTS to be with you. Shine like the star you are!!!!!!!  Feel free to message if you need to talk!   [Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/CKGFE50QWUX7?ref_=wl_share)
Feel better soon. When I'm down, I blast music, read a book, and eat something nice. Eating sweets usually help. Keep yourself occupied and don't think too much about it.   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3SMGYP8PVEXZ5?ref_=wl_share
First I am sorry that that happened to you, but if he dumped you, he doesn't deserve you. Coming at it from the other side I promise you will find your person who will recognize you for the fantastic being that you are!  Here are some things I do to practice self care big and small.  1. Light a candle I like the smell of 2. Do something creative (cook, craft, puzzle, draw, organize, etc) 3. Escape in a book or tv show 4. Shower and a shower melt 5. Fuzzy socks 6. Hot tea or coffee if you are a coffee person 7. Cuddle with a pet 8. Call a friend and talk it out, or just point out all the way your ex was annoying, it is easy to remember the good stuff when you're hurting, but I'm sure there are negatives if you take your rose colored glasses off. 9. eat comfort food (mine is mac & cheese) 10. Bullet journal 11. Watch [people falling on ice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhb04aZYyXY&t=406s). (My go to laugh) 12. Do a deep clean to get a fresh start 13. Day dream about things you want to do when the pandemic is over 14. Sometimes you just need a good cry. That is okay.  Remember it is okay to be sad, and all feelings are valid. Sometimes the only way through is through. But one day you will look back on this moment and I promise it won't matter, or hurt anymore.  Thank you for the contest, and I sincerely hope you feel better soon! [Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1BVB8G71MFKBJ?ref_=wl_share)
Binge your favorite show, take out from your favorite restaurant, spend time with people that make you feel good!!  [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/36CJ9MEF5VGH2?ref_=wl_share)
I turn to music. I have a number of playlists on Spotify with songs that I love to listen to and/or sing along to. Right now I'm using my [Good Mood Tunes](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5AG27VOb3G5RjumVpyzkMf?si=T-XPX-e9TKGVsBQPTVrraA) list. Grab a hairbrush and release your inner pop star.  He's not the one.

i’m sorry you’re going through that! :// but please stay strong! time heals all.   i usually like to go thrifting shopping. it keeps my mind busy and i get to treasure hunt for some amazing finds. 💜 [wishlist ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/ls/?ref_=navm_em_lists_0_1_1_5)
(((Hugs)))   I find music and making things helpful — crafting, baking, whatever. Something about using my hands and jamming (usually to old corny tunes) pulls me out of the moment and helps clear my head & heart.  Take time to feel the feels, and then start the next steps in your life ❤️ you got this!   [list](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/ls?ie=UTF8&ref_=aw_ya_hp_wl)
bear hugs   bubble bath is my ultimate go to, i can feel my stress going down my drain.  hope you feel better soon
I’m so sorry to hear that, I can relate to what you are going through right now, we can both get through this! Let me know if you ever need to talk !  . Not entering as I’m in the uk but I listen to fun music and put on my fav tv show! It heals things for me I guess!!
Gratitude lists. Or writing down one-three things I'm grateful for per day. After way all the things pile up and when I'm sad and missing an arsehole I look at all thing things I do have, and it seems sillier and sillier to be hung up on someone that gave ME up when I have so much to offer and have so many good things in my life.   I have this [carving set](https://www.amazon.ca/Carving-Chisel-Professional-Manual-Sharpener/dp/B07FY3PJGY/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=stamp+carving+kit+under+%2410+prime&qid=1610854228&sr=8-4) that has a pile of rubber blocks waiting for it to come home one day .
How I cheer myself up is treating myself to either boba or Starbucks and maybe something yummy like a donut! The sugar gives me a boost when I’m feeling tired or low and instantly raises my mood. 💜  [list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/JCD7I9FS85VN/?ref_=lol_ov_le)
I’m sorry to hear about your breakup and the lowness of your mental health. If you ever need to chat with someone, I am here. Hugs!   When I’m down I cheer myself up with junk food, definitely not healthy, or I take a hot bath. Getting outside for some fresh air helps too.   Do you like to read? Loosing yourself in a good book is nice too. Or a movie or tv show.   Hang in there, wishing you all the best. [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2V0AE6R80B0FP?ref_=wl_share)
I’m so sorry to hear about your breakup and that you’ve been feeling down! My mental health often heads south and a few things I found that help me out are snuggling with my kids and/or cat, reading a book that’s pure escapism, or becoming immersed in a tv show I can binge watch to distract me.   [My Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/JEUPUACSO0G1?ref_=wl_share)
I’m sorry to hear that. A lot of mindfulness during this time will help you out. It’s also OKAY to cry.  Crying is good for you.   What makes me really happy? I give my kitties kisses!

I'm not entering, but I just wanted to say sorry to hear about the breakup.   Talking with friends, and having a spa day and getting hair and nails done usually makes me happy.  Also allowing yourself to express your emotions help a lot too. It's okay to cry for days, weeks or even months. It's a traumatic time in your life. Holding emotions in will just make it's harder for you.   Keep your head up. If you need someone to talk to, my reddit message is always open and I'm always willing to listen and if advice is needed, I'll try my best! :)

I just eat and slob out for the day while watching movies, playing games, whatever! Do what makes you happy. And then the next day get up, and just get outside. Go for a run, go biking, take a walk in the park....whatever! After that just take a nice shower and sit down and make some goals for yourself:) what do you want to improve about yourself? Wanna clean your room? Start now. Wanna eat more healthy? Start now. Be the best you that you can be, you deserve it:)   [wishlist ](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2TRIVCPV2582K?ref_=wl_share)

While I was growing up, we would always watch an episode of Pingu on bad days. They're like little shots of wholesomeness. They're only five minutes long, they're all available on YouTube, and they take very little brainpower to watch. And they're *so* adorable and sweet and happy.   Anytime I'm feeling rough now, I go watch a few episodes of Pingu. Usually within 10 minutes I feel refreshed. I especially love the one where he meets a seal who becomes his best friend or the one where they fold paper boats (which is the reason I learned to fold paper boats).   So here's the [link](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/39HV1B1LA0SBV?ref_=wl_share) to my wish list, and here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/user/pingu) to a ton of Pingu.
I’m really sorry you’re going through this. I truly am. I can completely relate right now!! It’s been so painful for me, I can only imagine what you’re going through. Please reach out to me if you wanna talk about it! ❤️ we will heal in time and find better love!!
I know the contest has ended but yeah my relationship ended recently and I just want to tell you it will get better, yeah you may think of them from time to time but it will get better everyday!
Also coming in late just to tell you that I hope you found some great cheer-up ideas in this thread! Don't forget to process your emotions as well, it's okay to sometimes just [dance and cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nE2TpaGDgo).
I get up and dance. Doesn't matter that he dumped you. If he's the one dumping you, then he's not worth your abstinence from dancing. Never let anyone like that take away an activity that is your God-given right. You don't even have to perform any kind of dance. Just move.   Here's my [wish list ](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/7M9BJ5MU0P3M?ref_=wl_share). There are a lot of things under $10 on there, but I could really use one of the headband sets. 💜☮️
I’m sorry to hear about your breakup. Breakups can be one of the hardest things to endure. I hope that you’re doing well and feeling okay. Sending you [virtual hugs](https://ibb.co/nMpfPfs)! 🧸   I make myself happy by treating myself. I’ve been having a stressful day today, so I treated myself to my favorite meal and desert! I had a delicious pasta dinner, some chicken nuggets from earlier 😂, and tiramisu for dessert! It was truly delicious. Nothing makes me feel better than when I eat my favorite foods!  Some other ways I cheer myself up are self-care and doing activities that make me happy. After a long day I like to unwind in a nice bubble bath then cuddle up in bed and watch a show on Netflix!  [My wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2R1GRFEJ4XJRP?ref_=wl_share)  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! I hope I was able to help you find a way to cheer yourself up!✨💛
When I'm feeling down I either hang with [the pets and the kid](https://imgur.com/a/AxQOnUh) or listen to my [very favorite](https://youtu.be/zHe28iNOuDk) music!   also...f him, his loss.  [wishlist](https://smile.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/E45C16KNJL3P)

Thank you so much. I’m here if you need to talk as well
Ohh, that's a hard one! I think either perler beading or collaging. Both are really relaxing to me.

I just got a D&D cookbook but I think I need this one too! Is there lore with every recipe? Like a way it ties into the LOTR-verse?
You have a great smile!
That looks like a great cookbook!
There's that beautiful smile again 🥰  That cookbook looks so cool!
This book looks fabulous!!
u/cubannb thank you so much for the awesome Tolkien-themed recipe book. I am soo excited that my heart is fluttering (and my tummy is grumbling)! I cannot wait to start making lembas bread and Beorn's honeycakes and all the other  tasty things in this awesome cook book. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!!  Edited typos
Such a cool cookbook!
Omg what a fun idea!
Wow!! 😍
How cool!!
Oooh what kind of recipes are there?
Now you gotta post a recipe when you make one!
💛💛💛
Potatoes, boil 'em, mash 'em, put 'em in a stew
That looks like so much fun!
Awesome pressie! I hope you have many great meals and snacks from this. Share pics if you do!
Fun!
Oh very cool!
Yes! We have the D&D cookbook too. This does have lore with each recipe. Its so lovely!
Thank you!
I'm really excited to start making some of these recipes.
Stop! I'm blushing 😊
It is wonderful!
You are so welcome, I hope all your recipes turn out delicious!!
It really is well done. I'm skimming it now. The author clearly composed this as a labor of love for Tolkien's worlds. The recipes look easy enough for a home cook and there are interesting sections between recipes like, "Nontraditional Diets in Middle-Earth" and Feasting in Tolkien. "
I'm already mentally preparing  LOTR inspired dinner party to host as soon as the plague is over!
It is really well done. I highly recommend it. I haven't cooked anything yet but honestly,  as a Tolkien fan, it is so well done that I don't even care if I like the recipes (even though I feel sure I will).

I will!
There's always next year (folds up terrible towel)....
🥔🥔🥔🥔
Its great!
I definitely will!
That sounds super fun!
Haha, do the recipes include fictitious ingredients?
Ohhh that looks amazing!
That first half was rough 😭😭😭
Nope! They have real ingredients.  Its pretty clever.
It is!
I can't....lol!
Definitely i must have these book
I was happy they came back and still tried in the second half, but holy moly turn overs will destroy a team chances 😭
I took some pictures to highlight the book.  [Recipes from the World of Tolkien](https://imgur.com/a/YLj71uG)

I think I joined this group right around my birthday (I hate being a December birthday baby) and couldn't make an intro but that has finally lifted.   Firstly I just want to say that this is such an awesome group! Like, everyone, is so nice and fun to have conversations with. It's not about gifting, it's about making fun connections with people.   Honestly I am awful with at introductions or all of those "about me" things people want. I just turned 40 in December. FORTY! I honestly didn't think I'd live to be this old.   I'm from Tucson, AZ originally, but spent five lovely years in PDX, back to Tucson for 5 years, and now I've been in Spokane, WA for a year and a half. Damn the inland northwest is really odd. I cannot handle the snow AT ALL. The driving scares me. We had a wind storm that knocked out power for almost two days and it was nuts.   I use to be a baker - lost the job with C19 and wasn't asked to return when the bakery reopened. I've been trying to find work again for a while, but life has just been stupid.   Not married, probably never will be, but I have four furbabies - two Maine Coon cats and two Akita pups. The akitas were rescues from a horrible fire at their kennel. They had only been bread to breed more Akitas so they didn't know how to be dogs. We've had them for a while and they JUST started to learn to play with toys.   So r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon \- AMA!

Hi! Akitas are so cute! It's great they are rescued dogs! I want to adopt a lot of dogs when I live on my own. Indeed this community is great! I've been lurking for a while and finally decided to join and I'm very glad I did. A lot of different people of all ages, all interesting! Hope this year's treats you better.

Hello! Welcome! What's your favourite animal?
Hey, welcome. 🙂  Being a baker is a huge, huge thing in this day in age with everything being done at home now and convenience!! If you ever need any inspiration or someone to bounce business ideas off of, I have a (sometimes way overactive) entrepreneurial mindset about this stuff! Anytime, I love bouncing ideas!   When we are backed into a corner, its typically when we thrive!
Hello and welcome
Welcome! I'm Tracy and I know what you mean about being single, I have 3 pitt mixes and a part time community kitty but I'm hoping to get a maine coon cat in the future. Look forward to getting to know you, have a good evening :)
Hey hey! Who would you root for, the Sun Devils, Wildcats, or Lumberjacks?
Welcome to the sub and congrats at turning 40!! If you have any questions about it, just let me know. What's your favorite thing to bake?
Hello and welcome!
[Fezzik](https://imgur.com/gallery/xTgLUks) and [Gigi](https://imgur.com/gallery/Qt9YRTn) and [Mouse](https://imgur.com/gallery/A96hwBZ) and [Murphy](https://imgur.com/gallery/OGQG6S5) . I am beyond shocked that they fit inside of my car! [https://imgur.com/gallery/p42wsOf](https://imgur.com/gallery/p42wsOf)
I really have been enjoying having conversations with people. I've been kind of isolated from normal conversations with friends. I miss cooking! I loved my bakery because there was a bit of deli work, but they didn't his me back.
You know, I don't really do holidays. It's all about the food. I'm part Mexican so Christmas and tamales go hang in hand.  Oh! I've volunteered with the special Olympics since before I was in school. My grandfather started the team in his school district in the 1970's and then my uncle took it over, I've worked with them my whole life. I've got so many great experiences with taking the team to Disneyland for the first time.
Honestly, the domesticated dog is my favorite animal. What about yours?
I've been struggling with yeast beads because of the temperature here in Spokane. I want to drive into more traditional Mexican breads (my roots and all) but I'm over 1,600 miles away from those influences.
Hello and thank you
I'm from Tucson so I know we're suppose to hate the sun devils lol
Thank you!
Oh my gosh, what sweethearts!!! They are all so adorable. Haha, I bet they love it though :)
How wonderful that you learned at such an early age to volunteer and get great life experiences. I remember the 1st time I volunteer doing hand-in-hand I was teams up with a student that held my hand so tight that it hurt and I got a little nervous lol but ever since then I've so enjoyed working around the children.
Besides cats, alligators!
Oh, I'm not much help here unfortunately, 😕 but, if you ever needed ideas on how to turn your love and talent into something where you can work for yourself, I love bouncing ideas around! Just need one to stick. :)
Lol fair. I was a Sun Devil but I also got into UofA so no hard feelings against them 😋
The cats still aren't happy we have dogs. It was a little bit harder because both of the dogs are two years old when we got them and only see cats as food.
It's a group of people that I've worked with my entire life. When I was in high school I was one of the "head coaches" and remember joking around with the athletes just the same way that I joked around with all of my high school friends. We never treated any of the kids any differently than we would treat a group of neurotypical kids.  We had a boy who had no arms and he was our equipment manager for the floor hockey team. Everyone thought that we were horribly cruel calling him an equipment manager because he couldn't hold anything but he was always on top of organization and a great cheerleader. He was also a little bit of a jerk. We took him to Disneyland and we took him on Splash Mountain and when he came off his shirt was kind of sideways and his empty arm holes were flapping around. A little boy was looking at him weird and he said, "man, be careful on that ride, don't raise your arms on that dip," and then he Shrugged his shoulders and walked away. I think he emotionally scarred that little boy.
Both have a mouth full of dangerous teeth!
I was just joking with my best friend that I should open up a food cart but I wouldn't know what to serve
I never really cared for any of the sports-ball stuff. Tucson is smaller and easier to get around than Phoenix, but Phoenix has so much more "stuff" going on.
Omg yes! What you serve is what you love. And what you love is what is ALWAYS requested at family events and outtings. Keep it simple. Pick 1 or 2 things that is the "must have" when youre with your family. Build your business around those 1 or 2 things. Prove to everyone outside of your family, why you are the best at whatever item.
No one in Eastern Washington even knows what a Sonoran hot dog is, or a real tamale. There is a group here that is called tamale box and they're just awful but everyone in Spokane loves them
That is the number one way to corner the market. You can do this. You CAN do this. There are a million reasons not to do something, but all you really need is one good reason TO do it.
LOL the financial limitations are there for sure. I made tamales for Christmas and with the cost of the supplies it cost over $150 to make roughly 3 dozen tamales. To be fair that was starting 100% from scratch, but still.
Do you mind if I PM you?
Of course

Yaaaaasssssss omg another chance to gush about my big booty boy!! I have an adopted mini Dane named Lucky or Luck but better know as Big Booty Boy bc he’s plump now! He’s the sweetest, gentlest, innocent pup that I can’t get enough of! I adopted him almost 2yrs ago when he was 5-5.5yo so I know I don’t have long w him but I’m soaking in as much love as possible!!! His previous owners were shit, so he has a lot of health issues but he’s such a trooper!!! He’s a lover and a fighter 🙄😒 he was never socialized then when I brought him home he became terrified of dogs bc offleash dogs kept antagonizing him and trying to attack him. Now he goes ape shit if he sees a dog... I have so many scars.. so so many scars!! But that’s his only itty bitty flaw and it’s not even his fault! He loves to snuggle! He’s attached at the hip to me and I freaking love it! Oooo he absolutely LOVES to sit on me!! It’s a must for him 😂😂😂 he loves nestling in people crevices like in between legs and armpits! He’ll just stand there like that so happy and comfortable 🤣🤣 he’s very routine and time oriented! He knows when breakfast and dinner time is, he knows when walk times are, he’s just on it and licks me like crazy to let me know! I love how that’s his way of telling me something! If he needs a quick potty, he’ll lick my face so when I get up he shows me what he wants! Omg he’s so precious I wish everyone could meet him!!! This is him! Big Booty Boy Lucky! https://imgur.com/a/xxdiPq3  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/17YO3WFHWP8S4?ref_=wl_share  Come on friends! Show off your pets or tell me how much you also want a Dane 🤣🤣!! u/space_noodlers u/tinawebmom u/gdarn16
I don’t have a pet but I love pets. I wish I had a dog or a cat. I love bull dogs, chocolate labs, corgi’s, shiba’s, cocker spaniel, and Russian blue cats! My brother has a Russian blue cat named Meowci and she’s the best cat ever. I love her. Luckily they live upstairs!! So I can hang with her sometimes.  Thanks for the contest :)  [Wishlist link here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/4BOQGVVUFJMP)

I mostly included my cat as my glider is a jerk and my fish keep challenging me. https://imgur.com/a/ATQqkJV Midori is my best friend, I give her kitty butt smacks that she loves. I got bored and made her Instagram. She has an eye defect that cause them to not contract giving her what most call “horror movie eyes”. Sometimes they look all black , sometimes bright yelling. I argue with her a lot and she will whisper a meow in my ears if I don’t wake up fast enough. Steals half of my chair and all my blankets. She might be a racist.  I’d tag /u/alltheboops but she’ll try to play her but /u/alliumm has a kitty named pidge.  List https: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2C64JDA0P3M4Z?ref_=wl_share
My pets are chickens! I also have a kind of pet cat. I'm not sure if she's officially my pet since she lives outside (she came with the property we bought lol) I have three hens and one very mean rooster who I may have to get rid of. The cat's favorite things include hiding underneath our house and incessant meowing for food even if she has food. The chickens favorite things include perching up high and pecking things. My pets are weird lol
I only have 3 pets, all cats.  2 are from shelters and the other found us... and made us his bitch lol.   I remember I seen a gray cat down the street on my way home one day and thought how much Id love a gray cat. Got home and there was a scraggly gray cat on the porch reeking of gasoline. It was sooo lovely dovey and I was giddy! I figured since we already had two cats, my luck would be against me and I couldnt keep it. Had to pick my husband up from work and the cat jumped in the truck. The whole way there I was laughing so hard because the cat was riding in the truck. Not only was it in the car... it was rubbin all over me with lots of hugs and kisses. We instantly knew it was ours to keep (we did check around but since we are in the country people tend to ditch animals). We played with name for a while and came up with Macy Gray like the singer lol. Turns out it was a boy so we came up with Earl Gray lile the tea. I hated it cuz Macy Gray was THE name lol. So we named him Mason Earl Gray. So we can keep Macy as nickname. Of course, its normally Mimi Earl. Just love him even tho hes only lovey dovey a few times a year lol.  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/17C5K0MS4JWO1  If I could get another pet, I would chose an english bulldog.
Sneaking in here just to comment on Daisy. So so cute! I have a Daisy too! This silly girl is [my Daisy!](https://imgur.com/a/P6alJmD)  EDIT: just to be super clear I’m not entering! I’m in Canada!

Here's my pet, our [cat Beemo](http://imgur.com/a/0xKxXj9). He's a half ragdoll and is super sweet. Gets pretty drooly when he's affectionate (which is often lol).  [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2OZMNGN3SC0YX?ref_=wl_share)
Still no pet but if I had one I’d love any dog that needs a home 😊  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/YNK11TYESXYM?ref_=wl_share
This is my pet [Cali Cat](https://imgur.com/gallery/d7gE3MG)! She is spunky and full of attitude. But she can be cuddly and sweet sometimes. This is my [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2C27S36776I42?ref_=wl_share).
It is always good to talk about a pet! Currently we have a 7 year old Black Lab and my sister that lives with us has a 7 year old German Shepherd. It's amazing how much fur they can generate! They love to obliterate squeaky toys and lay right outside the bedroom door (which stays open) so when you go to the bathroom in the dark it's a maze.   We also have two cats that are almost 3. They are very close in age, and we did rescue them together, but they are not of the same litter. One is an orange female tabby and the other is a black male tuxedo. They get in to EVERYTHING. They are together almost always and go back and forth between sleeping with my husband and I and my sister. We just started putting claw caps on them (because we don't declaw) and they look adorable and hilarious at the same time. 😂  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/367JODSZXDHMR
My pet? Oh I am owned by three AH! they supervise me, get in the way, demand treats, demand pets and think each one of them owns my lap!!  I speak of Sir Alfred Pendragon III (aka Kiki), Sterling, and Tommy. My crazy kitties!!  Tell me about your pet? Who owns you?  Thanks for hosting a wonderful contest!!   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1AK35UH3JU9U1?ref_=wl_share
My pet Zeus is equal parts angel and menace. I love him so much! He's almost three, and he acts just like a three year old human. If he wants attention, he whines until you give it to him. If I'm walking through the house and he wants to walk with me, he gets up on his back legs and holds my hand with his paws to walk with me. He also does that to hug onto my leg. He also likes to suck on his blanket like it's a pacifier. He owns my whole heart.  Thank you for the contest! <3  [https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/301YL0DVWKIJ4?ref\_=wl\_share](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/301YL0DVWKIJ4?ref_=wl_share)
We don’t have a pet (although my in-law’s dog is basically ours but they won’t let us steal her haha) but we want to adopt one or two old fogeys from the pound! We don’t have the space yet but as soon as we move that’s the goal, give them some love in their old age.
Awe yay I get to gush about my baby! Or PET  Storm is his name and he is my one and only fur baby.   So Storm is a cat about 4 1/2 years old now. I rescued him from cat jail about 2 years ago.   Storm was severely abused and didn’t trust humans. He was in cat jail because he bit someone 🙄. I mean it wasn’t even his fought and they decided to traumatise him further by caging him up how rude right?  So yea I felt bad for the little guy and adopted him and the first year was an adjustment period yes he bit and scratched when he was scared or angry he didn’t want to be held at all. Little things like the sound of a soda can opening scared him and made him built. One time the car alarm accidentally went off in the garage and Storm made it from the kitchen to my room under my blankets by the time I caught up with him. He also had nightmares and I tried to wake him and he latched on to my arm like he was fighting for his life. But like I said he was abused and it was all he knew.    It’s been two years now and it’s like Storm is a different cat. He doesn’t jump or hide from strangers he doesn’t bite or scratch he cuddles, he sleeps with me every night and is the sweetest most loving fur baby ever.  And yes he is spoiled rotten. He even has a bucket seat in my car cause he hates his cat Carer prolly brings back memories of being in cat jail.  Anyways that’s my pet story sorry for rambling.

Im currently saving for my golden retriever service dog, but I have a 12 yr old Nebelung named Vox, who loves belly rubs, and licking eyebrows. I also have 2 whiteface cockatiels I rescued from the trash can when they were chicks. They’re now 3 years old next month, and happily married. The male, Fig, is the sweetest puppy dog I’ve ever known, until he’s sitting on eggs. Then he’s satan with bird wings. Here’s some footage of all 3.   https://imgur.com/a/CqP3Eoc
Omg yes I love talking about my pet! I have a [pitbull named Zeus](http://imgur.com/a/q9o9lGR) and he is the best boy ever!! He thinks he's a lap dog and sleeps with us every night, often letting us use him as a little spoon to snuggle with. He loves to lay on pillows like a human and burrow his nose into whatever crevice is available to keep it warm. He does this thing I call cobbing in which he passionately nibbles at things with his front teeth and he usually does it when he's having an emotional overload and is super excited, grumpy, feeling ignored, happy, etc. He also loves cobbing stuffed animals and likes to rip out their fluff once he tears a hole in them.

Oof I have many many pets. I am going to copy and paste my narrative about my pets from another post. Because writing it all out is O\_O  I have [7 pets](https://imgur.com/a/Y6PNwWR). First pet up is Hazel, she is a 6 year old sheltie mix who joined our family from a shelter 4 years ago. She is loyal, and intelligent, and obedient, but also a nervous wreck LOL. Then comes her little brother Goose. He is a 1.5 year old French Bulldog with enough personality to charm a theater. He is a ball of energy, and such a snuggle bug. He is currently on 4 more weeks of crate rest after being a crazy and hurting his back, but don't worry Vets say he will fully recover, and Goose let's us know he is objecting to his confinement and ready to play.  Now onto Agent, aka creep, aka creepy. LOL She is a 5 year old leopard gecko, who earned her name by creeping on us like a spy. (secret agent) She is a curious and feisty little thing who is full of spunk and has the most beautiful eyes.  Last are the crabbies! First is Ron, I know nothing about him except he is a crab. He buried himself in the sand immediately after being put in the tank and still has not surfaced after a month. Next is Frieda, she is the wild child. She is very curious and enjoys adventures. She is often found climbing upside down on the lid of the tank, and is tiny but mighty enough to not shy away from a human saying hello. Then there is Betty. She is not as outgoing as little Frieda, but will tolerate a human face peering at her, after tucking herself into her shell for a second or two just to be cautious. She is constantly in the food bowl, any snackies? They are hers. When not in the food bowl she enjoys following Frieda around on the less scary climbing adventures. Lastly is Myrtle. She is a newbie like Ron, except she is a teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeny bit more visible. She changed out of her yucky too small painted shell and is sporting a pretty gray/blue one. She is enjoying the new tank, but is the most shy out of the ladies even though she is the largest. She seems to enjoy digging MASSIVE holes in the sand every evening.  Here is my [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1BVB8G71MFKBJ?ref_=wl_share), and thank you very much for the contest! Daisy is precious!
Here is my [pet tax](https://imgur.com/gallery/GlCxVlf)  My dog is Roxy. She is half French bulldog half Boston terrier. She will be turning 12 this year. I love her to bits! She’s slowly going deaf and it saddens me, I hate facing pet mortality! She will forever be my baby though no matter what!   My cat is Dumptruck. He got his name before my husband and I even picked him out. We were trying to come up with ridiculous pet names, he said Dumptruck, I couldn’t stop laughing, so that settled it! He’s the most vocal cat I’ve ever met and he’s also a love bug. He absolutely loves meeting anyone that comes to the house - unless they’re babies/kids.

My pet is a pup we adopted September 2019. His name is Pig because when he was little his ears reminded me of Piglet from Winnie the Pooh. He’s sassy and stubborn and he audibly farts allll the time. But he’s mine and I love him so very much. He loves me more than I deserve.

Awwhh, Daisy is beautiful!! So cute! :)   We actually just got our family’s first pet at Christmas! She’s a Miniature Dachshund, and her name is Dani Moon! Though we mostly just call her Dani or Dani girl, lol. She is 10 weeks old. She’s soo spunky and daring. She loves snuggles. She’s a mamas girl, which a kinda love, lol! ;) And she is just the sweetest cutest lil pup ever! She’s awesome! [ Here’s some pet tax!](https://imgur.com/a/EqbU27T) :)  Thanks for hosting!

Omg! Daisy is the adorbs! I just want to smoosh her.  My house is full of pet hair 😂 we have a big ole rescue pup (we think she’s a mastiff/lab mix) named Summer, & a rescue orange tabby named Butterscotch. They’re both the best ever, but also both getting up there - around 10 yrs. Summer’s got some skin cancer stuff starting so we’re basically feeding her all the yummy foods & doing doggy hospice.

Daisy looks like such a doll!  My favorite pet I had was [Gunnar](https://imgur.com/PkYjmKN ) He was a huge German Shepherd that was so intimidating to look at but he was a quiet gentle baby. He was so well behaved that I hardly had to speak for him to know what I wanted.   Here is my grand puppers, [Molly](https://imgur.com/a/rb29tEz ). She is the best nanny and comfort dog. My daughter adopted her when she was six months pregnant with her second (of three) boy. I though she was nuts but Molly is the perfect fit for their family!
Daisy is adorable!  I have a beagle mix, who is also named Daisy! [Here she is](https://imgur.com/9ciSHmj). She is 8 years old and I love her to pieces! She is crazy, energetic, intelligent, and playful. She enjoys long walks, squeaky toys, and barking at strangers. 😆  Pet  Thank you for the contest!

Aww, Daisy is such a beautiful sweet puppy dog!  I wish we had a dog. Everyone in my family wishes it too. My toddler is a crazy psycho so we're waiting until he's a little bit older to get a dog. We really want a labradoodle as our pet.  Right now we have a bunch of rabbits. And guess what!!! Baby bunnies popped out of their warm den just a few days ago! I haven't been able to get pictures yet because they run right back into the den when I go outside to check on them. So far we have one fluffy white baby and one fluffy orange baby.   Thanks for the contest!  [my wishlist ](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/27Q7X4KANBLD6?ref_=wl_share)
My Pet Ginger is a awesome ginger cat!   She would love a new rainbow or bird to stalk and attack! Keep her busy while mama sleeps days! Before her long afternoon nap!  Her master would dress her up in a tie and wig lol! Both are awesome pet gifts!   Meow the ginger cat  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3D5DDCMII4HHM?ref_=wl_share
My pet cat [Gigi](https://i.imgur.com/x9lRv1z.jpg). I adopted her from the shelter and she's about 2 years old. She loves sitting on the garage floor and bathroom sink. She meows every morning for me to feed her and is always on time. So far she only knows the trick sit and up. Pretty stubborn in listening to me 😂  Your pupper is so cute! Thanks for hosting!

I have a small black cat as a pet. His name is Friday and he was living in a shelter. I like to think he spent his younger years wild and free. He now likes cuddles and yells LOUDLY for food.    [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3AXZVAAT1NBW6?)
I'm not going to give some fluff piece about my dog. I mean, she is cute but she is also kind of a b#$%^ .  She has climbed on the dining table to eat an entire plate of food while we have our backs turned.  Her breath smells like Jabba the Hut's farts.   She refuses to go outside and pee if it is raining, instead waiting until we come back in, then peeing on the only rug in the room.  She hogs the covers.  She barks at family but tolerates strangers.  She makes me swear under my breath many times a week.  But my lord, do we love her, we wouldn't trade her for any other pet  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/39TB29E5XR07X?ref_=wl_share
My puppy nova is so sweet and caring. She barks a lot at people she doesnt know but shes never violent. She LOVES to cuddle and is super conceited. She will also make u feel bad for eating food in front of her and not giving her any 😂 thank you!!  [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/5SOBYLL2FQEL?ref_=wl_share)
[These are my meanie cats!](https://imgur.com/a/3VDiE4D) The Torty is Flatbread and the grey is Garbage! They're actually both sweet and loving but they both are loud when I try to sleep and love to claw things ._. Despite having a scratching box and a post! Flatbread loves to walk back and forth on top of me and Tyler getting pets from us until she inevitably settles on Tyler and loafs on his chest. Garbage loves to make biscuits on him!

This is my pet [Mabel](https://imgur.com/a/JV9uhxU). She is an 8 month old golden retriever and pit mix. She is so spunky and fun. She keeps us laughing and full of joy. She loves going on walks, hikes, and car rides. She loves to play in the water and search for sticks. Fetch is her game but only because she intends on keeping the ball. She is so much fun and brings a lot of joy to our lives.   [Wishes](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/29QRPEKRV1FB0?ref_=wl_share)  Thanks for hosting!
My pet cat, Logan, was adopted in 2017 after my precious cat passed away unexpectedly. Logan was found on Petfinder with just the saddest story. He was adopted as a kitten from the same adoption agency I used to adopt my previous kitty. 6-ish years later they returned him because their newly adopted puppy didn't get along with him. They had him for 6 YEARS and got rid of him for a dog they just adopted. Shame on them, but now he's in a loving and happy home!

I am in Canada so I can't participate but I wanted to share about my three kitties. We call them the pasta cats and their names are Fettucine, Spaghetti and Penne. I also one day want to get a puppy and name him meatball.
My pet is the cutest dog you can imagine. She had 2 knee surgeries before she was 1 year old for genetic problems. So sad seeing her go through and recover form surgery but she’s all good now!!

So my husband and I went to the corner pet store to get cat litter for Marie cat.  The store sometimes hosts shelter cats, to try to get them adopted. Well, there was this grey tabby with massive Disney eyes.  When we read his info card we realized he had been rescued from a parking lot on my husband's birthday, 6 months before he was in the store. After very little negotiation, we decided my husband could get Arnold and in exchange he's responsible for the litter boxes. Well since Marie cat was already attached to his hip, Arnold cat became my BFF AND no litter box duties. Total win all around!   He's snuggly and smart. He knows come, sit, high five, pound it, and go home (to the top of the cat tree). I love him dearly.

I have two rescue dogs, [Perrie and Mimi](https://imgur.com/a/lilV2ei). I don’t have any human children, so they are my babies! They’re very spoiled and love treats, walks, and naps.   Perrie the chihuahua is super affectionate and will do anything for your attention. Her only flaw is that she can be annoyingly loud if she really wants something! On the other hand, Mimi the senior poodle is very chill and doesn’t like to get all up in your business. Despite being much older, Mimi is brighter than her sister 😅and loves to run around and play with toys more.   [list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/JCD7I9FS85VN/?ref_=lol_ov_le)
I have two beautiful dogs, one is a kelpie mix and the other is a long haired dachshund!   They are so crazy and are so much fun:)   So the dachshund, he’s only 8 months and is absolutely crazy! He loves to dig around in the grass and collects rocks!! 😂He just brings them inside and we put them in his little jar. If we didn’t take them I’m sure he would just try to chew them but that would be no bueno on the teeth!  [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2TRIVCPV2582K?ref_=wl_share)
One of my cats, Starbuck likes to share her displeasure at all times. "You pet me too long \*hiss\*" "Do not come closer. \*hiss\*" "I want to eat my food without you looking at me. \*hiss\*" "Why are you in my house? \*hiss\*" She uses hissing the way I use eyerolling. Every tiny little thing that annoys me "UGH EYEROLL." I guess maybe our pets ARE a lot more like us than we imagined.  [Wishlist](https://amzn.to/37J3Qb0)  A rare non-hissing moment.

I'd really love to have a Corgi as a pet but my landlord doesn't allow pets 🙁 I have two cats though because well they don't bark.. 😅  [wishlist](https://smile.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/13EG9A9LC1Q84/)
I have 4 pets! Two cat sons and a fish daughter and a snail!  Puddin is a big orange baby with a nub tail. He likes butt smacks and belly rubs (He is all over my profile lol). Houdini is my more reserved kitty with everybody except me. He clings to me like crazy and his favorite spot is my chest and in the shower with me. He likes to be pet behind his ears only.  I have a female crowntail betta (In a 10 gallon tank!) named Laurens after John Laurens... from Hamilton... :D and she has a tank buddy! A blue mystery snail named Tetris! I thought he was dead for about a month now and I thought his shell was pretty so I kept it in there and then he was on the tank wall yesterday cleaning away. Scared the crap out of me.
My pet baby is named Sebastian. He is a Yorkshire Terrier. He is my baby and I’ve had him for 2 1/2 yrs. he’s a turd but I do love him so! Thanks for the chance!!  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/W4DU1QVD90I7?ref_=wl_share

Your pet is so cute!  My pets are two cats named Lilly and Mr Robin. Lilly is shy around strangers but she is very friendly to people. She is not friendly to animals she doesn't know. Mr Robin gets on her nerves a lot. She loves cuddling with me and won't cuddle with anyone else. She hates wet cat food, for some reason. She is a short haired calico tabby. Mr Robin loves wet cat and really any food. He is shy too, but less shy than Lilly. He is friendly to all humans and other animals. I don't think I have ever seen him hiss and I've only ever seen him get angry because he loved this one toy and didn't want anyone going near his toy, haha. He still didn't hiss, though. He loves annoying Lilly. He will cuddle with anyone but he usually prefers to just lay near you instead of on you. He is a long haired black cat.

I'm currently staying with my best friend and her parents. They like to say that their pets might as well be mine, since I'm practically a member of the family now. So there's the four of us humans  plus a 4 year old blue heeler, three cats, a gecko, and two bearded dragons. I am hoping to get a corgi and a shelter cat as soon as I get my own place so that I can have a pet of my own again.

One of my pet animals is Bailey. She’s a rescue boxer who got in big trouble in her last home for killing neighbors’ chickens. We were so happy to get her as a two year old after our three year old boxer Beau died suddenly when his heart burst. Our hearts broke too and when we met Bailey three weeks later, they cracked open a little to let her in.  She is very silly, always happy (unless she accidentally  gets caught leaping on the kitchen counter where she absolutely knows she doesn’t belong... but like chasing chickens.. she can’t help herself sometimes.)  [Here she is today](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKH6u8yhPEC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) with her brand new bandana.

Daisy is beautiful! She looks so sweet.   I have 2 dogs, Remus and Chug. I have had them both for 5 years and both are rescues! Remus (a border collie mix) is my little shadow. He loves attention and follows me around everywhere. I accidentally step on him all the time because he is always under my feet. He is such a sweet and obedient dog. Chug (a pug husky mix) is my lazy cuddler. He loves my bed and would lie on it all day if he could. He also sucks on blankets and chases laser pens. He is a quirky dog and my buddy.   In August I started fostering this beautiful cat. My 4 year old named her Pumpkin. She was very shy at first but is slowly got braver. She loves getting pets and scratches. SURPRISE! Pumpkin was pregnant and had four kittens. We had no idea she was pregnant until the day before she gave birth. Fostering them was such a blessing in my life. They made 2020 a positive year that I will never forget. They found their forever homes recently so they aren’t under my care anymore but they are too cute not to mention. I miss them so much 😭  And we have a hamster named Honey. He is such a sweet little dude. So calm and happy. He loves fresh green beans and sugar snap peas and running on his wheel all night long.

Daisy is a cutie!!!  I’ve got a pupper named Pluto and a Guinea pig named [Winston](https://imgur.com/gallery/nT8EUvi) (Funny photo I got of them).  I lost two guinea pigs last year so I’m trying to move on and get Winston a buddy again.  Pluto’s just a crackhead. I’m training her to be a therapy dog. Super sweet and character, just major crackhead when hyper.  Thank you for the contest!  [my wishlist 💙](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3NEBSS7Q7G75K?ref_=wl_share)
u/shinpurple, do you have any pets or want any?
My pets: https://imgur.com/a/LNe5QYh  Smokey is 17. She enjoys yowling loudly for no particular reason. She’s going to live forever.  Athena is 5. Her nickname is “Asshole Cat.” She’s a wild child. Very rambunctious.  Zeus is 10. Super mellow. Loves belly rubs and cuddling. Only is interested in other dogs for the first 5 minutes of meeting them. After that, he is just apathetic towards them. He prefers the company of people.
[This is my pet Gio.](https://preview.redd.it/rgxx04fg59a61.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=e8e872a8c5bf91be5cf132c2c290b9790161a5a4)   He is around 4 years old. We got a phone call from a man that lived across the street from my grandparents saying the "damned dog ate a mattress" and had to go. The man who owned him knew my dad loved him and said if he could come get him that day, he was ours for free. So, dad got in the car and brought him home.   Come to find out the guy's adult child had got him Gio because "he liked Game of Thrones" and thought he looked cool. They kept Gio (affectionately G) locked in a metal crate that was for a smaller dog for about 20 hours a day and had him using pee pads. When they let him out, he destroyed some of their furniture.   We've had him since before he was a year old, and the only thing he's ever destroyed "furniture" wise was a hockey puck my parents used as a door stop when their door broke. He sleeps with me every single night, calms me when I have panic attacks, and even though he can be a jerk he's my baby. I'm so grateful for him every single day!

My lovable little muffin is named Gobo! She is a grey cat. Some of her favorite things are sleeping, judging others, walking on furniture she knows she's not to be, staring longingly out the window while I tell her she's a domesticated pet and cannot survive in the wild, and sitting on my lap while I'm trying to do anything important like leaving the house 😊 The day I adopted her was amazing and she's perfect.   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/36EQDVNTQYL87?ref_=wl_share

Oh. My. Gosh. What a sweet face!!! He is precious. He looks big even though he’s a “mini”. How big is he? He sounds absolutely wonderful 💗
Awe at least you have a nearby cat! Those are all good dog breeds, though I’ve heard shiba’s can be stubborn. I’m allergic to most dogs, except the “hypo-allergenic” ones (which daisy is).
I just love her cheeks so much BLESS YOU MIDORI.
Awe that’s cool though! I know a couple friends with chickens, they really enjoy them.
Awh I love this
I cannot wait to get a bulldog!
There's a bulldog who lives nextdoor to my new place. She totally looks like a potato. A very hyper, sweet potato.  I found out her name is Ling - full name: Fingerling. As in potato.
Omg I love her sweet face. Daisy love 💗💗💗
Awe what a chunk 💗
Omg that tongue!!! Love!!!!
Those eyes are beautiful!!
Hopefully you’ll be able to get one eventually! It is incredibly rewarding.
That pic is fantastic! She looks so displeased 😂
Awe all the pets! They all sound great! Luckily daisy doesn’t destroy toys too often but she does love squeakies. She’ll sit there and just squeak them nonstop.
Zeus is so cute.
She looks like she has a mask over her eyes! Too cute.
That’s how my moms dog is! He can be such a dick, but we love him. He’s definitely similar about the rain too. He’ll go outside and then turn right back around 😂
I love the names & future pup name! I’ve been watching impractical jokers & the one guy has 5 dogs all named after diff Italian pastries 😂
Very similar to working for Starbucks corporate then. Maybe Starbucks (the cat) is just trying to train you.. 🤣
Ahh your Lucky is so adorable! I have two cats, [Cleo and Daikou](https://imgur.com/a/FzRqcXp) :)
💜
Awww!  Lucky is so cute!!
Thanks for the tag!!! :D I do wish I had a corgi... someday!
Thanks 😊💚
Thanks for the tag! Omg he is so adorable 😍❤
I'm gonna have to get a personal secretary just to keep up with you lol thank you for tagging
Thanks for summoning me!
I had two Danes once upon a time. Man they are magnificent. However currently I’m trying to save for a Golden Retriever service dog. I have dreams about her even though we haven’t met yet.
I suuuuuuuure do!!! He’s snoring right next to me as I type- sharing my pillow and everything!!! He really does make a perfect body pillow 😂😂😂
He is so adorable!! My bestie had a big baby of a Great Dane if similar coloring. His big brother was a chihuahua and they were the cutest pair!  Here is my grand puppers, [Molly](https://imgur.com/a/rb29tEz ). She is the best nanny and comfort dog. My daughter adopted her when she was six months pregnant with her second (of three) boy. I though she was nuts but Molly is the perfect fit for their family!
😐😶😶😶!!! What kinda snake?! Fascinating!!   Hey make sure you repost this under the actual original post to enter!! It’s under my comment as a reply and I don’t want it getting lost!
No pets. Did you post yours??
Omgggg that pupper!
IKR!?! I was just saying how his face just melts me EVERY SINGLE TIME!! I can never get mad at him bc he’s just so darn cute and innocent!!   lol he’s really not big at all! In fact, there’s a Dane group on FB and their pups all make mine look like he’s not even a Dane! Dane puppies outgrow him! He’s only supposed to be 115lbs but we chonked him out to 130lbs. I’m about 5’1” and when he stands on me we’re about the same height, he may have a couple inches on him if we were really to measure. But when he’s laying down next to me, he goes from the top of my chest down to my feet.
https://i.imgur.com/CVUF0tI.jpg
I got to pat pat pat a bulldog tonight. Made my day!
That is so perfect haha. How sweet :( they are so darn precious. I love squishy face dogs.
She has dementia and walks into things but loves to play and is super happy to cuddle
Thank you! Definitely my favorite feature of his 😊
Right? I made photo calendars for my family for this year, and this picture is our December photo! lol
That is amazing! We got squeaky shoes for my son and it drives some dogs, like my Mom's dog, nuts. 😂
Thank you :-) He's so precious

oh no, giving you a hug! 🌸  recently went through a spiral of many raging emotions due to a recent stressful event 💭 a lot of meditation and affirming things like 'it is okay, everything is okay!' and taking deep breaths can help wonders in stressful situations 💗 using distractions such as reading or cooking is also a good solution 🌸

I had to overcome the fact that I have cervical cancer it has been caught early. It’s been heck on my mental Heath but I am getting thru it the group helps and my books I read  help a lot.
Sorry you had a bad day, I hope tomorrow is better for you.  I overcame a bad situation by recognizing that a drug-fueled relationship was extremely toxic and leaving. It was the first relationship I was in in which I was abused and it was difficult to leave without feeling like I was somehow to blame for what I was put through. My dog helped get me through it and we would go on hour long walks daily. Thankfully, my ex was able to get clean and now we are back together, he isn't a shitty person anymore, and we're happy 💙
I'm sorry you've had a bad day, if you need to talk my dm are open!   There was a time when I had a little meltdown before a presentation. It was bad I was shaking literally in front of the class and felt like I was going to faint. I excused myself and stepped out of the classroom. I didn't eat well in the morning so I had little energy to sustain my nervuousness. I asked my teacher privately if I could do the presentation after lunch, which she surprisingly agreed (because it was either that or I would have failed the presentation). After a hearty lunch, I did my presentation. I was still nervous and shaky, stuttered a whole bunch and didn't make eye contact but I got it over with. Came out with an 80 on the presentation. I think the teacher pitied me but eh oh well 🤷  Thank you for hosting!
I'm sorry to hear you are having a yucky day, but I admire you doing something to make yourself feel better! So thank you for the contest!  Very recently had to cope with an unfortunate situation. My husband and I are hopeful parents via adoption. We got connected with a potential adoption situation and were very excited. It didn't end up being a match which is honestly heartbreaking. Adoption is a journey of ups and downs, and we knew that going into it, but it still is very hard every time something doesn't work out. To cope I bought a mobile for the nursery. I made a pact with myself that every time a match falls through we will buy something for the nursery to remind us that each hiccup just brings us one step closer to to the little bean who is meant to join our family.  I hope you feel better when you wake up! Make sure you make time for your own self care when things are tough!
Hey friend if you need to talk let me know, I am here for you! No judgement, I am hear to listen. I won't even talk if that's what you wish. I have actually battled negative mental health many times in my life and I had to claw my way out of it a lot.   When I was 17 I lost all my grants and scholarships to college and was kicked out of the dorms, because I never went to classes (depression). I ended up on the floor in my work managers apartment having a panic attack and hyperventilated. At that time all I could think about is how easy it would be to just end it all. My manager wasn't even there and I was alone. It would have been so easy.  I for some reason decided that I was better than that and I was going to prove to myself that I was not a let down and worthless. I kept myself busy with work until I could save enough to move and reapply to college.   I think it was my stubbornness that got me through that.   You have the will power and strength to get through this bad time too. We are here for you.
Thanks for hosting this contest! I appreciate you! I had to overcome the loss of my grandmother a few years ago. I lived with her for a long time when I was younger and we were always so close. It still is hard some days but I think about her favorite song or I wear her old shirt and it feels like she’s still here!
Speaking of mental health, I have ADHD, depression, and anxiety. A month or so ago I was in a really bad space mentally and felt like I was going to break down. I kept scheduling and maintaining appointments with my mental health provider to adjust and change my meds until we finally got me to a place where I’m on a good mix and dosage of meds. I still get depressed and anxious but no longer feel like I’m on the verge of losing it constantly.  I didn’t give up on myself and am glad I persevered. It was hard.   Congrats on your first contest!!
I’m sorry you’re having a rough day. I just found out my great uncle died from the rona. I’m bummed.   In 2019, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had no health insurance. I fought hard for myself and got the necessary treatment and surgery. I’ll be paying it off forever but I’m cancer free!   I hope you feel better soon.
God uhh my situations dont compare to most of these😂 hmm a bad situation...would a relationship that was nearly 2 years long be a bad situation? I won't go into details but it was just bad, I thought I was in love and was ready to do absolutely anything for them. But I came to my senses temporarily and broke it off, but I kept pushing myself to go on for longer and longer, it was a week and I started to feel better without them, I started to feel happier and I started to be myself again. Its only been a couple of months since the break up but I haven't been this mentally well in...forever! Sometimes what you think is good for you isn't necessarily the best for you.
I'm sorry you're having a bad time!  I'm babysitting my sister and the first week was bad, she was upset and bored all the time. Now I've implemented a score system where she can score points and win a price and she's happy and excited about it all the time!
Sorry you have had a bad day. I started going to therapy which has helped
I stood up for myself after getting placed in a bad group project and ended up getting a good score, which was mostly luck, but I’m glad it happened. Now I feel more powerful than before 😊 how are you right now? We can talk if you want 💙
Here's a joke to cheer you up! How do you tell the difference between a crocodile and an alligator? You will see one later and one in a while.🐊  Bad situation - uni exam stress. I had things going on at home and right in the middle of uni exams. Result: my friends - absolutely rocks. They helped me so much to forget the other bits and sat with me in the library from 9-5 to revise. Hope you also have such a brilliant support network too 😊
So sorry to hear that you are having a bad time. A time I had a bad situation was when my ex friend called the police on me for harassing her. I wasn’t even harassing her she called me a disgusting transgender lesbian. The thing is I am not transgender. Even if I did like girls that wouldn’t be any of her business. I told everyone that I wasn’t transgender because I have the right to defend myself and especially since saying things like this can be dangerous. I had to tell the cops that I was defending myself and they had to close the file. It was hard to go thru all that I did eventually overcame it when I found better friends who actually treat me like a human being.
when covid was at its start, I had a really hard time because I had just moved in with my dad again and then lockdown happened so I couldn’t leave the house at all, it was really difficult because our relationship is a little strained. It made my mental health really bad and I just wasn’t in a good place at all. But a few months ago, I was able to move out and get a place of my own (thanks to my very hardworking girlfriend) and I am a lot happier.   She was staying at my dads as well during the time and if it hadn’t been for her, I’m not sure what would have happened. We both worked really hard to make our apartment a home and I am just a lot happier now (:
One time I overcame a bad situation was when my grandmother passed away last year. It was just a lot at once. I had moved jobs the week before, moved to a new apartment that weekend, and then she got really sick and died within a few days. I was really not doing well emotionally, and ended up getting shingles from all the stress.   What really helped me though it was my family. It was my dads mom who passed away, and when I got the diagnosis of shingles my dads reaction was to smile really wide and say “wait, does that mean you’re off work and can hang out with me for a while??”. That reaction just made me see things differently. I realized I was so lucky to have my family and that we could be there for each other, and on top of that, that they relied on me for support as well! That made me feel much stronger so that I could be there for my dad.
When we first went into lockdown I was really struggling with depression. My friend suggested the book “your brain needs a hug.” It was perfect
I hope your tomorrow is better than your today!   A friend of mine passed away this week. I am still overcoming this bad situation, but it helped to take a bubble bath, write in my journal, and drink some hot cocoa.
Have a hug friend. Have a hug
I had a bad situation last night. I got into a small tiff with my housemate who also happens to be my landlord. I've been in a number of bad housing situations in the past, so my first reaction was, "She's going to kick me out and I'm going to have to figure out where to live again." Which is not really based in reality. It was hard to get to sleep; I kept worrying about having to move again and losing my hard-earned stability. I tried to remind myself that I was thinking of a worst-case scenario, and that it was pretty unlikely that it would turn out that way.  Today, I talked with my housemate and apologized for my part in our disagreement yesterday. She apologized too, and everything is fine now.
I am so sorry that your day isn't going well. My mental health has been taking a hit this week as well. If you need a new friend to talk to, please feel free to message me. I love meeting new people and I find when I have the opportunity to cheer somebody else up, it improves my mood as well.   Overcoming a bad situation ... my husband and I have been trying to conceive for three years. We went through fertility treatments, I had surgery, and I just continued to feel more and more ill and still no results. In September I decided to take back control of my life, and we decided that we were going to stop. It still hurts my heart to think that we may not be parents, but my health is starting to get to a better place and we are discussing adoption options. Taking control of the situation really helped me.
Found myself in a large amount of credit card debt from poor spending habits. Wife helped me out and has held my hand through it all until we are here today happy and financially stable.
I went through a bad break up last year and it really hurt me and broke my heart. It took ages to even move considering myself as single.   I got put to a group about 5 months after to go for walks and do fun activities where I met some amazing people who i just got on so well with and a couple of those are now my closest friends.   It was being able to have a distraction and have people to talk to and have a laugh with that really helped. Then i got a job and started moving forward   Eventually got back with this guy and we've been great since 😊
Guten tag! 😀 that and asking if you have a sister, counting to 10, and saying "shit sandwich" are the only German I've walked away with after 4 years of it. I'm CONFIDENT all 4 of those will come in handy at some point! 🤣🤣🤣  Difficult situation, well, I was canned and thrown out on my happy ass while having a spotless employment record, because why you ask??? So the company could save a few thousand bucks by promoting my assistant that I had trained, flawlessly, for three years. The owner of the company told me, and I quote, since it will forever be burned into my brain, "this has absolutely nothing to do with your performance. Your performance has been incredible. It's not about that." And just like THAT, HotelSarah1234 became NONHotelSarah1234.   I hope you feel better in the morning. 🙂🤗
I want to share a lighthearted happy story to cheer you up, not a sob story! One time, I was really upset because I  was having a gloomy day. In order to cheer myself up, I took a nice bubble bath and did some self care! I put on a sheet mask, got in bed, and watched my favorite TV show. Then I felt better in no time!  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
I’m sorry to hear you’re having a bad day mental health wise. Yesterday was hard for me mentally. But support from this group really helped me. Every time I’ve been in a tough spot it has been the support and encouragement of my loved ones that has turned it around for me. That and a good nights sleep. Some things resolve themselves when we sleep. I hope we can help you get your day turned around. Xoxo. Thanks for the contest!
Hey purple, it’s me, purple! I recently overcame a bad situation via the kindness and generosity of the people around me. My best friend passed away 1 month ago today and I’ve pretty much stayed in bed all day pretty sensitive but so many people have send me condolence cards and little gifts to remind me I am loved and even my acupuncture lady lifted my spirits. But it’s been very somber without my best friend. She brought so much laughter and light and it’s really hard to be without her. But the days will get better... they will. Death is only hard on those who are left behind and we have to find a way to continue on with life. And honestly I’m just in awe of the love and generosity of the community I have around me. People really show up for you and that makes me cry tears of joy.
Hugs! Its the worst when your mental health is like "k we're bad now!" No MH! We were doing great! "Nope. Life is pain" I find relatable web comics are the best comfort, because mood.  Hoooooo boy, over came **A** bad situation? This will be a long one. Lets go with a cover all "many many issues" that lead up to a night in the hospital, and than a couple months later an autism diagnosis. I overcame it mostly by exploring my diagnosis, what it means to me, how it led me to be in situations that damaged my mental health and how it caused me to react to those situations. A long time sitting and thinking and deciding how to move forward in life and become someone I wanted to be. Yesterday I was described as having a positive energy, so I guess Im winning this battle!  Sleep well fellow MH warrior.
Hey there, I hope you get some rest and have a better day tomorrow. Fresh start!!  Well, there is nothing quite like getting your heart broken. A few years ago was a particularly rough patch, and I've been growing and learning about myself since then. I learned some tough lessons, and I'm now ready for a relationship when a connection feels right. Friends were my rock, 100%, through the hard times. And family. And me just keep myself busy and moving forward in whatever way I could each day.
Hey friend!   Idk if this helps but... I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety most of my adult life, as well as some pretty major insecurities. For awhile about 5ish years ago, it was really, really bad... not quite active thoughts of suicide, but frequent thoughts of death and urges to turn my steering wheel into traffic, off a bridge, etc. My husband & I were at the brink of divorcing, I was about the quit my job, and I was a really crummy mom. I resumed meds but mostly just realized that I needed to learn to say “no” — no to being overworked, no to being everyone’s go-to, no to carrying everyone else’s emotional weight. I think that was a big turning point. I had been carrying a lot of grief and pain from some past losses, and letting go of that was so huge.  As I go through my 30s, I’ve realized my life isn’t about what people think about me, or how “good” I am at (blank). I’ve given up on trying to please the world, and am worrying about making *me* happy instead.  Sorry for the long post — above all, remember that **you** deserve sunshine, self-care, and smiles. Acknowledge whatever you need to, then let it go.  Big hugs 💕
Hello, honestly my life has been difficult, mom committed suicide when I was 9, got pregnant at 16 had a baby at 17 and pretty much everything I've done has been for her, now my dad has been diagnosed with two types of dementia so he's going to be ripped away from me to soon too. But I'm finally living for me again, as painful as it is to know my dad will die sooner rather than later I don't have to worry about him anymore as long as he's happy, my daughter is old enough now that this year she'll be driving, and I am going back to school and getting certified in cannabis education, I'm getting married to my soul mate who is such a great dad to my kiddo even at her age where she doesn't need another parent telling her what to do. I've forgiven my mother, and I'm happy which I can say after years of "I'm fine" or "I'm here" and "I'm not dead yet"
TW: very brief mentions of self harm, no details   This was a good thing to do to help your mental health and hopefully distract you long enough for the elevator to stabilize.  I struggle with my mental health too. I used to self harm but I’ve been clean for like 6 years now. I almost broke last summer when i went to live in another state, on my own for the first time for an apprenticeship. I had the summer romance I’ve always dreamed of. I fell in love very fast and at times he behaved and said things that made me think he felt the same. Halfway through summer he said we should see each other less. I took it hard because I thought things were great but he wanted to take a break Ross and Rachel style. We only had the summer together though and I just couldn’t understand. Turns out he just wanted time to himself since we were spending all our time together. So we worked something out. It didn’t last long though because he kept inviting me over on his “me time” days and D&D nights and we quickly fell back into our normal routine. On my birthday, he took me out and told me he loved me and wanted to be my boyfriend. Which I took to mean that he changed his mind about not wanting to do long distance when my internship was over. Apparently not. But he brought up the idea of me moving in with him. My last semester of college was remote and this new city I was in had so many more opportunities for me than my small town. So I moved in and he broke up with me two days later.. I was forced to stay in his apartment for a couple more days in order to pack my car back up and organize meeting my parents halfway. We did not speak for those couple days. Not one word. I went to bed early and when he came to bed I moved to the couch. I held it together. I talked to my mom and my nana and my friends and my therapist on the phone. I reached out in a couple fb groups I’m in. I tried to get excited about going home. I read a bunch. I spent pretty much all day on the balcony chain smoking. But I didn’t hurt myself. I was strong enough to drive all the way home and enjoyed my time with Nana in the car listening to all the good music I discovered over the summer. I cried a lot and was very depressed when I got home and barely passed my last semester of college. But I held it together. That was pretty much the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through emotionally and I actually handled it. Younger me never would have been able to get through that. It gives me hope for the future. There still might be times when I’m depressed and feel helpless, but it gets better, it sometimes gets really good, and when it’s really really bad, well, I know I can do it cause I’ve done it before.   (On a somewhat related note, I received a letter from him today along with the stuff I forgot, but I’m putting off reading it. Nana read it ahead of time and insists I need to read it but I’m scared)
I'm so sorry you're going through such a rough spot right now. I hope you can feel good again soon. Congratulations on your first contest, thanks for hosting.  About 3 years ago I was an emotional and mental disaster. I came off a skin medication that made me psychotically anxious about everything. Panic attacks everywhere. I knew I had to be patient and wait it out for the medication to leave my system but it was one of the hardest things I've ever put myself through. It took months to get back to normal. To get through it I started a gratitude journal. Whenever my mind would wander to anxiety, I'd whip out my journal and start writing down all the things I was grateful for. It really grounded me in the moment. I was also able to go on medication to help with the anxiety so those coupled together really helped me get through those dark, dark months.
Hey u/shinpurple, how are you doing now? If you want to vent about it, do it! Get it off your chest!   You are so loved here. We all care about you ❤️ I hope your day gets better. I’ll check in w you later if you don’t mind
I’m sorry you are feeling down. Some things I do to cheer myself are a pampering shower and shave, nails trimmed,filed and painted.   I break out my coloring books or journal and let the creativity flow or do a puzzle.   Sometimes I will call someone who I haven’t talked to in a while and we both get cheered up!  Sometimes just browsing some of my favorite subreddits cheer me up plenty! I love r/animalsbeingderps and r/animalsbeingjerks.   I am here if you need to vent or chat!
MASSIVE TW   I’ve always struggled to be happy. I was depressed even when I was a little kid and self harmed a lot. I’d wear nothing but sweatshirts and didn’t take them off... even during p.e. I think my mental health got super bad when I entered Highschool. I managed to get into an amazing school (Lane Tech for those who live in chicago) and I went from a straight A student who took extra classes after school to a person who constantly failed, skipped classes, and cried in the bathroom because my anxiety was so bad. I had to transfer schools. It messed me up a lot. The three years I was there I was miserable. I self harmed even more and tried killing myself. I got admitted into the hospital about 4 times for suicidal ideation and attempts. I didn’t have any friends. I was getting in and out of relationships and hurting myself. I regret a lot of things. I wish I had worked harder and not had to switch schools. I wish I was still that smart girl I used to be. But I’m rebuilding myself. I’m learning how to be better. I met my amazing boyfriend on my last year at that school and he helped me a lot. Despite how scary it was being with him and how many times I hurt him (my thing was to hurt people before they hurt me first) he stood by me and taught me many lessons. He’s helping me be a better person and grow up. I’m a lot happier now. I wont lie though, recently my depression and anxiety has spiked again. I woke my bf up this morning cause I couldn’t stop crying. I opened my eyes and the first thing I did was cry :( . I have suicidal thoughts again but I know I’m strong and can get through things. Everyone can. You seem like an amazing person and I know that you’re going to be okay. The occasional bad day will always pop up. Something that breaks our hearts will happen. We will cry and scream into our pillow but we’re strong because we get through it. How many times have wanted to give up? But we haven’t. I mean in this community alone there’s over 200 people !! That’s 200 people who have lived over 18 years and went through a shit ton of problems and challenges!!   u/ShinPurple I hope we can be friends. I admire people who can openly say they had a bad day but still try their best to make others smile. You have over 60 comments full of people that care for you!!! Dont be afraid to ever reach out and vent. <3
Hey lovely, I hope your okay and managing during this difficult period. I’ve struggled with both depression and anxiety from being young, this also affects my partner, and my sister and mother whom I have caring responsibilities too. I don’t think I know anyone who hasn’t struggled with their MH at some point. I know it’s hard to think that things will get better but they will. I had a pretty rough time last year when I thought I had the love and support of my friends whom I’d always trusted and would do anything for. Well last year proved me completely wrong! They actually made me the worst I have ever been for years through their toxicity and cruelty. However, they really actually helped me reevaluate some things in my life and made me a stronger person and I am now much happier and at peace with my life and those who are in it. What I can say is that there are some amazing people in this RAOA community who can really brighten up your day! I’ve found so much pleasure and joy being part of this sub. Everyone is super friendly and will always try to help where they can! If you ever need anyone to talk too, I’m always happy to DM 💜  Sending lots of positive thoughts and virtual hugs 🤗
Hey, another person with purple in their username!  I'm glad it's fairly different otherwise, though.  There used to be a person here whose username also started with neongreen.  It was so frustrating, people would get us mixed up *all the time*.  He's no longer active here AFAIK, though.  I hate it when I have bad days.  I had a rough night last night, I had to quit reading a book altogether (like, I won't be able to finish it) because it was bad for my mental health.  And then I had to get myself some chocolate and ice cream.  Luckily we have a 24-hour Walgreens in my town!  I don't really have any good stories of overcoming bad situations, though.  I hope your bad day improves.  Or at least your mental health stops being a butt for a bit.
This "bad situation" happened to me last year. The aftermath consisted of me overthinking about it, but now that a new year rolled around, I decided to move forward. I mean, why spend time on something that's not important anymore? Time is so precious; there's only so much of it we have. It's a new year and I'm feeling productive. I can get things done now. Those months were mildly frustrating, but eventually I reached a point of... tranquility. And now that the weight is gone, I can walk at my own pace.
Aw, dang. I'm sorry you had a rough day. Be kind to yourself.   Hmmm... I'm trying to think of a particular bad situation to site, but most things I've been able to put behind me. What pops to mind are interpersonal conflict, and times I had to put myself and needs above what I was sacrificing. I had a job with a boss who was not very nice to me, ever. I found a new job and when I resigned she was shocked. When I told her why she couldn't believe that I was so unhappy. She almost convinced me to stay. But I moved on, and I'm so glad I did because the job I went to was awesome!   Sometimes, even if it's tough you've got to set clear boundaries, and set yourself up for happiness.   Tomorrow is a new day, and I hope sleep was a good "re-set button" for you!
When my boyfriend and I got in a really bad argument and I was sad I watched a shit ton of movies non stop. It helped a bit  I hope you feel better soon !! And thank you for this contest
I'm sorry to hear you've been feeling down my friend. In my own personal experience, I had a lot of those moments during 2020. As everyone knows, it was quite a terrible year. Yet one moment really got me down.   My grandmother who was just in the hospital had recovered fully and was able to recover at home. Instead of staying at home and recovering, she went outside to a restaurant to eat. This was during the pandemic's worst phase. Everyone warned her not to and because I don't live in the same country as her, the only people who could stop her were my grandpa and cousins. None of them did anything but rather they encouraged her. She ended up in the hospital again and I was unsure if she'd make it out. The whole experience frustrated and upset me. And it took a while for me to fully be back to myself. One thing that helped me overcome this situation was to alter my thinking and how I coped with those negative thoughts. Instead of feeling upset or frustrated, I focused on a realistic benefit of the situation. The benefit of that situation was that she was able to get further testing done and was cleared of her complications. We tend to focus on the negatives of a situation because those flaws are glaringly obvious. But if we saw the potential positives, then perhaps we could learn to accept a situation and cope with it better.
Honestly my life is basically a series of unfortunate events. Fate just loves punching me in the throat anytime something goes my way.  But, each time, I get back up, formulate a new plan, and do my best. At the end of the day, if I haven't died I'm okay. It may not be perfect, or even good, but it's something.  The time before last that I broke my foot I was in a different city for school and had no one to call, and no way to get to the hospital (that didn't cost way more than I could afford) so I hopped, cried, and dragged myself there, got a cast, and crutched, cried, and started dragging my way home. About 4 blocks down a doctor saw me and gave me a ride, and halfway home we learned I'm allergic to codeine. :/  But I didn't die. That's enough sometimes.
first of all let me say that if you ever need someone to share with feel free to hit me up, I feel like when I'm down it's best for me to talk with peoples I don't know, I feel like I can actually say what's ever on my mind that way.     which brings me back to the subject of how I overcame a bad situation, during my time in the military (mendatory where I live) I had a really hot temper, I guess it had something to do with my grandfather passing away 26 days before I got recruited, never had the time to actually be sad about it, missed every memorial day for him for the three years after it.   I ended up punching one of the guys on my unit because he kept trying to make fun on something that really made me angry, and it was just before the second year of my grandfather passing away.   my commander decided to send me to the mental health officer (basically a psychiater in the military) just  so I can talk to someone outside of the unit and get everything out of my system, he listened to me, no judgment at all, just listening and being there for me.   after it he managed to let me get out for 24 hours and go visit my grandfather's grave, it was a couple of weeks after his two years of passing away, but it was good for me to actually go visit his grave and have some time alone there, always wanted him to see me in uniforms, I hope he saw me that day and was proud of me.     that's why I always saying that it's best to talk to someone you have nothing to do with, that way you can actually get everything out of your system
I’m sorry you are having a difficult time. If you ever want to talk, I’m here for you. Wishing you all the best.   I’ve been struggling with infertility the last two years. The longer I struggle the harder it is for me. I feel anxious, depressed, hopeless. I’m still pushing through my bad situation but I hope to be free from it soon. 2021 has already been better to me than 2020.
First off, lots of people have offered to talk but if you just want a distraction, my go-to happy stuff is [Pingu](https://www.youtube.com/user/pingu) :)  That said: my first relationship was pretty bad. I was in my second to last year of high school. I didn't really have the tools to understand it at the time, but I figured out a few months afterward (with the help of a friend who had gotten sex education, as I had not) that it had included repeated events of sexual assault. Unfortunately I had to keep going to school every day with this guy. We had choir and theater together too. I went to the police about it, but they ended up botching the case so badly that this local children's advocacy center hosted further trainings with my town's police department.   My last year of high school fucking sucked. I was battling PTSD. I was in a pretty conservative school, so a lot of people didn't believe me. It ended up pushing me from being a centrist to being a liberal, so while I was much more comfortable in my own skin, I wasn't a fan favorite of the high school either. I was jumpy all the time, I was moody all the time. I was a total wreck, even with therapy.   But I also suck at keeping my own secrets. I was pretty open about what happened, not with intent to defame the boyfriend; while I did want to make sure people knew so they had some warning before dating him, I also made an effort to stress everything he didn't do, and he had confessed it to a few of his friends anyway. (Not that it made a different in the school voting him "Mr. CHS." Had to interview him for that story. Fucking sucked.) But in being open about my story, about half the people I told ended up coming back with a story of their own. My school already had several known sexual assaulters, but I realized I was the first survivor to step forward publicly, and I ended up becoming the high school's unofficial crisis line.   About once a month I'd take someone to this drive-in called Sonic. Maybe I'd made a post and they DMed in response, maybe we were continuing a conversation that happened in class. Once it was a girl who had been assaulted by my ex. I'd listen to their story, reassure them, and give them a list of all the resources in our community. I'd recommend some therapists I'd heard about, tell them what they could do besides the police. I wasn't great, but I was more than the school already had.  Once I got out of the high school, it was a huge weight off my chest. He was attending a college in our state, and I was going to the opposite side of the country. I got the space to find myself again and breathe and actually recover instead of just surviving each day. I felt myself get less and less jumpy. I got the strength to try sex again, to have a healthy relationship again, to volunteer at a domestic violence center.    And honestly, I realized I loved the work. I went across the country to study journalism in college, and I ended up switching to policy studies one semester in. My future plan is to be a policy advocate for orgs targeting sex ed, child abuse, domestic violence, or consent.   Oh, and that children's advocacy center that trained the police after my case? I got to intern with them two years after they conducted my forensic interview, and I'm their keynote speaker for their main fundraising event in March. (Fingers crossed it can still happen--COVID's a bitch.) I want to tell a story from my internship where I got to support a mom who reminded me of my own.   Hope this isn't too long--it's about three and a half years of story. But I still find strength in that I survived all that bullshit. It gave me the courage to come out, it gave me the courage to pursue my interests, it gives me the courage to get through COVID. Because even if I end up in a situation as shitty as that one, I will never end up in a situation as shitty as that one *without the tools I developed then*. I'm ready, you bitch of a universe! *Try* and fuck with me!   I hope your mental health improves. I hope you can find a time to go lie in the grass and stare at the sky and be content for a few minutes. And I hope you slept well tonight!
High school was bad. Therapy and the support of my parents helped. I’m doing a lot better now. Due to graduate college soon! December 2021.
Life’s been rough and I never handled it very well. I turned to drugs to numb the pain. In December I just celebrated 3yrs heroin free! It’s never easy and mental health issues are sooo real. Everyone struggles and has their own fights  us humans are pretty damn strong I’d say!!! Thanks for the chance!
Hugging you back :)   I'm happy to hear that meditation and positive affirmation work for you! It always feels like I lie to myself but I guess that's the point - fake it until you make it.

I’m so proud of you for pushing through. I’m thinking of you always XOXOXO
Sending you all the healing energy!
Sending you so many hugs and strength! You got this! Fight like a girl!
Wow, getting that diagnosis must have been a hit in the face. I hope that your treatment will go well and that your support system helps!  My mom is still recovering from her own cancer treatment, it's definitely a journey.
Thank you, I do feel better now  I'm glad to hear there is a happy ending to your story! Give that dog some love from me!
I totally relate to your story. I HATE giving oral presentations or having to speak in front of people. I get so nervous and I start to stutter. I am so glad the teacher was understanding. And you should be proud!
You spoke up for yourself and that is super hard and I'm super proud that you managed to do it! Really awesome!
That is an amazing thing to do, turning those negative moments into something positive!  I do feel better now, thank you
Thank you!   I'm happy to hear that you managed to come out of this bad situation being stronger. It's hard to pick yourself up and you crushed it! I dropped out of college because of my depression and other health issues so yay. But maybe I'll be able to give it another try in the future
I'm sorry to hear that, I'm happy that you are doing better now. Would you like to share her favorite song or is that something you'd like to keep private?
Oof, finding the right medication can be hard. I'm super happy that you kept up with all your appointments, it can be really hard to find the energy for that! Super good that you kept that up until you found something that works!  (My options were super limited, I can only take the one anti-depressant that doesn't have weight gain as a possible side effect.)
Oh man, my condolences :(   And god, cancer can suck it. I'm really glad to hear that you beat it! Do you still have follow up appointments?
It is so hard to see the whole picture when you are inside it. Good for you for leaving <3
Don't compare your hardships to those of other people, we are all dealing with our own issues!   I'm glad you got out of that relationship and I hope you are having good family or friends to support you and help you!
You sound like a great sibling! Game-ifying is the bomb!
Therapy is so good <3
YES, that's great! It can be so hard to speak out if you have the pressure of other people lurking behind you.   I'm feeling a bit better now but I have to see how my day goes and hopefully I won't crash during evening.
For some reason that joke made me giggle A LOT.
Awwr that are awesome friends! <3   I do have a great support network, but reaching out is hard.
Wow what the fuck. Like seriously, what the fuck? Yeah, throw those people to the curb... Good that you found real friends now.
I feel that, I'm living with my mother and I can't wait to move out. No girlfriend in sight for me though. ;)   Good to hear that you have a comfortable space to call a home now!
Oh, big hugs to you. Your dad sounds really sweet and shingles suck!!!!
Oh man... that really puts a wholesome spin on an otherwise grim situation. So good that your dad managed to see the joyful site and share that positive energy with you.
Sounds like a good read! But now i imagine two brains litereally hugging oh my
I’m so sorry to hear.  I recently lost a friend too and it’s really tough. Hugs to you 💜
Oh man, that's tough... I'm glad you got a self-care routine. Hug from me as well <3
Thank you :)
That must have been a really bad panic. I'm glad you two talked it out and hopefully you can remember this conflict resolution and stay calm if something like this should happen again.
Thank you, it's super kind but I'm really bad at talking to new people ahh  3 years is a long time, that must have been hard not ohnly physical but also mentally. I'm glad that you are feeling better now and I wish you two all the best luck!
Your wife's a champ!
Sounds like a great group, going outside your house and experiencing new things is great (fuck you covid)   Your life really picked up, congrats on the job!
Ah damn, only have a brother but now you will never know 😔  That is bullshit like what??? Thank you very much management, wow. I'd be so pissed. Did you find a better place to work at?
Yes, I love hearing people taking care of themselves!
A good support system and sleep, that's the dream <3
Hey purple! <3   Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. I'm glad that you got so many lovely people in your life that are by your side.
I love the term mental health warrior! And yeah, web comics are great, i share the "goodbye winter depression, hello normal depression" every year because it's just the truth.     That must be a tough diagnosis to get but I hope it also brings you some comfort and the help and understanding you might need. Positive energy is a huge plus, nice!!
Oof broken hearts....   Happy to hear that you had a lot of lovely people there to support you!
Ah yeah I know those thoughts. I'm happy that you could turn around from them and have a bright outlook now. I try to become the best version of myself but it's still hard not to compare your weak points to someone elses strength.   Thank you!
Wow, what a ride. I'm sorry you had to endure so much pain and stress and I'm so happy to hear that you are now in a good place!
Hey, I'm super proud of you! I struggled with self harm in the past too and some days the only thing stopping me is the knowledge that I don't live alone.   What your ex did is super shitty.... Why would he suggest you move in and then break up right after, that must have been such a stressful situation. Heartbreak alone, just the moving and the new city and then THAT UGH   If you can trust your Nana and she really insist you need to read it... then I hope you can do it. Maybe with her or a friend sitting with you, able to support or distract you afterwards?
Super happy to hear that you got better! I didn't know skin medication could have such huge impacts after stopping it.
I hate a bad night but a pretty good day, thank you!
I love puzzles! Creative things always make me anxious of "skill" and "failure" though haha   Thanks for the sub suggestions!
Thanks for sharing your story! I can definitely relate, I went from best student in my class to one of the worst and on top of that I was the youngest and fattest. Not a good combo. I'm happy that I don't have suicidal thoughts often anymore. I'm also really glad to hear that you have such a supportive boyfriend that is there for you and helps you!     Yeah I was surprised how sweet all the comments are! Definitely a lot to read through, so worth it!
Good friends are so important! And yes, this community is super wholesome! <3 Thank you!
Hey purple friend! No chance of getting us confused :D   Oh yeah media can have a huge impact oof. I'm happy you managed to calm down and care for yourself. I think that counts as overcoming!
Tranquility sounds super nice, I'm glad you got to this point and could let go of the weight!
It's awesome that you were able to stand up for yourself and not budge! Sleep was kinda rough but the day was good, so thanks for the reset :)
Distraction is a good tactic   Thanks!
Oh man I was really worried reading this, I'm happy to know that things turned out good for your grandmother. Seeing the positive things can be hard. Stay safe!
Oh my god.... That's shit you can't invent. My whole respect for you, that must have been so tough and painful.  (I actually broke a bone in my foot and walked around on it for 2 months in pain before going to the hospital and at that time It was already healing so no cast for me. yay?)
Thank you! I'm awful at letting go of my thoughts and I feel like I'm even worse at talking to strangers. I think my fear of being judged and not being able to put up my social mask is stronger than the fear of being alone with my thoughts.   Thanks for sharing your story, I'm happy the mental health officer could help you!
Thank you!   That must have been hard news to recieve, I hope you have a lot of lovely people in your life to support you!
Wow, thank you a lot for sharing this.    It sucked that this happened to you but I'm amazed by your strength, willpower and friendliness. Instead of shutting in you connected with so many people and helped them and now you are helping even more. That's amazing! <3  Lying in the grass will definitely be on my bucket list once spring comes
Happy to hear that therapy helped! Good luck during your last year!
Unhealthy coping mechanisms are the worst... Super proud of you to leave that behind!
You are just so sweet and on top of everything thank you for being another caring individual hugs to you
<3
💚💚💚
Oop time to cheer them up !!!
Xoxo
🙌 we got you!
I’m sorry you are feeling down. Some things I do to cheer myself are a pampering shower and shave, nails trimmed,filed and painted.   I break out my coloring books or journal and let the creativity flow or do a puzzle.   Sometimes I will call someone who I haven’t talked to in a while and we both get cheered up!  Sometimes just browsing some of my favorite subreddits cheer me up plenty! I love r/animalsbeingderps and r/animalsbeingjerks.   I am here if you need to vent or chat!
Always and forever!!
Hey it’s what we do when a fellow friend is feeling down!! 😊😊😊
Thank you so very much.
Thank you boo
Thank you ☺️
It wasn’t easy but my mom also had cancer she had Breast Cancer and she passed away a little over 2 years ago and it was difficult to see her go thru that.
You are me!! I know, I never liked the teacher but she gave me a pass that day. And thank you, it was really tough but I survived 😅
Thank you so much for the kind words ❤️
I’m so glad to hear that! Keep up with the self care though! It’s so important!
Also feel free to reach out if you ever need to talk! My inbox is always open!
It’s I can’t help falling in love by Elvis! She loved that man immensely!
Thank you and yeah, that’s super limited!! Is there really only one? They’re always coming out with new pills with lesser side effects. The one I’m on now has very little side-effects.
It definitely was hard to see but im so glad I got out of it when I did!🥰
Yes I really appreciate the friends and family I have more now than ever!!
I should had seen the warning signs before. She asked me out one time to prom and I said no she got mad and didn’t speak to me at all. The tipping point was during quarantine she was texting me a lot and then one day I told her I was hanging with my friends and I couldn’t talk to her so much so she started to Unsend all her Instagram dms to me idk what she trying to do so I blocked her ass. Then we had a tiff and she called the police. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and she posts a pic with a long ass caption about 2020. In it she lowkey points a finger at me blaming me for her depression and suicidal thought. I told her once I felt depressed she just laughed at me🤦‍♂️
Honestly it really turned things around. We spent so much time together and it made everything feel much better!
Thank you! <3
Thanks!
We have a pretty good relationship, so I think we will be able to figure things like this out pretty easily. I hope I can keep my head!
No problem. I totally understand.   It was. I became a while different person. My friends even mentioned that I wasn't myself. I'm starting to feel like myself again, at least semi human haha. Thank you for the kind words.
Life happens for a reason :)
Do you have a good support system? My psychiatrist tells me most people don’t.
It was actually really nice because I have mood regulation problems and I really thought I had BPD, which is the diagnosis I was seeking the day I got my ASD diagnosis. Ive always suspected autism and been shut down by people saying not everything needs a label, so to actually get a label and be able to say actually it really affects my life is really really validating. Some people, my  mother included, have actually apologised for invalidating me and have really embraced the label and have been amazingly supportive.   I so feel that winter/normal/lockdown depression combo. Thats why I celebrate yule, halfway out of the dark and into a different kind of depression!
It can literally only go up from here minus the actual dad dying part yet to come but it'll be a relief by then.
Thank you so much ❤️ I read it last night after everyone went to bed. It wasn’t upsetting like I thought it would be, but he said some things that made me reconsider cutting him out of my life completely. So I’m currently sitting on that.
Most medications like ointments don't do that. My medication was accutane and it's in pill form. It's essentially a very large dose of vitamin A that changes the biome of your skin. It was intense!
I’m glad it got better for you! ❤️ remember we’re always here for you!
You're welcome!   I hope today is a better day!
Thank you! <3
Sleep rocks. I hope whatever happens it gets better!
Yeah, it was not a good time.  Oof, thats no good! Did it heal okay?
The fear of being judged is exactly why I feel better with sharing it with strangers. They'll never meet me again, so what's the worst that can happen?
Thanks!
That’s so nice of you to say! I just feel like you guys were all there for me when I needed it the most, so I know together we can spread that joy and uplift others!
Yup!!! Let’s do what we do best, guys!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Woot woot!!  I know I can always count on you guys!!
I love this!! But make sure you comment under u/shinpurple ‘s post so she sees this!! We gotta cheer her up!! ❤️❤️❤️
You’re so welcome! You got this!! 💖
Yes you did!
I have been on it for 5 years or so now so maybe there are alternatives now, not sure if it's worth switching though
I was in a relationship for 5 years that turned out to be toxic and controlling. It happened so slowly that I didn't realize it. I also was really good at pretending that I was ok so I didn't have anybody on the outside telling me that it was not ok.
I do have a lot of awesome people in my life, but I'm often bad at reaching out to them and turn to slightly unhealthy coping mechanisms instead
Ah that's good to hear that your mother and others turned around! I feel the same way about adhd, a lot of symptoms just fit but maybe those symptoms are just my natural state or whatever. My therapist at least doesn't think i have it
I hope you find the answer that helps you the most!
Oh wow! :0
Yeah I was lucky it healed well and didn't need surgery!
Yes it's nice to see some of the same names everyday in all the threads that I can into as well looking to give support and love for everyone in need. Hugs
Woops! Thank you for alerting me!
That I do and I know I can over come it especially for my kiddos and hubby ☺️
Sorry you had to go through that for so long:( but yeah with me loads of people told me how wrong it was and deep down I knew but I was too in love yo care and kept making excuses like it wasn't always like that and I was scared no one would love me the same. Now I've learnt to love myself more.
I feel ya. I live with my support system so they know everything that goes on with me. Hopefully you’ll feel more comfortable reaching out in the future.
Its so hard when youre in the mental health soup of 'something vague is wrong'. Doctors dont like to give you a label but I know for me at least I was screaming 'how do I know whats wrong with me without a label.
Thank you ❤️
Awesome!
No worries!! Hey I needed that pick me up, too! 😉
Yes you can!! My son beat cancer, so can you!! 🌈
Yes! I always thought that too. I might as well stay because nobody else could love me. I found an amazing guy after that who really helped me to learn to love myself.
Oh yeahhh I feel that
Oh good! Two birds one stone^d
That is awesome I have heard so many stories of those who have over come it. It’s truly amazing to see all the ones who have overcome it. I have surgery now in February and I’m hoping that takes care of it and I won’t need treatment.
It's sad how you think you've found the one and just expect a life with them and then it turns out you won't have a life with them and everything becomes confusing😂
I hope so too!!! Wishing you all the best and a speedy healing!
Yes! We had a house together and I had really planned to be with him forever. It was so tough making that decision.
♥️

My guess is 73  u/hungupon as you're the one who commented on my stuff most, you get summoned (sorry for the tag though) your weird question is: How wide is your carpet? Mine is a crisp 193cm, which is a weird size imo cause why isnt it 190 or 200?  Though even if I win, im not back in Denmark until the 30th so any deliveries would be deeply in ??? status

Guessing at 77 items on the weird lists!   u/zx7319 would you rather have a hairy tongue or hairy fingers?.. and no you're not allowed to shave 😂
Haha, what is a finger plaster?! lol!
Hi! I think we'd get a lot of use out of kneeling mats!
Thanks for the tag u/cecyc! There’s no debate here, it would obviously be called Stanley.
Gosh, unusual thing I’ve eaten? Maybe frog legs? I’ve had snails but I feel like that’s not very unusual at all, who doesn’t love escargot! Hehehe my favorite is raw crab though! Not plain raw crab - it’s marinated. That’s my weakness!!!   What about you?
I’ve attempted to eat the eye ball of a tuna :’^)))))))) My tongue has never been the same
I’m going with 27   u/PepperjacksSocks you are my random!
Hello! I’m going to go with The Railway Man 😊
I've licked a salt lamp once hahaha
Thanks for the tag! Love Heinz tomato because I’m basic haha
Aww, thanks for the summon 💛 I catch and release moths when they fly in☺️ nice random question.
Hello there my friend toilet paper always goes over lol
Wait, I can only steal 1? Hahah I think my local zoos only have monkeys and orangutans! Lol jk   I think I’d want a koala! Ironically, when I went to the San Diego Zoo, the penguins made me the happiest of all and I spent the most time there! So I’d love a penguin but wouldn’t be able to maintain it! Don’t know if I’d be able to maintain a koala either!
Thanks for the summon, I have but I don’t remember what it was 😂
Thanks for the tag! I’ve already guessed a number, but the answer to your question is salmon with lemon juice (with salad and French fries if I’m choosing a whole meal)!  Wbu?
haha definitely dye my hair lime green!!
Thanks for the summon! My favorite brand is Colgate. :)
Omg I can’t even think of anything! Um... I ate pig feet, I moved to another country with a guy I knew for less than a year, before the pandemic I would eat alone a lot on layovers... lol not really weird... someone tried to hand me throw up once is that weird? Hahaha
Raid the office supply cupboard and start stapling them to trees
Camping. Not worth it without running water
I think eleventy eight is my new favorite number.
I always took that to be 118!
I would name it Goatee Locks :)   In guessing you have 46 items on your list.   u/DreyHI  If you could have your own theme tune play whenever you entered a building, what would it be?
Oh fingers for toes for sure! I have tiny elf toes and I can't be having those tidgy little things as fingers 🤢. Plus finger toes should make me be able to hold things with four hands(?) So I'd be more productive ... But then I imagine the weird shoes I'd have to buy, they would be mad long and pointy and I'd probably trip on this. My hubby also wonders if skateboarding would be easier or harder. We may have thought about this too long 🤔😂
Hello! Nice to meet you! I'd go with wedgie because that can and does happen to me all the time but seeing someone pick their nose still feels taboo. What about you? Lol
Excellent question, I'm glad you asked. I love Japanese cherry trees. They are beautiful when in full bloom, and always remind me of that scene in Mulan (I love that movie)
The kind that contains marijuana lol
Don't apologize, I love being tagged! :D I have no idea though lolol
Thanks for the summons. I used to work in an antique store and we had a haunted Dental cabinet with a mirror. It must have belonged to a very bad dentist. Several times, myself and other people in the store saw a face in the mirror. We were all very glad when it sold.
Say whaaaat?! Crazy?? Heck no!! More like bold and outgoing!! I wanted to die my hair blue on the inside but the salon person said not to bc it’ll fade very quickly and won’t look good w my dark hair 😓 bummer!!
I think probably politically motivated vandalism
Thanks for the contest and u/charlotte-x92 thanks for the summons!   I recently hosting an organization contest and I discovered most people liked to keep their lists short so I'm going to guess you have 25 weird items on your list.   If I could only take one thing to a deserted island 🏝 I think it would have to be a good hammock! With my hammock I might not completely lose my mind! Lol! If its a solid mat hammock, you can sit/lay on it of course,  it can be used as a cover during the rain, and it can be used as a blanket to cover up with when it's cold, and you could block the sun in extreme heat days. (I would totally have said my family 👪  but that would be cheating, wouldn't it?)  Let's see for my question, if you had to convince someone/anyone/the world that you were an alien 👽 but you mean no harm and you are here to save the world, which is about to blow up, how would you do it? Want to answer it u/doyouwannasnog u/hexbags ?
Haha if you are gonna summon me I'm gonna guess too    98!
Hey girl!! Hows it hanging? Lol.. the plants,how are the plants hanging? 🐭🐛🌷🦸‍♀️
3? Then a bite. Just like the commercial from the 90s. 😂
That is a weird question lmao. Hmmm. Everyone will be mad at me, but its gotta be Jeff Goldblum. Its not because i don’t like him, i just wanna be a dinosaur doctor!!!  Hes so cool I wanna be him so bad.
Little portabella mushrooms for the nightstand and maybe some chairs. And my bed would be block of tofu, seems comfy haha! 😂
There’s SO much weird Amazon stuff to love. 🙌☺️ some people get lost in YouTube... some people roam Amazon. 🤫🤷🏻‍♀️🤣  My favorite salty meal... probably kalua pig with chicken long rice, pipikaula, and a side of poi (helps offset the salty, without losing the taste!) what’s yours?
Hm...tacos!
Off! I actually just took them off to sleep!
On a table at a party while the music was still blasting I guess haha!
I’m making tiny dinos while watching the office (because this is basically my life now) 😁 How you’re having a good nap!
Yes . They are very cute.
I can put 4 fingers in my mouth :D
I don't think there's a weird thing I've ever seen. 🤔
u/doobadedo you rang?
Creature fo sho
Thanks for the summoning, new friend! What are your Sunday's plans?
Thanks for the summons!  I'm gonna pass because DreyHI just gifted me today and I appreciate it so much. I'm gonna summons u/Fourlivess to come play with us and ask her What her favorite beverage is?
Thanks for the tag!
The wall of the ice fishing shack 😂🥶  Fun contest!
Yellow for sure!
My favourite green thing is grass. Nice summer grass
hmmmm... I'm kind of a gross girl so maybe 4 or 5. It's a whole lot more in the morning when I wake up. :D
I really like mint chocolate chip!
Robin Williams!
Wait. What? What's happening?   Guess I'll join the fun!
I like floating toys! :D
Baby Owlbear or a Bronze Dragon!!!!
I honestly don’t know 😅 Way too many to be honest. Thanks for the tag friend!
Oh definitely atleast once a week 💁‍♀️😂
Hairy fingers!
That's why it's a weird question lmao
Perfect! 🦒 🐊
I'm allergic to all of those things.  I dunno, Kangaroo was pretty cool.
ewwww
Yay! I like being a Random :D  Do I get a question? Lol
Ooh I am gonna add that to my list 😁 hehee I am running out of shows to watch 😆
What did it taste like?
Hahaha! I love it!
A penguin would be so awesome to have!! Koalas sound very low-maintenance haha
I think it would steak and chips with mushroom sauce and a bit of salad
Good choice! I’m a Sensodyne girl myself, just cause I’d my sensitive teeth.
Omg that last one had me DYING!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 That is HILARIOUS!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 oh God I’m still laughing!!!! Bwhahahah!!!!  That’s really cool that you did so many things!!! I’ve never had pig feet! Every time I go get dim sum I see it on the list but never in the carts!
u/DreyHI, this is it, it's over, [u/Cooked\_Bread](https://www.reddit.com/u/Cooked_Bread/) wins the contest.
I actually just made up that it’s nineteen. Eleventy eight I don’t think is a real number. At least it never has been when I say it
That is a genius name for a goat how did you come up with that so quickly
That is a fabulous name! 🐐
I'm going to go with the Imperial March
Haha, I totally get it! I think I’d say the same? Maybe? I mean plus if you fix a wedgie discreetly enough, it can just look like your fixing your pants or whatever. Like you said, picking your nose feels weirder somehow. And I feel like someone is more likely to call you out for picking your nose? Like if I see a friend fix a wedgie, I just turn around and act like I didn’t see it or just accept it cuz everyone gets wedgies, and let’s face it, they gotta be fixed, lol. If I see a friend picking a booger (with no tissue) I’d be more inclined to mess with them about it, lol. And I would DEF mess with them if I caught em wipe it, cuz that’s just too funny to not say anything! XD
Ooh that’s a good choice, I like it. Plus that’s a great scene with good life lessons
Yassss ahahaha
I was just listening to a tiktok where a guy has a theory that girls with dyed hair are crazy, I completely disagree! I personally love dyed hair!  thats so sad! I have really dark hair too, dying it doesnt work well
Thanks for the answer!
For the contest I’m guessing 14 weird things !!! Probably one of them being that small wacky inflatable tube elf man hehe  For your question u/fawn_angel ,,, I think I’d wear a cute costume. Maybe some bunny ears and a cute little bunny tail. 🐰 and give everyone little carrots and candy and suddenly say “look!!! im a bunny alien :) “ hopefully not get shot afterwards or taken captive . weird answer but I really don’t know how I’d go about it without being killed lmfaooo  I’ll summon u/huntfishcamp and ask ,, if you could compete in the olympics as an animal ,, what would you choose and why?
I have 2 hanging plants and one isn't growing very well. lol
Awww haha
What a clever mouse!
Oh that all sound delicious! I love a Caesar steak tip salad meal!
Ha ha! I too can fall asleep anywhere if I choose.
So delicious
What’s better than chocolate?
That is correct! I love the Creature so much 💚
I’ve got some studying to do, and then I might got for a walk, we have had some snow where I live so I can’t wait to go out in it! How about you?
Lol aww thanks!  My favorite drink is Tropicana Peach Orchard Punch☺️ and I’m guessing random number of 13🤞🏾
Uhh... where the heck are you?!  *(she clearly just said an ice fishing shack Lottie...)*
Ooh, great choice!
That's good to know! Proper foot hygiene is important! 😂😂
Ohhhh, hahah. I thought it was some item or phrasing I didn’t know about! Lolol! I’ll saaaay, teal! ;)
Oooo kangaroo!!! That’s so crazy!! Where are you located, if you don’t mind me asking! I saw some jerky kangaroo treats for dogs that I really wanted to get for my Big Booty Boy but I was told it can’t be shipped to CA for “ethical reasons”? 🤷🏻‍♀️  What’d it taste like?? I know, so hard to describe right?? LOL
My exact reaction!! 😆
I can’t upvote this enough
Haha yeah sorry I was mid-meeting 😅 I don’t know.. umm.. what colour is the wall behind you painted? 😂 it if you’re outside, what colour is your bedroom wall?
Salt!
Right?! Or like a panda! Hahaha something very chiiiiiill lmao penguins are amazing 🐧🐧🐧
That sounds DELICIOUS
😂😂😂 I looked at the person like uuuuuum, the bathroom is right over there. Nope!
Haha I base it entirely in lord of the rings—in the movie Bilbo is celebrating his “eleventy first birthday!” Which was his 111 birthday.  No clue if that’s standard or not 🤷🏽‍♀️ but regardless it’s fun to say
I quite often ponder these things, in case I’m ever faced with the task of naming animals.
Thank you, it means a lot :)
I bet people think I'm picking my nose all the time but I'm actually playing with my nostril piercing..lol
Whaaaaat?! That guy’s an idiot!! I need to dye my hair! It’s so boring and bland! How about ppl who DONT dye their hair are crazy?! lmao jk jk
Oh wow, I think I would compete as a cheetah. I'd win all the races!  Thank you for the summons!
What kind of plant is it a? Is it getting enough Sun and are you over watering it?
It really is so delicious!!!  Omg! I love Caesar salad!!! Never tried with steak... wow! Why not? 🤔🤦🏻‍♀️ I have Caesar saad in the house, but no steak... fail! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤣
Very delicious
Does chocolate cake count?
Aquaman is too distracted by his vanity to win a fight like this.
😂😂😂  Trying to *not* fall into a river... ^fingers ^crossed
Teal is a nice colour lol I dunno I saw these finger bandages/condom looking things at walmart lol and they were for when you cut your finger and if you are a chef you where them for safety lol I was like well that's my weird question lol
I am in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. We have a heritage festival every year and in 2019 the Aussie table was doing Kangaroo burgers. It's apparently not particularly difficult to get kangaroo here. I wonder what the ethical reasons are?   It kinda tasted like a mix between pork and venison, but it was really tender and juicy like a good lamb. I dunno, it was super tasty.
It’s a matte, slightly darker ecru.  :)
Hahahaha of course! :P
Ohh a panda would be cool too! They really are amazing and oh so cute :-)
Omfg I wanna hear the whole story now please!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Name your new pet elephant, ready go!
Haha, my partner used to have his septum pierced and he would always play with it, and it always looked like that, lol.
What color would you dye it this time??
Its a spider plant not very big it was a transplant. I think i need to fertilize it.
Just yummy
Chocolate cake is amazing so yes 😂
You live a much more exciting life than I!
Hahah that’s so funny! Finger condoms, lol! XD Definitely works!
Yummmm that sounds delicious!!   California first said it was bc the Roos were endangered but once Australia got a handle on that, California then said they wouldn’t support the “massive commercial slaughter of the wonderful creatures” .....as if we don’t slaughter a bunch of creatures here ourselves like freaking cows, pigs, chickens, etc 🙄 but the ban stands 🤷🏻‍♀️
What's ecru?
And oOoO so lazy!! Hahah
Mark Zuckerburg-Phant
Nothing wild, just the same as I always do. Some shade of brown w some highlights 😊
Well they usually go into shock when you replant them and try not to move them around too much those things can grow and be very root bound so keep that in mind
Chocolate cake never fails me.
Much colder only — not a single bite lol
Interesting. I'd feel bad eating an endangered species, but I know that the 4 species we import are overabundant to the point of being a pest and the choice is to either cull them or harvest them. Like we do in Canada with our deer, moose,ect.
The color of the pants of the employees of target lol.
Hahaha I love it
Oohh nicee. I did not know that!
I worked in an embroidery factory when I was 17, it’s something you pickup and store in your brain instead of important stuff like math triangles 😂
Niceee. Hahaa well I never talk about triangles so this is good 😆

What was your favourite book or audiobook toy read this year? It does not have to had come out in 2020,just have read it in 2020. Mine was Star Wars: Ahsoka by E. K. Johnston. It adds a lot to her story that was not show on screen.   Rules:  \-DBAD  \-Have something $19 or less on your WL.   \-Will close on the 20th.   \-Good luck!
I actually really enjoyed the new Twilight book, Midnight Sun! Between my crafts, the kiddo, the home, and my other hobbies it can be hard to find time to read sometimes, and it can be hard to stay focused lol, but that one really kept me into it. I liked it! Lol, bit of a flash back to middle school, but I dig it. XD   Thanks for hosting!
My favorite of the books that I have recently read is *Fortunately, the Milk* by Neil Gaiman. It's not like his usual books. It's a YA chapter book, and it's hysterical. Good, clean humor that appeals to any age. I was laughing from beginning to end. And to think, I picked it up on a whim at a used book store!
I really enjoyed Circe by Madeline Miller, had no idea what it was about when I started it and thought it was great. Immediately read Son of Achilles afterwards.   Thank you!
"I'll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman's Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer" by Michelle McNamara.  Fascinating, compulsive and ultimately devastating book about the author's tenacity and determination to discover the identity of the man terrorizing California, who would later come to be called the Golden State Killer.  Really compelling reading. Highly recommend, but I probably wouldn't read it at night.
Where the Crawdads Sing was my favorite book of 2020. It was so beautifully written and engaging. I read it in two days.
My favourite was Station Eleven. It was very relevant to last year, set in a post apocalyptic world, really immersive and one I’m recommending to everyone!   Thanks for the contest :)
My favorite book of 2020 was The Red Queen by Victoria Aveyard! It made me so excited to read the rest of the series!! Thanks for hosting this contest!!
The Shack
The last rock and roll show.   Or the Martian.  Have listened to both of them many times.   Thanks for the contest.
I read then there were none by Agatha Christie Iast year and absolutely loved it
All the Light We Cannot See is a beautifully written book. I didn’t want it to end but I couldn’t put it down either.   Thanks for the contest!
The Phantom Prince by Elizabeth Kendall was a great book that offered a lot of insight about Ted from the perspective of his long-term girlfriend. It was also so dark to see the pictures they took together and to read about the times in which he let his true self slip. I would say that this book was my favourite one!
Sybil! I couldn’t put it down. I just traded a Mary Higgins Clark book to someone for When Rabbit Howls because it’s about something similar.
The Magic Fish, it’s a graphic novel about a first generation kid, and his mother’s story of immigrating, all based around myths he grew up with.  Absolutely gorgeous artwork and a great story!
I WANTED TO READ THAT BOOK! But the hold line on Libby was too damn long. Ahsoka is the freaking best.  Mine was *The Vegetarian* by Han Kang. I don't like horror except for surrealist horror, and I interpreted the opposition to vegetarianism in the story as a metaphor for the worldwide opposition to feminism and the various ways people view (and take advantage of) female independence.
My favorite book that I read in 2020 was The Princess Curse by Merrie Haskell.  I had read it a few years ago, loved it, but couldn't remember it, so I got to experience it all over again, and I think it's phenomenal.
Ouuu Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman or The Stranger by Stephen King. Both so so good!
The Phantom Prince by Elizabeth Kendall was a great book that offered a lot of insight about Ted Bundy from the perspective of his long-term girlfriend. It was also so eerie to see the pictures they took together and to read about the times in which he let his true self slip
I really enjoyed listening to *Atomic Habits* by James Clear. He had really good ideas for changing life habits in an easy way, and his system makes sense logically. My husband would love that book!   Thank you for the contest! :)
I really like Harleen by Stjepan Šejić. It talks about the backstory of Harley Quinn. The art is also really good. I recommend it, if you're a fan of Harley and the Joker.
My favorite book I read last year was the Guest List by Lucy Foley. It was very well written and had lots of twists and turns. I also really enjoyed the book Educated.
Mine was Priory of the Orange Tree!!
Mine was In Five Years By Rebecca Serle
I could finally finish "Ideas: A History of Thought and Invention, from Fire to Freud"  from Peter Watson.
really enjoyed "demons" by fyodor dostoevsky 💗
I really enjoyed the armchair travel adventures provided by David Sedaris in the Audible version of *Calypso*.  Thanks for hosting a contest.
My favorite book that I read this year was Homestuck! It’s a genre-defying sci-fi comedy adventure story about a boy who plays a game with his friends. Sounds pretty tame, right? NOPE. I promise you, you’ve never read a story like this one.   Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
It’s probably LOTR because it’s a fantasy classic and I’ve been putting it off for so long. The hype is real for it and though the first book is slow, the payoff in the other two is just amazing.
Mine's a bit niche, but I really likes The Actor's Life: A Survival Guide by Jenna Fischer (Pam from The Office). It's all about her experience getting into Hollywood and very practical tips for anyone trying to pursue that. The audiobook read by her was great!
sooo many. A couple books that I really loved were *The City We Became* by NK Jemisin, *The Ruin of Kings* & sequels by Jenn Lyons, and *Anathem* by Neal Stephenson. All fantasy. The first is about New York City personified in 6 different people (one person per borough, plus someone who is the entire city as a whole). *The Ruin of Kings* is about gods and dragons and magic and kidnappings and assassins and reborn souls. *Anathem* is about monks who do not have any contact with the rest of the world for anywhere from 1 to 100 years, and who study philosophy and science and possibly a little bit of magic.
My favorite book that I read in 2020 was Into The Wild. It’s so sad but a good one. I just watched the movie last week!   Thanks for a contest
Thank you for hosting this contest, it's amazing to see all these recommendations! 😁 my favorite was Factfulness by Hans Rosling and his collaborators! It definitely put the world into perspective (at least before 2020 😅)
Untamed by Glennon Doyle. It's a book I will re-read often as it was very life affirming for me.
This is a tough one! I think for myself my favorite book I read in 2020 had to be Bear Necessity by James Gould-Bourn, definitely needed last year and meant a lot to me to read.   One of my favorite books I got for my students last year has to be On Account of the Gum by Adam Rex. It’s a great book that talks about how good intentions can sometimes unravel in ways you don’t expect or plan
Tough call!   I'll say "All the Devils Are Here" by Louise Penny. I love her books, and this one was quite good.
Cruising by Alex Espinoza. I picked it up from a gay bookstore and I've been infatuated with it since I picked it up. I went through nearly half of the book on one plane ride! It's a really intimate look at gay cruising culture and how things have changed.
The best audiobook I listened to in 2020 was "The 7 and 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle." It's such a fun fantastical historical murder mystery. And the narrator did amazing with all the voices he had to do. It was such a treat to listen to.  Thanks for the contest!
Mine was Bone White by Ronald Malfi, a really good horror novel. It was the first book I’ve read of his and I’ve since read three more which have all been good.
I read Everything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng - bit of a rollercoaster, emotionally, but very well written! Thanks for hosting!
The best one I've read so far is the silent patient. I've only read a few because it's been busy for me in 202. But I'm glad I read it it was such a page turner!   Thanks for hosting!
2020 was filled with comfort reads for me; I mostly was reading Oscar Wilde's works. His short stories and children's stories are often light-hearted and easy reads.
Not so pure and simple by Lamar Giles. Great read! Thank you :)
The Tattoist of Auschwitz had to be my most riveting read of 2020! Emotional and compelling story.  Thank you for the contest! <3
The Shadow Land by Elizabeth Kostova really is sticking with me!
I read and loved East by Edith Patou, it's a rewritten version of East of the Sun West of the Moon and it's amazing! It's well written, heart warming, the characters are amazing. 10/10
In 2020, I read Invincible. it's a comic book written by Robert Kirkman of Walking Dead fame. It's about a high school kid who is the son of a famous superhero who develops superpowers of his own.
Ashoka was amazing. Also Rise of Kyoshi and Ready Player Two.
My favorite book that I read last year was called "Leaving Time" by Jodi Picoult. First of all, I never saw the ending coming and that almost never happens to me, so it got props for that. But overall it was just a fantastic book and I loved learning about elephants.
The Guest list! Everyone needs to read it
I loved A River in Darkness: One Man's Escape from North Korea by Masaji Ishikawa. What a unique experience and he escaped in 1996. The Japanese government did not originally want it published when first written in 2000. The background to the book itself is interesting as well.  For fiction, Lilac Girls by Martha Hall Kelly was my favorite book of the year.
Goodness so many! But the audiobook for Circe was amazing
I read the emperor of all maladies....it is so good! It just talks about the human condition and is from a doctors perspective. Very insightful.
I started reading the Paw Enforcement series by Diane Kelly. It was really good! It’s about a K9 officer and the chapters are split between the officers perspective, the dog’s perspective, and the suspect. It’s easy reading. The last one just came out (well, in October) and I have been very impatiently waiting for my library to get it
The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek!!!’ It was amazing. I read it in a day and half!!!
My favorite book was maybe “Flowers in the Attic” by V. C. Andrews.
middlegame by seanan mcguire! i keep recommending it to literally anyone that will listen to me about it lok. the premise and the naming convention may deter a lot of people off of it, but it's a very solid magical realism type of book about found family and there's a lot of layers to it that i just ADORE
I read the girl on the train. Was much better than the film and kept me engaged. I read it in 3 days.
I have read a few good ones! Infinity Son by Adam Silvera is definitely a favourite, and the mortal instruments city of lost souls was great as well!
100% The Henna Artist. I loved it, thrsomtory telling and the description on India.
I’m not sure if it’s been translated into English, but a book by Fredrik Backman (of “A man called Ove” fame) titled something like “Everything my son should know about the world” really touched me last year. It’s such a warm hug to the next generation and I want to absorb all of its love and hope. So yeah that was probably my fave.
*The Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying Vampires* by Grady Hendrix. What a phenomenal book!!
Not sure what year it came out but I really enjoyed Lovecraft Country by Matt Ruff (which was recently made into an HBO series).  It was a total page turner for me!
Mine was The Binding by Bridget Collins. It turned out to be a different story than I'd expected but quite a beautiful one. It had elements of magic, friendship, and love all woven together in a surprising but very touching story. Thanks for the contest!
I'm going with the first Harry Bosch novel, *The Black Echo* by Michael Connelly. Thanks for the contest!
*Uprooted*, by Naomi Novik. A very interesting read and a new take on a retelling of some Polish culture. Given that my father was born in Poland, it was an extremely enjoyable book for me. Thanks for the contest!
*The Violinist of Auschwitz* I will recommend it to anyone and everyone who will listen. It’s heartbreaking and inspiring and I sobbed my way through the end. But it made me want to be braver and stand up for others and I think about Alma a lot when I’m up against a situation that seems unwinnable.
Thanks for hosting!  I read so many great books, and even looking at my highest ranked its still hard to pick just one   I think **Yellow Wife- Sadeqa Johnson** is probably my favorite. It actually came out in 2021 but I got an ARC from NetGalley. It follows a young girl in slavery who was promised freedom on her 18th birthday and how shes just trying to make it until then. It fictionalized a real slave jail in Virginia that I had no idea existed and was just a really eye opening story for me. With a main character you're just hoping can survive. It's a really compelling story and I highly recommend everyone check it out.
I didn't read much in 2020 due to bad mental health, but I did read a book called Love and Peanut Butter! I can barely find anything about it online, but it's basically a year in the life of a mother! She goes from January to December and shares her days with us! It was really a lovely read <3
I didn't read as much as I would have liked in 2020 but Daisy Jones and the Six was a great book about a fake band!
I read a lot and the book the sticks in my mind is The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson, it was informative, shocking and amusing.  I listened as an audiobook and I think that added to pleasure of it
My favorite book was American Psycho. It’s brutal plot is actually somewhat insightful, and a lot of the symbolism can be picked up fairly easily.
I love a good survival book.  And I'm totally fascinated by people living off the land.  Therefore, that would make my favorite book of 2020 The New Wilderness by Diane Cook as it combines both of those elements.
My favorite book that I read in 2020 was Lost Boy: The True Story of Captain Hook by Christina Henry.
I loved Midnight Sun, too!
I read this one years ago and definitely agree, it was very fun
Oh neat! Haven't read this one yet! Will add to my list!
Yeeees! Did you see the miniseries on Netflix afterwards?
That is my top favorite post apocalyptic novel! I couldn't put it down and read it in 2 days. Such a great book!
Such an awesome series! I love it so much!!
Oh my gosh that book is amazing!
That sounds great!
I hope you get to read it eventually. The audiobook is especially good as the actresses reads it!
I’ve heard really good things about that book.
I need to re-read them, it’s been awhile since I’ve read them.
That sounds fantastic!
Oh I really want to read that!
I want to read that one, I have heard so many good things about it.
I definitely want to read A River In Darkness, I’ve always been interested in survivor stories.
That’s quite an interesting book!
I unironically love that book, and the 2014/15 Lifetime Movies adapted from them
YES i loved the audiobook (narrated by Buffy's Amber Benson) but i knew immediately I was missing things by not having the physical book. I plan to reread it this year but physically. it was such a fun read
I want to read that one!
I have that on my list to read, it sounds really good.
Soo good, right?! ;)
Yes! It's so good!
Yes! It's super short. I read it in a few hours. Good for a rainy afternoon!
No but I listened to the podcast Man in the Window or something like that...
It really was a great read! I’d like to read her new book at some point too. Too many books not enough time lol
I was shocked how much I like it because I usually mostly read thrillers and horror but this was amazing!
omg i never looked into the audiobook i never knew who narrated it! that's so cool
Yes!
The Netflix miniseries (by the same name as the book) was phenomenal and capture Michelle's efforts so well - and after the guy was caught, following the trial, etc. Highly recommended!
Yeah! I randomly picked up a book at the library and was so happy with it! I literally could not put it down! And then I preordered the second book once I found out that it wasn’t released yet, and preordered each one as they became available! It was a whole lot of waiting lol but it was well worth it! 💜
I’ll check it out. Thanks!

Audrey II! I love the picture. Real skull?
She is awesome! But whatever you do, don't feed the plants!
I love this
Best thanks of the day!
FEED ME, SEYMOUR!!!
...she already ate a cow! Thanks /u/malevitch_square for my first Funko Pop. She’ll take her place in my office where she’ll be assigned to eat all my errors and typos. She’ll be well fed.
Yes. Inherited from a friend who died. I'm deciding where to hang it.
haha!
Thanks. It was an impulse but it amused me.
Cracks me up!
I LOVE the pic!!
Thanks! She was so hungry i had to feed her right away.
Thanks! And I love her!
Hahaha I'm sure it was a tasty meal

u/Mrsjanssen this was such a sweet surprise when Amazon showed up at my door! Thank you very much for the book - seriously one of the best creepy comics out there. You are so kind!
Ooo what's this comic about?
ahhhh love this! i have the first and second issue of that comic. i’m treating them like gold.
You’re welcome! Thank you for being so friendly and welcoming to me!! This looks like a really cool series, and that would be awesome if they turned it into a show.
It's a horror comic kinda like the Twilight Zone. Each issue is a self-contained story, and all of them feature the titular Ice Cream Man as the antagonist in some way. Extremely creative and a bit unsettling, but I love the issues that are homages to other comics and books.
Whaaaa that's so awesome!! I didn't expect any other people to really know it, but it's such a good series. I've been working through the volumes and am just about done with vol 2. There's even rumors of a TV show coming based on the comic, so you definitely gotta hold onto those issues!
I hope so too. Fingers crossed 🤞
you’re definitely ahead of me! but i’m crossing my fingers for a show! i love the twilight zone appeal of having different stories.

One of my fondest memories will be when she won the Xbox giveaway!! That was so exciting and I was so ecstatic for her!!! I was texting friends asking for help on my guesses and really into the contest (love to guess although I am bad at it) and I saw the contest get closed so soon at the beginning of the round so I commented on her guess asking if she had won and SHE DID! Top 5 moment for sure 🧡💦
The excitement that Redditor xxoo caused in the group with members in tears of gratitude for she made so many people happy. The happiness was just overwhelming in the group.  The fun part was guessing who was going to be next.  I summon /u/rosiecakeness /u/bratmomjad and /u/external-nobody8500
Thanks for the contest! I don't know if I have a favorite memory since I just joined 2 months ago, but I have really enjoyed meeting everyone and chatting :D   I shall tag u/lilhoneybee4, u/orcprincess32, and u/hauntedcoffeecup!

My favorite memory is meeting my new best friend who has been such a joy and blessing to me. She’s been wonderful to know and her kindness and unconditional love for all is what makes my new bestie u/noimnotsally the greatest ever!
I don’t have a particular favorite memory but I’m forever grateful that I met u/vexedkitten94 and I love, love, love u/johnwoods1023 and his amazing threads.
I have made many friends here who I consider extended family, and one of my favorite memories was receiving my first gift .  I was so blown away that a stranger wanted to send me a surprise, and I'm not exaggerating to say this sub has restored my faith

My favorite memory is probably when I went to the Nashville meetup a few years ago.  It was so nice getting to meet people I knew from here.  So much fun.  u/late_to_join_reddit and u/psychologicalpenguin Thanks for the tags!  I'm also going to tag u/overlyapologeticguy because I got to meet him in Nashville! <3
Congrats on your first contest!  This community is great. I enjoy interacting with nice people. There's hope for humanity, knowing there's still nice people out there.  u/TheGreatTyrant
When i got covid, i disappeared for awhile and i couldn’t believe that there were people in this community that noticed. They reached out and even sent me some items to help me through my healing. Thats way more than what my family did. i’ll never forget them and their kindness. 😭🙏💜💜💜  u/haileyh38 u/aviatrixvixen u/josephineismyhero
One of my favorite things about this sub is u/Morthy and u/downtheriverwego's bathtime contests. It's so wholesome! I never seem to catch them in time to participate in the contest, but one day I'll figure out how to keep them trapped in their respective bathtubs until I log into Reddit.  u/archer_campbell, random wishlist chose you. Join the contest! How you doing?
A fav memory from this group.. hm.. Well, when xxoo/ xoxoxo first joined, but didn’t tell anyone, and was going around stealth gifting so many people, myself included! Just seeing all the people posting thanks post to the mystery Redditor, and also getting so many goodies myself, the whole thing is an awesome memory! I loved scrolling through the feed and seeing the new posts every day of people who were so surprised! (And I was so surprised too! Was crazy and amazing and overwhelming and epic!) Also, just in general, so may people who have tagged me in things and have been so sweet and made me smile, there’s a lot like that!   Love you all! Thanks for hosting gdarn!  u/tmrajgray u/so_appalled_ u/SuperGee94 Hey there friends! Don’t forget that you are awesome!! :)

Congrats on hosting your first contest! It’s lovely reading everyone’s responses. This is such a wonderful group. ❤️  I want to tag a few people! First, u/daisiesandink! I think she was the first person I really talked to in this group. She’s helped me a lot with her support, help and recommendations. I also want to tag u/Serine23. Her contests are so fun and interactive, they really bring all of us together! You are such a lovely person! And I also want to tag u/sassylittlespoon because she is just a wonderful and kind person all around. I’m so happy I’ve met you all, meeting so many amazing people in this group are the best memories! 🥺💕
My favorite memory is playing Evil Apples with the gang and reading u/Grindelwalds_Bitch Pokemon fanfic 👀
Meeting all my lovely friends are truly amazing
Oh, man. I have so many good memories! I've met some amazing people, had some fun conversations, and participated in AMAZING contests and activities. This really is an amazing place with such beautiful, generous people 💖  Can I tell you three notable moments for me?   1. Back in March, when I first joined, u/terrabranfordstrife adopted my clueless self and made me feel accepted and welcome. After I retreated from all social interaction during my quarantine depression, it was the memory of their kindness and welcoming nature that brought me back.  2. Meeting and becoming friends with my water bro, u/Lucy_Leigh225, is another AMAZING memory. She had supported me through some tough times and I've had the privilege to be her cheerleader (with tips about heels and makeup) as she journeys through the practice of law. People like her are rare, and I'm very thankful to have her in my life.  3. Something pretty cool happened to me on here, and I decided to give back by hosting a Dreams Come True contest, where I asked people about the one dream item on their list they would like to have. There were so many good dreams, and I was sad that I couldn't fulfill them all. Then, I got a message from u/omgitsmoki asking if they could join in and help me fulfill another dream. Their enthusiasm and generosity was another reminder of how amazing the people here are 💜
Congratulations on your first contest! Thanks for hosting!  I have a few favorite memories. When u/supermarvelous310 did her intro and we hit it off talking about Damon Bradley. When u/josephineismyhero and I came across each other in various contests and how eerie it was that we had so much in common. When I met u/LostBabyBear here and we started messaging each other. So many great friends here! And who can forget when xoxoxo gifted a million people over the summer.
My fave memory from the group was my receiving lip gloss from u/Tiger5913, cuz ya never forget your first time ;)  also sharing the love with u/Butterflycm and u/Chosengirl
Sorry but what is DBAD? I've seen it in a couple of posts already. I'm kinda new here :)
I haven’t been on this sub long, but one of my favorites was one of my first longer convos I had with someone on here. u/ughhhfine and I talked about a book back and forth, and then they were even awesome enough to send me a copy! Totally unexpected and it made my day when I opened up the package 🥰  Welcome to the sub, and I hope you have your own awesome moment to share soon too!
Hi! I still need to post an intro, but I've been posting and lurking in this subreddit since early December. The thoughtfulness & generosity of the people here is inspiring, to say the least. I've really enjoyed watching all of the gifting and receiving. I was even fortunate enough to receive a few little surprises from my wishlist, courtesy of u/lilhoneybee4. Because of that, I definitely consider her a friend. I don't have many of those here yet, but I'm trying. Anyway, I'm gonna go post that into now before I forget again. ;)
I love the gifts, I love the gifting. I like the support shown to one another and the pleases and thank yous charm me. But I confess two things really made my day here.  First, scanning through gifted tags and wishlists and seeing the variety of things people are interested is so much fun. Second, I love how a $2 gift can cheer someone’s day. It made me realize I could do this with people I know and love. Why wait for birthdays and holidays?  PS one of my favorite delightful and unexpected moments was the recent NSFW thank you post for the personal vibrating device. The response was so authentic and the comments so positive. I’m happy attitudes have changed.  [/u/Butterflycm](https://www.reddit.com/u/Butterflycm/) what about you?  [/u/Andalitegirl](https://www.reddit.com/u/Andalitegirl/) your fave?
I remember finally being able to write my intro and getting excited every time I got a notification someone had commented on my comment. It was such a positive experience.
I love that we’re all diverse and that someone always seems to pickup on when we need a gift! It makes me heart really warm. I’ve been in and out of this sub just because of life but when I get really into it I pretty much squeal with joy when I get gifted and I try to help others have that same experience. I’ve always really loved giving random gifts and I recently sent a gift to my friend for starting a new job because I feel like we really only gift people when it’s something big but little things along the way matter too. Gifts make a difference if that’s part of your love language and it’s definitely part of mine! Thanks did the contest :) and I’m excited that it’s your first one! Watch out!! It’s fun!
I’ve had some great interactions with people here, like u/josephineismyhero u/orcprincress32 and u/psychologicalpenguin and so many others.   Plus there’s always someone to discuss horror movies with or books or regular movies and I love all of it!
HELLO EVERYONE! Unfortunately I don’t have any friends on Reddit (yet!) but I have found it to be quite a supportive community. Especially with subjects I’m sure we can all agree are difficult to talk about to others irl. Anyway, hope everyone is having a wonderful weekend and good luck! ✌🏻  Edit: I made two new friends here today! u/Kboutiette   u/Hsks23
Everyday in this group is me favorite memory. I'm slowly making friends. I'll tag u/horrorlover29 for fun.
My favorite memory is finding out this existed. I joined reddit to make friends. Also to look up music and festival stuff. Then stumbled across this wonderful group. I love how easy it is to spread kindness here.   u/sleepy_pickle I have no friends. How's your day going?
My favorite memory is every single time I make a connection with someone. It might be as small as a favorite food, song, movie or a bigger dream or philosophical thought and just knowing that we are all so very different in age, careers, family lives, and even where we live but can stillmake a connection, I absolutely love it.
My favorite memories are just meeting wonderful people here. It's been a blast!  the best thing I've done this past year was join RAOA. 💕  u/Mimooshka u/gimmiesugar u/OhWinterAvenue u/Noimnotsally u/megaxxworldxx u/coffeelover39
First contest??? Woo-hoo!! You go with your bad self!!
u/3pmactivities summoning you for a new contest :D
Yay for your first contest! Wahoo!   My favorite memory from this group is participating in the fun and unique contest! I really love the art contests, they push me to create new things. I have so much fun here everyday!   u/sleepy_pickle what is your favorite RAOA memory?
I haven’t been here for long but my favorite memory was when I posted my intro  and i got way more replies than I expected! And so many upvotes :o
My favourite memory of this group was early 2018, the day i got my job offer and i celebrated with everyone on this sub by hosting a "spam my inbox" contest where the number of comments equals the amount (in pennies, so it ended up being about 4000 comments so $40.00) i spend on the prize! It was a fun way to celebrate what ended up being the biggest and most impactful life change in my life, and give back to a community that was there for me when I was down on my luck
Not entering - entered in a few already this week - but just wanted to say good luck to all who enter and thank you OP for doing a contest!

You’re too sweet to me ❤️💕😭
🥰
Awww well let’s keep it going and continue to shower you w love!!!
Aw, I love this! I’m so glad you got some love, you are wonderful and deserve all the love! So happy to help bring a little smile to your face! :)
aww you deserve it sweet cheeks! 🥰
I love being your top 3!
All my love water bro 💙💦 I didn't tag Xoxo because they have asked not to be tagged in contests, but they have also made my experience here amazing.
That's super sweet. I love the connections you've made!
Absolutely! I'm so glad I make your list! I'm very thankful we met and hit it off on here! Our war is so much fun! I can't wait until my next attack! I mean... gift! 😊🍌💚💚💚
That was so cool to see!
I loved that amazing person!   Thank you for the summons friend. ❤️
Only 2 months ago? Wow, it feels like you've been here long - in a good way.
Echoing the “only two months?!” Sentiment!
Thank you. 😊💚
I love chatting w you guys, too!!! u/gdarn16 you’re just so fabulous!!!!
You’re the best!!
another favorite memory was just a couple days ago-- the Simon Says challenge from just a couple days ago hosted by u/gimmiesugar :)
So addictive!
💜💜💜
Aw thank you for the tag! ❤️
Thank you for the tag!! I have so many! But dare I say it’s u/orcprincess32 starting the banana war??
We should change his name to something like Mysterio with all his gifts.
Thank you johnwoods!!! Hey, did I ever tell you I’m so grateful to have met ya? You’re fantastic! 🤗
also u/Forsaken-Usual-7510 u/huntfishcamp u/hexbags come join :)
Thanks! 💚
You’re too kind to me John!!
I understand. ☺️ time is all a blur for me right now... sorry i haven’t been around as much... what happened two days ago
Agreed! I love finding out people live near me. Sometimes it does feel like such a small world. 🌎☺️
Awww thanks!  You’re the sweetest!
Sooooo many cookies! 🍪
This made my day! I adore you. ❤️
;_; you are absolutely too sweet making me feel all flustered. Thank you so much. I am really glad I met you and that you exist. I love it whenever you comment on my threads.
I’m so glad I met you too! You’re so sweet. 💕😊
Thanks for the tag!!
Awww thank you for the summon!
Thank you but I'm Canadian but appreciate you reaching out
😊💚💚
Shut up!! There’s a meet up?! Aaahhh!! How cool!!!
No way! People me up!? Fun!
Hi friend ❤️😊
We love you!
That is awesome! I'm continually surprised by how thoughtful everyone seems to be here. I hope you're feeling better!
xxoo
Girl of course we noticed! Simba love forever! 🦁♥️
Haha I have the same exact problem with those contests, never on at the right time!
Thanks for summoning me but I missed it till now! fingers crossed for next time
As are you!!! You’re so special!
❤❤❤ you too
I love that memory too. That was so exciting.
I miss you!! 💛💛💛
I miss you! Hope all is well.
❤️🥰
Thank you so much! I'm glad everyone is having fun and I love bringing people together!
💛
u/mamamusprime u/Torisuta u/Fartou love you all 💙
u/BigMommaLZ u/malevitch_square u/neongreenpurple 😘🖤
The fanfic 😭😭😭
Also meeting u/Zeunicorn 😍
Okay, I'm adding more 🤣  u/hungupon's light, love, and encouragement means the world to me. I look forward to and treasure our morning conversations.  u/overthinkee1234 introduced me to Bridgerton, and we've had the most lovely conversations about the books. I'm almost done with The Sword and it's just as amazing as you said it would be.   u/Johnwoods1023 wrote me a song and then sang it for me! It was amazing and I loved it so much
u/josephineismyhero and u/orcprincess32 are absolutely beautiful ❤️ When I became friends with Lucy_Leigh y'all just said "the more the merrier" and welcomed me in. I can't stress to you both how much that does not happen for me irl. You both have made this place so special for me.  u/SaltRogue, my witchy friend. I would but be where I am on my journey if not for you. I think that you're absolutely amazing ✨
Awwww, water bro, you’re making me tear up!! 💦🧡
Good times!
Thanks for sharing the love! I’m from Canada so not entering myself. But I will share that my favourite member is the same as yours! I remember the shock of seeing my name and the excitement of waiting for my first gift! :)
I'm so happy to be your favorite memory! <3
annnndd  u/bunnybridget , u/doubleblondebraids and u/tinawebmom :)
I am also from Canada so can't enter but thank you for tagging me. My favorite memory is actually having the opportunity to have a chat with you u/loulou927
The first gift is really special!
haha! It's true.  Too bad we only get one firsttime.
It stands for “don’t be a d^ck” it’s pretty much just being kind to one another which i know this community does so well but it’s just a commonality on posts! :)
What book was it?
Aww thanks, this totally made my day ✨ you’re so sweet and a fantastic addition to this group 💕
❤️❤️❤️  You are wonderful!
this is such an incredibly wholesome comment. I love where you’re coming from with all of this.
What have you found in Amazon that's in the $2 range?
I still get that feeling and I’ve been here a little while (though I’m not OG by any means)
Aww thanks, you're awesome :-)
It's the book fairy! You are the best
You and me? We're friends now, deal with it!!
I’d love to be your friend too ♥️
Hi!
Pish! You have friends! I'll be your friend! ☺ My day has been pretty good. I was very productive the first half running errands and working out. And then 4pm rolled around and I turned into a couch slug. How's your day going??
We connected because we're both good looking 😎
Yes! I love it! I’ve gifted a few times but I haven’t had a contest yet! I have a lot of awesome things to read through!
Love the enthusiasm here haha 😂
Ah thank you. This got me so excited. I will interact with others but I’m not US based.  I’m so pleased I got asked though it’s really made me smile.
Thanks for the tag!
Love you so much! 💛💛💛
You are amazing!! 💛💛💛
💜💜💜 You are such a sweetheart!
Awwww thank you! I love you so much too! ❤️💕
Evil Apples! It’s a game like cards against humanity or apples to apples. We all played on the EA app 😊
Awwww thanks for summoning me 😊💜
you're too sweet! 💗💗💗
[deleted]
I love the gifts, I love the gifting. I like the support shown to one another and the pleases and thank yous charm me. But I confess two things really made my day here.   First, scanning through gifted tags and wishlists and seeing the variety of things people are interested is so much fun. Second, I love how a $2 gift can cheer someone’s day. It made me realize I could do this with people I know and love. Why wait for birthdays and holidays?   PS one of my favorite delightful and  unexpected moments was the recent NSFW thank you post for the personal vibrating device. The response was so authentic and the comments so positive.  I’m happy attitudes have changed.  /u/Butterflycm  what about you?   /u/Andalitegirl  your fave?
Thanks for summoning me!
I love you too!
I love you most!
You deserve the best!!
Thanks for being so good to me
Thank you for being part of giving me all the love!!
☺️☺️☺️ thank youuu
Always 🥰
I have also refrained from tagging her but she really is such a bright light here. Every time someone gets gifted by her, I feel an immense sense of awe and gratefulness 🧡 (also jealous lmao)
Wasn’t it though and then watching group members trying to figure out who she was.
Yw
Right?! I couldn't really believe it myself!
It feels like I belong here!
XOXOXO
It's one of my favorite memories too! 😊💚💚
Mysterio! LMAOOOOO I love it. My fraudulent abilities match his.
Awwww I'm grateful we met as well! You're awesome and always there for others :)
Thank you for the summons 💖
Thank you for the summon ☺️
I just got a lotta love from y’all.
🥰
Aww 🥰
Typical me , missing the rules!😳
They happened periodically before covid.  Basically someone sets up plans in their area and invites people to come.  Usually there are multiple posts gauging interest and stuff.  I had a ton of fun at the one I went to.
Yeah, I had so much fun.
Hi 👋 👋 😀
❤️❤️😊
😊❤️❤️
Yes! It really was!
💛💛💛
Life is just crazy and I haven’t had time to really engage with reddit
🤣🤣🤣 and love you too!
Love you too! 🖤🖤🖤
Love youuuuuu! 🖤🖤🖤
You are fabulous 💛💛💛
💚💜💚💜
Yeah that felt like an afterthought wife 👀 Very sus 👀
♥️♥️♥️
Aww thank you for tagging me!! 🥰 I feel so blessed to have met you on here and hope to continue to get to know you better and better!
Thank you so much for your kind words!!! I love this comment
You are the bees knees!
Aww, thank you so much! I'm glad you are here and that we are becoming friends! I'm terrible at making and especially keeping friends in real life. This sub has been a real gift for me. 😊💚💚
So making girl friends is hard for me irl because one of the side effects of my autism is that I have a hard time reading nonverbal cues. You don't know how much your friendship has meant to me and has given me the courage to teach out and befriend others. You deserve all the good things 💖💖💖
Oh crap I'm sorry! :)
Thanks for the tag!  My favorite memory is reading story’s of joy and making some new friends. u/TheGreatTyrant and u/cakes-coffee-crochet
Favorite memory????? Ummmm just spending time laughing with y'all!
Thank you for the tag love! 🥰  My favorite memory of this group are all of the Evil Apples games I've gotten to both win and lose and the wild out of control chats that make this group as great as it is :3
Oh I see! Thanks!
[This one!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1632361973/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glc_fabc_a14aGbMFTF1KZ)
Thank you! 🥰 The idea of this sub drew me in but it’s awesome people like you that make me stay! So thank you too!
You are! (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤
There’s literally so many amazing people on this sub, I’m so glad I stumbled onto it!
Aww thank you! 😭🤗
Yes! Definitely! I’d love that as well. 🤗
Did you ever get that coffin shelf set up? I really want to see how it looks
My day is good. Did some dishes. Packed a little for my trip. Sent out a few job applications. Productive day I feel.
🤩
It's so easy. You can literally pick any random idea that comes to you and make a contest of it.
Contests are great! Have you entered my birthday party one today? Late to reddit is insane and I love her! 💕
Love your glasses!!
Aww I forgot about that 😂 I’m glad you smilin though
Of course!
Love you and your clever EA responses!!
💛💛💛
I'm not hip or cool. LOL I've heard of those games but know nothing about them. Is there an online version of Scattergories for older people like me? :-)
😭😭😭 omg that’s the sweetest friggin story EVER!
This is AWESOME!! But make sure you post this under the original post or u/gdarn16 won’t see it!! This is posted as a reply to me and I wanna make sure you’re entered! ❤️❤️❤️
I am in Canada so can't enter but for me this group has added so much joy to my life. Seeing the generosity and the genuine gratefulness from everybody just warms my heart.
Oh my gosh, I don't even know if I can pick a favorite memory on here! I totally agree on how much cheer this sub brings so many people. The support and love on here is amazing. It never ceases to bring a smile on my face, even during difficult times.
Yayyyy! 🤗🤗🤗
Not possible!!!
❤️❤️❤️ you do more!!
We’re all good to each other 😊
Truly feels like you’ve been around forever!
I only reflect what others give to me so really everyone is awesome and always there for me lol
No problemo! <3
As you deserve! 🥰
Lol it's OK
Oh man!! I hope it can happen again post-Covid!!
I totally get that.
take care of yourself mamita. we’ll always be here whenever you come around! :)))
Uhm excuse you, are you projecting?!?! You're never an afterthought and it hurts that you'd accuse me of such a terrible thing 😢😢😢😢😢   Dramatized overreacting aside, you know I love you forever so shh 😘
❤️❤️❤️
It's a mutual blessing 🥰 I hope so as well 💖
You are such a ray of sunshine!!! Thank you for being you
Same 💛💛💛
I’m SO GLAD to hear that!! Lucky for you my BFF says I have the most expressive face that has ever existed. I’m always here for you, water bro 🧡❤️
That’s ok! I still had fun reliving the memory ☺️
Of course!!
If you need anything else let me know!!
Cat-related book? I’m interested.
😭🥰
❤️❤️
Feel free to message me if you ever want to chat or have any questions about RAOA!
[I did! ](https://imgur.com/a/IyKWPT5)
My phone doesn't know what that emoji is :-(
I didn’t enter but I did want to make sure to wish you happy birthday there and here as well now!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! And isnt she the greatest!!
I forgot I had a pfp on here and was spooked for a second there 😂 But thank you!!
Hey now, I love Scattergories!! I would love to play. I’ll have to see if they have something 😊
Yes ma’am!!!
☺️☺️☺️ thank you 🙏🏽
Me tooo!
Uh-huh suuuuuure 👀
💙💙💙
Cat related horror book!
Thank you. That means a lot to me. I’m pretty lonely in my day to day life some having some sort of human interaction is nice. :)
OMG, I love it and your style!!!
That's weird, it's "star-struck" may express that someone is amazing, fascinating, impressive, or exciting. I'm using a "knock off" branded phone maybe that's why 😂
Yep!! I'm glad I'm in this subreddit y'all are just wonderful!!
Pfp???????
Let me know, please.  🤞
☺️💜🙏
Right?! Omg I’d love to meet so many of you guys!! We should do a zoom chat one of these days!!
You have to believe me or I'll cry 😭
Two interests of mine!
I get that! I love RAOA because I’m a stay at home mom with limited interaction too.
Thankyou. I call it my creepy corner lol. I need to find stuff to put in the bottom of the shelf. But it’s mostly full.
I have an outdated phone, so it could be that I just don't get all the new cooler emojis haha
Profile picture haha
I sure will! 💛💛💛
How are you?? It’s been days since we chatted properly
Ooh, nice!
........ 👀
It’s also a manga.. so maybe 3?!
I'm sure you'll find something soon to fill that last spot. Things never stay empty in my house for long...I might have a shopping problem lol
Oh for the love of!
I am tired, in need of snacks, and absolutely swamped with stuff. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤣🤣🤣 but you know, doing okay. 😉🤣  How’ve you been?
Bby pls
I have stuff in storage. I just don’t wanna go there 😂😂😂
I’ll freeze time so you can snack and nap
Pet names will get you nowhere 👀
We live with family now and I have a while house in storage. We kinda just keep paying the bill and ignore what needs to be done. Clean it out and sell/donate everything. I don't want to go there
Nice! I’m ready! Thanks! 😉🤣☺️💜🙏
I'll give up seafood to prove how much I love you
We are renting a room from my boyfriend’s friend’s mom right now due to losing our jobs in March so we have everything in storage too lol. I know them feels.
Lol. I tried.
OMG you really love me!!! 😱😱😱
Appreciate it 😘🤣
Exactly 😍
How are ya??
Love you too 🥺
Okay. The weather is wet and windy, fluctuating between cold and humid. 🤦🏻‍♀️ got work to do as usual. Just another manic monday. 😉🤷🏻‍♀️ wish it were sunday... 🎶🤣  How are you today?
It was 60° earlier. I enjoyed some time outside. And a nice nap. I got no complaints for today. Now I’m watching forgetting Sarah Marshall
Sounds pretty nice!!! 👍☺️🎉💜 never seen that movie, actually. Heard of it though. 😉
It’s set in Hawaii! It has Jason segal and Russell brand and Kirsten bell and Mika kunis. It’s kinda long. Now Get Him to the Greek is on. I like Russell brand. We share a birthday.
Oh! Maybe i do need to watch that then 😉 i have seen Get Him to the Greek. 👍 really!?! I know three other people with your birthday!!! 😲🥳

So far I love it!!

Pretty simple activity, just leave a comment on whether you want music or a video.  As you do so, describe your current mood and what you'd potentially like to see. For instance, "feeling down, wanna see my faith in humanity restored".  You are safe, you are loved, and you are wise.
feeling a bit.. flustered and nervous eeep! 🌸 would love a song if that is okay! ✧
feeling happy, watching one of my fave TV shows Psych, wanna see anything that makes you smile. Video would be great.   Thank you!!!
I'm feeling... rather perspicacious this evening and want to be surprised
I'm in the mood for music, John. What's something you've got that a free spirit might listen to?
I need some lofi past midnight chill music if you have any!
Music Feeling overworked and tired, need motivation to keep working or take a break for now
Music please. Feeling down, would like to hear something motivational
Is there a funny video with dinosaurs?
I’m feeling kinda crummy (stomachache) but overall in a positive mood. I’d like a song please!
I feel downed, would like to start all over at day 1. With everything.
I like cats. I love music.
Video. feeling down, would love to see funny or cute
Feeling insecure, would like to heal from my trauma
[Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ffmtnuSGM) hope this helps :)
Ahhhhh, you hear about Pluto? That's messed up. I love Psych! One of my all time favourite shows haha.   [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11xs9mFKObs)
Here you go my perspicacious friend!   [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmEERvqq70) You asked for surprise... well you're going to get it
This is not everyone's cup of tea but it certainly represents the feeling of being a free spirit.

C'mon son!! That vid is so freaking cute thank you! Also, "Lassie, the more I know you the more I am convinced you are The Penguin" 😂🐧
Not only did that genuinely surprise me, but I absolutely loved it! Thank you my friend 💖
Joke's on you, because I love speaking-in-tongues/fake language songs. I blame ERA.
All 3 are good! #2 hit me just right.  Thanks!
Thank you for the recommendation! I'm excited to listen to it!
lol so was this a tv show? That baby is a shady bitch XP
Super wholesome, thank you
Thank you!! That was a beautiful song
No problem! <3
“Just because you put syrup on something doesn’t make it a pancake". Lassie is still The Penguin
LOOOL! No problemo! I thought you might enjoy it :) glad to see that my intuition wasn't off. You're very welcome <3
Oh wow! 😂 I hope you liked that then!
Awesome! Glad to hear that :)
Awesome! Let me know what you think of it
No problem :) I'm here for ya if you need me
Are you busy...on Saturday?
You - you want me to come with you to awkward class?
If I wanted to make guesses I'd go on a game show.

Oooh I bet this would be great on popcorn
u/soxgal enjoy! hope it's awesome!
Yum!!
heck yes!!
I was also thinking on Corn on the Cob. too weird? sounds yummy in my head.
That's exactly what we use it for and it's amazing.
Oooh, thank you! This is one of our favorite popcorn toppings.
Oh, that would be tasty! Or even as a fry seasoning?
Yaasss! u/OhWinterAvenue and I have about 10 other ideas about how to use this seasoning, too hahah 😂🙃
Oh yes, yes definitely!
Haha, yes. Welcome to our Frank's Seasoning Cookbook 😂
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kyuzi1/discussion_do_you_get_any_subscription_boxes_if/

I used to get one called Stickii. It's a sticker pack you get every month. I totally adored it, the stickers were great! However, it was 10 dollar USD, and with the falling loonie, I just couldn't justify it anymore. Still miss those lovely stickers, getting them in the mail every month was so much fun!
I only get makeup subscription boxes, Boxycharm and Ipsy. I have WAY too much makeup now, most of it is brand new and unopened. I’ve seen a few people do makeup giveaways on here so I might do the same soon. I like both boxes, but one would probably be more than enough. 😅  I like Boxycharm because it’s full size products and always worth the money. But I also like Ipsy Glam Bag Plus because it lets me pick 3 of the 5 products I get each month, which I appreciate.
Ipsy but I've been such a loyal customer for so long. It would take something big for me to change. I also had Loot crate for a little while but Eh.
I used to get ipsy and knotty knickers. I actually loved both but I feel like I have so much makeup and underwear now 😅 I'll probably start my subscriptions up again though sometime.
I loved  Book of the Month when I was subscribed to it, but sadly I haven't had much time to read since my son was born. It looks like im getting more time now that he's over a year old though!
Birchbox, though I put my subscription on hold for a bit. It's pretty cheap, just $10 a month, and it gives you lots of hygeine samples; shampoo, face wash, soap bars, etc. I've been saving the boxes, too, and gluing them together to try to make a not terrible background for videos and photos.
I do boxes off and on.  One of the ones we have loved the most as a family is called Matter.  It has 4 or 5 cool science-y things each month with a neat description card for each thing.  I literally took all the items from a 3 month subscription and curated them in a showcase I had back from my art show days.  There are even things like dinosaur bone fragments!
I currently am subscribed to the Relax and Radiate Crate, Fab Fit Fun, BOTM and EarFleek. I have tried Cause Box, Singleswag, Coloring and Classics, IPSY and Therabox. I also did Bark box for awhile but my dog doesn't play with many toys anymore.
Bark box off and on. My pups are very chewy and they only get toys with supervision, but they love getting a new one.   I also did blue apron for a while to challenge myself to cook new things.
I have FabFitFun, it’s very hit or miss honestly. I also have stitch fix. I have the style pass so it’s $50/year and I can get as many fixes as I want without the style fee, plus the $50 is still a credit. It’s very worth it.
I get both Fab Fit Fun and Ipsy.   I love Ipsy. I have never been a huge makeup person but it is nice to get small samples so that I can learn more about makeup in general as well as try different brands and see what works for me.   Fab fit fun can be hit or miss but I like that it is more of a lifestyle box. I signed up for a year through a promotion and I am not sure if I will continue once it is done, purely for cost alone. As a Canadian the price is a lot higher once currency is converted plus we pay more in shipping.
I currently get ipsy and boxycharm... but I pretty much tried them all!  I also get Hello Fresh if that counts and I've tried every meal subscription service ever-- AMA!
I get Hello Fresh. Honestly life/time saver. Husband and I both hate cooking, but don't want to eat garbage. Hello Fresh is pre-measured for everything saving time, and the meals are soooooo good. We signed up thinking we would just use the promo, and have been hooked ever since!
I forgot those were a thing! Never had one but they sound very fun 😊
I love getting things in the mail but I just can't commit to any one subscription box! I know for sure there will be something in the box I don't like or won't use. I've almost bought the promotional fab fit fun box but they make you enter your credit card info before you can even select your items which was a total turn off so I didn't do it. I also almost bought the winter cause box this year for the cool tea kettle but a lot of reviewers said it was out of stock so I skipped that too. I just can't justify spending money on things that just end up as clutter and not even getting the key item I want. Love the concept, just need the right items and the right price. Definitely not giving up and still open to exploring options!
I used to get ipsy and this one snack subscription. The ipsy came with really nice makeup, and I really like trying the new snacks, I was considering getting an anime box subscription but I am not sure what would come in it so it makes me nervous to try
We just started a barkbox subscription (the super chewer box).  Our dogs can both eat the "chewproof" black Kongs in less than an hour and it's expensive trying to replace their toys constantly.  At least Barkbox will guarantee and replace the toys they send us.
I got boxycharm, FabFitFun, sock club, universal yums, and book of the month! I like boxycharm but I have enough makeup so I might be cancelling. I love fab fit fun and I like that it is quarterly! The sock club is so fun I love fun socks and book of the month is amazing I could talk about them for hours! Universal yums is delicious!
I used to get Ipsy, Boxycharm, Sephora boxes. Sephora was my favorite! I also got Loot Crate a few times.  I had to stop for budget reasons but I love little Christmas’s every month!
I've thought of the stationery ones at Paper Kitty or some of the literary/book ones, but have never done it.
Ipsy, glam bag plus. I love it. I love it so much. Maybe too much. I have so much high end makeup and skincare products now. My skin looks amazing. You can check out my profile and see the posts I make for r/ipsy.  Once Upon a Book Club. I'm not signed up for monthly boxes but like to order their special holiday boxes. I've gotten 4 boxes from them so far. It's fun to open little gifts as you read the books.  Causebox. Love it!! It's quarterly for $50/quarter. I am an annual member so I get to pick out my choices so I'm getting a box I will use all the products.  FabFitFun. I've only gotten one box from them back in Dec and I was happy with it. I got the most luxuriously softest blanket ever. I'd love to get more boxes but I'm not sure I can convince my husband to let me get another subscription box.
I used to get Boxycharm and Ipsy....and Allure. It seems like most of them have went up on price but down on quality. I'd probably give one or two another try one day though.
I used to do japancrate which is a crate for Japanese snacks. They were pretty good, but the quality went down little by little while I was subscribed and prices went up. For the premium it was only one or 2 full size snacks, a drink, and then they’d send a bunch of little things by the time I unsubscribed. They also kept sending gummy candy during summer months, and the crates took weeks to ship, so you’d just get a melted hunk of candy sometimes. I complained once about the gummies and they were pretty much like eh 🤷‍♀️ too bad. For what they were charging I wanted them to at least acknowledge the issue and send out an apology to people or something. I know a lot of people complained on their FB too.   They also introduced a few other crates. I subscribed to their beauty crate for awhile too, Kira Kira crate. That one was actually pretty good I thought, I was actually getting more products than I could use up, but I’m not a daily makeup wearer. But they’d send all kinds of Japanese skin care and makeup goodies in it. But the last few months I had it, the premium crate was slowly getting smaller and smaller too.
Mine are all food lmao. I just got the Misfits produce box 📦 and I love it. Yummy food and then like protein meals but I have a list of ones I want to subscribe to when I get more money
I get a few wrestling ones!! At least I think I do.  I’m Not sure what I have going I sub and Unsub to them and get confused! And I love wrestling and collecting random stuff so yeah
I’ve subscribed to ipsy for a while now! It’s the one consistent in boxes I’ve tried. I also have pupbox for the doggo 🐶
I love subscription boxes! I can’t really afford any right now. I have tried BOTM, stitch fix, and fabfitfun
I get Ipsy , fab fit fun, and bookwork box  I love books and makeup
I have tried loot crates before. I ordered a litjoyfor the first time this month. They're expensive to ship to Canada :/
I have tried a number of boxes over the years... mostly geeky boxes: Smuggler’s Bounty (Star Wars), Loot Crate (Firefly, DC, Marvel), and Legion of Collectors. I liked most of the stuff in the boxes... you almost always get a pin, a collectible figure or Pop, and some type of wearable: shirt, socks, wristbands, etc... amongst other cool stuff.  I did FabFitFun for a couple of years. Like others have said, it is hit or miss, but i made it worthwhile when i was able to afford it. The annual subscription costs less per box, but of course you pay a lump sum upfront... i pay more for shipping to Hawai‘i, which sucks, BUT it is still a great value for the items inside. The annual subscription allows you to customize your box more than the monthly, so you are more likely to get stuff you will like/use. I am not huge on having frilly or self-care stuff... i tend to be more practical, though i SHOULD take bwtter care of myself. Anyway. A lot of that sort thing i don’t use, BUT they make great gifts especially in a pinch. All the stuff from the boxes helped me save money bigtime during the holidays AND allowed me to gift people outside of my budget.   I have really been wanting to try the Raddish box... cooking for kids. Looks cool and gives them little chef items.
I have Ipsy, and I enjoy it somewhat. I had it a couple of years ago and enjoyed it more. I feel now they include one ticket item and the rest are throw away. Also, they don't cater to allergies. I have a severe lavender allergy and when I saw it in my bag they told me that they are too large to cater. You have over 20 items a month and you can't say "hmmm. this person can't have lavender."
Ooo what kind of stickers were they?
I did one of those giveaways!  It made me happy to see someone else get to enjoy the spoils of my box addiction!
Woohoo! Another ipster! I get GBP too. Are you in the r/ipsy sub? It's fun over there posting about your bag and commenting on others. You can see my latest bag in my profile.
I used to do Ipsy but I don’t wear makeup at work so it just ended up going to waste. I did love the little bags they sent everything in though!
I've looked at Knotty Knickers a few times, is the quality good? I'm considering signing up after I have my son.
That’s so smart with the boxes! I always hated throwing them out cause they were so cute
That’s so cool! I would have loved that as a kid
Oh wow I’ve been looking at those! What are your thoughts on therabox?
Ooo I didn’t know stitch fix does that now!! I’ll have to look into them again
I used to get this a while ago and it was great! I was thinking about getting it again. My boyfriend and I hate cooking but want to eat better as well.
I’ve always been curious about them! Would you say they’re healthy meals?
I’m the same! I want surprises but half the stuff ends up as clutter.
What kind of snacks did you get?
Good to know for when we eventually get a dog!
Ooo sock club sounds neat! What kind of books are sent?
What’s your favorite loot crate?
I’ve never heard of stationary ones! That sounds great for letter writing
Same, I’ve been scrolling the comments to see if anyone has gotten them before haha
Good to know about Causebox!
I’m so curious about causebox. So they let you pick everything?
The only hold up I have on causebox is shipping. They are sooooooooo slow. That being said my winter box will hopefully be here by the 22nd. 🤞
How's the misfits box?  I've been tempted...
I didn’t know they made a wrestling one! That’s so cool!
It depends, actually! They have three options that you can shift between, all for the same price. There's vintage (the one I liked), which is history-themed and often has museum items as stickers! There is also cute (which is cute stickers haha), and pop, which are more modern looking stickers, often with very interesting themes! It was super cool because you could choose to see a spoiler every month and choose which one you wanted to go with. And sometimes you get extras, like notepads and shaped paper clips.
I’m not, but I just joined it! I love seeing the different variations of bags. Your bag looks great! I got the Ofra highlighter as well but I’m worried it may be a little too golden on my skin when swirled around because I’m super fair. I love that we get to pick what items we want though!
I used to wear makeup every day and I had a huge collection! Like I did not leave the house without full makeup, it was more of a hobby for me. But since the pandemic I’m rarely out so I don’t wear it much anymore. I’ve probably only worn it like 15 times at the most since March. 😅
I find the quality to be good especially for the price! I was happy with all the pairs I recieved :)
My teenaged daughter really liked it but I didn’t feel like it had as much value as others. I loved the concept of it though.
Pm me if you want a referral code!
I honestly love it. I have a promo code I can share if you want to use it, just has to be an e-mail address you didn't use before. Bonus, if you cancel they'll send you another promo code in the mail a few weeks later too!
Yes, they send you actual veggies, and actual fruit, and whole foods. You can also adapt things to be healthier, like we never use veggie oil, only olive oil in our foods, etc. We eat salmon, and the rest of our meals are vegetarian. But you can pick from like 20 recipes a week if you want to choose the especially healthy meals. I have like 2 more promo codes if you want one to try! :)
I honestly don’t remember cause it was so long ago, I believe I tried it five or six years ago
Sock club is a monthly sock subscription where you get all sorts of interesting and fun socks! And book of the month club does their five monthly picks where you can use your 15.99 dollar credit towards one of those five books but they also have a massive collection of books you Can add to your monthly box for 9.99 each! They also have cool perks like birthday books and picking up one of the five Books of the year at the end of the year!
Yep. If you just pay quarterly, you don't get to pick. But pay for an annual membership and you get to pick exactly what you want. In my winter box that will come in a few weeks I'm getting these really nice marble coasters, a warm sweater wrap, cozy socks, silicone baking mats, face toner, and 2021 planner.
That's how I feel for FFF. The shipping takes long, I forget that it's on its way, and then when it arrives it's a big surprise like Christmas!
I love it! I’m going to pick out my next box today. It’s so fresh and tasty. I can send a code lol. But I got two mangoes. I never would’ve bought mangos 🥭
Yeha they have a few! Most come with a few t shirts an autograph, a figure of some sorts, a book and then soemthing random! Got a cool spinnerroonie bottle opener/ fidget spinners!
Oh wow that’s neat!
Same! Then I decided that sweating through a face full of makeup was doing more harm than good lol
Awesome!
Sure! Let me message you my email address. 😀
Ooo I might hit you up in a few weeks for them! Just started work again and they feed me there lol
That’s super cool, I might have to do that one once I accomplish my “clear the shelves” initiative!
I’m totally sold on that, do you have a referral code?
Is it a reasonable amount of stuff-- like you can manage the quantities?  I would hate to get more than I can use and see stuff spoil (we're only a two person household)
Sounds good! Also I am very jealous of that set up!!!
And I tend to be a sucker for an interesting/pretty cover and they have gorgeous ones!
I shall DM you momentarily
Yes! They have a small box and a large box. I’m one person and got the giant box which is a lot of stuff (2-4 persons as opposed to 1-2) and I’m managing fine because I like to eat lots of fruits and veggies but you can customize. I have mine set to every other week
Excellent-- this is moving to my try it list!
Whoooo!!! It’s great because you’re helping prevent food waste! Lemme know if you want a code

Glad is only US otherwise I would have entered...and if I won...well I would've eaten the whole thing!
Nutella bella   My daughter loves Nutella so much. Here’s a word but yummy recipe she created. Spread Nutella on sandwich bread, add banana slices and voila, a banana Nutella sandwich!  nutella bella
Nutella Bella!   Here's a Nutella recipe that I like:   Nutella on a Spoon  1. Get a spoon.  2. Get a jar of Nutella and open it.  3. Scoop some Nutella onto the spoon.  4. Enjoy! Repeat until satisfied.  Feeds one.
nutella bella   My son just likes to eat it out of the jar and sometimes spreads it on pancakes. No recipes to share as my son is the addict 😂
Nutella Bella   One of my favorite ways to eat Nutella - make some toast. Slap some Nutella on that biatch while it’s still warm so it gets all melty. Slice up some banana and salt bae them slices all over. Enjoy that shit. 🤤  It’s also really good to do the same on crepes but I’ve never made home made ones before.
nutella bella   Nutella & peanut butter is the best combination, especially on toast 😊
nutella bella   nutella banana toast is a must!
I’m not entering but Nutella goes amazing on crepes. Add some sliced bananas and it’s amazing
Added it to my “Under $5” list  Nutella in a flour tortilla is amazing  nutella bella
Nutella Bella  I like it with strawberry jam on a tortilla 😁
Added to the top of my main list.  My son LOVES Nutella more than anyone.  &#x200B;  Nutella bella.
I have never, ever tried Nutella, not even a nibble. I love peanut and almond butter.  Would I be likely to be a nutella bella do you think?
added to the top of my list! i'm a nutella bella who LOVES nutella stuffed into medjool dates :)
I love nutella bella and so does my husband and my daughter!   I love this 3 ingredient truffle [recipe. ](https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/3-ingredient-nutella-truffles/) You need nutella, oreos, and chocolate chips. It’s easy, rich, and delicious! These nutella [brownies](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/nutella-brownies/) are a favorite too!  Okay last one these [3 ingredient nutella cookies!](https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/3-ingredient-nutella-cookies/) You need nutella, flour, and one egg. I’m a big fan of quick and easy recipes.   Thanks for the simple and sweet contest!
This Nutella Bella loves it on a waffle with some fresh fruit (strawberries, banana, and or blueberries) 😋
Thanks for the contest! Nutella Bella!  Nutella! A reminder of Paris!  We make crepes with Nutella and strawberries or bananas and a little sweet ricotta or mascarpone for protein - first fell in love with it in Paris.   Since someone mentioned it above I will include another recipe. I make hot chocolate bombs with  Nutella. Just add a spoonful of Nutella to the hot chocolate inside.  I also added a little crushed candy cane for a mild mint flavor.  Picture is here:  [Hot Chocolate Nutella Mint Bomb](https://i.imgur.com/t1wcZLj.jpg)  A similar recipe is here:  [Nutella Hot Chocolate Bomb](http://www.melkkos-merlot.co.za/nutella-hot-chocolate-bomb/)
Nutella bella!  If you're looking to do some indoor camping, you gotta try this nutella s'mores recipe: https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-skillet-nutella-smores-226496  Thank you for the contest! Funny enough, I already had that jar on my list 😅  EDIT: whoops, forgot to add the recipe link. Added!
nutella bella !  I love Nutella! It is like heaven on earth.  I added Nutella to my “misc.” wishlist!  Here is a DELICIOUS looking [recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/nutella-brownies/) for Nutella brownies!  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
Thanks for hosting a contest and nutella bella.  Makes a great topping for pancakes with sliced fruit and chopped nuts.
Good find! I like Nutella Crepes! Take one crepe and spread some Nutella on it and add optional strawberries/bananas. I like it best with banana. IHOP used to sell Nutella crepes but they took them off the menu 😢 but I don’t go there often so they could have back lol   nutella bella
Not entering. But I made a nutella hazelnut cookie that was drizzled with nutella. Omg so good.   If you want the recipe PM me and I'll send!
I love to make nutella quesadillas in a tortilla with marshmallows! nutella bella is a beaut!
Not entering but that is a good deal!
that sounds reallllly good. i’ll have to get my hands on some cherry jam!
Man I miss cherry cordials
The best recipe 😂
Have you ever had a Ferrero Rocher candy?  Nutella is like the chocolatey hazelnut flavored  smooth creamy filling on the candy.
Yes! It's sooo good!
Right? I like the cella's brand of cherry cordials best. They're sooo good!
Oh, yes! Yummy.
Sounds like you might just be a Nutella bella

I have this same one. My daughter loves it in the tub!
You’re welcome, glad they are enjoying it!
Oh wow, that looks fantastic. does it require specific markers?
Thank you so much u/Cooked_Bread for the awesome doodle mat! My kids are loving it! 🥰🥰
Wow, that's a smart idea to use it in the bath! I never even thought of that.
It comes with these marker things that you fill up with water and the water is what makes the colour show up! So you could probably use like paint brushes or your fingers even as long as they are wet :) It also fades once the water dries.
Yes! It should have suction cups with it. We just stick it on the wall.
Oh that's briliiant! Do you mind sharing the link? I think I found the gift for my nephew's next birthday
It does have suction cups! I saw in the ad they had it stuck on the wall but I never thought of the bath, definitely going to be doing that!

u/apl2291 — thanks so much! I had this exact bracelet from a Reddit Gifts exchange, but it was starting to fall apart. You gifted me not one but TWO replacements!!! Thank you so so much!
Love it! 🌈
♥️🏳️‍🌈
I love it!!
You are so very welcome— I am glad you enjoy your gift!
Right?! It’s so subtle that I can wear it 24/7, but still allows me to show some 🌈pride🌈!
Most definitely! I wore the other bracelet every day for over  9 months, so your gift will certainly keep me going for awhile! I can also swap between them so I have one for daily use and one for “formal wear!”
Can you provide a link to this? I love it!

This is so neat!
u/ricenoddles thank you so much!!! The ice cubes are beyond perfect. The details are so clear too! We all love it ❤ I couldn't get the picture clear so I improvised with some red wine 😁
That's a wonderful tip 😮
Ooh nicee I am gonna try that next time. I got so excited, I just used tap water 😁

Ah white pens :))) i know em all too well. I wrote a naughty mean note to the teacher with em lmao. Thought I was slick. Apparently I was the only one who used em so I got suspended. I was a very shy person, but my mind wasnt. They described the letter as "using every curse word in the dictionary at least twice". Totally not my style... but i was tryin to play it off as it was someone else writing it.   Be kind with your white pens lol.
Thank you u/the_mermaid_slayer for the gel pens! I have some darker stationery that they will be perfect for <3

u/hungupon thank you for the relaxing bubble bath. 😙 Time to unwind after a day full of screaming kids. Who knows. Perhaps I’ll come up with a cool writing prompt?
Looks relaxing!!
Got room for two? Looks devine.
Oh, that’s pretty interesting. I’ve once gotten something similar in a hotel and it was so calming. I could literally feel my skin absorbing calm. All the ones I’ve ever found in drugstores weren’t... that. Even if I used pure esthetic oils.  Sooo.. just for curiosity.. I guess it’s lovely bluish. But how intense is it? I might get myself some!
yay you're so welcome!! :D
If you’ve never tried Dr Teals I def recommend it it’s very soothing.
Only once, but I did like it! You have me considering a bath before bed now.

Me too!!! I can barely do a single stitch or double stitch. See, I don’t even know what it’s called 😂😂 I’ve been watching YouTube vids and it looks so easy but when I tried... omg no. LOL
I absolutely will! 😃
Single crochet stitch and double crochet stitch lol I use beginner YouTube video that zooms in when they do the stitch.
Ooo that’s a good idea!! I keep rewatching and rewatching but it just doesn’t register lmao luckily I have my mom who’s really good at it so she can teach me... but she’s not very patient w me 😂😂😂
Also watch where they do it in slow motion to really see how the stitch is done. Helped me tons when I was like wtf is hdc2tog now I know it’s half double crochet stitch 2 in the same chain together
😳😳😳😳  Say what now?? Omg this is so overwhelming lol!! Alright!!! Let’s do this!!
You will get it I promise it took me a bit but I got with lots of YouTube tutorials
Thanks for the support and encouragement!! Totally need it lol

OK, see the image? You're going to respond with emojis to describe a movie. It doesn't have to be literal, like "Bird Box," it can be more abstract/descriptive. Have fun with it!  Rules:  1. Your movie/response is in emoji only. Then let people guess your movie. You may respond and comment normally. You may do as many movies as you'd like! 2. Guess what people's movies are! 3. Tag a friend if you want to. 4. There is a bonus element to this contest. I have a secret LIST that has 10 movies on it that can be created with emojis. If someone creates and/or guesses all ten of these on the board then I will gift the person they tag as well! 5. Winners - only those who have gifted to others are eligible to win.

🏡☄🤚🗡👾🤣🌌  u/horrorlover29 maybe you can get this one!  Hint: It was originally a short story by a famous horror author  Second hint: It's a Nic Cage movie  The answer was The Colour Out of Space  The story emoji were basically where the meteor hits the farm, that one really tense scene where the mother cuts her finger off, the fucked up llama monster, the dad going crazy and how the colour really just envelopes everything before it explodes/implodes.

Yes, My Girl!
Ha, I was worried about that. The ring is key here 🤣
6 and 7 are both not right but the rest are!!  Which emojis can't you see in 7?? I'll go change them 😢
Yess!! You got all the ones you guessed right. A clue for number one is that its a really awful but good netflix Christmas romcom hahah
Ahh you got 1-4 correct.  5 is close but nope,  For 7 focus more on the colour of the guy afterwards 😂 I found this one hard haha
Yes!!
Hahah yes you got everything right except for the first one which is a terrible netflix romcom haha
Nope. I might have to redo it I think😂
Woohoo you got it too! 🌟
Nope. First ones right though!
Nope!
Ohh that’s a good one but nope!
Nope!
Nope!
Except the movie is four wedding....
Yes, lol...
Bug soda, lol close🤣
You got it!!
That’s a good guess for the first one but not right ☺️
OOOOOO that’s a GOOD ONE!!
Yes!
Spot on!
Number 5 is really great. Man, I love that movie.
No, but good guess!
No
6 and 8 are correct!
2 and 5 are correct
No x 3 😂
👍
The english title is The Emperors New Groove, but yes.
Yes!
Jep! :D
I love all those movies!
Yesss! All of those are right!
You got one, three, and four right!! :)  Well actually 4 was supposed to be The Hobbit - but it’s apart of lord of the rings so tis works!  2 is a rom com if that helps!
You got 1, 3, and 4 right!   I guess I made 2 a little hard lol, but it is a rom com if that helps!
Haha yep!
Yup!
Yes! 😊
Yes! 😊
Yes! 😊
Yep
Yep
Correct :)
Maybe some more emojis will help?   🥶☠  🛩☠  🚗☠   👩‍🦰👨🏿‍🦲👨🏼🧔🧑🏾👧🏾
Nope, but I see how it could be lol
It's a blue emoji that is freezing because it's cold!
You are correct!
Same answers, but not sure of the TV show!
It is! It was hard to find something to relate to each character.
A meteor :)
No,  sorry :(
Noooo
No :(
Sorry but no
Nuh uh :)
Nope, Try again.
All correct. Last one is old: Fist full of money
Yes!
Omg that was a good one!!!
It was Austin Powers :)
Hmm the first one reminds me of something like night of the living dead or maybe some more like a Jason movie?? I’m so bad at horror movies! 😂😂
yes! you got them all (:
Yes!
Signs was wrong the rest correct
All correct (excluding the one you couldn’t see)
Wait! The first one isn’t correct
I got all the same answers as you!!! 🙌 i can’t see that one emoji either. 🤔 i feel like the key to number 1 is in that last emoji i can’t seem to figure out what it is... so small! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣
Yes to the ones you guessed
Yup!
I think 7 might be The Secret Life of Pets? Maybe.
All correct except number 2!
yes! lol
Nope :)
The first movie is really great maybe check it out if you have time! :D You can also make your own list :)
Yes!
No it isn't really an anime it kinda fits into that category though sadly the right emoji doesn't exist 😅
Jep! :D
4. Himouto! Umaru chan
🥇 Yup!!
Yes!! Well done.
Everything is right except number 3
Yess well done!!
Nope!
Yes!!! 👏
Yup!
Yup!
No, but good guess.
Yep
Yes!
Yep
Yes!
I never would’ve gotten that lol good one!
yeah! :)
nope :)
4. Yes  8. Yes 6. No 10. No
Yes and yes
4,5 abs 8 are correct. Other not so
Yes
**K.O.!!!**  Not a tough one but that it’s make someone smile.
Yes! Must be. Great movie.
Yep!
March of the Penguins! Brilliant!
Yay! I’m so glad!
I keep coming back every once in a while to look at them with fresh eyes and I still can’t figure it out haha
You are definitely right
Yay! It was either that or RBG :)
I changed 5 is it right now??  I’ll think on 8 for a littel
Yes, no, yes! 👏👏👏
Ooo finding dory????
Twilight?
🤣🤣🤣 you can do this!!
Yeah! That was really good!
Yay!!!
Hurray!
I haven't watched it yet but from what I've heard, those emojis are great for it!
Hahaha I love it!!!
I should watch Three Men and a Baby, it's been a long time and it makes me laugh.
Men in black ahh that makes sense
I use to watch that movie every weekend as a kid lol.
Oooo ooooo oooo!! Crap!!! That!! Arggggg omg   Nightmare before Christmas!!   And I definitely don’t know musicals.. especially one w knives but I might have to watch it bc of it now 😂😂
Is number 5 Heather's?
Chicago? Actually never seen it, despite its popularity 😲
The only thing that really comes to mind for that one is Meet the Millers and Idk why lol guess cuz 4 people.
The pigs were the best clue!
Is it Se7en?
I did not expect that with that emoji, but now that I know it makes sense :)
Yes!
Great movie!
One of my favorite Christmas movies!
#3 Baby Driver  I think the software changed my number.
Nailed it
Thank you, that's the one!
Is 6 John Wick? Haha
So stuck on the ones I can't get though! Good job!
I’m literally still staring at that one lol. I won’t let it beat me!
John Wick?
Yay!!
yay!
Me too! I literally want to name my non existent boy child Wesley (I like that spelling better)
At the end!
Such a good (and terribly sad) movie!
I really don't know this one, but I'll stick around to see if someone guesses!
I don't think it's your fault lol I can't see a lot on here and I'm guessing they must be phone specific. Like android and iPhone haha
All Christmas movies on Netflix are awful romcoms 😂  I haven't watched many, but it could be the Knight before Christmas or something that one with that girl and guy as always
Oh number 7 is then Hulk!
Christmas prince??
Give us hints! This is fun!
Oh man I was so sure!! I’m invested now lol
Lol I knew there was a movie about multiple weddings and a funeral but that’s it
Omg beetle juice is brilliant!
I looked at the other response and now I’m laughing at myself for not getting that lol I love that movie!
Also hello 612! :)
Oooo that’s a good one for #1!!! Dang u/doesyawannasnog you’re EXCELLENT at this!!
So simple but so effective!
Yay! I love this movie!
:D
Definitely!
into the spiderverse?
Thanks! ☺️ gonna have to take a look at those others again.
\#1 is Deadpool!
You spelled yes wrong
I love that film so much lol.
It reminds me of 50 first dates, but i don't think that's it, maybe something with the Olympics!
Is that a movie?! I thought of the song.
Final destination? That was my first instinct, but I didnt remember a deer lol
me either, I have no idea what the show is lol
I think you did really good with it tbh
Super 8...? This one is tough!
Invasion of the Body Snatchers?
Blast. This one has me stumped! Armageddon? This is my last guess!
My brain is fried from the chaos of retail today lol
I absolutely LOVE horror movies so I have no excuse lol I should know all!
Yay!
Yay!
Oh wait...I was talking about 3. I can't see any of 3? I can't see the last of 1 either though.
🎉☺️
Right! That makes sense. 🙌I was reaching with Cats and Dogs 🤦🏻‍♀️
Yes, Secret Life of Pets!
Of course... Gorillas in the Mist 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
🎉
Im not much into anime tbh xD and jm bad at coming up with rjddles like this :p
🎉☺️
I’m definitely at a loss lol
*4.
The Birds!
You’re so good at this
It was the bomb that made it click
10. Ice Princess? Frozen?
I was thinking the movie Happy Feet!
Super clever!
I feel like I need to add more emojis but I’m clueless at which ones I could add 😂
Hahah yes #5 is correct now!
Hahahah yessssss!! 👏👏👏👏👏
Yaaasssss!! I guess I really should’ve stuck a vampire emoji on there instead of the wolf lol
I'm old...... 😛
It’s on Disney plus if you have it! I rewatched it’s recently and it still holds up
Yep!!😎
same! lol
Yes!! Nightmare before Christmas!!! And 5. The title of the musical is a major us city!!
It’s placed and named after a major city!
Yes!! You should watch it if you have the chance!! It’s really quite the spectacle!!
Haven’t seen that one 🤔  It’s an 80s movie
Kinda thought thought so... there’s no knight or evil nun emoji. Lmao!
Ding ding ding :-)
Me too! I watched it again yesterday 😅
That's what I was wondering too. But yup, you got it!
Ding ding ding! Nicely done
I'll give you some hints on the ones you didn't get:  7️⃣  A dog dies in the beginning  The ice cream flavor there is "vanilla"
I'll give you a hint. The 🐕🔫 signify the dog dying in the beginning
YUP! nicely done
It’s a great name and not terribly common, which I like. My first love’s name was Wesley though so I couldn’t do that, lol.
There, fixed it! There’s still a couple important chunks missing cause I didn’t know how to represent a kidnapping or their victory against humperdink 🤷🏻‍♀️
It really is! I haven't watched it in so long. I always think about it, but decide I don't have the emotional bandwidth to do it.
It's been guessed! My Girl.
Ohhhh that's also a great one 😂😂
Yes!! I saw all the science emojis and as an ex bioscientist knew I had to recreate that 😂😂
Yess
I updated it with more detail and prob made it worse 😂
Hahaha I think it might be a little lesser known but it’s been released within the last 5 years
Also looking back midsommer is a damn good guess for it too!
Lol...
It is!!! I won’t lie u/fourlivess it took me a second to register 😂😂😂 I was like what is that insect?! Juice... ooooo beetle juice!! 🤣🤣🤣
Lolololo one of my favs...
Hi!!!!
God, that 🤡 is enough to freak me out!! Oh man, still have chills about that movie 😂😂😂!!
Yes!!!
Yep
💜🤣
😂
Me too! It's one of my favourites!
That was it!
It is an animated movie! Super corny, but nostalgic!
No, sorry! I haven't watched that 😅
Yeah I was gonna say final destination too I mean the hot emoji made me think of the sunbed scene.
Thank you!
Nuh uh :)
Nada, sorry
Nope!
That's definitely understandable haha
😂😂😂 I’m horrible w remembering movie names!!
Yeah. We in the same page here. Number three emoji is just a question mark, but that last emoji in number one is so small.
Nah, yours made sense too :)
Yesssss!
Well done!
It was supposed to be detective Pikachu but it wasn't that good xD
Yes!!!!
Frozen. Correct
That’s how I feel about mine lol, this is a lot harder to make these than I expected
8 is so difficult to figure out ahhh
Hush!
I do. Thanks for the heads up.
OOOOOO!!! Chicago!!!!  Hahah at first I was like La La Land?! That movie has knives in it?? Then I was like wait a minute!!!! LOL thanks for the hints!!!
Chicago?
I will make note of that! Thank you! ☺️
Woo! I have that on my list too, just with different emojis 😅
Thanks for the hints!  Ahh I'm actually awful at films though 😂. I avoid anything where a dog dies so I definitely won't know that one... Haven't seen or heard of anything with vanilla in the title either  These are great tho! I'm going to try and make some more haha
JOHN WICK
Oh no! Isn’t it funny how meeting someone in real life with a name can tarnish if
Awesome!
Same. That's one of those movies that might just stick in my memory forever without needing to watch it again.
Thank you for letting me know! I haven't seen that one!
Throw an angry face in there just for good measure 🤣
Awesome! 💜
Omg the edit helps, but still doesn’t help lol
Annihilation...?
The Revenant?
Lolololololol
You seem like you’d be fun to watch scary movies with! Two of my friends in high school used to come over to watch scary movies even though they were terrified. It made it somewhat less scary for them because we’d all be laughing so hard at their jumps over minor things
A llama?! He's supposed to be dead!
Awesome, great movie! What's the golden medal emoji stand for?
Ooh the medal is because of the First place 😂
Exactly!!
What was the answer?!? You stumped us!
Thanks ☺️ but not as much as yours 😉
🎉
☺️💜🙏
I would never have guessed it lol. It’s a shame they don’t have a pickachu emoji! Can you imagine how cute it would be 🥰
Woo hoo!!
You can do it....
🤣😂😉
Yes!!! Such an amazing musical!
For being awful at films you sure got a lot! No problem, glad you played along :)
Nailed it!!
Yes! So many good names I can’t use lol
It's a good one! Pretty sad though.
Ahh that's such a good idea! I was just like, hopefully they'll get that he's green and looks pretty dangerous?
I think I thought about it too hard 🤦‍♀️ oops haha
WOAH SOMEONE GOT IT!
Here’s your gold star! 🌟
Nope!
Hahahah I’ve a very intense person when watching scary movies!! Gasping, jumping, freaking out, grabbing whoever is next to me, the works!! Hahaha!!
Oh, right. The poison. The poison for Kuzco, the poison chosen especially to kill Kuzco, Kuzco's poison.
Lmao yeah just for the first date part!
Oh oops! It was The Colour Out of Space! It's one of my favourite horror movies!
Yes!!! Haha thanks for the tag!!
I will never name a kid Matt because I’ve known like 14 Matt’s in my life!
I do like all the sciency emojis. I haven't seen them before!
Hurray!!! That was a good one!
*screams into pillow* lmao jk This is really fun  Edit: I just accidentally learned how to make italics lol
Those are the best people to watch with!!! Haha.  What are some of your favorite movies? (Non scary)
Thanks for being like the best guesser haha
Oh yeah, dated one one of those too 😂😂 I need to slow down so there’s some boy names left lmao. I want to name my kid something really unique though, so I doubt I’ll meet anyone named Oleander 😅
Thank you! It was fun trying to emojify it
Yay for happy accidents! I hope someone gets it though! I think I thought about it too hard. But it should hopefully be clear once someone gets it if you’ve seen it!
You could also try the 2nd one. No one guessed that either!
Hahah the worst is when I’m really into the movie and whoever sitting next to me decides to grab me and yell BOO! Or shake me! I’ll start screaming and almost pee myself 🤣🤣🤣  I’m really into action movies... can’t really think of any bc I’ve been living under a rock for the last 8yrs!! But like the Marvel series were pretty good (except Guardians of the Galaxy- just couldn’t get into that one). My all time favorite movie is Bad Boys! I loved the first one!! 2nd one was meh. 3rd one they made up for the crappy 2nd one!!!
Oh that’s cool! I like that. Would you nickname him? Like Ollie? Or Ander?
I thought too hard about mine too. I made it and then looked at the other comments and realized I went a little overboard, haha
Haha see that’s one thing I will not ever do—if you’re trusting me enough to watch a scary movie with me I won’t mess with you!  Bad Boys is a great pick! I really enjoyed the third one, sort of surprised I liked it so much—I expected it to be sort of bad
Definitely Ollie ❤️
At least someone got yours 😂 I should’ve just picked another off my shelf but I wanted a challenge lol
Someone got it - annihilation!
Whew!! On behalf of all chicken shit scary movie watchers, I thank you for not messing w us!! Would absolutely love to watch a scary movie w you!!  Right?! I was a little wary of Bad Boys 3 like oh boy... please don’t be bad.. it was great. I hated that one part, w the captain, if ya know what I mean? Ugh, that upset me a lot! lol
I was secretly hoping you’d say that because that is an awesome name and awesome nickname!   I had a friend with that nickname (real name Oliver) and he was such a cool guy. Massive head of gorgeous black curls that he then donated
Well of course! challenges are fun!
Never heard of it but I’m glad someone solved the puzzle! Now I can sleep tonight 😂
Oh man it’s a good movie if you’re into sci fi/horror at all. It’s got Natalie Portman as the lead too! (I haven’t seen a bad movie with her in it)
From your emojis, it looks pretty good! I’ll have to try and find it somewhere to watch
Hope you can find it! I haven’t seen it pop up to stream in awhile.

Hi all. I’ve been on Reddit after it being recommended and found this sub. I’m trying to figure it all out, next step making friends.   I have SPD so find myself liking a lot of random stuff, different textures and artists, films and people. I like baking and love love love dogs. I have a dog and just love stroking his ears.   I love coffee and custard donuts and staying in bed when I can.   Hope we can be friends
[deleted]
I don't like coffee or donuts but I love dogs and staying in bed! Yes I think we can be friends!🥰

Welcome to the group! ☺️
Welcome! This is an awesome place, pop in and out as you please
Good job!!
Thank you. I will look
he is called Chester
amazing, friend right there
He is an imperial shih Tzu. So cute
I love rom coms, cant get enough of them
thank you so much, i might get going and do some sort of discussion to get me used to it.
i think its in the name... but mine is pretty good, he is asleep at the moment.   Oh i like omlettes but have to go with cheese and tomato and peppers. MMM could eat one now actually.
Sensory processing disorder. It’s about senses, everyone is different. For me it’s sounds and touch mainly. I love to touch things but don’t like being touched myself. I don’t do personal space well. I don’t like loud things either but then I love music in my ears. Music helps me a lot
He is a shih Tzu called Chester
I love cold iced coffee.
I love red velvet cake 🍰
I want to try baked Alaska but worried it will be a sloppy mess 😂
I love baking treats for my dog. Although he won’t leave me alone when I’m doing it
I love a nice cold iced coffee
He’s a shih Tzu
I love fluffy pillows and anything soft. I can feel cushions and pillows forever.  I like all sorts of music but my favourite song is the killers- mr bright side
I love soft fluffy pillows. Get me in a shop and I’m touching it all.  There isn’t a texture I dislike as yet.  It’s all about the positives for me.
I love exploring this country as I take my pooch with me. We enjoy the holiday together. I like coastal places but equally enjoy exploring old towns such as York With nature I love flowers. I love looking at them and touching their petals (that’s the SPD though)
Aww cute name
I enjoy those too!
Thank you for explaining!
That's awesome! This is my mom's new shih tzu puppy, [Coco](https://imgur.com/gallery/8ECdwUM)!
Is that the dessert that you set on fire? I'd be afraid to make it!
Aww so cute! I almost got a Shih Tzu instead of the dog I ended up with when I rescued my first dog.
Yay that’s good :)
No it’s the ice cream inside cake that you bake. Never understood it
I rescued mine. It was at the start of lockdown and he was in such a sorry place. I mean now he’s loving life but it’s been hard
Oh yeah, baking ice cream sounds counter intuitive!
Aww I totally understand. I've had my rescue for 4 years now and we're still working on a lot LOL. But it get's better! I'd say my girl is now 70% there! A ball of total anxiety, but we can walk past other people, and dogs, and now have visitors come to our home (if it weren't for a pandemic.) It you need any help, or ideas with your pup let me know! I'm happy to help in any way I can!
Thank you. I will follow you and we can chat.

u/RosieCakeness Sorry for the late post! Alot was going on.  Thank you so much for the vitamins! They are working great ❤❤
Oh, that's a nice amount of melatonin. The 12mg! That should really help!

Awesome to hear!!!  Sweet dreams. ❤️

Ah, good luck! I’m sure you’ll do great!

Super cool!  My daughter drew this piece piece with oil pastels. Just thought I’d [share](https://imgur.com/a/DOZbHZH)

What a cool postcard and thoughtful interpretation!
Thank you so much u/DebStone for the awesome spooky postcard!! It put a smile on my face waking up to my post this morning :)<3
😱 What a cool card
Aww how cool! She has done a grand job :)

u/debstone 🍌 Thank you for the kind mail!

I'm very excited about my marshmallow bomb.  Also excuse the sticky island in the background.  I have a 4 year old but to be honest it was probably me😄
Mmmmm what will you eat with it?
Yay!!! Fluff!!!!
Fluffernutter sandwiches are always a win, and of course a glob in a cup of cocoa.  But also it is super good on a hot brownie🥰
That sounds absolutely amazing!!
It is dangerous😄

Beautiful!
Thanks so much u/ickis88 for the space pendant! I love it! It’s so pretty, I keep staring at it trying to figure out how they made it.
Too neat
I'm glad that you like it. :) It makes my heart happy

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kynsp1/contest_help_me_with_the_things/
Hello RAOA fam! I'm going to host a small $5 contest to help me with decisions I've been wondering about. You must vote on both options in order to be considered. Contest will end at some point on Sunday. Obviously DBAD. Here are the rules:  1. Vote if you want my next contest to be $5, or $10, but if it is $10 it will take me a little longer between contests. 2. Vote if I should hire someone to insulate our attic professionally with the foam stuff and delay getting the attic door being installed, OR do we hire someone to install the attic door, and insulate it ourselves with the pink fluffy stuff? 3. Use "3 day weekend" for the raffler 4. Be in the US or have items for prime 5. Have gifted before (I will check) 6. For fun if you want to share your best homeowner tip I'd love it! But it won't help you in the contest. I just love talking house stuff.  Happy Playing! This contest is now closed. Thanks for playing!
3 day weekend ... oh yeah! 😀  1. $10, sweet of you!  2. In an attic I think I would go with the professional foam ... the door will come. I think the foam would keep it warmer if you are going to use it a lot. To me, heat rises and you don’t want it escaping out of your attic. I am attaching a link I found helpful to answer your question.  [Insulation pros and cons ](https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/attic-insulation-types/)   ....  6. Homeowner tip: instead of filing our bills, manuals, taxes, and other misc. papers in a filing cabinet we create bankers boxes. Each has the year on it and we throw everything in the corresponding years box. Think about it, how many times do you actually go to those files ... hardly at all, why waste hours filing when you can throw them into a yearly box. After seven years we go through the box and keep what we still need and burn or shred the rest. So much easier than filing everything in a file cabinet and everything is easy to find.
1. $5   2. Hire someone to insulate and delay the door until you can hire someone else. There are some things to skimp on. Not that. Or electricity.   3. 3 day weekend.
1. $5  2. Ugh. Insulation is awful itchy but easy to install. Get the rolls, staple gun, and cover ALL your skin, mask up snd wear eye covers but then do it yourself because then you can get the door fixed too and it will be DONE!   3 day weekend - great time for home projects.   Tip: do the repairs before you think you need to— saves time and money every time!
1. $5  2. Hire someone for the foam, wait on the door. Insulation isn’t fun to install and the foam is fantastic!   3. 3 day weekend.
1. I think you should do another $5 contest and take that other $5 and put it towards the funds for the door, which leads me to   2. I think you should hire someone to insulate it and hold off on that door a little longer. My dad always says, “If you’re going to do something, do it right the first time.”  3. 3 day weekend   Thanks for the contest. u/gdarn16 come play
Thanks for the contest! 3 day weekend  $10 contests, and hire someone to insulate the attic for you. A door can wait and insulating it yourself sounds exhausting.  Honestly I could use homeowner tips too, I am planning to buy the house I currently live in and I want to start helping my friend/the current owner take care of it!
1. $10  2. I say you professionally insulate the attic then install the door later. That way, you’ll be able to have both but with time in between!  3. 3 day weekend  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
3 day weekend!   1. $10 contest   2. Hire someone to install the attic door!
$10  Hire  3 day weekend
3 day weekend!   Professionally insulate and wait on the attic door. Hold a $10 contest with time in-between. Sometimes, it's just a good idea to wait.
1. I vote for whichever contest you think you’d have more fun with! Maybe a theme. (Stationary under $5 or books under $10 etc)  2. I don’t know about the cost difference for each of these options or which one will be the better insulator in the long run - but as someone who works with insulation at their job - avoid it if you can! It will be EVERYWHERE and since you aren’t used to it you will itch like mad. Any small bit that gets on your clothes will transfer to all your other clothes in the wash. So I’d personally go with avoiding the insulation. Cuz you’re gonna have the added cost of also getting PPE. I can’t imagine a door would be too hard to install yourself though? I’m sure there are tons of YouTube videos to help you out!  3. 3 day weekend !  4. ✔️   5. ✔️   6. I have been a homeowner for a few years. I’m not sure what a good tip would be, but if you have a question I can try to answer!  Thanks for the contest!
3 day weekend  $10 contest Insulate yourself and hire for attic door. Just my opinion.
It’s a 3 day weekend   I say $10   Hire someone to insulate you’ll be garage full to insulate yourself is a B
1. $5 😊 2. I’d hire both but I’m not experienced in insulation 😂 3. 3 day weekend ! I’ve gifted but forgot to make a post  Happy weekend!!
1. $5 --> more fun! 2. This 3 day weekend you (and whom would be helping you) watch a video or two on a) installing the pink fluffy stuff insulation and b) installing an attic door. Then decide if it's something you can/would want to do <3  3. My best homeowner tip (not that i own a home) is to make sure all of your rain spouts are clean/clear and OPEN! My neighbor's rain spout had been crushed by something and was causing the water to, instead of going to the grass and gutter, was pouring like a waterfall over their front door and porch area! It was a super easy fix that i did in about 2 mins with a wrench and mallet :) Congrats on your new place!!!
I think you should do whatever contest you feel like doing!  Also, I'd probably have a professional do it since we have a four year old who is ino EVERYTHING!    I have a 3 day weekend this weekend because of my schedule!  As far as being a homeowner...  I highly recommend moving to an area you love, whether or not the house is a perfect fit.
1. $5 because small contests are fun!! 2. I’d hire a professional because it means less work for you, plus personally I know nothing about installing insulation.    3 day weekend
I am not entering the contest but I do want to tell you to hire a professional unless you know how to install insulation. You'll regret it later if it's badly installed
I say $10, because it’s hard to find that many cool things on amazon that are under $10.  I think you should get the insulation professionally installed.   3 day weekend
You should keep doing the $5 contests, the more the merrier!   I vote you have a professional do the foam stuff, it insulates so much better and I think it would save you in the long run.  3 day weekend !
Hey, not entering but depending on where you live my aunt and uncle run a family home insulation business (his dad started it in the 50s). Everguard Insulation. They are in the LA area :)
3 day weekend  $5 because its not about the money, its about the thought. 🙂  100% vote to do it yourselves. I insulated a garage ceiling, rented a sprayer of sorts that you load the insulation into and shoot. It was a really fun, sweaty, dirty time but I'd totally do it again. 😀 Plus, you'll save a lot of money and build solid memories.
1. $10 2. Get a professional to do the fluffy stuff, it will save you so much money on heating so you should get it done asap! 3. 3 day weekend 4. I'm not in the US but I do have some prime things on my WL, or I'm happy with a giftcard! 5. I have gifted before!  Thank you for hosting this!
1. I think your next contest should be $10. 2. You should hire someone professionally.  3. 3 day weekend
1) $5   2) Hire professionally   3) 3 day weekend
3 day weekend!  Hire someone, that stuff is itchy😬  5 buck contests are always fun!
1. $5 2. Hire someone to install the door and insulate yourselves. The door seems like it would be important and I asked my Nana and she said doing insulation yourself isn’t difficult at all   3. 3 day weekend!  Homeowners tip from my Nana: Change your furnace filters once a month in the winter so they work better   Thanks for the contest!
1. $5 🌸 2. hire someone professionally 💭 3. 3 day weekend 💗
I'm not entering, but as someone who rebuilt a room over the summer/early fall and worked with doors, drywall, insulation....    Hire someone to foam spray your attic. It will create a better insulation barrier than the "pink fluffy stuff". You wont have to worry about if you're doing it right, buying enough (or the right stuff), stepping in the wrong places,  etc. It will, in my opinion, be worth the ease of mind to have someone just come in and do it. And this is coming from someone determined to be doing all the things DIY when we renovate our house - but attic insulation is where I stop. Lol
For your 3 day weekend raffler definitely hire someone to do it pro. Peace of mind for later, plus a selling point if that's your future plan.  $5, more often because it's fun! And home tip - smart lighting is a game changer.
1) $5! Small contests are fun 2) Insulate professionally, insulation is gross to mess with yourself but properly insulated things are really worth the money (I've been living in a terribly insulated house and I wish someone had put the money in to have it properly insulated!) 3) 3 day weekend!  Not a homeowner so I don't really have any "homeowning" tips but for just general home stuff, replacing blinds and curtains is shockingly helpful at making your house feel nicer! Amazon and Walmart are the places to go for those things too, I never thought I'd be able to replace my sliding glass door curtain for $15 lol
I think it should be ten! And I think you shoukd hire someone to professionally do that pink foam stuff! It’s actually kinda dangerous!! Enjoy the 3 day weekend! And thanks for hosting
$10. I think you should hire someone to install the door and eat the pink fluffy stuff.   3 day weekend!
Thanks for the contest. I vote for a $10 contest. And I also vote for someone to professionally insulate the attic.   3 Day Weekend :)   I don’t think I have any home tips. We are renters so we don’t deal with any of the repairs or maintenance.
1. $5! The amount doesn’t matter and gifting is so much fun!   2. Definitely hire a professional! That sounds like difficult and messy work.   3. 3 day weekend! Wahoo!   I’ve never owned a home before I’m so I don’t have any tips sorry!
Yay for 3 day weekend!  I vote for 10$ and for you to hire a professional!
yay for a 3 day weekend!  $5  hire a professional, I feel like it would benefit you in the long run.
3 day weekend!  $5 gifts to spread more of the love :)  Hire a professional for the attic and delay the door
1. 10 dollars 2. Professionally done, it’ll probably be more useful? I think   3 day weekend !!!  I’m here for the home owner tips, even though I don’t own this home (it’s my dads) I manage it! So I could use the advice!
1. I say $10 gifts more spread out!   2. Hire a professional  3. 3 day weekend   4. Check   5. Check   6. I'm not a homeowner so I don't have any tips for ya :(  Thanks for hosting!!!!
Yes to your tip! We bought a fixer-upper in July and the previous owners let everything just rot. Literally our AC condenser was an actual pile of rust, and summers here can get 90+ degrees, and humid AF. We're literally just trying to catch up on all the crap they let fall to waste. The list is.... long LOL
Thanks for the summon friend!
We have to cut the joists of the roof floor to get the attic door where we want it. But other wise I'd totally would DIY it!
Thanks! :)
My dad has done it before and right now we have literally no insulation so something is better than nothing! (In my head as least)
Aww I wish! I’m on the opposite coast ☹️
I know! When we first bought our house in July we replaced the HVAC system with a 16.6 SEER one, and I swear its all going out the ceiling... LITERALLY!!
Glad I could finally beat you at summoning haha
Ohhh yea that’s a whole other ball of wax never mind then! I forget people have entrances in the ceiling in their house. A lot of people around here have entrance through the top of the wall in their garage. I was thinking of that.
of course! it's always awesome to have your own place <3 i'm excited for you <3
If your dad has done it before and he'll help then go ahead and do it yourself. Do watch the Youtube videos another poster recommended.  Good luck
Haha me too actually. East coast buddies! Just throwing it out there. Good luck!
I bet!!!!
I’m on it when I’m not at work or at my boyfriends lmao 😂😂 you caught me at my bfs house!
Haha! 1 for me and like, 14 for you. Haha

I just have a query for u/supermarvelous310 that no one else has been able to answer for me.   My local clothing stores have all this weird, dowdy clothing in the women’s section right now and i just don’t get it. High, stiff collars, weird grandma lace stuff, just really school marm motif... except the maternity section, where there’s all the tight pants, low cut tops, satin robes.. just really sexy stuff.   So I have to ask why the maternity section gets all the sexy clothes. They already got laid.   [Bunny’s list. ](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/XB7R7S7AQESA?ref_=wl_share)

Haaaaa!  Im a fan of the SCP fan series, *Confinement*, and theres a joke in there that always tickles me.  Guy one: They put me in with the cannibal. It sucked.   Guy two: I’m sorry, man. At least it wasn’t that guy who eats memories.   Guy three: OMG theres a guy who eats your memories!??  Guy two: No way!  There is?   No one appreciates that gem but i bet you would.
You are a treasure. 🥰🥰🥰
Here for the obligatory denim denim denim spam. 😂😂
Omg. I just. Why? I don’t. What?   I am so confused. And all i can think of is our local shop called Herfy Burger that seems to belong on your list.
u/overthinkee1234 ! *ding ding ding*  because I simply couldn’t get this out of my mind and it made me laughed. I kept going back to this image 👏  You FOUND me !   *...this time*   😉
Okay, okay. You got me. Im on board. I got on board with the “humming buyrds are a dick tattooed”. 👏👏👏👏
Frickin 👏 Science 👏 Hippies 👏👏👏👏   I know you don’t need a play-by-play of your own share, but its so amazing I can’t even.
Its the Chronic WHAT *did I just watch tho*
That’s hilarious! What’s SCP?
Hahah, I’ve told her it before I’m pretty sure, so I didn’t wanna post it again, but yes!! XD I actually did just post it on another contest though! I love that thing! 😂❤️
It only gets funnier the more you look at it. It’s so dumb and I love it
Yay we have found Waldo thank you   u/MichaelTheMage for finding her!!
Hahahah these are the besttttt. Watch more of them you’ll die laughing!
Lol!! I love it
It stands for secure, confine, protect. It’s basically a series about monsters and entities that is entirely fan made. Like, there’s no TV show or anything like that that it’s based off of, everything is fan made. There’s some really cool SCP channels on YouTube and stuff, though, because a lot of people have built the lore.  Bunny got me into it, and the first one I ever saw was called the endless IKEA. That’s a really good creepy one, but there are also really nice ones too, such as SCP Dash 999 the tickle monster.
Because it is the greatest joke of all time.  And so versatile, just ask my wife… But only when she’s been given large doses of anesthetics.
You're welcome! Glad she has been found 😁
How did Josephine die? Suicide by laughing by humming bjyürds.
That sounds so cool! I’ll have to check it out!
Hahah, I agree! I still giggle thinking about “they did it, did it, did it!” lol! XD  She’s a genius!
Hahahaha the giraffe one by the same YouTuber is another favourite!

Happy cake day 🎊🧁🎁😅🎉🥳🎂🥮🎈🍰 y card is named Geralt lol
First car was “Big Blue,” then I had “Charlie Brown,” followed by an unnamed vehicle, and I currently drive “Tony.”
my first car was named Patience because you had to have patience if you wanted to go fast 😂
Sadie.  She just looked like a Sadie
Her name is Stella. ❤️
My car is orange and I have named her Monarch
I never named my car, but my daughter did. In her early talking days, our car was known as "Daddy Vroom" and my wife and I will still refer to it as such.
I just called her Baby. She was a good car and would’ve lasted so many more years, I just know it. But she was brutally murdered recently 😭 May she Rest In Peace
My car is named Tom Tom, also happy cake day!!
Ember! I love her 💜 She’s a little black car that’s got a lot more spark than anyone expects. I have to warn friends when I give them a ride that she picks up fast otherwise they get scared 😅 and happy cake day!
Fiona the Ford Focus. My old car was Viola the Pontiac Vibe.
I don’t have a name for my car now but my first car was a black civic coupe and I called it Goggles bc my license place had like GOG in it hehehe
I just realized I haven't named my current one!! My last two have been old blue and Betty White. But I don't have a name for my Ford Edge
My first car was Sue; she was a Subaru. My current car is Robin because she's robin's egg blue!
Her name is Isabella, but I call her Bella for short. She's a Fiat. :p
My car’s name is Lance. It’s a Lancer. I’m not always super creative lol.
I actually haven't named my current car yet and when I think about it I've only ever named the very first car I had.   My first car was an impala and it had two names. It was first named Keith and then changed to The Pimpala. 😂
Schrottteil.  Translate it if you want a vague description of my car.
Betsy but I don’t know why. 🤪
My SUV has a fin-like thing on the top (not sure what it's called) so I named mine Jaws.
Carya Stark
Toy Story
Serenity.  And it's packed full of Firefly merch lol.
Haven't named my current one but my old was Gipsy Danger!
Dopinder - Mr. Pool's ride
I just have an invisible boat mobile. (I don't drive)
My first car was Hogarth. The current one is Janet after The Good Place
I've never named any of my cars! My sister does though
Wade Wilson becase it's all black and red, a bit of a mess on the inside, and I don't name inanimate objects after females.
Hubs' old car was Rupert.  My old car, that Hubs isbnow driving, is Jericho.   My current car I've had since Sept and it's currently nameless. Nothing fits, but it may also be because I didn't really want this car so I don't feel like naming it.
Her name is Betsy!   Happy 🍰 day!
Happy Cake Day!!  Hmm our car doesn’t have a name...guess I should read some responses for inspiration!
My first car's name was Rosemary. She was a good car.
My truck had my boss's plates on it for a while because it took forever to get the title transferred in the pandemic. The new plates have LYR in them, so I named my truck LYRA.
Veronica Lane!  My last car was Winston Charles (RIP. You did a great job)  My first car was Ruth Claire (She was 22 years old when I got her... I hit a turtle and... she was done.)
Mia!   Cause it’s missing in action!
I have often tried to find a name for my vehicle.  I am open to suggestions.  Summer and winter [pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/uHwpcSr)

My car is named RiRi because she’s a bad bitch (Rihanna fan lol) It was my small red sporty car I’d always wanted, so I had to give her a fitting name haha

Welcome to todays thread! If you haven't been around before, here is a quick explanation for you to enjoy!  The Daily/Nightly thread is a place for you to enjoy the company of your fellow RAOAers in one place! This thread is for many awesome things such as:  * Spring cleaning in January * Planning naps * Eating Foodstuff * Doing Adult Stuff  Plus many more fun things!  So come on in, grab a blanket, and enjoy the company.  **QOTD: If you were a mediocre-hero, what would be your mediocre power?**
How y'all doing today?? I hope everyone is having a lovely day. Just finished reading two books - the sleep experiment and the silent patient. Didn't really like the ending of the sleep experiment😩I loved the silent patient. Such a good read   QOTD: my power would be pro parallel parker/reverse parker cuz I suckkkkk
Howdy friends! Happy Saturday.  Seriously, what the heck does Sus mean. Suspicious? Suspect? It makes no sense to me, probably because I’m old. Maybe y’all can explain.  I’ve been doing loads of spring cleaning which I found odd, but to see it mentioned as a real thing makes me not wanna do it anymore.   My mediocre power would be unlimited money for gifting, but I could only gift practical things.
Hi guys! i went to the doctor yesterday. It was my first time there and i was so happy to meet her. She was actively listening to me and offering solutions. i usually get this indifferent borderline pretentious look from doctors where they just casually dismiss everything i’m saying and then i leave without any solution and go home to just keep dealing with the problems. But she advised different vitamins, so i’ll be ordering those to help with this brain fog i get. 🤞🏽

Morning everyone. Trying to be productive today before the big game, I guess I’ll work out too. Shoulder day is hard.   QOTD: I’d help others digest lactose that can’t. They call me Lactaid man
Good morning.  Big snow storm here today. So that means staying inside and watching tv. Maybe some Journaling, or reading. Any suggestions on what to do today?
Goodmorning have a great Saturday we are gonna watch Wandavision today so I’m excited .
Pink is sus. Vote pink.
I just found out I'm pregnant. I cant tell anyone cause a) its too early and b) I don't know what to do. I'm so stressed about it cause I am not in a great financial situation but I just needed to tell somebody..
QOTD: I would snap my fingers and give people their perfect haircuts
I finished my book today! Wasn't a super long one, but it's the first I've been able to finish in a few months. I think I may try and make more car seat blankets soon. I think I have enough to make our peanut one and a friend of mine, hopefully. 🤞  I hope everyone has a great day!  QoTD: I'd like to think my carpet vacuumed.
Hope you all have a wonderful day
my mediocre power would be that all pets would let me pet them.  Healthier version on me January is going pretty well so far, hopefully it keeps up 🤞
I'm playing video games this morning while my husband plays pathfinder with his friends over zoom.
QOTD: Fire lasers from my eyes that are just normal, weak, laser-pointer lasers. I'd be a huge hit with cats!
nearly noon and more caffeine is needed, damn, or plan out a nap, what a great idea!  Quote of the Day : my mediocre power would be to roast garlic perfectly! but some of the time it burns and some of the time it's still hard
Happy Saturday everyone! I was able to catch up on some sleep this morning so I feel good. Hanging out with the baby all day. ☺️ She somehow got ahold of an ink pad I have for rubber stamps so her hands were covered in ink. And she’s at the ‘I’m gonna run away from you, you can’t catch me!’ stage, so I had to chase her around for a bit before she got little baby fingerprints on the white walls. 😂 At least it’s washable!   Also, as someone who always picks pink, pink isn’t sus! ☹️ The pink character in Along Us with the bat ears from Halloween is my go-to haha.
So glad it is the weekend.  Last load of laundry is in the dryer and just waiting for my husband so we can go to Costco (shudder).  I last went the week before Christmas and my mom picked up milk and bread at the corner store last week.  But now EVERYTHING is empty and I need to restock.  I have never gone with a list as long as the one I have.  We are in lockdown and have to stay home unless going to work, groceries or medical appointments, so I hope it isn't too busy.
zzz accidentally slept in until 2pm eeep! 🌸 fortunately it is the weekend so not much consequences than slight guilt and less clean up time! 💗 hoping that you all have a lovely day, don't forget to stay hydrated and remember that someone loves you! 🌸
Happy Saturday, y’all! I’m doing laundry at my mom’s house right now. And I did my grocery shopping this morning. I even picked up a new tree for my brush cherry eugenia bonsai forest. I love having productive days. How’s everyone else’s Saturday going?   QoTD: I feel like my mediocre power would be that I’m really good at making salads.
Okay, to whomever it was that suggested I buy the blow dryer brush off Amazon during Black Friday sales, thank you!!!! This is the first time I used it and it’s pretty freaking amazing! Thank you!  Thanks also go to u/mistermagellan for your advice last night. I used it. It seems to have worked. Today is much better for me.
I designed another cross stitch pattern today. Haven't decided whether to start stitching it today. I'm almost ready to publish the last pattern. I'm hoping this turns into a real side gig!   Also finished one part of a major crochet project.  Qotd: I AM a mediocre-hero! I can see things really close up with perfect clarity. (The trade-off is that it's because I am severely nearsighted.)
Yo. Worked today. Went home early because I’m still feeling bad. Gonna try to get to the doctor on Tuesday. That’s about all I got
QOTD: I'd like to be able to instant dry my hair after a shower. I hate hairdryers and wet hair takes forever to air dry.
Y’all the store was a chaotic mess today. So many call outs, people not there because they’re sick.   I was doing instacart orders for four hours with two phones because they had no one else. So shopping for two orders at a time, all while having to pull orders and run them out to people’s cars. Whew.   Self checkout kept crashing while I was stationed there for three hours during our rush hour.   And my last hour was on a register which went pretty smoothly and quick. So glad I have the next two days off.   I need a drink and a sleep 😂😂
It was a good day.   I found out about two friends who are expecting kiddos in June and August, I got the last thing picked up from my garage that I put online to give away, and I spent the afternoon with a friend! We went shopping, had delicious wings for dinner, and did a little more shopping.  After she left, I spent a little time with my husband before he went to game with friends and now I'm enjoying the last of my fire, my favorite show (Friends), and a beer before bed. :)  It was a good day.

That's because sweat glands in your armpits secrete more protein into a dark, damp environment—the perfect place and food for bacteria. # - **[Sharks can live for five centuries.](https://youtu.be/E9tpPWK7sag)** Greenland Sharks are known to be some of the oldest living animals in our world.

Good morning lovely people!! How's everyone's Saturday going so far? I have already shoveled 2" of snow off the driveway this morning. Now I really need to do the dishes but really don't want to.
I'm happy to have my car and power back on! This weekend I'll have to work on grocery shopping since everything went bad!
QOTD: My mediocre super power would be bringing all the laundry to the laundry basket and I would share it with the world.  I’d close my eyes and poof! socks and pants and shirts and skirts across the globe would magically appear in whatever designated area they belong in.   What y’all doing today?    I just finished an acupuncture appointment.  Going to get the main area of my house clean and then finish *Night Stalker: A Hunt for a Serial Killer* on Netflix.
Hey friends! I'm still dog sitting today. More doggy cuddles and tail wags! <3   QOTD: My mediocre power would be to grow fruit and veggie plants just enough that they would yield enough produce for exactly 1 salad a day (I don't have a green thumb irl, I try so hard, but all my plants die).
Happy Saturday everyone! I've got some beans in the crockpot, and now I'm waiting for Instacart to deliver the meat that Walmart was apparently our of when they shopped my order today.  I'm looking forward to hanging out with my husband and dog today. I'm hoping it's a boring, stress-free day 🥰  QOTD: my mediocre superpower would be the ability to put any USB in correctly on the first try 😂
I would want my mediocre super power to be to help everyone sleep comfortably/enough/healthily.   I shared this group with my mum. She loves the Christmas exchange every year but that's the only thing she knows about Reddit so far. 😊
QOTD: Ability to find my way home now matter how lost I am. No other innate sense of direction, just able to find my way back home.
HI EVERYONE I WOKE UP EARLY at 5:30 and watched youtube and got up on time and took my meds and vitamins and now i'm studying before Ineed to get dressed and go to work in an hour I FEEL PRODUCTIVE gonna ride this highhhhh
Hi everyone!   There is finally snow here!!!  I don't know for how long or how much but it looks magical, I love it!  Our lockdown got extended so I'll be doing classes online still and no internship.  I'll be babysitting my little sister again for the 3rd week in a row now! Let's hope this week will be a great one :)  My little sister has been having a lot of anxiety and problems and I'm very worried. She was so scared of car rides and everything that can go wrong going wrong.. My mom took her to a friend who did like a cleansing thing or something that made her bad energy go away. I don't really believe in that kind of stuff but if it works, it works!  How has everyone been?
My mediocre power would be getting rid of my own headaches because i have sinus issues
QOTD: cooking decent homemade meals  &#x200B;  Hi everyone.
I’m finally putting laundry away this morning and getting the fans clean. I’ve had some weird spurts for cleaning the last few days.
QoTD - stop dropping stuff. I’m a butter fingers.   Happy Saturday all! Absolutely nothing planned for the day except some house keeping type stuff. I have a thank you post to do, too.   I hope you all have a lovely day! ❤️
Happy Saturday friends. I've had a cleaning binge then settled down to rewatch a series
Morning friends! It’s a lazy day today. Not leaving my house for any reason. Might clean some stuff, who knows!?   I’ve been feeling so blah this week and it sucks. It’s just sad week I guess.  QOTD: exact distance guessing. It’s part of my job so I’m already very good at it lol
Spring cleaning? Never heard of it.   &#x200B;  QOTD: My mediocre power would be helping people use Google instead of Bing. Hey, I still save them from something right?
Yessssss finally got my hair cut and love it! It feels so much better
[here’s a cute video for you guys! ](https://imgur.com/a/iMo6xDa)  Hope it makes your Saturday Happy!!!!
Hello.
Hi everyone! Today I had planned on going on a hike with my friend today, but the roads iced last night, so we had to cancel. :( Instead I've been working on taking pictures for my shop and cleaning up my room today. I think I'll journal and/or draw a bit in a minute.   I hope you all have a great day today. Remember, someone loves you! <3
Happy Saturday, Marshmallows!  Hope everyone is having an awesome day!
I wouldn't say I did spring cleaning but for some reason I had the urge to clean the cat bowls, the curtain in the kitchen, the table, and the window sill... Lol  I hope everyone is having a fantastic Saturday!   QOTD: hmm, snap my fingers and all of the house would be clean 😅
if you like nutella, come enter my contest!   i don’t think it’s showing up on the timeline 😅  EDIT: [Here’s the updated contest! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kyrixb/contest_do_you_want_some_nutella/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
D&D themed day for me. Printing minis, painting minis and then I'll draw a new map before my game tonight.   QOTD: My talent would be mixing colors and complimenting colors. Don't take wardrobe advice from me though. XD
I'm in an organization mood. Baby girl's toys and books are now all tidy in the living room. Well, at least the ones she plays with. I like to keep her toy selection simple.   I also cleaned out her dresser. She only wears a few items so I'm getting rid of the rest. Plus I'll have to get her the next size up soon and I want to keep it minimal. I actually told my mom no when she said she was going to go get her more clothes. The baby doesn't need them -we don't go anywhere!  We've also cleaned the fish tank. We're taking out the recycling. We've done lots of laundry.   It's been a busy but productive day!
My local Shell station has a ton of rare energy drinks, and I'm just living.
I talked to my bf's mom yesterday. She said, word in their country is no travel, now, until 2022 ...  I did not want to hear that. It sucked all the air out of my lungs.
QOTD: I have telekinetic powers, but only for moving small objects short distances.  I can move your pen three inches to the left of where you set it down, or knock your keys to the floor.
What is a "pink is (sus)" ?
We had a special treat of Korean corn dogs and ice cream for dinner tonight! I’m very satisfied right now. 😋
3 good things today:  1. It's now officially my birthday! Yay!!!  2. Talked with fam over Discord. It was nice!  3. I'm now down 13.5 lbs in under 6 weeks! Woo!  ACCOMPLISHMENT: stayed on my diet even though I didn't want to haha! (I do intermittent fasting and I wanted to eat tonight SO badly!)  VALUE PROVIDED: helped bro in law mod Fallout: New Vegas.
Good morning everyone! Got coffee, have travel coffee and looking at getting my hair cut then laundry and other adulting things to do.
Good morning, everyone!  I hope you have a good day!! I'm working today and once again don't have food. It's going to be a fun one. Staying positive!!!!!  Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need a friend!!
Good morning everyone! Unfortunately got a headache last night that's still lingering into today, but I'm trying my best to ignore it and stay positive. Going to try to listen to my body and just spend the day relaxing and doing fun activities rather than chores or errands. Hoping you all have a wonderful Saturday!  QOTD: My mediocre power would be speedwalking.
QOTD: I would be a shapeshifter. But I could only shapeshift into creatures that are relatively harmless. Featuring moves like: Ferret wiggle!! Hummingbird flutter! And possum-play-dead! Fear me!!  I got all my college work done for this week early, so now I get the weekend to relax! Trying to stay on top of things and even work ahead a little. Any one else have any fun plans for the weekend? I got some fresh salmon to make for dinner tomorrow, I’m pretty excited for that!
Happy Saturday y’all! I hope everyone is having a lovely day 💛  QoTD: my mediocre superpower would be to help any crying babies on planes. I would be able to help them instantly feel soothed/stop crying!
Happy Saturday everyone. Hope you have an awesome day
Hi all!! Happy weekend!! How is everyone?? I’m in the middle of a snowstorm right now!!
Today was just one of those days which I want to avoid, got nothing done. Still it's only the 16th day of 365, I can do it.  QOTD prep vegetables/cooking items with the snap of a finger 🙂.. my contribution in helping others prepare food.
Hey guys. My brain has been weird. Gotta pay some doctor bills and whatever. Clean the apartment. Make sure Mr 6 gets some school work done.  QotD- My mediocre super power would be not procrastinating and actually accomplishing tasks
QOTD: being able to eat anything and keep my weight. I feel like eventually I would just get bored of snacking too much and just eat regular sized meals but still be able to indulge when I wanted.  So today I came to work at 8am and my co-Manager just called to let me know she wouldn’t be able to close since she’s really sick, meaning I’ll be here till 10 pm tonight. Wish me luck!
QOTD: I would be unable to trip over things.
i had to go get my blood ~~stolen~~ tested today and i only sobbed the whole time because of anxiety, but not beforehand so thats better than expected!  qotd: i can tell you the time correctly, all the time.
I think I’d be really good at opening can lids.  Morning !!! Feeling tired again today. Hope you all have an amazing day!!!! Remember to stretch a little and get up from your seat! Take a few steps. Drink some water. Ily all 💓
QOTD: I’d be nail polish woman and be able to make nail polish dry instantly and not chip.   What’s everyone’s plans for today? I have none. I just need to make lunch later, which I really don’t feel like doing. And of course the cleaning and laundry never end. I just want to be lazy!
Happy Saturday! Today is the day we get things off the to do list! The kids will not be happy about, but I need the house back in order for my sanity.
Has anyone watched the new WandaVision show on Disney+? Thoughts?
QOTD: Laundry folding at the snap of my fingers.  Happy Saturday 💙 Hope you are all doing well!! Big Hugs!!
Gotta top off the groceries and do some house cleaning. No cardio today but gotta lift some weights for a bit. Which I need to add in more so hopefully I'll adjust it to where it does more for me. I was gonna make cheese ravioli for dinner but Idk if that's gonna happen for sure now. What is everyone else up to?
Mediocre power eh. Talk to plants.  I mean could be useful as like a detective and plant care but not much else.
I did a lot of cleaning because we had the power go out for almost two days.   [I don't think the fridge has been that empty forever.](https://imgur.com/gallery/R4mlzyi)  I really want to get back into making sourdough bread, but I shouldn't bake while I'm still a plague carrier.
I'm so close to finishing knitting this sweater and every time I sit down to work on the neck, something interrupts. The dog wants out (like 4 or 5 different times throughout the day, still managed to finish the sleeve despite him), the cat wants to snuggle, the kitten snuck into a room and I closed the door and she wants out now that I touched my project, the Roomba got stuck.   4 more rounds and some ends to weave in.
Good evening, friends.  I slept most of the day today.  I think I might be getting sick?  I dunno, I just feel kinda crappy.  But I've been feeling like this (though not as severe) since before I got tested for covid a few weeks ago, so it's probably not that.  I dunno.  I probably won't go to the doctor, since I dropped my last one.  It wasn't working out.
Spring cleaning in January is exactly how I have spent this past week. So excited. I also received a vanilla bean orchid and I am over the moon. I have been reading all about it. I’m about to turn my bathroom Into a grow room for vanilla. I am about to order all the things I need from amazon! I am thinking about painting my room grey while my husband is out of town. I turned 35 last week and all the sudden my interior design skills showed back up. Hopefully my husband likes it. Kiddo is having a blast having an airsoft weekend. Getting lots of pictures. It is crazy that he is so grown. I hope everyone has had a great day!
Qotd: the ability to glide.... Cant fly, just glide. I will call myself... The glider.  Today was a weird day. I was suppose to get my stimulus check in the mail... My email said it was in the mailbox yesterday.... It wasnt. I go check it today, still not there. The usps lady told me to contact the other usps office... Why bitch, this is my post office, my po box is here!!  Im not too angry just confused. Why would i get an email with a picture of the envelope and its not there? Seems a little sus to me. 😂
I am currently hiding under many blankets and trying to find ways to get a broken charger out of my iPad.  Otherwise my week was really good. My fancy mask came and I feel really cool in it.
Ugh so much adult stuff!!  We are thinking about making big life moves this year!! Possibly selling the house and moving (again!) and leaving my job and doing travel contracts for a while!! Time to start selling everything!
I just have 300 more words to write and I'll be "done" the first draft of my essay! I'm so close, then I can go to sleep and relax until my bf proofreads it for me. I misread some of the instructions which specifies using "I" and reflecting on things which has made things much easier as now I can reflect on all the things I've mentioned. I'm also just telling myself "a pass is a pass" because I did pretty well on the first essay and it's just a pass/fail situation so I shouldn't stress as much.  Also extra excited because yesterday my library just got a bunch new ebooks and several were ones I'd recommended so once I'm finished the essay I'll be spoilt for choice regarding what to read next!
How's everyone doing this evening? I'm settling in watching the newest season of Disenchantment. It fills the void Futurama left pretty well!
Hope everyone is having a good night and my super power would be making people feel empathy .
ayyyyy among us reference!!! everyone needs to let me know asap if they play among us so we can all play together. :D
If I was a hero, my power would be to detect when people who I can help need my help
QotD: Whenever I push my shopping cart into the cart catch, it will always go in perfectly straight and/or interlock with the cart in front of it in such a way that the next person who goes to use it doesn't have to struggle to get the two carts separated.  This past week has been kind of a nightmare for my health (all temporary things I brought upon myself, so no worries there); fingers crossed that this upcoming week is boring in comparison.
Today is tough. Please send hugs and photos of your stuffies ):
For months, my toddler has fallen asleep on the couch at night and I'd carry him to bed. The past few weeks, he's been fighting sleep. Two nights ago, I'd had it, so I handed the baby over to my husband and took the toddler to bed and laid down with him. He was out within 3 minutes. Last night, same thing. Tonight, my husband is busy, so I figured I'd just patiently wait it out. Finally, the toddler said "This isn't how it works, Mom. We go to my bed now." So, I walked in and asked of he wanted me to lay with him. He told me "No, you're holding the baby. Just sit with me." And was asleep within minutes.  I guess a new routine has been born. ❤
Migraine central again. Surprisingly, I was able to rest today and just relax instead of GOGOGOFASTERFASTERGOGOGO marathon cleaning lol. My mom and her kicks these days. u/LoverOLife if it’s not baking it’s cleaning hahaha. But at least she was reasonable!
Happy Saturday!  I'm currently watching my toddler carry individual potatoes and onions across my parent's house and hand them to my mom.   Kids are so weird!  I am feeling accomplished today because I finally got my fish tank planted and it's in the process of cycling.  Haven't done any testing on the parameters yet but I seeded the filter from my other tank and have some ammonia which I'll start tomorrow so I'm hoping to be able to add fish and frogs within a couple weeks.   [Here's my day 1 progress pictures. ](http://imgur.com/gallery/2gDSpzf)  QOTD: I'd be able to make the dishes magically be done all the time just by thinking about it.
Turning 21 on Jan 17 :D so happy!
QOTD: My mediocre power would be - being able to fold and put away clothes by just throwing them where I want them.   Today I have had a major lazy day with my daughter, I made waffles for myself & fiance. Thats been the excitement of my day 😂. If anyone has any good recipes for a waffles maker let's me know 🙋🏼‍♀️.  Also joining this group and seeing how friendly everyone has been. Iv been very lonely since having my daughter now I feel like I have met a whole group of friends ❤.   Hope everyone else's day has been more exciting lol.
Finally going back to work this week. I was out for two weeks because I needed to take two covid tests! My job shutdown. Gave me a little time to get together clothes for baby Ashers nursery in April. 3 months he will be here!! As for a mediocre power, snapping my fingers after a shower and I’m dried off and dressed lol.
Still in bed but I finished The Dutch House. It was fine  lol Anyone have any books of thoughtful or philosophical magical realism they'd like to share?   I'm waiting for my best friend to wake up and come play w me for my birthday weekend. I have a small bottle of Prosecco but going to see if I can convince her to walk to World Market with me (right by my house) to buy a couple bottles of beer. I haven't had beer in like...more than a year? And want one. I try not to go out but I've got serious Covid fatigue. I'll double mask it.
Happy saturday guys! I just arrived home after half a year abroad so i am able to spend time with my family. Wish everyone else similar happiness!
My mediocre power would be the ability to tie my laces on my first try 😂
Chewing is getting easier to do! Maybe I'll try buttered toast for breakfast since I miss bread so much
I would be hindsight woman, id pop in and give people clarity after tragic events
I've actually been productive today.   Can't vacuum because sleeping roomies, but that's okay.  Still got my laundry done plus cleaning and groceries ordered.  And my family is coming to visit on the 22nd!!! Yay!  I miss them so much.    I'm hoping my hubby and I can get a dinner out without the kid, and I think I'll give both of them their Valetine's gifts early.  &#x200B;  As for the rest of the day...  I feel a little depressed.  I was thinking about coloring my hair, but I don't think I'll manage today.    I need more introvert time. >.<     My mediocre superpower would be coloring hair any color at will.
QOTD- my mediocre power would be to make people feel well rested, because that’s just such a good feeling. 🥰
This morning started off on the wrong foot - we locked ourselves out of the house! Luckily we had baby girl with us - if she had been locked inside it would have been the first time she decided to crawl or something. But we called my parents, who came over to unlock the door. I think I'll make several copies of the key and leave them with various people. Just in case. Haha.   But then I got to go to my meeting and it was wonderful!
Teething is a b, y’all. (Idk what kind of language we’re allowed to use in here.)
QotD: My mediocre power as a mediocre heroine would allow me to cook pasta just right every time! It's so easy to barely undercook or barely overcook pasta of any kind! 30 seconds too soon and the noodles are too tough to chew... 10 seconds too late and they're all mush!

QOTD: I'd be able to change wiring in a plug.
u/Zeunicorn 😏
Got back from grocery shopping. Really gonna have to start enforcing the, "no grocery shopping while hungry," rule. It used to be a lot easier cuz I eat lighter earlier in the day so I can save up for a filling dinner and get my cardio and workouts done. But stores used to be open later and I could grocery shop at midnight. Which I preferred because it wasn't utter chaos every time I went into the store. *Sigh*  I got some simply cheetos jalapeno cheddar cheese puffs yesterday...only to buy a bag of Doritio 3d spicy ranch chips...and I got a lemon pie a few days ago I've yet to fit into a daily budget but that didn't stop me from buying two boston creme pies and a strawberry and creme one 😂   Did find some basic long sleeves on clearance though which was nice. As I thought, raviolis are not happening for dinner because Tyler's grandparents brought us some delicious Taco Bell! But unfortunately I'll go over on my sodium if I make raviolis for later haha maybe next week. All my exercise is done. Now I just gotta do the weekly cleaning list.   How is everyone tonight?
QOTD my power is brining to many snacks
My mediocre superpower is listening. So many lonely sad or bored family and friends just need someone to hear them. I will call myself the “Empath”  I’m hear if you need to talk. 💕
I AM DOWN TO TWO BOXES LEFT TO UNPACK!!!! (And I have way too many Funkos).  QOTD: Being able to tell what someone is feeling, but not able to influence them. Then I'd have to use whatever personality I have to help them out.
My favourite hockey team won tonight and played so well so I’m very happy!
Yay for no sleep 🙄  On the plus side, I've made some great progress in my goal to binge watch all of the Hobbit/LOTR movies 🤷‍♀️
u/nacho_cheezus yellow sus 🔪
Good morning!!! GF donut time sandwiched by yin yoga sessions 🧘🏻‍♀️🥰🥰🥰🍩🍩🍩😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰💕
Hello! Did I miss it? Its very late here in Scotland so I suppose I might have to catch the evening thread before bed. I have had a lazy day and then I went shopping and picked up some new diet books!  QOTD - the ability to freeze time but only for three seconds. Maybe Ill drop things less.
Maybe it's because I've acepted that I'm going to be in this apartment for the next several years, but I suddenly have the urge to decorate the place. I'm talking garland, wreaths, fairy/string lights, maybe some incense or something...I just want it so bad now...  QOTD: I could make mediocre sandwiches with my mind
Qotd: Converting one food into another
Happy Saturday everyone!!!!!!!  It’s been a lay in the couch and watch tv kind of day and it feels amazing!  QOTD: I think my mediocre power would have to be the ability to tell Dad (or in my case Mom) jokes on command.
Hi! How do I make an intro?
Dream power. I always misjudge how much space I have behind me.
Oooh I also want that power. I'm terrible at that. When I was 20 and dumb I asked a stranger to parallel park my car for me when I was downtown one time because I kept trying and couldn't do it 🤣😭
I've heard really really good things about The Silent Patient. I gotta check it out.
I read The Sleep Experiment not too long ago. It was decent for the most part but I couldn't stand the main character. I guess it was kind of intentional but yeah haha
It’s beyond my time too but from Reddit I think it means suspicious! Gotta keep up on the lingo 😅
It means suspicious.  It comes from the game Among Us.  You play crew members on a spaceship, trying to complete tasks.  One or several of the crew members are actually imposters, who try to kill other crew members or sabotage things.  You periodically vote to kick people off, and the crew members can discuss who they suspect in chat.  To save time (and because it's often played on mobile), people will often say a certain crew member is "sus" if they suspect them of being the impostor.
I also had to ask what it was , because I'm old. I also said "twittering" yesterday when talking to someone 10+ years younger. I'm not old, but I'm old 🤣
Congratulations on having a good doctor. Glad your getting answers
That’s so awesome that you found a great doctor! I had one like that a few years ago but I moved out of state and miss her so much! Need to find a new doctor.
Having a doctor that listens makes a huge difference! I drive an hour to see mine because she is worth it!   I hope these vitamins work out for you 💛
I'm so happy your doctor is listening. That can make a world of difference
Happy birthday 🎊🎁🎂🎈🎉
Happy birthday! 🎂😊
Happy birthday 🥳🎂🎁
Happy birthday to my birthday triplets u/unknownpotter and u/cynmart456  And thank you everyone for the greetings 😊
Happy Birthday u/unknownpotter, u/cynmart457 Hope you have a great day. 🎶🎂🎁🎈
Happy birthday to u/unknownpotter, u/cynmart457 and u/sammy0h. Make a wish!
Happy Birthday!!
Happy birthday you guys!!
Happy birthday!
You've got this!!
Good luck with the workout!!
I'm excited for the big game too! And, that would be an awesome mediocre super power!
The Dairy Whisperer <3
Journaling sounds great! I'm planning to do that later today as well. What are you reading currently?
Sounds like a great opportunity to make chili or homemade soup.
You should have an indoor picnic! Make a few picnic foods (or chili as suggested earlier), set put a blanket and some pillows, put on some fun nature sounds, and pretend it's a beautiful day outside while you eat and journal indoors.
Go outside and make snow angles and a snow dog! ❄️
I don't make a ton of book recommendations because everyone has different tastes, but I'm reading a middle grades series with my kids: Greenglass House, by Kate Milford.  It's so cozy, talks a lot about hot chocolate and winter weather.  It's a nice, easy, cozy read.
Happy Saturday!
Oooh nice!!!
Oh yeah! I don't have Disney+ yet, but can't wait until I can watch it too. I'm pretty excited.
From someone who had to make a tough choice in your position before you are welcome to message me anytime to vent your thoughts out or if you need any advice 💜💜💜
Hugs!   Just remember, if you were to try to plan things for that perfect time, you might just miss it.   I hope the best for you! Feel free to vent to me if you need to.
I'm not really sure what I could say that could help but I really wish the best for you and hope everything works out easily for you!
I've got nothing for the financial side of your situation, but as someone who's lost 6 pregnancies, it's never "too early" to tell people.  If they're important enough to hear the good news, then you're important enough to be supported through the bad news.  /hugs
CONGRATULATIONS!!! i know it's super scary, but maybe you can pick up a side hustle?
If you ever get this power please give me my perfect haircut 😂.
I like this one a lot!!
God I love this idea lol
Haha. I wish my carpet vacuumed itself.
Woohoo go you! That's great :D Which book was it? Have a great Saturday!
Ooh, good choice of superpower. I'd like to invite you over then!
I hope you do too!!
I hope you do too.
Same for you!
not a bad mediocre power!  Our guinea pigs doubt you, though.
Best super power!
Gimme some of that power. Most pets like me a lot, I must smell like meatballs. But there are some, and wild ones who don’t. Boo.
Fun! What are you playing today?
Ugggh I wish I was playing Pathfinder 😭 Haven't gotten to play all year!
I haven’t played video games in so long that I fantasize about it daily 😂 What a great way to unwind on breaks while working 24/7
Yea, think of all the cats. People would think you were a cat god.
Oooooh the cats would love you. 😂 That’s a badass superpower haha!
I've never actually roasted garlic...I think maybe I should try! Coffee or tea for caffeine?
Sounds like some great sleep!! Have a great Saturday, lovely! 💜
Sometimes you just need those sleepy days! I hope the rest of your day is just as relaxing
Everyone deserves a day where they get to sleep super late! 😀 Hope your day was good! 💕
Yay for productive days! What’s your favorite salad to make?
Ooooh that sounds nice!!!
I'm so glad to hear you're doing better. Please keep posting if you ever have rough days! I can't do much, but always happy to chat and pm :)
That was me who recommended you get it during Black Friday! I'm so glad you're enjoying it! It's by-far my favorite hair tool ever!!
Hello fellow crafter! Have you maintained your motivation through lockdowns?
Good luck! It would be super cool if you got to do it as a kind of job you really enjoyed!
I have a similar power!  Like, close up, I can read super small things.  Far away, zip without glasses.
I hope you start feeling better soon!
I hope you feel better!
Hope you feel better soon!
Good luck getting to the doctor soon! Take it easy as much as possible until then!
Oh this one would be nice!
Saaaame. My hair usually takes forever to dry!
That would be a wonderful power to have!
😬 that sounds like a total shit show. Enjoy your next two days off lol
Jesus.  Go have yourself a stiff drink and a hot bath, you've absolutely earned it.
Yikes! Good job and glad your day is over!
You I deserve an award. Not kidding. I tip my grocery and shoppers as much as possible because they are doing what I cannot. Be safe and yes, sleep!
❤️🤣
Your so funny haha love the jokes
This is awesome!
Loving the shark facts!
Wild fun facts about sweat
2" of snow?? cool! I moved down to Florida from New Jersey recently and miss snow a lot! Sounds like you are having a productive morning!
It's going good!! Tired as all heck! How are you?!
So jealous of your snow! It's near 50 here today with 84% humidity.
Yay!!! Congratulations!!!
I'm glad your power is back on!! I'm sorry all your food went bad. Yay for grocery shopping!
Ugh that's the worst, but at least your power is back yay!
Oh no sorry you lost your food
Good power! How do you like acupuncture? I used to go for a bit but never could get comfortable with it, even though my practitioner was actually really nice and gentle.
I love that power!! I can grow plants but they never produce enough that I can make a salad out of them 😅 Unless I just wanted tomatoes. We had so many tomatoes this summer, I started letting the dog eat the right off the plant so they wouldn’t go to waste
Have a great day with the doggy! Sounds fun. Aw love that power! This way you don't have so much you don't know what to do with and just enough to eat a tasty meal.
Did you take pictures of the doggy to show us tho 👀
Yes! The crockpot is amazing!!
Walmart is the only place that has Blueberry Special K 😭 And that’s sad because I try to avoid going in there. Most people in my town refuse to wear masks like it’s going to give them superpowers.
Here's to an easy day!   We all need your superpower :D
That superpower sounds super useful to me 😅
That's a good one
Thats awesome! I hope you have a good day 😊
I am so jealous of your snow! Pls send some my way!!
We're also in lockdown here in the UK so I feel you. I'm jealous of the snow you have. We hardly get any snow here in London, it's mostly up north.
Snow is my magic too. It’s not sticking here, just blowing sideways, but I love to watch it fall so I’m happy.
This one gets my vote. I have the worst sinus issues.
Me too. It must be the moon, or some weird planetary thing that I don’t believe in making us all nest.
I’m ashamed to admit how old I was when I learned you could disassemble a fan to clean it.   No one ever taught me that....
Me too!
I hope you have a lovely day tooooo!!!
Same, housework never ends. Have a great day!
Have a good day
Happy Saturday!! 🧘🏻‍♀️💞🥰
And then go play football or baseball and be the best receiver/catcher ever!
Ooh what series?
I hope you have a good day!!! I'm here if you need a friend!
That’s actually a legitimately awesome talent and I’m jealous lol. I ran cross country in high school so you’d figure I’d be able to measure a mile, right!? Nope.
Haha omg bing is the worst!! Please save the bing users they haven't seen the light
Yay! That after-haircut feeling is the best!💇🏻‍♀️
I need a haircut badly. So jealous lol
😍😍😍
awww 🌸
So cute!!!!
hello! 🌸 happy saturday!
Hi!
Hi! 👋🏼
Way to make the best of your weather related change of plans!! Great attitude :)
happy saturday, hope that you get to go hiking soon! 🌸
Have a happy Saturday!
So far so good...been moderately productive so feeling good about that! Hope your day is great!
I hope you are too!
That would be a great superpower
That would be my dream super power!!!
You just reminded me I need to clean my dog's bowls 👀   ...*pretends to forget*
You mean Cocaine!!? **[I Absolutely Love Nutella!!!](https://media3.giphy.com/media/26vzi1X2BQ9zrmnsNm/giphy.gif)** You can't comprehend how an addict I am,  1 kg all by myself its finished in 2 weeks.   I'm just like **[her ](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcShQkWehnOXRz_HqdAA-TTxhJFTFx7BNe-hDQ&usqp=CAU)** LOL!
Resisting the contest, because Nutella is dangerous in my home. 😆
It says it’s been removed!
I wish I could do that with my food choices haha keep it simple. I don't eat enough in a day to justify how much is crowding my pantry closet ._. Good job being productive today :)
ooo what kind?
Rare? Like what kind? Or is that the name?
I haven't had an energy drink in a looooong time 👀 I kinda miss them
Oh no, I’m so sorry. 😞
I'm sorry hun :( that's extremely disappointing news
It's a reference to the game Among Us.  In that game, you play as crew members on a spaceship trying to complete tasks.  One or more players are impostors, though, trying to sabotage the ship and kill other crew members.  Periodically meetings are held where players can discuss who they think is the impostor and vote someone off.  Since many people play on mobile and you have limited time, "sus" is often used as shorthand for suspicious.
Yummy!! Should have had melona bars to wash it down with 😂❤️
Korean corn dogs sound interesting!
Happy birthday 🎂!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND CONGRATS ON THE WEIGHT LOS!!!
Yay!!!!! Happy Birthday and great job!!!!!!!!
Happy Birthday 🎂 I hope you have a fabulous day!
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
That sounds like a nice day :) enjoy!
Good morning! Have a good day!
Good morning, my dear! Why don't you have food? Can you go to the store and get seaweed again?
Oh no :( Hope you don't get too hungry and that you have an OK day.
I hate those headaches. I hope it goes away soon. Have a great day!!!
Good morning! I hope that your headache eases soon. A day of relaxation sounds like a good remedy 💖
Hope your headache goes away!
I share your superpower. I can speed walk with the best of them but I can’t run for anything.
That power is more than mediocre! You’d be the most popular superhero ever!
Happy Saturday to you and hope your Saturday is amazing as well!!!
Hope you have an awesome day!!
Happy weekend to you!!!  Snow sucks.
Stay safe!
You'd be THE SOUS CHEF. You'd probably make bank being in super high demand at literally every restaurant!
Chopping and prepping is the bane of my existence with cooking, I like your choice
I dunno I feel that could potentially lead to an incredibly powerful super power. Imagine if you used that power to not procrastinate on working out or learning martial arts or studying advanced technology.
I’d take that power. Calorie counting blows and I have poor self control when I’m hungry. Not for bad foods so much, just anything and it always puts me over my calorie count.
Are my own feet included?! Because i might want that power.
Um that’s a damn good superpower 😂
Lots of people are stressed by blood draws.  You're not alone.  (I prefer drawing blood on people who are intubated and sedated for this reason.)
Thanks for the reminder on drinking water. I need it!!
Hope you had a good day! 💕
As someone who struggles with nail polish I would love this power for you to bestow on me
You got this!
Nope but now i have something to watch later!
Tbf, you can talk to them now lol they just can't talk back.
at least you have jelly to put on that bread when you're well again!
At least it's something positive out of an irritating situation! Are you planning on giving the bread away or keeping it for yourself? I can't imagine it would hurt too much if you're the only one eating it!
Are you in PNW? We had to dump all of our stuff. One of our friends had their neighbors tree come down and knock their entire fence down and strip the power lines with it. They’ll be out of power for 3 weeks 😢
You're so close to done though! Sorry everything keeps stopping you!
Good evening! I hope you find a new doctor soon that is good for you! Feel better!
bleh, i'm sorry you feel crappy. i think you just need to rest. have you been sick lately/had covid?
Have loads of fun redecorating! I bet it's gonna look awesome when you're done!
Gargoyles could only glide and they were super cool.
That's a little weird for sure. I hate how much of a mess it's been for so many people! Hope you get yours soon!
\*faaaaaaaaaaaart\*  who?  oh wow...  \*waddles away\*
Hope you can get it fixed soon!
Sounds like big life changes! Exciting!
Good luck with it! It sounds like you're well prepared and will do well!
I hope you're done with it by now!! :D
I play!! I’d love that!
Love your super power. Feel better soon!
Hugs!
Sending good thoughts your way \*hugs\*
All the hugs to you 🤗🫂💛
Sending over love and hugs 🧡
Hugs!! I hope you feel better :(
*hugs*  Will dog pictures work too? [Here's Zeus](http://imgur.com/a/q9o9lGR)
[Hugs to you. ](https://imgur.com/a/j2tKqEB)Lots and lots of them!   Ooo and a picture of my little dragon Squishmallow, [Desmund.](https://imgur.com/a/kMswsVS)
I often think about how we try to make kids so sleep independent but some of us really enjoy sleeping beside someone. So they all have to relearn how to sleep when they find someone.
Awwwwwww
okay that is ADORABLE.
I think your mom would drive me crazy 😜.   But I guess your not bored!  I’m sorry you have a migraine again. What are you doing to take care of yourself?
Idk how to not be in that gogogo mood most of the time lol like I can't even do much now while laundry and dishes are running and I want the house to be cleanest tomorrow before we start back to work...so no point in doing floors right now. Ugh lol   Hope your migraine goes away soon!
Has your toddler seen pearl onions yet? We had a bag last month and mine became obsessed with these "baby onions" and took them everywhere. I'm still finding them around the house.
HEY! Happy birthday!! It's my birthday toooo!!! Weeeee!
Happy birthday 🎂!!
awwww happy birthday!!! i hope you have a good time. :D
Happy Birthday!!!
Happy birthday!
Waffles sound amazing! I had yogurt but now I wish I'd had waffles lol. Feel free to reach out whenever you feel lonely and want to chat :D
Joy of cooking cookbook has a great waffle recipe
You can make healthy "chaffles" (cheese waffles) with zucchini, broccoli, or cauliflower
oh wow enjoy!!
I hope you can eat the toast!!!
I, too, need more introvert time and am thinking of coloring my hair.  I ordered a rose gold conditioning wash?  i think that's what it's called?  I got some teal for my daughter.  We will see how it goes.    so, with your mediocre power in mind, what color would your hair be right now?
That is a great power!
now that's a super power!
So you’d essentially be an Inn in World of Warcraft. But would they have to go inside you to get the buff, or could they just touch you?
So happy you got back in quickly! When my oldest was a toddler, he locked himself in the bathroom with the lights off. Not nearly as dramatic, but i did have to shoulder the door open and there were a lot of tears on his part.
Oh damn. What a terrible way to start the day. I’m glad you got back in!
you can say whatever the fuck you want too here! although i typically dont swear a ton anyway in writting, but like a sailor if im speaking out loud.   are you teething or a child?
18+ sub so you can swear if you wanna.
Use all the colorful words.
Fuck is my personal favorite!
Oof my daughter is teething too and today was a tough day for her. One of those whining at everything because I can’t tell you want I want days too. 😩 Good luck!
That’s a unique power!
That’s sus (And gay) bud
Sitting on my ample ass with a box of mango mochi and being glad for the 3-day weekend.  Work has been a complete dumpster fire and we're resuming our hybrid schedule on Tuesday.  I wish we'd just stay virtual the rest of the year.
Shopping while hungry is always a terrible idea 😂
I used to always follow the "no shopping while hungry" but I found out it actually works the opposite for me! When I'm hungry I'm super picky about what I want to eat, while when I'm not hungry I'll buy lots of snacks because "I might want that later".
that is totally not mediocre at all, we need more listeners. ♥
oof! how many funkos do you have? i have over 200, i stopped counting. xDD
owwwwww that sounds sooooo awesome! 💜 have fun!
That ability would be great for pulling tiny pranks.
We only do daily threads on weekends 🙂
Oh what's the most interesting looking book you picked up?
I definitely recommend doing this and making it your home :) it may not be your forever home obviously but like...have fun with it! Whenever I move into someplace new, this time my old room at my parents house, I hang up wall art, fairy lights, shelves and basically put as many holes in the walls as possible to make it feel like mine because I want it to feel like a sanctuary from the outside world. :)
You def should! Maybe check out Hobby Lobby or TJ Maxx to find some discounted stuff to do it!
Might as well make wherever you're living feel like home :-)
Go for it!  Kenna Sato has GREAT vinyl wall decals on her etsy shop -- I've used them in every apartment I've lived in over the last five years.
Decorate it up!
Would the food retain its original nutritional value?  For example could you turn a green smoother into chocolate cake but be as healthy as a green smoothie?
Hello and welcome. Click close out of this chat then go to the top of the page and read Subreddit Info this will guide you through everything you need to know.   Hope this helps. : )
Just make a text post titled [Intro] and tells us about yourself.
Me too, and even sideways too, I had to retake my driving test several times becuase I couldn't parallel park within three feet of the curb!
Lol I wouldn't put it pass me to do that as well!! I often just leave it parked badly if no one is nearby to help me xD
Yes read it you won't regret it🙌
Omg yes yes yes me too I hated him!! He sounded soooo stuck up from the start. I wanted to get his head ripped off so bad
I lived through “fleek” with my teenagers, and now here we are with this one. Every generation of old people go through this, don’t they? 😂 You’re cool in your own heyday, but turn impossibly uncool when you age.
I would like to play that
Happy Birthday TO You!! 🎶🎶🎶
Thank you and happy birthday too!
Thank you!
Thank you!!
Thank y'all for the birthday wishes
Thank you 💪
I'm reading James Paterson 19th Christmas,.
Ohhhh you're right. I would love soup.
Sounds lovely. I like hearing other people's opinions on books, it opens me up to do many cool books
Have a good one!
☺️
Me too I’ll let you know how it is I hear it’s amazing
Thank you!
Thanks!!
Thank you!
I have lost a few myself. Its mostly because I have kids already and I don't want them to find out in case its another loss.
I'm trying to figure out how to do that lol but im a stay at home mom of a toddler and have 3 other kids, one of which is incredibly high needs so I'm already awake and busy like 20 hours a day lol but once I've been to the doctor were gonna focus more on it!! Thank you.
I'm down for you getting this power!
Right XD Between three cats and a toddler, I could vacuum twice a day and probably still find stuff to vacuum
Everything I never Told you by Celeste Ng. Really good! Kind of a Lovely Bones type vibe, but not quite.
😂 3 cats and a toddler. My brain would never stop thinking of a vacuumed carpet in my own house.
Thanks!
Thank you!
The Outer Worlds. Its a new game we got on Black Friday. Its pretty fun so far and has a cool story
I could train them to do my bidding and raise up a cat army. Hmmm... maybe not so useless after all.
Haha, yess, and the power to temporarily blind bad guys!
Red Bull!
thank you! 🌸💗
awww thank you!! 💗💗💗
I love making a farmhouse style salad topped with grilled chicken. What about you?
I appreciate you a lot!
It is a miracle worker!!! It’s such a great tool for people like me with chronic pain. I’m super impressed AND I only paid $15 for it! Thank you so much.
100% 😂😂.   Frankly I’m just happy I don’t have to wear a bra the next two days. I’m so over it. LOL
I just got out of a flames of hell hot bath lol. Gonna go grab a beer out the fridge!
Was like that yesterday too. They didn’t account for covid so now we have no one to call while people are dropping like flies. So the usual retail garble lol
I work in the actual store just filling orders so people can come pick them up. But as someone who also helps the people who come in on their own through delivery services, they rock.  One of my favorites I see like 8 times a day and she’s always moving fast.   And so do you for being a great human being 💜
Well I was, now I'm being lazy with my [dogs](http://imgur.com/a/ynW7hgs)
Im in NJ and have family in Florida. About 4 years ago my grandmother passed, amd the family came up here for the funeral.  My 26 year old cousin dragged her toddler children out into a Walmart parking lot to touch the snow mounds (from plowing like a week earlier). Blew my mind.
Glad to hear that. I'm doing well. Trying to decide what to do with my day.
You can have the snow. I'll take cold but I hate snow.
I'm glad to have it back lol
Thank you!
I'm thankful!
Absolutely love it.  I was told I’d need my gallbladder removed years ago but opted for acupuncture instead and I’ve still got my gallbladder.  It also helps a lot with migraines and allergies.  I understand how some people could feel uncomfortable with it though!
Thanks! When I lived in New Jersey, our tomatoes grew like crazy! But down here in Florida, nothing seems to grow well.
Thanks!
Yepper pepper!  [Ally the Doggo!](https://imgur.com/gallery/asxaMvz)
Right? Set it and forget it!
Does your area have Walmart Plus? I just heard about it and joined. You can order and pay online and Walmart will either delivery it to your house or you can go there and they'll bring the groceries out to your car.
I have Narcolepsy and my son (5) has had Insomnia since birth. If I could help everyone solve their sleep issues I totally would because we understand it so well.
I'll try my best! It might be gone before I know it!
It's the first time in like 3 years, I hope it will stay for a while!
I had to buy a air purifier for them
Yeah I don’t believe either 😉
Haha! It’s sometimes easier to just take the vacuum to it tho.  But I’m doing ceiling fans unfortunately - can’t take those apart
Death in paradise. I've seen them all but love rewatching them
🧡🧡🧡 thanks friend
Part of my job is knowing how far things are in relation to each other so I’m very good at saying “okay that person is 6’3” from the other person and he walks forward 4’ so now he’s only 2’ and they’re both 3’ from the table...”  It’s a lot of on the fly math lol
I most certainly will xD
Yes
I was walked in after 3 reschedules and bunch saying open but being closed
Same to you friend. Hope u are well.
How r u today
Thank you! I try ahaha :)
Thank you lovely! Happy saturday! <3
You too!!
:D
I immediately thought of you when I saw the Nutella contest. 😂
😂😂😂😭😭😭 soooo accurate! & i have no shame in my game. That’s why i only buy it on a occasion. it’s the best stuff ever!
[how about now? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kyr2uv/contest_do_you_want_some_nutella/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
That would be good too! I should try that.
They have Venom and Rip It cans. I've never seen anything other than Bang, Monster, Reign, and Rockstar when I'm out-and-about.
Rare, as in, I've yet to come across them in a physical location as opposed to an online retailer.
It's hard. I hope it isn't that long.. I understand it, but I hate it.
It really is. I'm looking into it right now, and it looks like next time I want to go to NZ I will need a visa and a 14 day quarantine at an approved facility, neither of which I can afford. And the visa processing time is like 13 months anyway. And probably not likely to be approved.
Ha! I see...so why is pink suspicious? lol The color? The singer? lol
NEONGREENPURPLE SUS AF
Yesss! Honeydew melonas are my favorite!
Thank you!!!
Thank you so much!!
Thank you!!
Thanks!!
Thank you!
Thank you!! ☺️
Ty
Ty but sadly looks like I wait a couple more months to get my hair cut. I’m use to waiting for me to get stuff like that done
I dont have any bring to work foods. I also don't have any cash, so no seaweed.
Thank you! I hope so too! I can eat candy, but I don't want to do that. Lmao!!!
Thank you so much!! Hope you have an awesome day as well
Thank you, friend!! Hope you have a wonderful day today <3
Thank you!!! 🥰
Haha yeah living in NYC my whole life really helped my speedwalking 🤣
Compared to super strength, telepathy, invisibility, teleportation..etc I thought it was, but you’re so right I would be popular 😂  You are so sweet! 💛
And back at you!! I hate the snow! I can’t wait to move!!
Thank you!!
Lol.. Yeah I can live with that.. I prep , they cook, I eat..I can see that working 😋
Dude, I just wanna get my dishes washed.
Absolutely. No longer would I be the bane of my own existence!
I have to agree
I just tell them ahead of time I’m gonna cry. I still sit still for the blood drawer and don’t move my arm but I cry and tell myself to “just keep swimming”.
Thank you 🥺🥺
I’d love to!! And I have a huge issue, no matter what type of nail polish I use or whether I use a top coat it’s chipping by the second day. Such a bummer.
The first two episodes are up! It was cute, I'm interested to see how they take it.
So. Much. Jelly!  And so much of it is huge Costco jars so they take up too much room.
I had baked bread for my neighbors, but while I'm Covid positive in not cooking/baking for anyone else.
Three weeks! Holy smurf! I'm in the "inland northwest," basically Eastern Washington just a stone's throw away from Idaho. The winds were crazy and the power went out in the neighborhood, tree fell on our porch but didn't damage too much.
I cast off all stitches. I'm about halfway done weaving in ends. I think I might call it a night and finish officially tomorrow.
Thank you.  I honestly haven't been looking...  I don't even know where to start.
Not that I know of, and I have never tested positive for covid.  I have had some kinda sinus congestion for a while.
True dat!!!
I think I can wiggle it out. I just use it for drawing so much its weird not having it.
My problem is mostly that I know what I want to write, and I know the research and stuff behind it but I need to go find sources for most of it which is what slows me down. I figure I'll just write the last 300 and worry about sources tomorrow (especially since they mostly all say the same thing, so I just want to show that I've used a variety instead of just the two I have physical copies of)
Thank you!
Thank you ♥️
Thank you!
Thank you (:
Thank you ❤️
Thank you 😭
Oh my gosh, day made. He's so handsome!!!!
OOOOOO SO CUTEEEEEEE
Same! He actually used to co-sleep. It drove my husband nuts, but I said the same thing. He had no idea that sleeping alone was normal. One night, he decided he wanted to be in his own bed, and he's never looked back. It broke my heart, to be honest.
I may or may not be in therapy partly because of her 👀  I am NEVER bored hahaha  It’s okay. :) I took a three hour rest and used some essential oils and I’m about to go eat some tomato soup which always helps me feel better. I will probably take a bubble bath tonight. :)
I’m like that most of the time when it comes to my own life - it’s just when I get migraines I know I need to slow down or else I get worse. When it comes to my mom, she hyperfocuses on the minute details like organizing one box of stuff when an entire floor needs to get cleaned in a couple hours. She would definitely benefit from r/ufyh. If you haven’t heard of it, it’s a cleaning system that focuses on 20 minutes of cleaning with a 10 minute break. They’re really awesome. They’ve got charts and systems to break down cleaning so it’s manageable and not a stressful ordeal!  Thanks for the well wishes! It mostly went away so I can eat dinner and function enough to enjoy the rest of my evening.
Omg, no he hasn't but he'd love them!  I'm finding that a good third of raising a toddler is finding all the things in all the weird places.  Seriously found a plastic sheep and a fork in my bed this afternoon.
Yayyy!!! Birthday buddies!!! Happy birthday 🎉🎊🎉!!!
They definitely were amazing, I had maple syrup on mine. Thank you, that means alot to me ❤!
Oh I'll have to look into this. Thank you
Me too! But for now I'm cozied up in bed 💙
Oddly enough, rose gold.  I'm working my way to it.  I have a box of henna to use first.
🥰
Awww 🥰
Ohhh I don’t know? Just a touch maybe🤔
Thanks, sometimes the occasion just really calls for some goddamn language. My toddler is the fucker who’s teething. I wish it were me instead tbh!
Thank you! Teething is a fucking bitch.
Thank you, Cup. Teething is a goddamn bitch.
Always a good choice! Edit: always a good fucking choice!
I’m sorry 😞 and good luck to you too! Hopefully they will all come in at once and it will be over fast!
Yep it also provides power to other things if done correctly.
Work has been for us to and we're enjoying an extra bit of time off until we go back. I'm tired of it. That sucks y'all can't stay virtual!
Mmm mango mochi!  My significant other is a teacher, and each class got surveyed if the parents were actually going to send their kids to school if given the opportunity. So he’s remaining virtual for the rest of the school year. He’s so happy!   I’m sorry you’re going back hybrid. It’s hard to not feel like they’re going straight to step #10 when we are still on step #2 of resuming normal life. And then they will act surprised when people get sick...
Ah okay! Thank you!
I have been here for like two years and never noticed that! 😂😂😂
I went out to get "pinch of nom Quick and Easy", to go with my collection of PoN books. Everyone on the facebook group raves about the sweet potato brownies recipe in there, but I need to find brown granulated sweetener.   The most interesting one though was when I got side tracked and picked up 'The Dopamine Diet', because just reading the blurb it described exactly how I feel about food so I was hoping I could trick my brain into believing these healthy foods make me just as happy!
No, it would not retain the old foods’ properties. It would have the nutritional value of what it is turned into (taffy into tofu). I’m a cook who just dislikes running out of brussels when there may be a drawer of onions.
Thank you!
Thanks...
Oh absolutely. I never even really used the lingo from my own teenage years, I’ve pretty much stuck with the same words my whole life.  I’m a walking stereotype of Southern California lol. My favorites are dude, gnarly, and stoked.
I haven't played it a lot, but it's fun!
It’s super fun! 😀
Thank you!
You're very welcome.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
Oh nice!
Anytime
check out mturk.com! it's data entry hosted by Amazon. it may be able to help a bit.
Oh yeah I've heard good things about it!
Ohhh I’ve been meaning to play Outer Worlds! They team that made this game, is the team that created some of the best games in the Fallout series! 🥰   Glad you’re enjoying it!
You just walking around the world with a trail of cats dancing around you would probably land you a tv show, and you’d get rich enough to feed them all.
I’m reminded of a PowerPuff Girls episode but it was dogs
That works too!
That sounds so good!! I only have simple salads with cucumbers, tomatoes, and whatever dressings we have lol.
That's a GREAT deal!  You're welcome 🙂
Hell, idc I almost never wear one. Unless my tatas may pop out or it's see through 😂 they're too small for anyone to notice I don't anyways
That sucks :-( Hope it's less hectic next week
Awwwww They're so cute!
Hahahaha that is awesome! I'm near Jacksonville, so sometimes we get frost in the winter. One of my friends saw the frost the other morning and thought it was snow. lol
Oh? What are your options?
I love it! But I also work from home so I don't have to trudge around in it beyond shoveling and building a snowman LOL
I can imagine!!!
Oh wow that's pretty cool. Yeah I was going to headaches but they had to place the needles in my neck and head, which scared me lol.
I’m in FL too! I guess it probably just depends on the area. Certain plants don’t do well, but the cherry tomatoes grew like crazy! Most of our other plants, we grew in pots in the fall, since it was too hot in the summer
Hehe what a cutie 💙
Yea there’s a fee though. My mom uses it so I’m going to ask her to get it for me.
Um, that's an amazing superpower, not a mediocre one.  O\_O  It sounds like your son and you have compassion for each other.  <3
Ooph, that's a tough combo between the two of you. If only you could give him some of your sleep and visa-versa.  Sleep isn't too bad for us, but my pregnant wife is definitely struggling these days, which makes work days taking care of our 3-year-old tough.
Yep I run one 24/7 in my room. I should really go to the ENT DR but I keep putting it off.
You can vacuum a fan??
Oh nice!!!
Color me impressed, that is awesome!
I’m having a nice Saturday, thank you!
Me too! I love when good days come out of unplanned things!
Nope 🥲! You might just have to make a new post.
We have rip it here in Indiana. And I think we have venom also.
Ah gotcha haha
Oh wow!! What country?
It's really tough for us to get visas to other countries that aren't temporary :/
It's the color.  Each player is a different color. :)
\*hides in vent*
I have some in my freezer! Mango is my favorite ❤️
You're welcome! :)
Awww. I'm sorry :( What are you going to do for lunch later?
Haha I hear you! Hope you can resist but also don't resist if the alternative is starving LOL
Thank you, I hope that you do as well 💖
Oh, you'd get mobbed by airlines demanding you work for them.  Let's be real.
Very normal and common.  I had a woman who was so embarassed she wept and could not tolerate an arterial blood draw.  It's normal.
This is precisely why I stopped caring about nail polish at manicures (which I rarely get anyway). Just rub my hands and fix my cuticles haha
I noticed you have cream - one of my favorite treats is whipped cream topped with a bit of jelly! You'll definitely run out of cream before you run out of jelly but that's a start, at least.
I hope you get well soon!
Hope you feel better soon
And ya three weeks is crazy! the power company said if they come by and they’re not home when they come to hook it back up they’re not allowed to it incase something spontaneously sparks with the new power lines! Crazy! We’ve had them showering at our place since they don’t have hot water or anything.   Glad you guys are okay! Heard a story about a couple in Tacoma who’s tree fell through the roof and pinned them into bed, the fire district had to cut them out 🙀  Those winds were crazy! Did you see the wind storm this past summer in salt lake area? Completely uprooting 100yr old trees. Sheesh.
Yay 😍 Glad he could help cheer you up, I told him that you think he's handsome :-)
Mmmm tomato soup! I think we are about due for some of that!  I keep a rollerball if peppermint oil on my nightstand for sinus headaches. It helps me so much. What are your go to E oils?
That sounds like something I need to check out!
That kind of thing would have seemed weird to me in the past. Now, it's totally normal haha. I love when they have an explanation for it too.  "Why did you put Daddys shoe in the dog crate?"  "It was in jail so Daddy can't go to bye-bye work."
Yum! I love drizzling mine with date syrup. It's SO good!
Yw
Sounds nice!!
I agree!!   I’m teething my wisdom teeth and foe agree that it’s better than A toddler. At least I only cry some of the time. Not all the time
It sure fuckin is
God damn and cunt are my favorites.
Damn that was almost a missed opportunity! (This is fun)
I know nothing about electricity so that’s cool!
My boss is trying SO HARD to give me a schedule that reduces my chance of exposure.  But we have more kids returning this semester than we did in the fall and it's just not possible this time. 😞
😂😂😂
If you haven't tried it, I'd recommend golden monkfruit sweetener! I think that's brown granulated anyways. It's just about the only artificial sweetener I'll use now because I don't get a weird aftertaste from it.
This would be awesome for people in who deserts!  eta: food deserts, not deserts!
You are very welcome.
The intros the easy part lol.  Let me know if you have any questions about wishlists etc.  Welcome! ❤️
I grew up in Southern California, so now I'm just the weird 30+ person in the Midwest that calls everyone dude and says sike and stoked.
I tried it on free play and it was alright. I reckon it would be more fun with actual people.
Its funny that you say that, fallout 4 is my favorite game. Its actually the video game that i learned how to use an xbox controller for after watching my brother play it. Open world games are just awesome
The imagine of me walking around surrounded by a horde of flat-faced Persian cats is pretty entertaining to me 😂
Was that the one with the dog statue that could shoot lasers out of its eyes? If so, I think I remember it.
I envy that lol. I’d definitely get reprimanded at work if I didn’t wear one. Might knock someone out on accident 🙃😂😂😂😂
Thanks. I think I’m going to request a couple days off just because I can and I think I need it. Fortunately they don’t guilt you when you ask for days off here which I love them for. Take a Tuesday and Wednesday so I can have a four day break in a couple weeks since I don’t work Sunday Monday.
Thank you!!
Play Forza 7, nap, do the dishes. That's pretty much it lol. I'll probably end up doing all three.
Maybe that's the trick, the time of year. I know the growing season is different down here. I'm still trying to figure it all out, lol. I tried beefsteak-tomatoes. maybe I need to try cherry tomatoes!
That's a good plan!  Yeah, I decided to pay the fee cause it's cheaper than using Instacart by a lot and I can't go to stores because if the antimaskers
It took me a LONG time to adjust to his schedule and get him properly diagnosed. I love his new specialist!
Oh I bet! How far along is she?
Yeah im going to see a doctor about it when things start to open up
Thanks! It makes forgetting my tape measure on IKEA trips super easy lol
Very nice. I'm just playing pokemon go.
i did that 3 times now. :/ maybe a mod is taking it down..? am i allowed to say “add this nutella to your list” and leave a link to it on amazon?
See, I think it's location, too. Because it took us forever to get these. So rare by my location.
They live in New Zealand.
Yeah
lol ok, thanks  :D
*HITS THE BUTTON!!!!*
Who knows!
Fair point! If I could I would, but all my intolerances make it impossible to eat candy
Thanks!! 🥰
For sure 😂
I usually apologize for being difficult. I’m getting better though!
Yeah, ya really discouraging but I just painted my nails for the first time in forever, even though it’ll be chipping soon lol. It’s pretty for the 3 hours that it’s perfect.
I've never thought of doing that - I use it for my cold brew coffee.
I'm feeling okay, mostly tired. Pretty sure I got a mild version.
The same thing basically happened here in Spokane! They definitely mentioned on the news that it was Hurricane force winds
Good!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Don’t forget the grilled cheese!  I have some blends from doTerra that have peppermint, frankincense and lavender that ease my migraines :)
I found them by accident during my tumblr days! They’re great. I’ve used their 20/10 cleaning/break system to put my entire two bedroom apartment together in an evening after I moved in one time. It was glorious.
Mine isn't talking yet (just signing and only a few words) and I can't wait for those fun explanations!
Urgh I’m sorry, wisdom teeth suck too. I had to have one of mine surgically removed 😩 hope it goes better for you 🙃
Yesss! They just feel really good to say, don’t they?
(I agree - I feel less shitty already!)
I know it can make you fly across a room if you touch 2 wires together. Hollywood taught me that.
Everyone is sick of parenting and ready to get their kids back in school. Its unfortunate because all teacher should have the opportunity to be vaccinated before being forced to go back to work. Everyone is choosing between feeding their families and getting sick, and it’s not an easy choice. I’m sorry.
Oooh thank you so much! I just googled and it seems cheaper than the other alt I saw. I’ll have a proper look tomorrow
Yes, food deserts. I live outside town, I guess that’s why I think about it so much!
Thank you for welcoming me, and I definitely will...
Haha I love that so much!!! Yeah I’ve traveled for work to places like Georgia and I’m like an alien in small towns lol
Yeah definitely more fun with people. The talking and arguing is the best part haha.
Mine too! I’ve played Fallout 4 entire main storyline at least 4 times lmao.    It’s interesting ‘cause Obsidian didn’t develop Fallout 4 but it was the first game in the series that I ever played and I was obsessed. If you haven’t I would definitely play Fallout 3 or New Vegas (which obsidian was part of) even if they are a little outdated!
I would like to do this with octopus and black bears. I’ve gotten close with the bears in a bear rehab facility, but they couldn’t be exposed to humans while conscious (it interferes with rereleasing them so it’s a no no), but I’ve never touched an octopus and boy would I love to.
Yes!!! If you have Hulu in the US you can watch the old episodes there!
Heck yeah! That's good they don't guilt you, everyone deserves a break every now and then to avoid burnout
I was gunna say.. All three sound great hahahah
Here we have a huge bulk of antimaskers, but an equally large amount who only cover their mouth. BITCH, YOUR NOSE IS CONNECTED TO YOUR LUNGS. I’ve found a T-shirt that says The mask goes over your nose, and I’m heavily contemplating buying it and making it my going out shirt.
Insomnia is rough, and he's so lucky he has you for a mom.
5 months along. Kind of in the sweet spot right now - past most of the nausea but not so big it's hard to move. Baby is ACTIVE though between 9pm-midnight haha
That’s so weird!! I’ve seen those contests before, so I don’t think that’s an issue
Automod sometimes removes contests with direct links to amazon because reddit thinks they are spam.   I've had that problem before.    Maybe just tell people to put nutella on their lists, or message the mods and they can help you
Ohhh. Ya they’re extremely strict. But look! They’re living normal happy lives! So at least they’ve been able to lock it down and press resume.   But I hope you get to see family soon ❤️ it’s been a long hard year
Sorry, that was probably really negative sounding. I meant like...living visas can be. Idk how visitors ones are now but they're usually easy to get.
You're welcome :)
alltheboops is sus
:( <3 <3
Aw man! Well probably better for you in the long run lol
You’re right! I think I’ll paint mine tonight too
that sounds delicious too!
Crazy! Lots of winds happening! And 20-30 ft swells on the coast this weekend
He did some grumbling and then went back to sleep 💙
Cannot skip out on the grilled cheese!  My daughter discovered Revive oils, the quality is equal to the top brands without the huge price tag.
They are so great! And yet, I still have no idea how he comes up with the things he does.
All 4 of mine will likely have to go. For now though they’re not bad. At least today.
It’s shitty to feel shitty. Much better to feel fucking awesome
Lol at least Hollywood is good for some education!
Yes, I meant to type food deserts and got ahead of myself!
It would be so interesting to be that close to a bear. Such powerful creatures that are also kinda like big dogs at times. Are octopuses dangerous to get close to? I guess I don't know anybody who has.
Oh sweet! I have Hulu through my phone plan so I should definitely check of out. Thanks :)
Absolutely.   I love my direct manager. He’s a great guy. And anytime you need something he tries to make it happen.
Well the dishes part I may skip and let the wife do them hahaha.
You should!  I should have made my mundane superpower the ability to make masks appear on anyone. The masks won't come off until they are away from other people and cover their noise and mouth 😂
Thank you! He's in a good spot now. I was worried about medicating him for a while (though I take meds for various things) but once he started one his development thrived!
Of course! The boat has stopped rocking her to sleep so now it is time to dance!
okay.... let’s try this again. [how about now ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kyrixb/contest_do_you_want_some_nutella/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
you resolved the problem! i had to remove the link. thank you!
It has, for sure. I'm super glad NZ has taken care of things the way they have.  I just really miss my bf and his family. I wish I could go there, but even if I could I'd have to quarantine in a hotel room for 2 weeks, and I can only leave the US for 1 month at a time, so it almost doesn't seem worth it. Unless they would let my bf quarantine with me.  (edit) Oh it looks like I can quarantine for 2 weeks *before* my travel date... but it does cost around $3,100 .. on top of a ~$2,000 plane ticket. Ow.
Its ok <3 I can't afford the application for the visa I saw but maybe there's a different one
I always joke that my coffee tastes like ice cream because I will use a ton of heavy cream and sugar free flavors in it. Also, when my best friend makes his french press coffee and doesn't finish it, I just poured the French press coffee over the cold brew grounds in the fridge
Oh I bet! Man I miss the Oregon coast, I've never been to the coast in WA
Hahaha!!!
Goddamn right!
I spend half my time on Reddit just editing my comments lol I had a phone once that the n was broke for a couple months before getting fixed...fun stuff there
Well black bears, which is what we have here in the smokies are pretty small compared to Grizzlies and other bears. Strong but aloof about that strength. They’re very self confident and don’t flex their power for fun. They’re extremely curious and playful, a nose 100 times more sensitive than a hound dog, excellent tree climbers, very powerful muscles. The young mama bears are smaller than a large dog height wise, but they can definitely do damage if provoked. I’ve never seen or heard of a female attacking unprovoked, even then they mostly bluff charge to warn you away. There was an idiot visiting Cade’s cove last year and he taunted a mama bear who was crossing the road with cubs, she bluff charged him. He deserved to be mauled, but if he had been, she’d have been euthanized so it was good she didn’t attack. I’ll see if I can find you the video. She’s a good representation of typical young mother size.   Ok you didn’t even ask any of that 😂 You can check out the rescue I mentioned if you use Facebook. It’s called Appalachian Bear Rescue in Townsend, TN. They’ve just finished releasing this years rehab cubs but you can scroll back and see updates and videos, photos, and educational live-streams, vet check ups on all the residents. Many come in as tiny cubs, and are grown yearlings once released in the fall or winter. Up close views!   Octopus can be dangerous yes, from what I know, which is very little. They have a beak to eat with which is a mean, sharp thing. And their strength is unbelievable. I would love to know some in real life.
I’ve been having a great time rewatching old cartoons from the 90s like that and Hey Arnold. They definitely still hold up.
That's awesome :-) Not many people are able to say that haha
That’d be the best. Look at them, and with a single scowl their face is masked and it can’t be removed until they’re back home.
Seriously! We're gonna have a little ballerina on our hands or something.
Yay it worked! 🙌🏻🙌🏻
You're my kind of coffee drinker. My favorite way to drink coffee is mostly milk and a tiny bit of coffee for flavoring. Also, that french press trick is A+.
Hey Arnold was one of my favorites! I feel like I learned most of my morals from that show haha
For sure. I’m lucky
If only! We can dream
Hey it's a good skill!
WHEWWWW 😅😂😅 thank you for checking!!
Dude YES. It had legitimately good stories and characters. And some of them creeped me the heck out as a kid

When it's someone's birthday, they sometimes sing a birthday song to them. Well, I found it on Youtube. This is the [Dapper Dans Birthday Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5ROsHfNhUM)!

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kyss3h/discussion_who_are_the_creative_types_and_what/

I’ve been told I’m creative but I think I’m too hard on myself. I have all these ideas in my head but I can never translate them to the real world. I always expect myself to be good at whatever I’m trying and get frustrated at failing. I need to keep telling myself “they’re happy accidents” instead so that I can get better at things and finally realize some of my ideas! I’m finally getting over that hump of self doubt with a few things though so, I am happy with myself for that!
collage and writing for me
I’m creative ish! I just like making things. I pick up new endeavors as I get bored and it’s been super fun. It makes me happy to try new hobbies and learn new things. I try to make a different thing for my in-laws every Christmas and challenge myself to do new crafts.
I really enjoy reading, which gives me access to other people's creativity. I also crochet which means I can pick any random stitch and come up with something to do. I also enjoy writing short stories but haven't done this in quite a long time. I hope to get back into this routine and do a bit of writing each week.
I'm am still, but was until 2 years ago a touring musician and recording artist. I went to college for music after playing all through school and in Drum Corp International. I am the product of two pretty creative parents. My father was a master carpenter and engineer and my mother was a music teacher. I am now retired from music for the time being, so I'm doing remodeling, painting, and finish carpentry. I enjoy the finished product and dont mind the hard work. The money is good, but not music money. But I'm a weird guy, as long as I have my home and a kitchen to cook in I'm happy. I like to cook in my spare time. It seems like an art I'll never understand fully. I can't draw a stick figure either. So I think it is all subjective. I love watching anyone who has a full and overly competent mastery of their craft. Doesn't matter what it is. As long as they are at the top of their game, I can find artistry in it. I saw a video of garbage collection guys kicking ass on their route and it was amazing... beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I guess.
Ive never been creative at all. But people in the past have told me I'm creative. When it came to playing minecraft and designing my house and the same with animal crossing but i just don't think im creative at all
I consider myself pretty creative. I love writing and painting. It makes me happy to get all the thoughts and stories out of my head and onto paper.
I feel like I'm not naturally creative, but I want to be! I've been trying to learn to draw and crafting a lot lately. Hopefully, I can pick some stuff up!
I am and I enjoy just having a day to shut off the world and create without thinking about it at all.
I can write pretty well. 🙂 Find its a good stress release
I enjoy scrapbooking and coloring
I draw sometimes, and I've found I like sculpting. Kinda wanna try scrapbooking, too.
I like to make things, like, akmost everything that I'll see or think about buying I'll try and think if it's possible for me to make it, started at around the age of 14 when I wanted to buy myself a knife for camping, decided I will try and make one on my own, and this day I make pens, rings, sometimes knives, helping my dad with building his 1989 jeep cj (hope to buy myself an old car too, but it'll be a while).   I'm 23 today, about to turn 24, and I still find new things to make on my own, something about taking a rough material and making it into a piece of art or into something for everyday use is just making me relaxed
I consider myself creative. I like to dabble in a bunch of different artsy type things: scrapbooking, ceramic painting, etc. I also enjoy writing. But what really makes me happy is planning. I love to plan events or fundraisers. I would definitely do this as a job if it was something that I could make enough money at to support myself.
Me! I [journal](https://instagram.com/kayescreations) and craft a lot, along with painting (mostly watercolor and gouache), drawing with pencils and charcoal,  and creating with anything else I can get my hands on. I like to personalize my own jewellery and accessories. I also mend and see my own clothes, write, and play the piano/ukelele/guitar.   What makes me happy? Walking through life and hoarding things like a goblin to put into other things. junk journaling would totally be my thing but I don't understand what the point is yet...  I also like installing art displays. Large scale public random art like drawings made of fallen leaves, chalk art, inukshuks, twig charms hanging from trees, yarn bombing...
Writing, Journaling, painting, reading, and making lotion bars and candles make me happy!
I can relate to having non-stop ideas and not necessarily knowing how to turn them into something substantial.
Have you ever done decoupage?
What have you made?
What do you like to crochet?
I love the drums and wish I could play. You'll go back on tour when Covid is under control. I know singers who are going crazy not being able to perform or tour. I can't draw a stick figure either. I can sit and watch creatives work any time. One of my favorite things to do in NY and CA is to attend TV show tapings and watch the crew between scenes.
I am not familiar with those video games but maybe you're drawn to digital art or architecture.
I wish I could paint or draw.
You can't do it unless you try so A+ for effort.
What are your creative outlets?
What do you like to write about?
I enjoy coloring, too.
Excellent. Sculpting sounds interesting. I really want to play with a pottery wheel.
There's a need for blacksmiths. If you have Disney+ there's a series about movie props. The Pirates of the Caribbean episode features a guy who makes swords.
I hear you, I plan my high school reunions and trips.
Wow! 👏 Bravo. An artist of many talents.
Lotion comes in bars, too? No idea.
Well I hope you can get over that hump too!
I haven't. It was the rage when I was a teen but never did it.
I’ve done wood burning, made a ton of stuff with my Cricut, baking, wood models, knitting, and I’ve been looking into resin work and candle making.
I'm not very good at painting. I mostly just try to copy cool paintings on pinterest. They never turn out right, but its a lot of fun!
Thanks so much! :)
Painting, but also poi and dance and learning to gypsy hoop.
Mostly poetry and short stories. 🙂   I have a good idea for a sci-fy/fantasy story I've been thinking about for ages, but just havent found the inspiration to write it. Doesn't feel like my hearts in it fully
sadly I'm not a blacksmith, living too close to my neighbors to be able and forge steel without them wanting to kill us.   disney+ is not available in israel yet so I can't watch it there, what's the show called? I'll have to give it a look.   also you should watch history channel's forged in fire, really fun seeing the competition aspect of blacksmithing
That sounds amazing!!
Yeah! It's pretty neat. :)
It's tough. LOL I keep trying.
Wow. You're like a one-woman gift shop.
As long as you're enjoying it, that's awesome.
Neat!
It will present itself when you're ready.
That’s the goal! Gonna work on learning embroidery this year too
🙂 thank you

Hi all!  So I posted this before and got lits of amazing answers! But I was not expecting this lockdown to get extended. I will now be babysitting my sister for yet another week, 3rd one in a row, and possibly more weeks after.  So If you'd like, please help me come up with some ideas!  Things I can do with her from home would be the best!  I also implemented a point system where she can get points for a lot if things like: win a game of monopoly, help with cooking, feed the bunnies, and even when we watch something together: Whenever a character is laughing she gets a point, whenever someone drives a car i get points etc.  So if you'd like you can suggest points for your activity as well! Like: go for a walk with her: 1 point.  Clean up as much as she can in a minute: 2 points etc.  Don't feel obligated to help if you see this post, especially if you've already helped me before! But I would greatly appreciate some new fun activities for this upcoming week :)  Any questions about her are welcome!
Hi! I’ve worked with kids for a while and one of the fan favorites with that age group is scavenger hunts or like murder mystery parties. They are great because they take a little while to complete( if you have to fill up time) and are fun to make! You can give her a point for completing one because she’d be doing a great job using her mind to complete it! My dad came up with this when we were younger so he could do chores mainly lol. There would be a clue that led you to another clue and then eventually to answer! It’s loads of fun!
I’m not sure if I already suggested this to you but take her geocaching! :) maybe give her points when she finds them herself
What’s the weather like where you are?  I have a few good outside activities if it’s not too cold.
You could write a picture book with her 😇
If you know another language you can also play games to teach them new words. I also enjoyed writing my own stories as a kid and their creativity is great! My nieces and nephews (similar ages) enjoy drawing. I sometimes give them a theme and see who can go wild with it.
Make a time capsule! You can spend time brainstorming, decorating the capsule, and collecting and making things to go inside. Then you can make a plan of where to bury it when the weather is a little nicer :)
We make silly comics, learned to make cake pops and caramels. Learning needle felting with my kiddo. Lots of board games.   Points: Make a bag of donations for other kiddos, check the mail, fold a basket of towels and fabric napkins (squares are easy).
I've been teaching my boy how to cook.  Making waffles and pancakes was a hit, but he got bored of cookies bc they take too long.
That sounds great, Thank you!
We love geocaching! Such a fun thing to do :)
It started snowing today so pretty cold 😂 Not sure how long the snow will stay. But I'd love to hear them anyway, maybe we can alter them a bit if needed!
Ooh great idea!
That sounds great! We've been reading English together, so this could help her advance with that as well!
You could make a nature wind catcher like [this](https://inspirationlaboratories.com/spring-activities-for-kids-make-a-wind-catcher/) which may serve as a nice gift for your/her parent’s porch.    You could also organize a scavenger hunt for her.  My other suggestions were a fort and picnic but you may have to wait until it is warmer!
Thank you, great ideas!

/u/Lucy_Leigh225 sorry it took me a bit to upload! I’ve been getting used to this new work schedule + trying to manage a home on top of all of that! But I’ve been using it every morning while I get ready and I’ve truly noticed a difference! Thank you so much!!
These lamps are so good!   I’ve finally resorted to taking D3 because not even the lamp was keeping my seasonal depression issues at bay. It’s been 2 months now without a single episode. If that’s something you want to try, Solgar brand D3 in soft gel form (increases bioavailability when carried by an oil) is an amazing one.
That is awesome!
Such a thoughtful gift.
Awww yay!!!

Do you eat them like that or do you top them over ice cream? I never seen mochi topping before lol
I know not of these mochi things. They look like pastel gumdrops. Do tell.
Those are so yummy! I love them on froyo.
u/skwerl12 You're so kind to have remembered how much I love these little mochi toppings and to choose out such a fun assortment for me! I tried them and they taste fruity and fun! I love how they look in these clear containers and I'm excited to eat them with ice cream! Thank you! <3
Woahh
Whoa!! These look so good
Yum!!!!
Ohhh these look good! Do they still have a mochi filling inside?
I eat it with ice cream and yogurt but you can also just snack on them :)
When I worked at our local froyo shop, we’d carry this as a topping and kids would mistake it for marshmallows and parents would complain so much because they wouldn’t pay attention and let their kids get whatever they wanted at the topping bar (it was self-serve) - it was always an adventure hahaha
oh they look beautiful in there! enjoy <3
These do not have filling. I personally prefer that. :)
Ohhh me too! It’s the red bean paste I’m not a fan of. Other fillings aren’t so bad though.

OMG!! AND THE LOOP!! 😱😱😱  You just bring tears to my eyes!!! Omg!! I don’t know what I did, but thank you!!!
I know, right? Jk 😂 I’ve been working on accepting compliments and not swatting them down like flies, and so I occasionally take the arrogant approach as a joke to avoid rejecting them.
Me too. My flexibility has waned in recent years, but yoga is one of my favorite things in life.
It’s some kind of strap and some blocks. I really have no idea what they are 😂 I learned yoga without any props but these look like they’d make it waaaaay easier
I just do what the stars tell me 🥰   That jumping lady looks like she could teach me how to stretch well. Is that “the loop”?
You really are the sweetest. TAKE IT!! Don’t even comment back w anything!! Keep it!!
I’m so stiff now that I need these props to help me 😂😂😂
I don’t know what it’s actually called but I called it the loop bc it has so many 😂😂😂 thank you so much for these!! Dang it now I really really can’t have an excuse not to exercise!!!
It’s cool that there are tools that prevent having to quit though. Really cool. I’m gonna look into some of these.
Yaaassssss do it!! Let’s be yoga partners!! We can slowly become yoginis!!

You are so welcome!

Hey there! I’ve got five books on death and death investigations that I read as research for a writing project.  One person will receive all five via USPS media mail so must be in the U.S. due to shipping costs for the weight of books.   The books are shown in post below and are in great readable condition. Titles: Smoke Gets in Your Eyes & Other Lessons from the Crematory, The Skeleton Crew,  Making an Exit, How We Die, and Working Stiff  To be considered:  1. Show or tell us about a time you felt really alive.   2. Share why these titles interest you.   3. Share an example of you as a positive influence in this group or how you’ve been positively influenced by  someone in the group.  4. If you think someone would be interested in these books, please summon them.  That’s it!   I’ll choose one person to receive them on Sunday evening Pacific NW time and will mail them out by Tuesday 1/19.  [giveaway is closed]
A time (times, rather) I felt really alive was when the boyfriend and I would go on different adventures together. We were both recently clean and had been working on rebuilding our relationship after enduring a lot of hardship. I thought the relationship was done with, so when we were given a second chance and were able to make it work, it made me feel a pure joy that no drug could ever give. Exploring with him is one of my favorite things to do and he always knows how to make every experience a memorable one! [Here are some pictures of places we've gone](http://imgur.com/a/PI7L4Ki).   I would like the books because I am obsessed with learning about death, true crime, serial killers, and morbid topics in general. I was going to school for Criminal Justice and hope to one day go back to finish. I love trying to understand why people do the things that they do and the process of trying to solve a crime is something that intrigues and fully engages my mind. My favorite class I've ever taken was a Forensics vocational course in which our professor would set up crime scenes, we would take pictures of the scene and collect evidence, we even had to bury dogs and later collect bug samples! It's all so awesome to me!   I've been positively influenced by many in this group, but I would say the biggest influence has been u/xoxoxo7777. She is an absolutely wonderful person and I aspire to one day be in the position where I can be as big of a giver as she is. I believe that the meaning of life is to positively impact others as much as possible and while I have a job in which I am able to do this and do my best to do small acts of kindness for others as I can, it would be wonderful to give others the material items they desire as well :-)   Thank you for this contest!
A time I really felt alive was ziplining! It was an amazing experience to feel the air in my lungs and wind in my hair! I love it! These titles interest me because I’ve always had a fascination with death and actually still think about being a funeral director to help people cope with loss. I try to be a positive influence in this group by stay active in the comments of most posts and checkin in on the friends I’ve made as well as the new people :) Im really excited for this contest and I appreciate you so much for hosting!!
/u/gdarn16  I think I saw one of these on your list
I felt really alive when I went on a two week European Rollercoaster trip! It was so amazing riding all those coasters! It was a trip of a lifetime and one I’ll never forget!  I am interested in these books because I love to learn about death. May be morbid but I grew up in front of a funeral home. Always been fascinated. Even wrote obituaries for the local newspaper for years before I moved up into copy editing.   I’ve been positively touched by so many lovely people on this sub. But one that stands out is u/noimnotsally because she has helped and is helping me come out of my shell and get more involved. Sure I run a lot of contests, but she’s pushing me out of my comfort zone to really comment and join in daily chats. She’s been a driving force of positivity in my life and has become my best friend.   Thanks for the opportunity!
Not entering (Canada) but that sounds pretty cool! I love Smoke Gets in Your Eyes, such a good read.
One time I felt really alive was when I moved from Missouri to Ohio. I have agoraphobia and hadn't left my city for about 4 years. A few of those years I hadn't even left my house! It felt so good to see beyond the city limits again and to see old towns and cities I hadn't seen in years. Going outside my bubble made me feel like a real person again.  These titles interest me because I love the subject matter. I love reading murder mysteries and always thought it would be neat to write one myself! Maybe these could help and even if they don't I still find the topics interesting.  I've been positively influenced by several of the people in this community. One thing that sticks out to me was seeing so many people mention journaling as something that they enjoy and something that improves their mental health. It made me think that maybe I could benefit from it too. And so far, it's really improved my mood. I also saw people mention gratitude journals and gave that a go as well and that has also made me feel more positive. I'm so glad I gave it a try and I'm so thankful for all the people that have gifted me anything journal related. I am a more positive person now and I have this community to thank for it.
I used an online random name picker to choose and it selected /u/gdarn16  So if you will get me your address I will put these in the mail by Tuesday.  Enjoy reading them!

Congratulations on you and your boyfriend’s life changes. It sounds like it was what you both wanted and paid off. I hope you can make your dreams come true. I only started doing next of kin searches in my fifties, so it’s never too late. ❤️
💙💙💙 You are an amazing person! I appreciate you so much!
I have watched people but that and skydiving scare the patooty out of me. We need sensitive snd committed funeral directors. Are you familiar with Thomas Lynch’s writings?
Thank you!!
That sounds like a fabulous trip. Who did you go with? I think we should normalize reading and talking about death— it’s one thing we 100% all share in common; losing those we love and our own impermanence.
Big smiles!! This was so touching. You bet I'm gonna get you not only to chat more..but hopefully smike more🌸❤🧸 love ya kiddo   Tell me about the funeral home....u missed this part? Lol
Aw, sorry... but you’re in Canada— a good thing!
There are so many amazing journal supplies that make it fun and creative!
You are so so kind. I know you had a hard day. Thank you for spreading joy in your difficult time. I’m thinking of you ❤️
You can ship books media mail to make it cheaper
Thank you 💙💙💙 Ohhh, next of kin searches sounds super interesting! Also if you're willing to share the piece of writing you used the books for, I'd really love to read it! :-)
😍😍
Skydiving scares me too! But ziplining was so so fun! So was waterfall jumping in hawaii!!
And I am not but tell me about them! I’d love to know more!
I was summoning you to the Giveaway.  If you're interested, check it out and participate. :)
I went with a friend of mine. It was a convention with American Coaster Enthusiasts.  I agree death should be talked and read about. It’s the one thing we can count on from the moment we’re born, we know we will die someday. Having written obituaries and meeting with families, I know the grief and lack of discussion. Even in my own family, it is difficult to bring up and to talk about and yet I must.  But it needs to be based on facts and experiences.
Hey, no worries! I just like to comment as I remember someone was sad once because they had low engagement on their contest. I couldn't enter as a Canadian, but I like to think even getting a comment on the contest subject is nice for some people :)
Thanks. I’m doing fine. We’re just really going to miss all his funny chatter after so long with him.
Yes, I said that's how I am shipping in the post, but only within the U.S.
It’s for a book project still not sold, but here’s [an essay published ](https://www.damemagazine.com/2018/04/16/telling-the-stories-of-the-unclaimed-dead/) from it. Let me know what you think!
He’s a poet and scholar but also writes hilarious essays. Check out his book on the undertaking life, I think it called The Undertaking: a Dismal Trade. There’s also a video of him preparing a body for burial. I think PBS or NPR hosted it. He’s a third generation funeral director.
I am super interested!! I appreciate it!! ❤️❤️ you’re lovely!
He had a wonderful life because of you!
I sent you a pm with my info I’m so excited to receive this! Thank you so so much!
Wow...that made me cry...what a rollercoaster. You are an amazing person and an inspiration 💙 Whenever the book is released, let me know...I definitely want to purchase a copy.  I've considered writing a book about my experiences with homelessness and drug addiction, maybe one day I'll do so :-)
Wow I just read this and it’s amazing. Please let me know when your book is released and I would love to purchase. I love your writing
Wow yes! I will be checking both of those out!! Thank you so so much! I love learning more about the trade! It excites me so much!
Great, I’ll get them boxed up tomorrow snd will post when they’re in the mail.
I hope you do. We need wider representation of voices. After that story was published Ronnie’s mom was released from prison. We became friends on Facebook. I hope one day she will tell her story. I’m sure it’s so much more complex and interesting that what it was reduced to in my piece.
Thank you. Still searching for a publisher, but one day...
You are the sweetest ❤️
For sure, there's still a lot of negative stigma surrounding homelessness, addiction, and mental illness. I'm glad to hear you managed to connect with her once she was released. Thank you for sharing your piece 💙
You’re talented you got This!!

u/bruiserbeetle these are very handy and super cute.  As my daughter said upon seeing them, these are the cats meow! 😂
I love these bags!!! I just bought some zippers (hoping to learn how to sew some bags), but now am too intimidated to even start! Story of my life 😂
These are adorable!! 😻
So cute!
these are awesome! 🌸
I love your daughter and wish to adopt her if you tire of her. 😘
I bet your bags will come out amazing! And if they don't, at least you tried! Many people don't even make that effort to know. And I always tell my kids "practice makes progress". Maybe you might need to do it a few times in order to get them done right, but the more you do it, most likely, the better you get.  I would love to see them, if you do make them!
I can lend her out for a bit to have a good laugh with, but she's a pretty cool kid so I'd like to keep her around. 🥰
Thanks for the encouragement. I’ve never worked with zippers before, so it’ll be new for me. I’m sure it’s easier than I imagine it to be 😜

Hello lovelies I thought I'd finally do an intro! I've been here for awhile but never done an intro because it feels awk to me (but that's just in my head)  Y 'all can call me lana - I am currently in school & working part time. In real life, I am kinda awkward and find it difficult to talk to people because of my social anxiety, hence I feel more at ease conversing with people online.   I am a hardcore Etsy browser which means I collect (hoard) stickers, art prints, and enamel pins. I usually like to do giveaways from etsy because I love supporting artists there (and b/c I don't have amazon prime yet). Some of my fav hobbies include board games, video games, puzzles, manga/anime, skincare, and makeup. I also just started back into reading books thanks to this sub. ☺️  And did I forget to mention that I'm a crazy cat lady? She's my world.   Thank you all for this kind, supportive, and welcoming sub. ❤️
Hi! Welcome to the sub! Enjoy the wonderful community!! What are some of your fav etsy shops?
Welcome to the group! Ooo stickers there is alot of people on here that love stickers. Being a crazy cat lady is fine we have some in the group and they are awesome!   Have a good day and once again welcome!

Hi I've been so obsessed with etsy lately too! I find so many cute washi tape, stickers, stationary and mugs there. I haven't got any pins yet though. What is your current favourite item or shop on there?
Hello and welcome! Ooooh Etsy is so good. My favorite mask maker has a shop there too.
I adore Etsy too! So many great vintage and handmade items!
I love etsy too. Being able to talk with the artists directly is one of my favorite aspects.
Welcome to the sub! I also love stickers, so fun! Which board games do you like?
Welcome! What is your favorite art print that you have? What are some of your favorite board games (I'm wanting to get a collection of games together for myself and my friends). And lastly, what book are you reading now?? Or what did you read recently?
Welcome! It's nice to meet you! What is your kitty's name?
Hi and welcome.  I love Etsy too ... maybe an unhealthy amount.  Do you have pictures of your cat?  I have 3 cats myself (along with a ton of other pets) and they make life interesting!

Hi and welcome!
We met but welcome anyway!
Hello Lana... welcome!  I also have social anxiety, and this sub has really helped me come out of my shell a bit, so hopefully it'll help you too!  I adore enamel pins, and I can get lost on etsy for hours and hours too! How many enamel pins do you have? Do you have any pictures of them?
Oh I cannot wait for your contests and giveaways then because I love Etsy! I sign up for most Reddit secret santas and always aim for Etsy first if I can.

They have the best unique shops for masks. Need a mask for an occasion - etsy got your back!
Yess I love it ❤️
Yes I love the little messages they send with your stuff as well!
Thank you, I'm a fan of dixit, clue, & monopoly. What about yours?
My favorite art prints is sailor moon by hannah alexander; my favorite board games are dixit, clue, and monopoly; I just finished reading the silent patient (sooo good). Any book, art prints, or board recs you have?
Nice to meet you too, my kitty's name is gigi 🐈
Yess here's [Gigi](https://i.imgur.com/KaRMCSi.jpg) basking in the sun,, on my book. Wow three cats would be the life 😁 what are your cat names?
Haha crazy cat ladies unite!! What is your kitty name?
My favorite holiday is def Christmas! Already miss the holidays 😭 I enjoy flowers and birds, they're so beautiful and colorful. I love it when it rains (as long as I'm inside haha)   Mr. JJ is such a cute name, and oo I rmbr your three kitties. Thank you for the lovely welcome 🤗
Her name is gigi :)
Thank you!!
Thank you 🤗
Ahh yes same that's why I love this sub!  I have around 15 I think, and no I don't, most are still in it's packaging becuase I havent bought a display for them(also looks too nice with the packaging on). How many pins do you have?
My cars name is gigi and here she [Is](https://i.imgur.com/pisj0Xf.jpg) bathing in the sunlight on my book 😊
It’s true. The girl I buy from is called Retromy. She did some studying of fabrics and uses exactly the right kind for max effectiveness without a filter. But they also have filter pockets and ear loop channels so you can change the elastics if they wear out. Seriously good stuff.
Oh Clue is my favorite!! Also really like Spirit Island!
I play Clue with my family all the time! For games I would suggest Werewolf, you get a set of cards to use and then the rest is done through an app on your phone. Hmm prints I don't have a lot from authors that I actually know, I usually just collect things like stickers and postcards to display.
Aww cool!
She is so regal!  I have Rex, Walter and Allie.  As you can see most of my pets have people names!
Topol! It means chubby, because he really is chubby. What’s your little girl’s name and what color is she? My guy is a brown/grey tabby.
Lol this is so cute that you must the holidays are ready it was only a few weeks ago.
She is sooo cute!
Oo she sounds like a one of kind mask maker! I tried searching her up but couldn't find her :/
Oo I heard great things about spirit island!!
Ooo sounds fun! I'll def look into it. Stickers and postcards are always nice to display
Haha they are very nice names, they are your companions!
Haha aw so cute. Her name is gigi and she's a [Calico cat ](https://i.imgur.com/6mO9DtN.jpg)
Oh, [here it is! ](https://www.etsy.com/shop/retromy?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=806571145)
It's so fun! I love how different each of the spirits is, plus I like co-op games
Oh my goodness, she’s adorable and I love her name!! Thanks for sharing!  [Here’s my baby ](https://imgur.com/a/sAUtDlW) with one of his Christmas toys.
Thank you!! For some reason I couldn't find her. She has beautiful masks
Yess co op games are the best!!
Thank you and awww Topol is a cute chunky. So cute ❤️
Thank you!! He’s my baby.

Very happy with it, thank-you <3
I have like a marble effect duvet set yeah, from amazon with a zip bottom and it's grey underneath  😅 it goes with my marble phone and lamp!
I hope you show us the completed project! I know there are plenty of ppl who’d love to see!
OK it must belong in the same family mine doesn't have a zipper on it but if you look at some of my pictures the background I could see the exact same set that I have that I took pictures of items on it lol
I usually post them to r/diamondpainting when they're done. I posted my first one there too. :)
Oh yeah it looks very similar!
**GASP** there’s a subgroup?!?! u/lilhoneybee4 u/doesyawannasnog did you guys know, too?!
That’s wild! I just joined it! I like seeing what people pick!

Be careful, it has the tendency to make you constantly want to diamond paint or buy more.
🤭 ok, that’s enough!! I’m staying away!!! lol I’m working on a huge one right now then have a small one. After these two I think I need a good hearty break for a while!

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kyqfn3/discussion_whats_the_most_influential_album_of/

I have quite a bit, but the top 5 are:   Alice in Chains - Dirt   Okkervil River - Black Sheep Boy  A Perfect Circle - Thirteenth Step  The Pineapple Thief - Magnolia  Chevelle - Sci-Fi Crimes  They're all just albums that have helped me through very difficult times and hold a special place in my heart
Mumford and Son’s first album got me though my first young heartbreak in middle school so that always has a special place in my soul. I played that whole thing on repeat for days
Billy Joel, 52nd Street.  My parents had it and it started my lifelong love of Billy.  His music is the soundtrack of my life
Jagged Little Pill. It's a real album that came out in a time of a lot of fluff. Her words actually mean something. Great album! 🙂
I would say for me it’s Beatles , Abbey Road - changed the way I approached music because it was actually due to a 7th grade crush that I started listening to the Beatles and it’s stuck with me all these years. I can still imagine the little greattyrant listening to the Beatles on my boom box and mooning over my crush - it was a pivotal time in my life
Probably xInfinity by Watsky. Although Taylor Swift's Speak Now album was pretty influential to me when it came out.
It's really hard to say the ***most*** influential but I have a list of albums I think are influential to me.  Constellations by August Burns Red - just one of those albums that I discovered when I was on the cusp on turning 18. I ended up seeing ABR two years ago on their 10 Year Anniversary Tour for this album.  Avenged Sevenfold's White Album - When I was starting to get back into rock and metal in 9th grade, I picked this album up not knowing who the artist was. For all of 9th grade, I would play this album on repeat. A7X has become one of my favorite bands.  Let It Enfold You by Senses Fail - I just recently heard this album but it feels nostalgic somehow. I guess it speaks to me at my current age and I can relate to it.
The verve - urban hymns. Reminds me of so much and that so much can be achieved
The Next to Normal soundtrack. It helped me to see my mental illness as a valid part of me rather than an intruder in my mind.
Greer’s first two singles. I’ve met three of my friends as random people who also listen to this fairly obscure band with two songs.
In the court of the Crimson King!! because it started the whole progressive rock genre
In Rainbows by Radiohead. I've listened to it hundreds of times and it never gets old. Love every song on it and has made me appreciate music even more since it's release back in 2007
Hard choice but I’ll go with Metric’s Fantasies or Smashing Pumpkin’s Siamese Dream
Heart, Dreamboat Annie. So evocative of a time in my life.
Probably Korn Follow the leader. It’s when I realized it was ok to not be like my parents and I could be who I wanted to be.
Damien Rice's "O" album got me through a lot of hard times during high school.
Dirt is definitely in my top list as well. Great choices altogether
Omg you were so young when that came out!!! I listened to them back in the day but they weren’t like my fav band- I was more of a band of horses , decemberists, modest mouse kinda person
Early Billy is awesome I just don’t listen to him as much anymore - there’s a person who goes to This karaoke night that we used to go to that could sing “we didn’t start the fire” perfectly. - it’s uncanny !

This one is fantastic. Good pick.
I always remember that she wrong You Outta Know about Uncle Joey from Full house and that always gets me- she’s amazing though
Speak Now is friggen incredible. Haunted is one of her ABSOLUTE BEST songs!!! You and I walk a fragile line...and so on lol. 🙂
Omg you are making me remember this guy I dated back in the early 2000’s - he was super into Avenged Sevenfold and music like that - and then I was friends with a bunch of guys in hardcore and metal bands, it was such a weird thing because I totally am not into that kind of music but I went to SO many shows that were similar type music - I know more about it than I should lol
How to Disappear Completely and Street Spirit (Fade Out) are my two favorite songs by them. So haunting and soul touching
Oh that's  a hard karaoke one! So fast
Same. I didn't find that out until way way later, but it never fails. Every time I hear that song now, its ALL I think about. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Glad I can help you reminisce :)
Oh yeah, I love those too. How to disappear completely sometimes gets me down Hahahaha but I love it nonetheless
I'm one of those weird people that loves depressing music 😅
Hahahaha I also like depressing music! But that one sometimes is too much for me lol

I haven’t done my nail art in a while but i have no ideas. So i turn to you guys. Any ideas? (Edit: I didn’t think this was going to get this many comments but i guess i have ideas for a while now lol.)
Betty Boop
Disney - stitch
Hmm maybe sea life? Seahorses, octopus, crab, turtle etc .
Leaves, and trees, and nature things?
Mondrian
Cherries!
Icebergs and isolation
snow flakes ❄️
Galaxies!
Cat theme [inspo](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3XS0viij0X/?igshid=v6ai3k0r7in3)
You should do cow print ones! And maybe the thumb or your middle finger can be a little cow face🥰
Cacti/ plants?
I love a bit of marbling
Narwhals and dolphins!
It’s almost Valentine’s Day !!! Do some hearts ,, little angels and a red and pink theme !!
I just spent an hour doing my nails lol.  I did deep blue (like one step under black) and did a bright blue zigzag pattern with nail stamps.  To answer your question, something sweet lile strawberries or cherries would be cute!  Some nonsense gibberish... I love nail stamping, but still a noob so have to do it many times. Im smart, i use a clear uv-cured top coat THEN do the stamping. That way, I can erase my mistakes 2859 times before I get it right. I just figured out how to use them too. Before, Id put the polish on top of the stamp design then swipe excess. Nope... put the polish NEXT TO the design and swipe the polish across. Lmao, guess I shoulda researched more. But Im glad I learned how to do that part anyways.
Animal print or animal paws with color?
Plants!!
Black leopard print, but with matte AND glossy black!
Winter wonderland! Blues and whites and silvers :)
I used to do ladybugs all the time in high school 😅 Painted my fingernails just for laughs a month or so and I thought about doing it again but the polish comes off so quickly I didn't want to put the effort in
🐸 frög nails
Cherry blossom nails!
Maybe when my nails grow out a little lol
That’d be cute!
Yeah stamping is always tricky!
All these cool ideas! Im going to need more hands lol.
Sounds cool may need to pick up some matte colors
Yeah some polishes do that just gotta find the right one
How about a space theme ?
[here](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0a/d2/31/0ad23173eef7b72ff0c81a3a482d5ec5.jpg)
Yes! It was my second thought
This is what I was going to say! Would be cool :)
Oh that does look cool

You’re freaking awesome for hosting a contest!! I don’t qualify bc I’m in the US ... BUT Lemme tell you, I’ve never met a group of friendlier, loving, supportive, sweeter and funnier people than everyone in this subgroup that I’ve come across!! Sooo many thanks to so many people for picking me up while I was/am in my worst! But I’m gonna try...   Thank you for being in my life! UK contest only u/space_noodlers u/doesyawannasnog u/gdarn16
My future plan. I suffer from PCOS so my goal this year I to try and attempt to help get in control and hopefully attempt to try for a baby.   I am taking it one day at a time but keeping my chin up and trying what I can.
You are the SWEETEST doing a positivity contest ❤️❤️ currently the thing that keeps me going is everytime baby laughs. Can be feeling so drained and awful and bleh and then he smiles at me, and he chuckles and my whole body just melts ❤️ Also,chatting with this crazy bunch of people I met online who never fail to make me smile ;) Love you xxxx
I want to compliment everyone on RAOA site honestly You are awesome how kind and generous it makes me feel so positive every time I logon.  In lockdown I am mostly working but other than that I am journalling so when it comes back two years in the future I can see what we actually went through. I’m also cooking a lot of different recipes and making notes on them to perfect them for when I do come back to work.  I happy memory I have is taking my 93-year-old grandad to the Victorian living village where his dementia disappeared and his memory came flooding back, the people there are in gauging with him and he was telling us all sorts of stories that we thought were lost in his brain. It reminds us that there is always a person behind the dementia no matter what I have going on on the outside.   And sometimes I think I’m too nice, I’ve been told that and I have to be less nice. But how can I do that with it being horrible I don’t want to do that 😂
I am spending the lockdown doing a cross stitch for my nans birthday!
My happiest memory from being a child would be Christmas at my granny's with all the family. My happiest memory as an adult was finding out I was pregnant ❤.   I'm only new to the group & have found every person I have interacted with has been amazing in their own special way. It had made my day finding this group.   My daughter has been keeping me entertained during the lockdown so doing lots of tummy time and activities with her has been fun.   In the future I would love to travel the world with my daughter & fiance. But at least one holiday would be nice for now lol.   To help others during lockdown I have been picking up their medication and helping to get others shopping in so that they are not feeling overly stressed about running out.   Iv just kind of told you a bit of everything I hope this is OK lol.
I’ll be extra and do all the things because I’m procrastinating.  But first I am complimenting YOU because I am going to beat you to death with kindness if I have to 😉 You are so lovely, caring, intelligent, and all round fun person and just a pleasure to know.  And if that’s not acceptable then I shall also compliment u/adorablyunhinged because they are a sweetheart and just the kindest and most compassionate soul 💜  Apparently I am keeping myself ‘entertained’ with Discord this week but otherwise I’ve started on the Netflix crime series 😂  A happy memory is a New Years Party I hosted in 2019. It was so fun and carefree and just a really good night.  A future plan is hopefully getting back into my profession! I’m so close 🤞  Also rats are positive to me so I’m telling you ‘rats’ 🐀 Any excuse to bring them up tbh.
One of my happiest memories from last year is paddling with my family in a river near to us. Just one of those days where the sun was shining, all my loved ones were near and we were ‘adventuring’ along the river!  Thanks for the contest 💜
Not entering.   Welcome back. You are a great person. You can achieve whatever you want just believe in yourself.   Have an awesome day.
I'm going to tell u/poisonedmonkey how fantabulous he is! A superstar teacher and a superstar dad. I'm pleased I've got to know you this last year.   I think being nice makes for a better life, to loose some judgement and remember your manners makes for a better world. Be kind people ❤
To keep entertained in lockdown the third I've been doing lots of puzzles with my mum! Its lovely to get to spend more time with my family than I normally would, even though it it is in such weird circumstances!
Future plan: total and complete upheaval and I'm REALLY freaking excited! 🙂🙂🙂   Oh, sorry, I'm not in the UK but I still wanted to share! You guys say "Cheers!" Right? CHEERS!!! 😀😀
You the bomb diggedy bees knees, you know that right?
I've been trying to stay positive, making and sending postcards/mail. It's been really fun so far and I like using different washi tape and stickers. I'm also trying to cook more and eat healthy food with my family. It's been fun trying out new things :)
Thank you everyone for entering! The raffler has selected u/[purple\_pasta77](https://www.reddit.com/user/purple_pasta77/) - gifted post to follow!
Hi and welcome back.  Your username also describes me so I think it’s pretty rad.  I’m not entering but wanted to say that!
Sharing my fav joke that always makes my friends smile: How do you tell the difference between a crocodile and an alligator? You will see one later and one in a while.🐊   Something else that's positive: ofc due to the UK lockdown we aren't able to see my family, especially my mum has a new puppy. Yesterday I Facetimed the puppy and told her to sit, and she did 😍🐶   [wishlist ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/CDQP6YS0HB9M) Thank you for the contest 😊
Gosh lockdown the third, may it please be the last.  Something that's keeping me positive is thinking forwards to this summer. If everything goes to plan I should be in santorini with my partner watching his brother get married!! And to keep me positive in this lockdown I'm trying to eat healthy and exercise so I don't look awful 😂😂  How about you??  Thanks for the contest

Awwwwwww ;\_; you're so so so sweet! I love this comment.
I feel for you- I also have PCOS and it's just awful. I have complete faith in you though- you're going to take control and I'll keep my fingers crossed that you'll have a baby on the way before the end of the year!  Give me a shout if you ever want to chat/vent about anything- I know it's tough and I'll always be a sympathetic ear x
Sending you all the baby dust 💖. I'm always here if you need to talk or some support. x
Love you too! I promise that everything I know about being sweet, I've learned from you! That is so lovely- he is so lucky to have you and what doesn't melt your heart like baby laughs (other than me of course) <3
That's such a lovely memory! Dementia is an awful disease- I'm so glad you got to spend time with him where he wasn't so affected by it for a while.  Everyone on here is lovely without a doubt!
This is NICE! moments with your grand dad, (mine past Thursday) he lived to 89....and don’t change who you are, maybe there’s not a mean streak in your bones.
Such a lovely memory 💜
I'm constantly amazed at people's craftiness! What are you making for your nan?
This is my plan for the week. I bought somethings to do a cross stitch for my mums birthday. I am in no way crafty but let’s give it a try!
Welcome to the group! I've been so fortunate to make some really great friends on here, I hope you only have positive experiences!   I also miss going on holiday- my aim to travel to 30 countries before I turn 30 is looking like it'll be harder to meet at this rate. I had hoped to go travelling for a month in October once I had done my Masters but I think looking at the situation I might have to postpone that!  You've been a hero during lockdown! That's an amazing thing to do- it's such a simple thing but makes all the difference to people who are vulnerable or isolating!
You are so extra, but I expected nothing less ;) I will accept all the compliments as long as you know that I'm secretly crying and think the same of you!     But HOW MANY rats?
Cattssss no fair 😭😭 I love you, hahahaha entertained that's one way to put this week! You are so much of how I've managed to get through this week I am so grateful to you!!!!
There's not been enough adventuring recently! I'm so glad you managed to get that time with the family- can't think of anyone more deserving xoxo
That’s lovely, thank you so much!! Hope you have a great day too :)
I forgot to reply to this (you know what I'm like) but this was such a lovely thing to say, thank you :)
I'm so glad you're able to do that- this past year has been such an odd one! What has your latest puzzle been like?
Share your plans away! That sounds nerve-wracking but really exciting!  We do indeed- cheers for commenting!
That's awesome- I love getting post and write back and forth with a friend and my grandparents! I am not that creative though unfortunately- I just have to focus on making sure my handwriting is readable! What's been your favourite thing to cook?
😻😸
Love ya lots!!!
Aww, thank you! 💚💜💚💜
That is very sweet of you! I'm so glad you joined us here! 😊💚💚
[awwwwww man. i’m feeling all warm and fuzzy!! love you too!!! we have so many plans - boba, gallivanting in georgia and jetting off to korea! you’re the best!](https://imgur.com/a/4cN2omP)
Right back atcha friend! 💜
You realize it's UK silly...... But yeah their awesome for doing a contest and wanting nice people!  Oh and you rock!! Keep being your wonderful self!
Thank you for being in my life! You are sooo sweet 💗💗   This sub really is full of great people 🥰
love you!! 💗💗💗
Love you so much more!!
❤️❤️❤️ thank you for being so sweet! I’m happy to know you!
Thank you lovely. The same goes to you. PCOS can be one of those things that’s just constantly lurking in the back of your head.  x
Thank you lovely. ❤️
You are def a heart melter! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Mine passed in October so I love thinking of the memories to get me through this
It should end up as a picture of her dog that died last year. I know she is planning on putting a few pictures of her up on a wall in her house so I thought she might like the cross stitch.
I am sure it will be wonderful! I absolutely love cross stitch, though I am still constantly making mistakes!
Thank you ❤.   The way things are going it feels like we will never be able to leave home. A holiday is what I look forward to every year. But hopfully we get some sort of normality soon.   Thank you, it definitely is. My grandparents have only met my daughter once and i am very close with them. But I'm hoping once everyone has the vaccine my daughter can have the same amazing memories with them that I have had.
18 baby rats of course! 🐀😉
🥺❤️ I love you too!
You’re such a love. When things are better we’ll go adventuring in Hundred Acre Wood 🐻 💜
I’m currently working on one with 2 seals, with snowy mountains behind them!
Nerve wracking as HELL 😁 Whats a little fear in life, right??? 😂😂
Yeah I definitely need to improve my handwriting lol I like to make some japanese food like okonomiyaki (which is a cabbage pancake) or japanese curry. They're both quite easy to make. Also salmon teriyaki!
You’re the best!! That’s why we’re doing all those things!!
Omgosh I just saw your link and it’s soooo ... ugh you’ve got me in a nutshell!!!
Well fine, the message still stands though!! Lol I’ll delete these and put them in the daily thread! lol
It is! I've found mine is affecting me more and more as I've got older too- my hair falling out is the newest one!
I’m going to take you up on that! It’ll be a game of Pooh sticks you won’t win!
Life's all about taking risks. I had a teacher that used to shout about complacency a lot... he was talking about revision but I also always think about him whenever I get a bit too comfortable in life!
It’s such an annoying syndrome. I don’t know about you but I’m always exhausted. I’m having tests this week to try and get out on medication to help regulate things.  I hope you aren’t suffering too badly.
Yes!! Exactly! Theres a huge world out there and if we sit around and not make big moves/changes, we will miss out on SO much life has to offer!

Hey guys, as the title says today is my 29th birthday. Unfortunately I don’t feel too happy today. Pretty down in the dumps for a lot of reasons. Nothing to do with the actual age, just the way I feel about how my life has progressed.   But! I thought a little contest would probably be a little bright spot in the midst of my doom and gloom lol  So, for this contest do whatever you want: a little joke, a little life advice, a funny meme, an instant pot recipe, a Netflix show that I could binge the day away to (I finished bridgerton already), doesn’t matter   Rules: US only, must have posted an intro and have gifted before (doesn’t matter how long ago). Have something $5-10 on your list with free shipping (I don’t have prime)  [CLOSED] I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who entered. I appreciate your words of kindness and support, they really did make me feel a tad bit brighter. I appreciate the jokes and the instant pot recipes! Even the cute videos and pictures of your pets :) I’ve also gotten a lot of shows to add to my watch list on Netflix. Thank you all honestly from the bottom of my heart. I tried to reply to everyone saying thank you.   I’m going to try to pick a winner between today and tomorrow, even though I wish I could’ve gifted every one of you. Again, thank you!
Happy Birthday!  My 29th was kinda blah as well, i think 29 is an age when you start to think about what you have done and what you want to do. Don't be sad, you have a lot of years ahead to make your life what you want it to be. Im 30 years older than you, and I remember my 29th. Its a growing year, you will love it before its over
Knock Knock!    *Who’s there?*    Omar.    *Omar who?*     Omar gosh, it’s your birthday!
Happy Birthday! When I feel down I like to google Snoop Dogg Narrates Plizanet Earth. [Here’s a link to one ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-7UbU45a1U) And there’s several more. I hope you’re able to find some smiles and laughs today. 29 is a great age :D Thanks for hosting!
I’m not in the US but just wanted to wish you a happy birthday! Keep smiling lovely! I’d also recommend watching ‘End of the f****** world’ on Netflix :)
Did you like Futurama?  There is a show by the same people called Disenchantment and it's set in a medieval world with a rebellious princess, a tiny devil, and an elf who doesn't want to be an elf.  There are 2 seasons, I'm not sure if the third season is out yet.
Happy birthday! Are you doing anything to celebrate?  You should check out Sweet Home on Netflix. It is really good.
Not in the US but just wanted to send you a happy birthday message.   ❤️
Happy birthday! I totally understand hating where you’re at in life. I get like that a lot. One thing I do is look back at all the times my life could have turned out way worse though.   Did you like Bridgerton? I haven’t seen it yet.
Hi there, I'm not here to participate but to give you a little advice. Don't get upset about where you are in life. Everyone goes at their own pace. I'm about to be 31 and I just finally went back to school. Do what makes you happy and take life one day at a time. Be kind to and considerate of others and it will all fall into place. Life isn't a race, take it slow and take it all in :) Sending you happiest of Birthday wishes ♥
Happy birthday! I hope you enjoy your day ❤️https://youtu.be/jgfu30N-zpY
Happy birthday! Sorry to hear you aren't too joyful about it. But try to remember that 29 is still young and you have lots of time ahead of you to do great things (or small things that bring you happiness). Lots of "great" people didn't create their art, write their novels, or make discoveries until their older years.   As for things to binge, if you like sort of cheesy horror, highly recommend Harper's Island. Not sure if it's on Netflix though.  Thanks for the contest!!
Happy birthday!! 🥳 here is a virtual birthday party for you! 🎉🥳🎂🎊🍰🎈🍾🛍🎁🎊🎈🎆🎇🥰  Also, this recipe is the best for the instant pot! [yummy ](https://pin.it/7v4hhKi)
Happy birthday! I’m sorry you aren’t feeling the greatest. Just know how loved and appreciated you are! You deserve the world! [here’s my baby butters ](https://www.instagram.com/p/B42c4_vHf6w/?igshid=7bpmz0n5zboo) peekin around to say hi!
Happy Birthday! I get pretty bummed out on mine as well. I’ll be 29 this year too.   [Here’s](https://youtu.be/KQ5bUkk6iW0) a video to remind you of the little things in life. (NSFW: language)
Happy Birthday!!! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAQmRO42UHc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAQmRO42UHc)
Happy birthday~ I know it's not much but sending virtual hugs your way!  A good Netflix show would be Disenchantment or The Good Place
Happy Birthday I hopes this year is wonderful for you 😌  https://imgur.com/gallery/TcdWK
Happy birthday!!!
Not entering but happy birthday to you x
I just turned 28 and I totally feel like ive just been spinning my wheel for a few years. We are still young. You can do whatever it us you feel like you should be doing💚    I think you should watch the new Netflix series in the Night Stalker (if you're into that sort if thing). I watch/listen to/read a ton about true crime and there was stuff i had never heard about this case before!! It was really good
Happy Birthday!!!!! Not entering, but wanted to say H.B. and recommend Psych! You can get all seasons for free on Peacock!  Also, its been a tough year, here's to hoping that this next year is a great one for you!!!! ❤
Happy birthday!!!! You should watch The Good Place!
Happy Birthday I hope you feel better!! Are you the one is the perfect trashy reality show to bring up your spirits!
Happy birthday! I just turned 29 as well! Here's one of my favorite jokes:   There's a woman who has never ridden a horse before. She gets on the horse, and it immediately starts going very fast. She starts to slip. The horse keeps going. Soon, she's dangling off the horse. The horse keeps going. Then, just as she is about to fall, our hero, the store manager, comes out and unplugs the horse.    I hope that helped to put a smile on your face. :)
Happy birthday to you  I'm sorry you feel blue  I'd offer a hug from afar  But instead I'd take us to a bar  We'd drink a glass of coke  I'd tell you my best worst joke  You'd be laughing in about thirty...  Seconds that is  Admit it, you thought I was going to rhyme "dirty"  Instead I was a bit more coy and flirty   No limits on what our day would hold  We would do nothing we were told  A day of adventure with no rules  My goal would be to spend time with yous 🙂  Perfect strangers turned friendship strong  Maybe we were meant to be friends all along 🙂  I hope this poem brightens your birthday  And you found a little happiness along the way   😀😀 Happy Birthday!
Happy birthday! If you've got Netflix and are looking for a pick-me-up, you should totally watch Rilakkuma and Kaoru. It's pretty short, too. It came out on my 19th birthday, and I needed a pick-me-up then, and ever since that day it's been my go-to when I'm down.   Oh, and remember life isn't a competition. What matters is your own personal satisfaction, so if you aren't happy, change something for yourself and yourself alone, dear.
You might like the show Hilda 🥰 it’s adorable and filled with mysterious lore. Let me know if you want some birthday support. Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, don’t uhh... [do this.. 🥓 ](https://imgur.com/a/Bhay7Dm)
Happy Birthday! Take a few deep breaths and recognize that you are here and plan to do a few things that make you happy. Maybe go for a drive to a scenic spot, walk, listen to your favorite music, or eat dessert for lunch.   Netflix suggestions  - Glee, The Kaminsky Method, NCIS, Stranger Things or Supermarket Sweep.  Here's a gorilla enjoying nature. [photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/B30iu2rH-91/?igshid=1atbsawew6tgk)

Hey.  Not entering.  29 was hard for me.  I was pretty unhappy about life progression also.  I’m 39 now and I can say that 29 was much harder for me than 39.  I guess the difference is at 39 you give a lot fewer fucks than you do at 29.  Dunno what that means about being 49!  Try not to compare your journey with any one else’s.  And try to remember you’re doing a terrific job even if it doesn’t feel that way.  Sorry you’re down on your birthday.  If you want to talk, feel free to shoot me a PM.
Hey! Not entering! I remember when I turned 30, and was bummed because my friends were getting married, having kids, and had better jobs etc.  but I then also realized that I can’t compare my self to others because their journey was different than mine. Your journey is perfect for you even when it feels like it’s a mess! I hope everything begins to look up!
Happy birthday! I’m sorry that you’re not feeling so well today. I hope that you can still make the best of your special day!  You should totally binge How To Sell Drugs Online (Fast) or Sex Education! They’re both AMAAAZING Netflix series!  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
Wish you a very happy birthday. Sorry you are feeling low.   I know the times are hard, but maybe try to give yourself some change. May be just go for a long drive or even go out somewhere around nature (obviously be safe and not got to crowded places). Or just sleep in or read a book or watch tv. Just spend some me time. It will probably help.   Hope you have a good day. Once again wish you a very happy birthday. Take care.
Happy birthday!  Please try not to be so hard on yourself. I like to think that everything in life happens for a reason. You may be unhappy where you are now, but as long as you hold onto hope and keep improving yourself, the future holds so much potential of being better. Life is tough and you're doing the best that you can, which is what matters 💙  I hope this album of my pitbull [Zeus with his stuffed animals](http://imgur.com/a/q9o9lGR) will help to put a smile on your face. He would definitely lick you if he could :-)
Happy birthday! Sorry you’re feeling down, but hope these comments help turn that around   [random meme](https://imgur.com/qNqtcVC)
Sorry things are tough. Life is ebb and flow, and significant points can make it feel more intense. I find music helps!   Here’s a lil playlist for you. Happy(or kinda happy or so-so, but you got this) birthday!   turn it up and dance!](https://youtu.be/BEJh-aMMpJ0)  [or this](https://youtu.be/_ovdm2yX4MA)  Maybe a little  [Bon Jovi?](https://youtu.be/vx2u5uUu3DE)  [go ahead , sway with your sadness, but play this ](https://youtu.be/7eul_Vt6SZY)  [then sing along with this a couple times. ](https://youtu.be/Y_ZzAABhmzk)  Love to you on the day we celebrate you in the world.

Relax and enjoy your special day. Thanks for the contest!!! You rock!
Happy birthday! I'm sorry you are feeling down, I hope you feel better and are able to enjoy your day.  🎂🥳💚  One of my favorite Instant Pot recipes! [Beef Stroganoff.](https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/best-easy-instant-pot-beef-stroganoff/) So good and so easy. We've done it with chicken and pork as well and just substitute chicken stock for the beef stock. 😊  Thank you for the contest! 💚
Happy Birthday! Sorry you’re feeling really weird. I know it isn’t easy at all, but you’re going to be okay! Everything will turn out fine and the cloudy sky will clear up. You’re strong!!   You probably don’t have the same sense of humor I do but there’s this dog video i keep watching and it makes me giggle always. It’s the ugliest yet cutest dog ever and the little nibbles at the end make me laugh!! Here [you go](https://youtu.be/LeKBTjp6BTM)  I hope your day gets better. We’re all here for you!!!! Take a break, watch tv, relax, or take a nap. It’s your day! Be happy, sunshine ☀️
Happy Birthday!!!! I’m sorry you’re feeling a bit down but I totally relate to things not having turned into quite the way you hoped or thought they would. But please know that you are wonderful and an amazing person!!!   Here’s [a funny video ](https://youtu.be/ghEE8-gxmPE)I hope makes you smile!!  As for the Netflix shows, if you like historical I highly recommend the following: Versailles; The Tudors; Borgia; and The Borgia (two different shoes about the same family).
Happy birthday!  I’m going to suggest you Sense8 on Netflix. It’s like no other show I’ve ever seen
Last year of your twenties! Wooo! Hope you have the happiest birthday yet.
Happy birthday!! I tend to get a little down on my birthday, too. As I get older it gets a little harder 😂  I’m not entering, just wanted to send some love.
I’d recommend the show “Documentary Now!” It’s a mockumentary series. It has Fred Armisen (from Portlandia) in it.
Happy birthday!  Dont let these days get you down! Whenever I am feeling down about something in my life I try to figure out what steps I can take to change that, and then start working towards it:) Easier said than done but I believe in you!
I too have struggled with my progress in life compared to others. It can be a really upsetting and it makes it easy to be really hard on myself. But, in all honesty, we’re all so different, how much sense does it really make for us to all follow the same path at the same time? It’s not realistic. People who don’t follow the college right out of high school, marriage right out of college, babies by 27 thing, but we’ve been taught it’s shameful, so none of us feel confident saying, “hey, I didn’t take the traditional route, it’s okay.” Hang in there. I hope you can find some joy today. Kim’s Convenience and Derry Girls are good. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
Happy Birthday! I'm sorry today isn't going the way you planned. But, I understand the progress thing. I found though that I'm always comparing my worst to someone else's best and that makes me feel worse.   I just finished binging Bridgerton and am now reading the books! It's a different kind of show, but we started watching Cobra Kai and like it. Have you watched that yet?
Happy birthday friend! I hope tomorrow is a better day, and I hope these comments make you smile a little. You got this. Don’t forget that you are wonderful, talented, and loved!   [Here’s](https://youtu.be/7aXowlMZQK8) a link to my favorite joke! It’s silly and innocent and always makes me giggle! :)  Thanks for hosting!
Happy birthday! I hope that this year you find yourself on a good life path and make good memories.  I just finished Bridgerton today. I bawled. So good, and that twist at the end! I want to go back and watch it all now.  Have you watched Dickinson? It's so fun! It is about Emily Dickinson's life, but with contemporary slang and stuff. It feels very relatable. The second season is airing now.
Happy birthday! I know it may feel like you haven't made as much progress in your life as you expected to by this point in time, but you have to give credit to yourself where it is due; you have overcome so many obstacles in life *AND* you are still in the midst of a crazy pandemic that no one was planned for... and yet here you are with many years ahead of you to kick ass and take names! Just because you don't feel you measure up to where you thought you'd be doesn't necessarily mean you've accomplished nothing. It means that sometimes life had other plans, and you adapted and learned, and that is something you'll be able to carry forward in the years coming so you can get to where you're going. You got this!  [Here's a little something to hopefully cheer you up!](https://imgur.com/a/TuiKDFD) 🙂
Happy Birthday!!!!!! I loved watching In the Dark on Netflix.
I’m sorry you’re feeling down on your birthday. That’s never fun. Well Happy Birthday anyway. I hope you still had a good day. Thank you for feeling generous.   On Netflix I really enjoy The Blacklist, The Haunting of Hill House, Dexter, and Ozark. I can’t say I have any good advice but I hope you feel better soon.
I know how it is to be down. Here is my derpy cat being himself at chirstmas. [https://imgur.com/gallery/bR8vSPd](https://imgur.com/gallery/bR8vSPd)
I’m watching “night stalker” right now on Netflix. Pretty good if you like true crime.   Schitts creek if you haven’t already.
Happy 29th birthday! I’m sorry you weren’t feeling happy today. I hope it got better. Hugs!   What did the janitor say when he jumped out of the closet? >!Supplies!!<  I have an item on my list with free shipping. I know the struggle of not having prime. It stinks.
Happy Birthday!!! What’s a cow’s favorite holiday? >!Moo Years Eve!! !<  I’m not sure if you’re into Korean dramas, but I’m watching one called Mr. Sunshine right now, and it is so good! Highly recommend.
I will die on this hill. WYNONNA EARP. It's so funny and does not take itself seriously. Melanie Scrofano is the best at making expressions and faces. And Dominque is the cutest little demon researcher since Willow Rosenberg!  And also? I know you said this birthday was down for you, but I hope that these little notes help you to smile a little. I don't know you, but I'm pretty sure you deserve a giant hug and cake if you want it.
Happy Birthday!  Remember it’s never too late to go after what you want in life.  I’ve been watching Virgin River on Netflix. It’s so good!
Happy Birthday!  [LOL.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2a/7f/09/2a7f094cfe011ae4b0978195d7fa9149.jpg)
Q1AAzúrl Q ppl lol óo it's d,jjnn  Kjjn
Thank you so much for this. I really hope I do 🙏🏽
😂 thank you
Whattt I didn’t know this existed
I’ll give it a watch! Thank you
I’m going to check this out, quite a few people recommended it
I wasn’t in a celebratory mood, but i will check it out! Thank you for the suggestion!
Thank you!
That’s true, I have to practice being more grateful.   It’s a genre I don’t really look at a lot, but I did enjoy it! I binged it lol
Thank you for your words. I’ve been finding it very hard to figure out what makes me happy. And I’ve been having a hard time doing a lot of the thing that bring me some sort of joy, since they may require other people (say hiking for example because solo activities for a woman isn’t encouraged in my parts because of crime)  But I did discover yoga and while I’m the beginnerest beginner, I’ve been enjoying it. And it doesn’t rely on others so that’s a big plus
The cutest video! Thank you 😊
Thank you, I try to keep those things in mind. But it’s very hard sometimes tbh. I’ll check out your suggestion!
Thank you! I’ll try it maybe today 😅
The cutest peek! Thank you 😊
I loved this! I’m saving it for future use lol.   Tbh, I struggle with being grateful. I feel like right now I have let the bad outweigh the good quite a lot. So this video was pretty spot on. Also, I love banana bread!
This was hilarious!
Thank you for the hugs 😊 and I’ll check both of those out!
Haha! Thank you
Thank you bud!
Thank you :)
The problem is I don’t know what I should be doing or what I want to do. I feel mighty directionless :/   I’ll definitely check it out.
Thank you and I’ll check it out 😊
I’ve been seeing this a lot, I’ll definitely check it out! Thank you 😊
Sure! Hit me
😂😂 it did!
Damn you are mighty creative!
Thanks a lot for your wisdom, it’s exactly what I have to do. And I’ll check them out
Thank you for your offer :) I’ll check it out, I’ve never heard of it before
Haha! The bacon fried him instead 😅
I’ve watched three of those, so I’ll check out the other two :) thank you
So dapper with his little tie!
Thank you for your offer, and I just might take you up on it. I hope it only gets better honestly because I feel so lost and lonely and directionless atm. No fun at all
Wow thank you. It’s a lot of this and a lot of me being lonely and not really having a friend or friends I can count on.
Thank you friend :)
That’s what I did, I spent the day literally alone with myself. It was really hard. But also I think very needed as I haven’t been alone In years, and I’ve found myself alone since last year.   It was also relaxing, so that’s a plus lol. Thank you
Omg he is the cutest!!   And thank you for your kind words. I do feel like I’m not doing my best though, and haven’t for a long long time. I’m not even sure what that is anymore, or what I should apply it to, but I guess that’s what I’m going to have to figure out so that there’s not a similar contest at 30 lol
Haha! I love it 😅
Thank you so much! I’m going to play these in a bit :) so thoughtful
Thank you for your randomness 😅 and also your wise words :)
Thank you, it’s exactly what I need
Thank you friend, I’m saving all of these recipes to try!
It seems easy enough, I’ll give it a go this week because I have all of those ingredients already in my fridge!  And thank you :)
That dog is the strangest 😅😅  Thank you for your words 😊
I’m sending that video to my mom 😅  I did watch Versailles, so I’ll check out your other recommendations :)  And thank you 😊
Thank you! I’ve watched it! And I find it pretty good as well
Thank you 😊
Thank you my friend. It’s exactly what I need
I’ll check it out!
That’s exactly the point I find myself. Asking what do I want and how do I get there.
Thank you my friend 🙏🏽
I haven’t watched Cobra Kai, for some reason I don’t feel like I’ll like it 🤔
This made me chuckle! Thank you! And thank you for your words my friend
I didn’t and I’ll definitely check it out!   I sorta guessed it was Pen when it came out that Marina was preggo and they showed Pen crying to Eloise. Imagine the guilt she felt!
Thank you for your words. It honestly hit the spot. And your cute doggos too :)
Thank you, I’ll check it out!
I’ll check out the blacklist, because that’s the only one on your list I haven’t watched 😅
So cute!
Thanks, I’ll check them out!
Haha thank you!   And it does stink 😅
I’ve never watched any, but another person recommended two others. So maybe it’s time I experiment lol
I also just noted your name is miMOOshka, so fitting for your joke lol
Dominique is super cute.
Thank you my friend. I’ll check it out.
Time to figure out exactly what that is.   I’ll check it out!
😂 thank you!
Hahaaa! I love introducing people to this!! Enjoy lolol!! It’s my gift you :D
It's a Korean series by the way, but there's English dubbed if you don't want to read subtitles.
Yea I feel like a lot of things in that genre are very hit or miss.   Hope you are feeling better!
Yeah it was fun trying to find something for you! Did you have a good birthday? I hope you did 😊
I hear you. Best of luck! Always here if you need to vent.
He says hi and happy birthday!
Glad you liked it haha
Yay!!
That’s a very very easy feeling to have, especially right now during the quarantine. This is a time where you can, 1. Reach out to your friends and let them know how you are feeling, 2. Find out more about you as a person, find out what you love and what you are going to accomplish in this 29th year around the sun. 2020, was a shot show and yes, January is looking very 2020ish, but you got this!
That’s great that you had a relaxing day.
You’re so welcome!
That's fair. It's a little nostalgic for me because I loved the movies as a kid. It's a little cheesy, but it has some redemption stories that I like.
She was on my list of suspects, but Lady Danbury took first place so I was ultimately surprised! I was pretty sure it wasn't Madame Delacroix though. It was just too neat and easy. Perhaps she is an accomplice?
You’re very welcome ❤️
It’s a roller coaster of a show :)
Ooh I didn’t think about the possibility of accomplices
One person can't possibly acquire all that information by herself!

Ohh I like that design!

Thank you /u/josephineismyhero you're amazing and you put a smile on my face today. 💜
That’s amazing
It's so cool
Its 30x30inches
Thank you
Hope it beats the boredom!🧡🧡
Whoa!!! Definitely need it to get the detail on the tree branches. I bet it's gonna look amazing when finished. Good luck with it!
Definitely will
Ya, I'm thinking of getting a led light board to do these on.

Ooh I just got far cry 4! But for ps3! Maybe we can go on this journey together??
u/jkpenrod Thank you!! I was super excited to try on the dress...only to discover the zipper is stuck and won't budge one bit! I'll have to find a way to fix it because it's definitely a super pretty dress! :-)
Oh no! I will see if I can send you a gift receipt so you can return or exchange it!
It seems like maybe the stitching is just too tight in one area and the zipper is unable to fit through it

Nah go blackhawks!!
u/Amandaisacult The Random Wishlist Generator picked you, but I do want to say **GO AVS!**

Do I need to remind you of the scores from last season?  |Avs|Blackhawks| |:-|:-| |5|2| |7|3| |4|1| |3|5| |**19**|**11**|  Just sucks we don't play you this season, I work with a Blackhawks fan and makes for some good banter when we do play each other.
Yay!!! Thank you so much!!! I love me a good pair of socks.
Thank you,  I just needed to be a little different.

You are very welcome and I am glad you liked it.
Yes!!
Yes it is!!
Yay!!! I can’t wait to read it all!!
What are you going to grow this season? I want to do more corn and carrots
I want to do some tomatoes and some more cucumbers!
My sister did cucumbers this year and they just kept coming!!! No idea what she did but this one plant produced soooo many!
Wow! That’s so funny!

CLOSED    I'm in the middle of a snow storm and trying to come up with ideas of things to do. So I would like your suggestions on what to do and what you would do? I will gift someone something to do this winter from their list. Closes on Tuesday.
u/aereolagrande and u/vindictable will have some good ideas!
I'm not in Canada, so I can't actually be in this contest, I just want to comment that I miss being able to go to Canada since the border closed (for non-essentials) last year. I used to drive across just to stock up on Canadian snack food ^(and totally not alcohol because who would do such a thing) every month or two :)
My first idea is to keep that snow in Quebec and not send it to Ontario 😜  When I’m trapped inside I usually use it as an opportunity to deep clean or purge my closets and cupboards. That doesn’t sound fun though, I know.   I’m always a fan of finding a new book to curl up with.    If you’re into cooking shows there’s a really cool one on Netflix right now called Final Table...I’ve been bingeing on that lately.   Build yourself a snowman!   Write a letter to someone you miss...even if you don’t send it.   Find a new recipe and try it out.   And above all, keep warm and safe!
I would like some snow, you can dump it all in BC if you need lol  BC doesn’t really have much especially where I live but last year was so intense so I recommend a nice mug of hot cocoa and doing some cross stitching OR clean out your closet and set aside what you don’t need and keep it in a separate box to give away or make a quick buck or two. You could do those diamond paintings since those take forever to complete it or do a 1000 pieces puzzle.   You can also indulge in any baking/cooking of dishes that may take a while and play netflix in the background. :)))  Stay safe though!! Your safety is number one priority (‘w’)
Take advantage of the daylight to do things you won't be able to do as easily if the power goes out -- reading, jigsaw puzzles, etc. Make sure all of your electronics are charged and maybe download a movie or two onto a tablet. If the power goes out, you'll have some entertainment.
You in Montreal? Cause I heard there’s a storm there rn. A few suggestions for an activity you could do during the storm is to play some board games it’s fun for the entire family, a movie marathon for any movie series or certain actresses or actors, you can also play video games too, you can bake some cookies or cakes or anything you crave, you could also start to organize or do things you have been neglecting it’s fun to reorganize your pantry while listening to nostalgic music, if you have kids it’s fun to play hide and seek in the house with them, you could make a dinner party with just your family at home, you could take a nap, and lastly I would suggest you could organize a trivia night if you don’t have enough ppl you can use zoom to play with your friends. Why I personally would do is I’d play video games all day. Last time there was a snow storm I played video games with my brother. Another thing I would do is organize and clean the apartment when we were in quarantine I took it upon myself to clean the house. I hope I gave you some ideas on what you could do. We rarely have snow storms where in Vancouver and when we do they only last a day 😂
My fellow Canadian, I feel you! Make some delicious food, bust out the popcorn, make some tea, and watch some Netflix! You should also go onto your local library's website and order some books to pick up once the snowstorm wraps up. Maybe use this time to do some spring cleaning. Get a sweat on inside and get a fitness video on (lots of youtube videos are set up for 'no equipt required' if you live in a small space and don't have fancy gym stuff).  Stay warm and cosy!
If you like being outside in the snow then build a snowman!   If you don't want anything to do with outside right now then I would watch Netflix, maybe find a new show you can binge. You could also play board/card games or video games! Maybe paint or do some kind of crafts?   You could also use the time inside to clean or organize.
A snowstorm is the perfect time for a movie marathon with popcorn!
Build a lego set!
Craft projects are perfect to keep busy inside! You can even pop in a movie in the background 😁 and if you could send a bit of that snow to Ontario, I’d be more than grateful!
Built a cozy fort indoors and read or watch movies inside.   Crafting is always my favorite thing to do to pass the time. Or maybe a puzzle?
u/Zeunicorn sus
Take the most luxurious bath ever. Bubbles, hot chocolate or wine, a book or something to listen to, candles. Get out and lotion your entire body. It's winter and you know all your skin is dry! Put on cozy jammies and curl up on the couch with Netflix.
I always gather my candles and flashlights and download some Netflix shows to my phone/tablet in case the power goes out.  Then even if it doesn't I can have a cosy candlelit evening.  I generally draw all the blinds/curtains so I don't have to look at the storm, then turn on some cheery lights and music and cook a warm meal.  Unless I'm super in the mood, then I hunker down in my window chair with a blanket, a warm drink and a craft and watch it all go to hell 🤣
Hello fellow Canadian :)  Hmm since it’s snowy outside, I would suggest an Ultimate Mega Coziness Day.   First, take a long hot shower or bath, get into clean cozy and warm pjs or loungewear. Don’t forget warm socks! Then, set yourself up somewhere comfortable (likely the couch), with lots of pillows and blankets. When I do this I actually take my bed comforter and use it on the couch lol! After you’re all cozy and comfortable, watch a movie that you haven’t seen yet or haven’t seen in a while! Order in food, have some snacks throughout your cozy day, and you’re all set!
Here are some ideas based on what I've been doing- Do a paint by numbers (either paint or diamond) -Do a puzzle or model (there's so really cool 3d/escape/mystery ones) -Do a hook rug/cross stitch/other crafts -read a fun book -bake something new -learn sign language signs -learn how to make bath bombs/soap and then have a spa day -make some fancy popcorn, turn down the lights, and do a fake theatre night  \-Dance party, just blast some shit and rock out.
Hello fellow Canadian. When it snows I snuggle up and watch movies or read books with a hot drink
Do I ever! Haha
True story!  Haha.
Uhm no, send ALL THE SNOW to Ontario please!!
Ohhh its been awhile since I've done a puzzle, going to check Amazon and see what kind they have
Yup I'm in montreal
I'm sending it now lol I've located a diamond painting i havent done and some cross stitch patterns
Also, I would take snow over the deep freeze we are going into next week.
I entered already but thanks cookie bud! (I actually baked today again so I’ll have snacks for our watching party tomorrow 👀)
Second this idea, make sure all of your electronics are charged, all of your battery packs are charged, etc etc!
Why do you hate me?
They’ve got some really scenic pieces so I hope you find one that you’ll enjoy. Cause I know they have one that’s just pure white and it’s insane lol 😆
Woop woop! Cross stitch is also one of my go to! Have fun and send pictures of what you end up doing!
Whoo! Cookies!
[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/AFg89Pb) evidence of our last bad snow storm a couple of years ago.  I was lucky I had some Netflix saved to the toddler's tablet.  It got cold quickly in our house and I had to close us in one room.  She would have gone nutty very quickly without it.
I don’t hate you, I just LOVE snow 😇
I found a a puzzle thats all clear pieces lol
Will do.  I just got a new diamond painting in the mail,  so many choices lol
Omg I can imagine! Lol
You obviously don’t have a 5 car driveway to shovel 😂
Oh my Aphrodite what is this madness 😂 and I thought 1000 pieces of just pure white puzzle pieces were hellish enough
The two of us are lucky we live in places it doesn't snow much.  I was born in northern BC though and holy heck!  Hahaha.   Stay safe u/happiness0101!
Of course not, I don’t even have a sidewalk to clear out 😁
Lol the white one sounds horrible lol
Hahaha right omg luckily my town always has nicer weather than anywhere else. It’s hilarious it can be pouring rain in Richmond then you drive through the tunnel and it’s sunshine. 😹😹😹 we tend to get snow later in winter like late feb early March.
You’re welcome to come shovel mine any time.
Yeah my mom sent me a shocking picture earlier this winter with snow!  Hahaha.
Non 😈
LOL! It's always really surprising because it comes out of nowhere... we had a random day before Christmas where it started out pouring, turned to snow, snow stuck and covered everything in maybe an inch or two, turned back into pouring rain, and everything was melted by dinner. xD
Unsubscribe!
That's my kind of snowstorm.  Haha.
Don’t leave meeeeeeeee 🥺🥺🥺
Okay...but if it snows and I break my back having to shovel it’s over! ☠️
Fiiiiine I guess we can get just a little snow, not all the snow 🥺

Hello and welcome
Hello and welcome!
Welcome! How much of the musical do you have memorized?
I was told to post my amazon link in the comments, so I don't know here i guess? [https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2B5YES4164L8R/ref=cm\_wl\_huc\_view](https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2B5YES4164L8R/ref=cm_wl_huc_view)
I enjoy takis. They are great at keeping me focused during online lectures or late night work. My favorite song at the moment, that isn't hamilton, is either drivers license, or ruthless. Hamilton-wise, it's between well, all of them.
Dont worry! None of them have reddit. SSSHHHH!!!
My favorite holiday is probably the fourth of july. I get to go home to celebrate my little cousins birthday, and all the activities surrounding it. My favorite thing about nature is taking walks alone in the woods with my aunts dog. My parents have a river behind their house through the woods, and that is the most gorgeous walk ever.
all of it. I have watched it 175ish times and counting.
Nice! Idk drivers license or ruthless. I'll have to look those up. I really like the finale in Hamilton. I mean, I love all the songs, but the finale hits me hard.
Yes the 4th of July is another magical holiday. What kind of dog  Does your aunt and have?
That is epic! Do you feel like it inspired a love of American history too?   When I watched it I was surprised how much I remembered from history classes. It’s been about 10 years since I last took a history class so I was proud of myself lol
golden doodles
I have always loved history, so when I chose my major, (law) I was excited that I would be allowed to do history with it!
One of the cutest snuggles animals on the Earth❤🧸
Oh really? How is history incorporated into it, is it like when you’re looking for precedent?
Yes but also the beginning of the law system and developments in the law system.
That’s a great point! I love that you’re so passionate about it

Happy birthday to you both!
u/torisuta
Awww thank you kindly! Happy early birthday to you too! 🥳💛
I’m very excited this year!  My oldest was visiting and suddenly said “mom, you need to leave the room”. Her and my youngest had a whispered conference, called in my middle daughter and then later admitted that they were going in together to buy me a birthday present.   It’s driving me nuts not knowing.
Awww that's so sweet ☺️ I hope it's a special surprise! Sounds like it will be! I don't have plans this year, but I'll definitely be calling my biological twin to wish her a happy birthday as well. She's a HUGE Beatles fan, so I was thinking of getting her some more memorabilia for her collection. We used to sing "Yellow Submarine" together pretty much non-stop as kiddos.

u/mistermagellan thank you so much for this case — I really needed it to get my pens and pencils in order. It's such a pretty color and holds SO many pens. It's perfect! And I even decorated it already :D
Yay! You are very welcome, and you've already decorated it and filled it beautifully :D
Aw thank you! Yes it will be such a lifesaver and so positive with all my stickers :D

Lololololo gurl I know, don’t know how I’m surviving mom hood, I’m surprised myself with the bunch and nice to meet you...
Hiii!!! I don’t know but I do take “mom” breaks often lol... they range in different ages so getting a break is pretty easy when needed. I breezed through this last baby by putting duties on daddy, hahahaha I’m not even going to lie... they grow quick, how old?
Hello nice to meet you!!!  EVERYTHING! depends on the moment I’m in, lol... Usually it’s clothes and sneakers for myself! The kids are good so that’s a GO for me... I’ve been trying to get into my apartment more but these kids tear things up, so that definitely leans me toward myself...
Hi HAPPY NEW YEAR to you as well! My favorite HOLIDAY isssssss CHRISTMAS, it’s full of love, family time, shopping, happiness☺️and my kids happy anxiety lol...I definitely enjoy nature. I love to camp, sleeping in tents and roasting marshmallows (creating memories) with my boys. It’s a dope feeling!!
Hi there!!!
Hello there!!!
Thank you hi there!
Hi! Thank you, it was a kool idea...
Hiiii!!
Please send me your cold! Why is NYC so warm?
Mine are 5 and 3 and can find me wherever I try to hide!  Mom breaks sound amazing.  Whenever I walk out of the room they start biting each other or something like that but maybe I can have one of those soon.  What’s your favorite thing to do on mom breaks?
I hear you! I also like shopping for everything!! Clothes, books, housewares, you name it! What’s your favorite brand of sneakers?
You can have it!!!!! Lol
I gotta go with Nike, the vapor maxes are my heart right now, lol...

I’m not familiar with that one but it sounds comfy!! My most comfy pair of sneakers are Nike but I can’t remember the model.
I believe you because mine feel like your walking on air, look them up when you have time... Vapor Maxes...
Will do!! Thanks for the tip!

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kyjrao/discussion_whats_your_favorite_comfort_food/

buffalo chicken pizza with bleu cheese and crunchy celery!
Tteokbokki, Coca Cola, cheese pizza.    &#x200B;  What's funny is what my son thinks of as comfort food.  For him, it's berries.
Mashed potatoes and gravy!
Mac and cheese. I am allergic to wheat but Krafts gluten free Mac and cheese is still close to the real thing. It is a treat at the end of a rough day
cheeseburgers. if i have the money, wendy's is ideal, but I'll settle for mcdonalds. it's my favorite food period, how american of me. but second after that is definitely chex mix or pizza flavored combos. they were treats for me as a kid and were always my favorite snacks so getting to have them every so often is really nice
Loaded potato soup! With cheese, chives, bacon and sour cream.
As a french dude, its any cheese, or cheese based meal =D
Pasta carbonara, I haven't had it in so long!
Snack: Chocolate with a cup of English breakfast tea.   Meal: Beef stew with shortcrust pastry
Probably Mac and cheese, in any form
Definitely sausage and mash with gravy 😍
Tortellini soup, made by my mom of course
Pasta. Can be fancy like a well-planned, from scratch Lasagne or cold naked leftovers out of the fridge in the middle of the night. Can be any inspired by any culture or region. All are comforting.
Baked potato soup! I should actually make some soon....
Sautéed mushrooms with cheese ❤️❤️❤️
Mac n cheese or sweet potato casserole
Mashed potatoes with gravy, for sure.
Biscuits and gravy, breakfast sausage, hamburgers, also smoothies! That's my go-to for snacks or if I don't have the energy to cook something.
Tacos because that’s the only dish my mom would make 😂  Also Mac and cheese, grilled cheese and mashed taters with gravy from KFC
Any type of pasta
Pizza!
Ice cream 🍨
Mashed potatoes and white gravy or Hungarian goulash
It depends,  it currently, brownies
Soup.  Won ton, miso, or clear onion if I have the sads, tomato with a grilled cheese sammy if it's something more.  None of those heavy-ass cheese soups, though.  The point is to feel better, not go into cardiac arrest.
Pasta, potato soup, ice cream or M&Ms lol.
Anything chocolate...or cheesecake!
Mac n cheese, baked potato, and hot fudge chocolate cake
Boba milk tea for drink and mango cake for food
This is one of my favs 😍
That is one of the best tasting combos I've ever had for sure
Haha I love it! Health conscious little man :)
May I have your gravy recipe? ☺
I’m so happy you were able to find an alternative that works for you! I can definitely see myself finding comfort in a big bowl of Mac and cheese after a rough day as well :)
McDonald’s sometimes forgets to put the cheese into my burgers and once they gave me a chicken burger instead 😅
I love both Wendy’s and McDonald’s! Awesome choices!!
That sounds so good right now
Cheese should be a mandatory ingredient in every dish!
Yum! This is your sign to get it asap! I might have to as well, you brought on a craving a I didn't know I had :P
Amazing choices! Beef stew is definitely a comfort food for me as well. Is English breakfast your favorite kind of tea?
Delicious! Have you tried the broccoli cheddar mac and cheese from Panera? I have to say I'm a fan!
What kind of sausage do you use? That sounds really good!!!!
Of course! Moms cooking can’t be beat!
You’re absolutely right, pasta tastes great in any setting!
This sounds delicious. Please can you share the recipe?
Love it! Please do share your recipe!
That’s a new combo for me! I have to try it, do you just sauté the mushrooms and sprinkle cheese on top or?
Sweet potato casserole is the bomb, do you use the mini marshmallows on top?
Easy and delicious! How do you make your mashed potatoes? I just add butter, salt and pepper.
Yum! Do you have a favorite smoothie you drink often?
Tacos are so good! And of course those three are classics!
Yum! Do you have a specific type to like?
What’s your favorite flavor?
Hungarian goulash with potato pancakes topped with cheddar cheese and sour cream is one of my favorites!!!!
Isn't it so good?? I used to live in a small town in New Jersey, and there's this little mom and pop pizza shop that makes this type of pizza sooo well!
Agreed! So good!
Thank goodness for Costco or I couldn't afford his habit.
I don't usually make it, just eat it lol
It does! And I’m hungry 😂
I know right ? Depend what cheese tho hehe
Haha nice :) it's right there in the pantry.. But we're already going to eat something else tonight 😂
Yes I’m from England so it definitely is my most favourite. Though I also really love peppermint tea and I often buy different flavoured herbal teas to try them out. 🙂
Ugh yes and I love it in a bread bowl
Hmm normally Cumberland sausages but I'm also a sucker for a good pork and apple sausage. So good!
Yes! So it really started basic back in my childhood lol. It started with sautéed mushrooms and a slice of American cheese on top lol but now I like to think I’m elevated and sprinkle on fontanella or Swiss!
Yes that is the best yummo!!
Same but with milk too.
I don't really use recipes, the grocery store that I shop at has a "sale" section for fruits and vegetables that are going bad, so I usually buy a bunch of fruit from there and then freeze it. And then for the smoothies I just throw a bunch of stuff that I think will taste good together with water and ice. My favorite was probably a black plum/strawberry smoothie that I did. It was sweet from the plum and I didn't even have to put a sweetener in it. I have some prickly pear cactus frozen and it's super tart and sour, I've made a few smoothies with it but am still struggling to find the right combination to cut the sourness
I really like ham and pepperoni! But I also really like macaroni pizza. It sounds kind of gross but it’s super delicious!
Hmm hard to say I like almost any flavor even like weird combos like at Salt and Straw...store bought wise I probably go with Ben and Jerry’s Strawberry Cheesecake
I wish I could try that! It is sooo good! I find it can be hit or miss at some places though.
Have you had onion rings and bleu cheese? I'm kind of obsessed
Which cheese would you take to a deserted island with you? :P
Awesome! I’m a big fan of earl grey and passion fruit, they both go very well with lemon slices :)
Whatt, how did I not think of that before?! I know what I'm doing for lunch today, yum!
It sounds amazing, I bet it tastes even better. I have mushroom and got some shredded cheese so I’ll be trying today for sure! Thank you for sharing!
I definitely agree that it can be hit or miss depending on the place!
Nope, but that sounds amazing!!
Humm really hard, I think camembert =D
Ooh passion fruit sounds good!
Enjoy!!
It’s great, add a little lemon and it’s golden!
Thanks for the suggestion.
My pleasure!

I couldn't figure out who gifted me this but please let me know if it was you! <3 I LOVE opening booster packs. We didn't get lucky this time but one of these days I hope to open an invention card! :) It was still a blast opening this! Thank you!
My son plays this internationally. He loves the game! Do you play?
it was supposed to come with a note but shipped separately from the mochi bits! YAY for the fun of opening them, I remember those days sooooo many years ago ha ha ahha
Yes!
Awww thanks so much, skwerl!! ❤️❤️❤️
I should have learned because a couple of my kids play and one is really into it. If you like listening to two dudes talking about decks, strategy and play, you can [hear my son interviewed](https://www.google.com/amp/s/agot.cards/amp/2019/08/30/interview-with-dan-strouhal) here. No worries if you aren’t interested..  it’s probably only for the geekiest of players and a mom. 🤣
I started watching but I think they are referring to a different card game for this video. I’m not too familiar with that one. But thanks for sharing!
Oh dang, yes that’s the GOT game. Haha. He does both. Sorry!

Happy new year!!  Let's hope 2021 is a better year for us all.   I'm 25, from Northern Ireland.  I'm new to reddit,  my fiance introduced me to it & now I cannot get enough of reddit. Its definitely getting me through lock down.  I came across this subreddit & I'm so excited to join. Everyone seems so friendly, I can't wait to start gifting.   I'm a first time mummy, my baby girl is 4 months old & well I didn't exactly expect my pregnancy to be through a pandemic lol. But it is what it is & i done it. Hardest part is not being able to bring my baby girl to meet her family.   At present I'm trying to get myself into a hobby , iv been looking at bath bomb making (due to spending a fortune on bathbombs lol ). Iv started walking and exercising to get rid of all the pregnancy and lockdown weight lol.   Forgot to add I'm a very sentimental person I love to keep memorable items & know the history of my family.   I hope you are all keeping well & staying safe.
Welcome to the sub and happy new year to you as well. Congrats on your new bundle of joy! I hope she'll get to meet her family soon. What's your favorite memorable item that you've kept? If you need any help navigating the sub or have any questions, let me know!
Aw welcome!!
Welcome! What is your favorite bathbomb?
You know, I thought about doing shower melts. I only have a shower and I love the whole scent thing. I have all these links saved, and then never did anything with it.   How's Ireland handling the pandemic? We hear about London all the time, but never hear about Ireland.
Hello and welcome! What's your favourite animal?
hello and welcome to the family! what would you say are your three best attributes?
Welcome!  This is my favorite place on reddit! Everyone here is so kind and loving.  Congratulations on the birth of your daughter!  As a mom to 3 girls, i know you will love having a little girl.  I hope your family can see her soon.
Welcome! Nice to meet you! Congrats on becoming a momma! Since you are a sentimental person, have you considered scrapbooking as a hobby? You could put some of the memorable items you've saved in a scrapbook and decorate the pages and organize the books so they tell the story and history of your family. It doesn't just have to be pictures in a scrapbook.   Also, making bathbombs is fascinating to me! I don't know how to do it, but it seems so cool, and bathbombs are awesome!
Hello there.
Hello from the UK. Great to have you here. It's easy to get lost in reddit, I love finding funny subs. I'd love to start making bath bombs too, it's been on my to do list for a while. If you start and get any good tips then please pass them on 😊

What are your favorite sentimental items that you have? I always keep stuff like that too. My favorite is probably crafting items and a robe that were my grandma's.
Hello and welcome to the sub.
Hello and welcome! I’d love to learn how to make bath bombs because they’re so pricey!

Hi u/77ec77  I love Northern Ireland. Such a beautiful place. Ive been for work and loved it although only saw a limited amount.   You should look into baby safe bath bombs for little ones. Then you can have your baby involved
Welcome to the neighborhood!  What subreddits first drew you in before you landed here?
Welcome fellow newbie! Congrats on the baby girl! What is your favourite scent for bath bombs?

Hello!!!!!
Thank you so much.  So far my most favourite item is my daughters first outfit that she wore. & my very first pregnancy test. I never thought I would have been blessed with a child. So these both are moments I never want to forget , her birth and finding out I was pregnant.
Thank you
Thank you , at present I'm obsessed with the lush hippo bathbombs , it looks and smells amazing
I'm the same, I have every link saved. I just never get around to ordering anything. But I'm determined this time. Need to get through this lockdown someway lol.  I thought we were doing okay, but due to the new  strain everything is closed up again & we are only allowed out of our homes for essentials.
Oh what’s a shower melt? This looks interesting
Hey, thank you. My favourite animal is a dog, I have a sheltie x pom , he's 5. & I always class him as my first baby lol
Thank you , I think mine would be that I'm very caring,  I'm a very loyal person & creative
Thank you so much. I'm definitely blessed with my baby girl
Thank you so much.  So far I have done little albums but also been looking into scrap booking.  Yeah iv Been looking into it for a long time.
Hey hope your well.
Hiii, nice to see someone from the UK here.  I will do, I hope to start them very soon. I'll even send you a sample once I start.
Hi lily 💖. Thank you so much. I'm trying to work my way around it & find out what's what lol. I will get there.  Thank you for the offer I will keep that in mind x
My favourite items are my daughters first outfit and my very first pregnancy test. Having my daughter was the best thing to ever happened me. She's my little miracle
Thank you so much
Thank you, i shall keep you updated when I try it.
Thank you. Yeah iv been looking into it for a while I just need to order the stuff now to get started.
My granny & dad have been working for a few years on the family tree so it will be interesting for me to look back on it. Wow I'd love to do the dna test  !!
Thank you. That is the best time when they fall asleep on you but then you have the fear of moving them incase they wake lol.
Heyy, it is a beautiful place & I wish I had more time to take in all the beautiful views that surround me.  Omg that's an amazing idea, I never even thought about that thank you
Thank you,  I started off on a psoriasis one , then secret santa & Random acts of cards.
Welcome to you aswell ❤. My favourite atm is raspberry scented. It's the hippo bathbomb from lush but I absolutely love lavender as its so relaxing.
Hii, thank you so much.   I love going to Malta,  I had a holiday booked to go last year but unfortunately it was cancelled due to covid. I had a holiday booked for next month also for krakow but also cancelled due to covid.  Locally to me their is a forest and my favourite part of that is hearing the wind blowing through the trees & seeing the squirrels.   I have a dog , he's a mixed breed pom x collie. He's my baby boy.  Your an amazing person, working with special needs children is my dream job. I done some work placements and enjoyed it although it was challenging at times.   Thank you so much. So far everyone seems very friendly just what I needed as i don't have any friends I contact. Big hugs 🤗 x
Hii, hope you are well
Oh that's so awesome!! Do you have one of those books where you can write down when she takes her first steps and says her first words and stuff? My mom had one of those for me when I was a baby and I love reading it back.
Ooo I’ve never tried bath bombs! What do they take to make them from home?
I had a friend who did that and soap making. Soap making is way harder (and expensive) but hers were lovely. I think you'll do splendidly! You can do it! What's your favorite scents?  At least they're taking it seriously. Missouri decided to VOTE against wearing masks and social distancing. And then they canceled their next session... GUESS WHY.
It's aromatherapy type stuff. You don't let the water really hit it, but the steam and humidity from your shower and as it slowly dissolves (they can take multiple showers to dissolve), they release the scents.
Awww, sounds cute! I've got two cats. They're jerks but I love them haha
I hope you have fun exploring hobbies!
I'm fine, and you?
Awww that's awesome and very kind of you. My daughter is obsessed with bath bombs so I'd let her have it ❤ I fetched my horse over from NI, we only visited for the day but it was nice
That's cool! Do you have them displayed anywhere? Did you make a baby book or anything? I feel like when I have kids I'll just have tons of scrapbooks for them
Awesome, thanks!
I own royalties 😂
There are so many fun places to lose time in Reddit!
Oooh I will have to have a look for that one! Though I guess I cant go into stores for a while yet... Lavender is definitely my favourite. I got a new Radox recently and I swear theyve changed something, it was like a BLAST of lavender. Id be tempted to use it to make bubble bars.
Well I think we're gonna get along just fine because I too like my peace and quiet🐭 I love everything about nature especially listening to the wind. There's a wonderful group of people here somebody is always available to talk to, lend a  hand and to be a friend I'm hoping that you enjoy your stay hugs to you🧸❤
Yes , I have one that I documented my whole pregnancy & it covers everything until she is 1. I also have one that I can write down when she got all her teeth
I'm nearly sure it's baking powder, citric acid, Epsom salts,  essential oils,  the moulds & I think there's something else but I cannot remember off the top of my head lol.
I love lavender but really want to try designer scents such as angel perfume. But I think I need to start with something simple first 😂.   I take it someone caught coronavirus?  There are still many people here not wearing masks but everyone social distances. With me having a brand new baby I'm petrified of her catching anything.
Oh I like the idea of that. I can imagine a lovely tea tree one. Clear those sinus
Oh wow 2.  I think 1 animal is enough for me at present lol.
I'm doing good, thank you.
There are so many amazing places to visit over here. You should come back again to travel around.
No but I'm looking for a shadow box to put all her little things in.& I have little memory books but I'm going to start scrap booking
I'll let you know if it ever kicks off 😂
I think it was for Christmas only :(. Omg yessss.. bubble bars are amazing!!!
I have  beautiful beaches around 20 minutes away from where I live. I love going and listen to the water.  Thank you so much.
That's so great!! It sounds like you're going to be a wonderful mom to her as she continues to grow <3
Nice!! Sounds easy enough? Haha! What scents are you looking forward to making?
Probably while you're still learning to make them, I'd use more readily available scents so you don't end up tossing a bunch. But that sounds really cool. I hope this goes well for you!  Yup. And the entire state went WAYYYYYYYYY up on cases. Oregon, where I live, just got its first confirmed UK variant case.
They have those! They have lavender ones, and all different scents. They have some on Amazon. I like to put mine in a little satchel so that it can be close to the steam but not like sitting on something that could be wet.
I would love to. The family we visited were so hospitable. It was nice to see where he'd been, but glad he's mine now haha
I want to start scrapbook too! I'm trying to decide of I should do a 2021 book just to be more present in moments but I feel like nothing super exciting is happening. Like I'm not getting married or having a baby or anything so it's like, what's the point
My bubble bars came out a bit damp. Maybe I should try again soon, Ive got lots of free time!
I have a Little River about 2 houses away from me though I haven't been able to get to it as he have to walk down a little bit of a Hill with some rocks and  I have arthritis in my leg right now. And within a 5 minute drive I have an inlet that connects to New York and Staten Island and there's a lot of boating and people down there and then about 45 minutes away I have the seashore so I'm surrounded by it which is a nice thing.
Thank you so much. I just want for her to look back on everything when she is old enough to understand.
I hope its as easy as it sounds lol. I really can't wait to start with lavender but I do want to try do the "designer fragrances" such as angel perfume etc..
This virus is adapting way to quick. They have starting the vaccine here & have started with the over 80s. I'll not be due it to near the end of this year.  Thank you I hope it does to.
Very interesting will definitely look into this and add some into my wish list
Everyone is friendly over here. Well I think they are lol.
Well I think it could be the smallest of things that you don't think you should remember such as going out a walk and seeing something beautiful. It doesn't have to be big events.
It's all trial and error. Drop me a message we can talk there about bath bombs, bubble bars and everything wonderful lol
That sounds amazing. I'd love to visit America some day. Its definitely on my bucket list.
Ooo designer fragrances!! Fancy!! Well I wish you the best making them from home and tailoring them to your liking 😊 otherwise just place some bathbombs on your list if they aren’t already there 😂
Unlike the grumpy Brits here 🤦‍♀️
That's a good point!
Ooh I might come back to this when I have time to be making! I have some ongoing crochet I shouldnt neglect any longer, then I will be moving on to other crafts.
Thank you, I'm going to read more into it before I start. Funny I didn't even think of putting bathbombs on my list. Thank you for the suggestion
My fiancé's mother does alot of crocheting she made us a grogu (baby yoda) & make my daughter alot of little things for her room. It's something I have never thought of getting into.
Certainly 😊💜
I love it so so much. I got into it at university and its so relaxing but its one of those hobbies that everyone tells you you should sell and it gets old fast
Thats exactly what she said when I told her to sell the things she is making.
The curse of the crafter! 'You should totally sell those!' but never 'I would totally buy those'

Your cat is absolutely beautiful. Mind giving them an extra scritch from me? :D
HEY where can I add super pretty kitties to my Amazon list? ❤ Love the tapestry. I'm going to buy it.
Beautiful kitty!  Looks very much like my void Misha.
I just want to say that your kitty is beautiful
That is so pretty!!
My son's favorite cats are the black ones, so this made me smile. :)

I have not played Never Have I Ever in some time. I think I might have to do that with some of my friends soon. (On Discord, of course, because none of us can be in person.)  I want to go HIKING IN OREGON because there's a bunch of trails with waterfalls, but with the pandemic I have not been able to. So that's my what I want to do.  I have never gone skydiving AND I NEVER WILL. I am deathly afraid of heights.   [Wishlist](https://amzn.to/37J3Qb0). Thank you for hosting! This was fun to think about!
Never Have I ever  I've never visited California and I'd really like to! Hopefully, once the pandemic is over, I'll go with my family.  I've never went water tubing and I never will! I'm extremely afraid of deep waters. I can't even go over bridges. 🤦‍♀️  Thank you for hosting this contest! [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/118XBEQBGJGRM/ref=nav_wishlist_lists_1?_encoding=UTF8&type=wishlist)
Never Have I Ever seen a panda 🐼bear in real life.   Never Have I Ever been on a crab fishing boat in Alaska   [wishlist ](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1D2NDB9UF47WB?ref_=wl_share)
Never have I ever gone hang-gliding (and I want to!)  Never have I ever been stung by a bee, and I'm mildly scared I might actually be allergic and just not know it!  [Wish list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2QQZB9D04BKIE?ref_=wl_share)
I haven't done either one. Not sure if I'd want to zip line or not. I will NEVER jump out of a plane! I had to take a plane one time, and I hated it! I was super scared. I have a bad fear of planes. I was nearly in a panic attack the whole time. If I can help it, I will never be on one again, that's for sure!
I've never hiked in the mountains. I would be open to it, though. I'm with you on the skydiving!
I haven't done either of those and don't want to! I'm afraid of heights. No bungee jumping for me.
I have one tattoo that I need to have redone. I would get another one, too.      I wouldn't go to Mars, either! I'm keeping my feet firmly on Earth.
I've never done either one, and don't want to. I'm scared of heights, and skiing would be too cold for me.
I've never done either. Sounds like I'd have a good time in Oregon!      I am also scared of heights. If I was meant to fly, I'd have wings! My feet need to stay firmly on the ground.
I've never done either. I would be open to doing both; water tubing looks fun to me! I am afraid of heights, though, so I'm with you on (off! lol) the bridges!
Awww! I haven't done either, I would love to see a panda in real life!
I haven't been hang-gliding and I don't want to because of my fear of heights. I am the same way as you with the bees! My mom was severely allergic, so it's possible I am, as well. I don't want to find out! 🐝
I have zipped lined actually just not thru a rainforest which I thank would be absolutely beautiful.  Jumping out of a plane I would never ever do. Chances of death highly increase.
Right?
I am also afraid of heights but there is just something about bungee jumping and skydiving that calls to me. Live octopus on the other hand, nahhh. It's a Korean delicacy that many like to try. I rather stick to sashimi and Kimchi lol
Yeah, no thanks to the heights stuff for me either. It's hard enough for me to get on a plane without a ton of anti-anxiety meds.
It would be awesome they are huge but look so cuddly!!!
Here's to staying sting-free!  I have my share of fears, but thankfully heights aren't among them (I tried skydiving last summer!) Funny fact...I was WAY more scared climbing a ladder to hang my clock over the stairs than jumping out of the airplane. Ladders freak me out!
What are sashimi and Kimchi? I'm not too familiar with other cultures' menus, unfortunately. I eat pretty basic. I know, I know, I'm boring, lol.
Seeing someone else on a ladder with it moving ever so slightly even makes it hard for me to breath a little. I get very anxious.
Sashimi is raw fish sushi grade.     Sushi is basic. Raw fish on top of rice.🍣   Sushi rolls are the ones that have fish, avocado wrapped in sticky rice and seaweed wrap. 🍱   Kimchi is fermented Napa cabbage marinated with gochujang, dried shrimp, and spices. It sounds weird but I swear it's delicious.
No idea what gochujang is, either, lol sorry. I don't really eat seafood, only a couple types of fish and that's pretty rare... mainly just tuna, really. I do love tuna. Does that count?      I used to eat shrimp as a kid, then one day I bit into a shrimp and it felt like it was still alive. Very strange texture. Not for me! I never touched another shrimp again. I was like 7 or 8, I think.
It makes sense! I also have texture issues. I love Tuna but just raw.   Gochujang is a Korean chili pepper paste. It's spicy yes but it's a touch sweet.   Your experience with shrimp is so familiar to be! That's how I felt when I ate octopus. One and only time.

You guys, I’m burning out fast. I have no idea how I’m going to work full time and finish my dissertation/an entire novel in six weeks. I’m just burning out so fast, and I’m so depressed right now, too. We’re in total lockdown here and I’m feeling so, so stuck and dejected and worn down.
Thanks! I am currently have female issues and it’s not that bad yet but will get worse over time. I’m just a wee bit nervous about surgery? Suggestions tips?
Having financial issues regarding my schooling due to some sort of technicality. No idea what I'm gonna do. Just really distressed about it honestly.
Having some Sad Life Changes happening lately and it's not exactly what I was hoping for this year--basically my little family of 3 is fracturing because we're all very sad, but the one person with a lot of money is planning to move out, which means all 3 of us will have to move or I'll have to find people to rent (sublease, really) rooms in the house we live in now. Not sure if the other member of the family is planning on staying with me or if we'll all be splitting up, and to be honest I'm a bit scared to ask.   I was hoping I wouldn't have to move for a while, and when I did I wanted it to be the 3 of us, but that doesn't look like it'll be the case. It's sad seeing hopes and dreams for the future disappear like this, but it's hard to explain to people I know as they just don't quite understand the relationship that the three of us have/once had (relationships don't have to be clearly platonic, romantic, etc--they can just be a combination and not be labelled). I wish that we'd be able to work this out, but it's a lot of personal depression and deeply rooted personality differences and I'm not sure that we're able to fix that  I sort of knew this was the case when I opened up a book of poetry a few months back and read [this](https://imgur.com/a/KlimxsS) and just sobbed for a bit, but didn't really want to acknowledge it until I was forced to
Im visting my parents while my boyfriends sister is also visiting today. Everyone around me is happy - except for me. I dont have any friends and once I drive back to my shitty appartement, i'm all alone. Am I jealous of the people around me? That their lives are going so much better than mine?  And if that wasnt enough, im also terrible at school.  I feel like killing myself. I won't do it ... but man the temptation is strong.
Sending you many hugs, friend. I wish there was some way I could help! <3
Try not to look at it as 6 weeks. Take it one day at a time, and set small goals. Take your dissertation one paragraph at a time, and give yourself some time for self care. If you don't make time for yourself you will burn out and your dissertation will suffer because of it. So make self care a priority as well and do something every day to care for yourself, even if it is just as simple as lighting a good smelling candle that you like while you work.
You got this. Love you 💜
Good morning my friends I'm sure that you're feeling very overwhelmed with everything going on. But know that you can get this done and it is possible. Go slow and set your priorities on what needs to get done 1st be sure to give yourself lots of breaks lots of hugs and stay hydrated during the process. Soon you will start seeing that you're making lots of progress and you will feel better about it wishing you the best. Hugs
A lot of caffeine, lovely girl. <3  Be kind to yourself.  It doesn't have to be perfect.  You just have to push through and ask for help when you need it.  A dirty house will not kill you.  Be kind to yourself.
Sending positive energy and well wishes your way, my friend...  You are one of the strongest/smartest/most fascinating humans I have had the honor to “meet.” You have it in you to get this done, even though it may not feel like it right now. You have friends here (like me!) who love you and are prepared to give you a little boost, should you need it.   I am one of those people that wants to give you a boost. Are there any self-care items on your wish list that would help lift your spirits?
Hugs. Sending you happy mail
Do you have a way to access some sunshine. It sound adumb as hell but when I was burning out in grad school, doing work in a hammock saved me
No tips unfortunately, just here to commiserate. Day 118 of my cycle and waiting on blood test results.
I'm sorry to hear that, and I don't have exact experience with it. But in terms of dealing with the surgical anxiety just think about how great you will feel when it is over and you are no longer dealing with that. Think about how nice it will be to not have that on your plate, or in your brain. Try to think of the result rather than the actual surgery. That is what has helped me get through anxiety like that.
Good morning to you my friend Are there any support groups that you can join for others who were going through the same thing maybe that might make you feel a little bit better in not so alone. It's a normal reaction to feel nervous about upcoming surgery. Try to stay calm and make sure that you're getting your rest your vitamins your food and your sleep. Wishing you all the best I'm here if you need a friend to talk to hugs to you.
Hysterectomy?  You'll do great!  I'm a nurse and let me know if I can help.
I’m sorry to hear that. I have lady issues too. No surgery needed for me, but it seems whatever medication they throw at me never works quite right. I was in a subreddit for the condition for awhile but it became such an echo chamber of self pity there.   Have you had surgery before? I know I was scared my first surgery, but they take such good care, you fall asleep and then next thing you know you’ve been teleported to another room!
I had to have hysterectomy at age 29. I had fibroids and endometriosis. After 4 surgeries I finally said take it all. I’m also a nurse and would be more than happy to help with any questions you have!
Breathe. Hugs
It’s frustrating and shocking when our body doesn’t do what we expect it should, but I’m thankful you have some options to consider. I had fibroids as well and had a partial hysterectomy in my early thirties. Lots to think about and each case is individual but the one thing I loved was no more periods. I really did not miss them. I kept both ovaries which ended up being removed later one at a time, ten years apart for other reasons. Feel free to message me if you want to ask questions or chat about it.
I have female issues too, and I completely understand the anxiety. No tips here, but just wanted to send you lots of love and hugs!
I'm sorry that you're having difficulties and I can understand how it's upsetting you. I really hope that you can sort it with the school soon and have one less thing to worry about. Wishing you all best <3
That is super stressful. Sometimes we can’t change what’s real in the moment but we can use tools to manage the stress of it. Do you feel like you have some strategies so you aren’t stressed the entire time? People who support you in the ways that feel helpful?   What helps you have breaks from the anxiety?
Hugs
Hey man, looks like we're late to the party. We two are apparently the only ones here. I hope it gets better for you tho.   I got the time if you want to talk... ...bc I could use someone to talk to now...
YOu have all of us here. You don't have to be happy. It's okay. It's also okay to feel alone. But don't dwell in those feelings. You won't feel this way forever. Which is something incredibly important to look forward to. Message me if you need to.
Thank you ❤️❤️
Love you too ❤️💙
Staying hydrated is something I need to get better at. xx
Thank you. <3 <3
Thank you so much. <3 I will try to feel like someone who has it in me to get this done!! <3  In terms of self-care items, honestly, any clothes. I've gained some weight that I'm now working to get off, but it means that most of my clothes are too small, which means I rarely get dressed anymore, which is seriously affecting my mood and productivity. I've also been relying pretty heavily on vampire TV/novels and wax melts the past couple weeks. xx   Thank you so much for the words of encouragement! I just cannot wait for this to be over; I feel like it's squashing me.
<3
I don't. :( I live in Scotland; there isn't even sun in the summer here. Usually I try to go to Spain once a year, but with COVID I obviously can't. It's really destroying my health.
Wow I just had multiple ones and heavy u know lol
Thank you!!
Thank you i appreciate it! There is a forum on Reddit I been stalking! :)
Yes thank you. I’m a CNA but deal with older folks. No surgery this is my first one.
Possibly or removal of fibroids haven’t chose yet.
Never had surgery before. I’m a CNA but with older folks.  I go in February to my consultation.
I’m not looking for pity just good suggestions on what to buy!
Thank you I’m deciding if I need a full or partial. It’s a tough decision.
Thank you!
Sorry to hear that. I wondering about this also. Most in family have early meno. I’m the first one with fibroids. Ugh!
Thank you soo much! I appreciate it.
Thanks so much, I really appreciate it! I think what's really getting to me is that I don't get to know what's happening until Monday, so I'm just totally stewing about it! Thanks again! <3
Wow, that's actually so helpful for you to ask me. I actually have an anxiety disorder, so I've learned a lot about tools and coping methods, but I often forget to stop and use them. I ended up doing some crafting, and it really helped, and also talking to my family. Thank you so very much
Thank you!
Thanks man. (Even tho I don't feel much of a "you have all of us here")
Yw! Try to take it one day at a time if you can and focus only on small steps, not the big picture. And reach out if you ever need to vent or chat.
Why cant uteri just behave themselves?!
You got this!!
Your welcome. Oh I'm hoping it's what will help you n bring you comfort 🧸🌸
Honestly, knowledge of body mechanics/medical background puts you way ahead of the normies.    (Yes.  We're not normies.  Let's not kid ourselves.  😂)
If you'd like any guidance, LMK.  I also understand how personal and private this decision is.
I was sooo nervous my first time. It’s okay to be! I actually broke down and cried once they put my IV in because I was so anxious. Do not feel bad for how you feel about it. Many people are nervous having surgery, it is a big life event. Just remember that this is their job and they know what they’re doing. They’ll do their best to do the best they can, and they’re already prepped and know what to do should something go wrong.   Post surgery I suggest you have something to keep you busy while you heal. I got sick of watching TV so I read a lot. But any sort of handheld hobby would be good too!
If it makes you feel better a good bit if my right side if artificial or at least has been tweaked by medical professionals (strangley one surgery at a time for different, unrelated reasons) and as scary as surgery will be, whatever you eat coming out of it will be the best meal of your life. Its something positive to look forward to. Also, I live a fairly happy normal life despite my artificiality. Oh and all of it was done by the time I was 28 or so. 😅
Oh no I didn’t say you were looking for pity sorry if you misunderstood! I mean I tried to find some support for myself through a subreddit and everyone there was just full of self pity most of the time instead of discussing options/treatments etc.
It's all good. Hope your decision comes easy and you heal well.
I can understand that mulling over it all weekend! All you can do is remind yourself that you can't speed up the day or make Monday come quicker, so it's best to enjoy the time in the moment and take care of yourself doing things you love. :) You'll be okay. You'll forget all about this in years to come. <3
It’s good to have breaks in worrying. It’s such a kindness you can show yourself. I’m glad you have people and tools.
Thank you 🙏🏻
I agree behave and be quiet lol hehe ;)
Thank you!
Crazy good for sure lol is what I’m told :)
Thank you! I appreciate it!
I’m all girl but have the new Xbox one to entertain me and now Reddit lol :)   Thanks for the reassurance!
That sounds euphoric awesome! :) food that is ..
No I understand :) that’s not why I made the thread :) I wanted to clarify it for sure
Thank you!
That's very true! Thank you so much for the reassurance <3

(found this sub recently and thought I'd join since it looks fun\~)  Hello! I'm Sleepy or Belphiie (or my username if it's easier? I don't really have a preference lol), I'm a 19/F in college and have a cat.  I like to draw ~~^(when I'm not procrastinating)~~ (I also make things with clay sometimes) and I like video games (there's a lot, but a few would be FFXIV, Soul Calibur, and Tales of)! I like anime too but honestly I rarely watch anything, so most of my knowledge tends to be from searching up the anime :'D (only ones I've watched recently are Fate/Stay Night and The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.)  I have a lot of Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh cards, I never played with the Pokemon ones though since Yu-Gi-Oh was more fun/interesting to me \^\^; (but I've played a lot of Pokemon games)  Because of COVID I'm stuck at home, but it's nice not having to wake up really early and having more time to do what I want ▓▒░(°◡°)░▒▓  &#x200B;  I'm not good with introductions so I think this is good for now since I'm not sure of what else to add, also it's 3 a.m. for me so if anyone sees this I'll try to reply tomorrow 😅
I’m a cat lover also Purrfect I collect sport cards.
Hi! Welcome! What's your favourite thing about FF14?
Hey im also 19, like to draw, watch anime, and i like collecting Pokémon cards!
Welcome to the sub! I used to play lots of Yu-Gi-Oh but lately have been doing more board games than card-type games. What are you studying in college?
Hi, welcome to the sub! What do you study in college?
Welcome! Nice to meet you! What kind of things do you make out of clay? That sounds awesome!
Welcome!

Hello and welcome! I can’t draw, unfortunately, but I’m a master at procrastination! How’s your day going? Any plans for today?

hello and welcome to the family! what would you say are your three best attributes?
Hi! Thanks\~ My favourite would probably be the story/lore!
Thank you! I don't play much anymore either so the cards are in random boxes or a binder \^\^; I'm studying law (legal assistant)!
Hi, thank you! I'm currently studying law \^\^
Thank you! Nice to meet you too\~ For now it's just small figures of game characters since it's mostly for practice!
Thanks!
Hi, thanks!
Hello! Thank you!  My favourite holiday is Halloween (my family doesn't celebrate holidays like Christmas or Thanksgiving, so it's Halloween/New Year and a few others)! I like the sounds of birds/other animals, I also find nature kind of calming even though I prefer being indoors 😅  I have one cat of my own, though there's also another from the neighborhood that likes to wander a lot and spends some time in our backyard\~  Thanks again, everyone here seems really nice!
Hi! Thank you! I think my favourite dessert would be macarons or cake (specifically black forest, though I've only had it from places like walmart)
Thank you! I think my favourite might be Berseria, I've only been able to play a few Tales games so I'm just picking from the ones I'm more familiar with \^\^ What about yours?  I have Crestoria too but I rarely play/forgot I have it since I don't play mobile games a lot ;;
Thanks!
Thanks! I'm studying law (legal assistant) \^\^
Hello!
Hi, thank you! I don't really have any plans, I might draw if I'm not procrastinating or I'll probably just end up playing games and getting some homework done \^\^
Hi! Thank you\~
Oh cool! That's awesome
That is so cool! Do you have any pics of your clay characters?
That sounds very interesting. Good luck with your schooling
Sounds like a great Saturday to me! I need to do some cleaning and cooking, ugh.
[Here's some of them!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/786619227896283166/800129939818283018/clay.png) They're all from summer or earlier since I haven't had a chance to finish anything new once school started 😅
Those are amazing! I especially like Kirby!
Thank you so much! 😊

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kyg4r5/discussion_what_helps_you_get_out_of_a_depressive/

Give yourself a little grace. A little treat. Have a bit of chocolate. Endulge in a favorite child hood movie or activity. That said. It’s ok to feel this way. It is entirely appropriate. We are living through an extremely traumatic world event. Make sure to eat something. Make sure to bath. And have a nap. Try to accomplish one little thing even if it’s just brushing your teeth or fixing your bed. Lastly. Come to places like here for support and hugs. If you need someone to talk to my dm are always open and I do my best to answer them in a timely fashion.
It's cliche, but the whole fake-it-till-you-make thing works for me. Like /u/PurpleTeaSoul, focusing on making others happier, even a tiny bit, makes me feel better. DOING things makes me feel better. Having a project helps. Unpacking is my current focus, and I realized I have WAY TOO MANY FUNKOS. Like ridiculously so.
Sadly, nothing... I've been continuously depressed for the last year
I just cleaned my room this morning, and it helped :3  Not living in a smelly cave helped.  I notice I sink into depression when things are filthy.
Writing. Sometimes writing anything, a venting paragraph,  a story, a poem, a letter, etc. can help me get my dark feelings out, so I can start to see the light again. I hope all is well with you. If you need anything, feel free to reach out! Hugs!
What helps me the most is usually doing something to help someone else. It helps me to look outside of myself and reminds me that I can make a difference.   I also have to take care of myself, making myself shower, eat something, drink water, etc is really important. Exercise can help me pull out of depression IF it hasn't gotten too bad yet. If it's really bad I'm just too tired to exercise and I have to show compassion for myself about that. Sometimes I'll need to go to counseling again or increase my medications.   The most important thing for me is remembering that it's temporary. I remember the other times that I've had depressive episodes and things got better. That helps me avoid thinking too darkly. I remember that when I was in high school I wanted to end my life but I have had so many wonderful moments since then and have said so many times that I'm glad that I'm still here. I remind myself that this will be no different. That eventually things will get better and I'll once again say that I'm so glad I'm still here to experience it.
Thank you for posting this I’ve been in the same episode right now and these comments are really helpful 💕
Honestly, /r/randomactsofcards. By focusing out on others I am able to trick my brain a bit and snap out of it. But I’m weird and have to be super organized and have a good set up so I have everything at my fingertips. So I bought myself a little cart to house all my supplies on. It really helps me to have everything in reach so I can focus on enjoying sending cards rather than the hassle of trying to find everything I need to send and write out a card.  I really just baby myself too. What would I like right now? Showing myself kindness and gentleness helps me feel like it’s ok things will get better and I slowly take one step at a time to make myself feel a little better. That I deserve things I like and nice things. 💜
well, personally I have a couple of methods that work for me, I use games to help with it and get my mind off of the whole situation.. I also tend to try to make others happy, no matter how small the amount of joy is I can give them it helps and then lastly I just try to keep my mind busy, wether it is watching tv or just going on reddit and swiping through it I need to keep my mind off the episode, how about you?
Honestly, I struggle with that, but when I cry I feel a great sense of relief, where I begin to feel elated. But i go a long time without crying so I don’t get this relief until it piles for awhile
Getting creative helped me escape my first one. As did reading books and trying new things. Basically keeping my mind occupied but in a semi productive way because a lot of my depression at the time was related to having garbage self esteem. This time around I’m not quite sure. But trying to stay busy, trying to force myself to make the effort. I know if I let myself wallow it will only get worse. But it also depends on the person. Some people need that down time to mentally recover. Some people like me would drown in it.
When I'm feeling down I try take myself for a walk. Alot of fresh air calms me alot
I always try to remember my mom and how happy she is that I’m alive and that I just have to put one foot forward and that’ll be enough. One day at a time.
Music helps me immensely.  I put on cheery, dancy music and it perks me up
Eating, walking, hot drinks, crying, husband. Not necessarily in that order.
Usually distracting myself w things I like or spending time w my girlfriend
Thank you all for your kind words! I hope it will be better soon and I will try some of the things you suggested! I hope it can help others too because this really is a hard time
I watch funny videos, voice chat with my boyfriend, play video games, scroll through Reddit, things like that.  :)  I hope you feel better, OP.
i’ve recently picked up embroidery, it’s really peaceful and I find myself wanting to finish each piece
Getting in the car and driving around with a ridiculously high priced coffee while listening to music. 💚 hope you find some relief
Fresh air. No matter the weather. I always feel better for getting outside
Fresh air or a funny movie!
Treat yourself like a friend, with kindnessband patience and maybe a little treat
a nice warm shower. clean bedding, if i can help it, but i often can't get myself to do all that. otherwise i just kind of bury myself in blankets
Going outside, going for a hike, driving somewhere new, playing with my dogs, journaling/writing down how I'm feeling, watching comfort shows/movies, and if all else fails I buy myself a new plant.
Medication, honestly. It can't fix "you are literally going through a shitty situation" but it can fix that "there is literally nothing good in my life" feeling if you stay patient and find the right thing that works for you. For me it was adding an antipsychotic to my antidepressant, which sounds like A Big Deal but really isn't as dramatic as it sounds  Also, eating regularly. Nothing worse than low blood sugar on top of depression
Baths. Coloring. Video games.  Screaming, hitting bedding. It depends on the moment. I have a tendency to get super drunk if I get too down.
A cold shower
Going outside, for sure  I find that I feel worse when I don't move around a lot. So something that I've started doing is one-song-length of yoga. I put on a good yoga song (usually Saturn by Sleeping at Last but it can be anything that I'm resonating with at the moment) and I just do basic stretches for the length of the song. It makes it feel like a much easier task to tackle than doing a full yoga session, and in this case I'm choosing to do the poses that make me feel good in that moment so there's no pressure to be super productive or to really build muscle or anything. When the song is over, I usually continue stretching for another song or two, but even if I stop after the 2-3 minutes that is one song length, I feel better and I feel like I took care of my body a little bit
Ditto tbh
This! I always imagine it as my thoughts are knocking around in my head and bothering me until I get them on paper and can finally be free of them. Writing always helps me sort out my thoughts and emotions about something. It's a great tool that I don't utilize enough
I second doing something to help to someone else! I've noticed that when I'm in a particularly bad depressive episode, I tend to scroll through RAoA simply because no matter how dark the world I imagine it to be, there's strangers out there who are unbelievably kind, generous, caring and much more. I think this subreddit has helped a lot in satisfying these tendencies (to help others, perform small random acts of kindness, etc.) as the pandemic makes it more difficult to feel connected with others :')
Yes! Exactly! That's how I feel. I feel like my thoughts fill up my head like running water in a bathtub, and I have to write to get the water to drain out.

Your very welcome! I’m was happy to find someone to gift :) I got so many movie suggestions it will take me a while lol. I guess I could recommend anything with John Leguizamo. I love his comedy shows he did on Broadway, my favorite is Freak. For movies, try Chef or To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar. Or The Pest! I watched The Pest all the time as a kid.
It was so unexpected, thank you :') Roger, that! I've heard Chef is great but I don't know the other ones. I'll give them a go!

I’m exhausted so I may fall asleep soon but I wanted to start this tonight and close it tomorrow (1/16) around 3.   Tell me your weirdest cleaning hacks. I have 3 boys and today I tried shaving cream around the toilet for when they miss the bowl. It’s the weirdest way I’ve ever cleaned but it definitely helped pull the smell out! Made me wonder what else is out there.   Please DBAD and US only for this one.   Stay healthy!!
If you write an Expo marker on top of a sharpie marker stain, you can erase it. Granted, the surface has to be smooth like a dry erase board. but if it is, works like a charm :)
i mix dawn and vinegar in a spray bottle and spray down my shower and fill my tub up with water and add in the same mixture. let it sit for awhile, and it just wipes right off!
I needa try you back hmmm 🤔   Mine is Fill a sandwich bag with two teaspoons of baking soda and half a cup of vinegar then attach it to your shower head using an elastic band.Turn the shower on slightly to let the bag fill up then leave overnight. When you take off in wipe all the nasty stuff just comes off
Use a lint roller for dusting 👀
I have 2 kids and cleaning is a straight up full time job. I feel your pain.   My best hack for cleaning ceiling fans blades is to use a pillowcase. Put the blade in the pillowcase and then use the pillowcase to clean all the dust away
Baking soda and vinegar can clean every damn thing in the world for you.
If you're trying to get stickers off of stuff, hand sanitizer works wonders!  For most cleaning stuff (the kitchen is where I need to clean most often) I use Barkeeper's Friend. Not really a "weird" cleaning hack, but useful all the same. :) I scrubbed for AGES and didn't make a dent, then scrubbed with Barkeeper's Friend for a minute and the burned-on mess was half off.
I'm not entering as I'm in Canada but toothpaste takes marker off the wall.
I learned this from my mom but basically instead of throwing away an old toothbrush, you can keep it to scrub hard to clean messes.
I let dishes soak in hot water with fabric softener sheets for about 10 minutes when the food has dried on them. This works great for things that may not be cleaned all the time, too, such as oven racks. Spaghetti night is yummy, but the mess is not fun... it is 10 times easier with dryer sheets!      PS. I actually learned this trick when I was 14, when I went to help my aunt clean her house. Her kids weren't always very helpful, I'll say nicely.
Clean your shower head with vinegar. Place white vinegar in a baggie and tie around the shower head tightly. Leave overnight and rinse.  Clean shower head! 😃
Not entering as I'm not from the US.  Just wanted to share - if you have black mould on my bathroom sealent, don't remove and replace it. Better to put some Bleach and cover it with tissue for 12 hours. Then it's gone!
Okay the weirdest one I’ve got is when you have to clean up vomit out of the carpet, put either coffee grounds, baking soda, or sugar all over it. It sort of soaks it up and you can actually sweep or vacuum it up so much easier. And it hides the smell a bit.     This one is not weird but a good tip:    Sometimes when you use cast iron it will ruin a sponge every time you wipe it clean. I bought a little chain cast iron cleaner. The way it’s designed it won’t scratch your pans and it makes it so easy to clean! I love that thing
Grease spots on clothes? Dawn dish soap. Rub it in just like you would a pretreater. Because Dawn is specifically formulated for grease, it’ll do a better job. I’ve even fixed shirts that had been through the wash already.  If you spill something sugary on a hard floor, clean it up with boiling water and a regular old mop. It’ll dissolve the sugar for easier pickup and also prevent stickiness.  Washcloths smell? Before you throw them in the laundry, wet them down and throw them in the microwave for 30 seconds. It’ll kill the bacteria making the smell so it doesn’t transfer to your other clothes.
Clean the shower/bathtub naked so you can just take a nice hot shower afterward.
I recently discovered that Bar Keeper’s Best Friend gets rid of burnt on food and stains on pots and pans! It was a revelation!
If your having an issue with ants coming around no matter what you do.  Avon’s Skin So Soft! I don’t know what is in it but it’s an ants worst nightmare. They die instantly and your house doesn’t smell like chemical.  It makes floors and surfaces slippery though so make sure to wipe and disinfect the area after going to war on the ants lol
Oven cleaner will get stains out of a shower.  A baking soda soak in the wash will help get dingy socks clean. Fights fungus, too. Will also remove odors from sneakers and pit stains on white shirts.   If you're out of literally anything, just use diluted apple cider vinegar.   Rubber gloves will get hair off upholstery.   And lastly, a can of cola soda will get hard water stains out of a toilet.
Here's a neat one - anytime you use lemons for fresh lemon juice, save the used lemon halves to clean your microwave with. Pour boiling water over the lemons in a microwave-safe bowl and cook in the microwave for 5 minutes. The steam will loosen and particles so you can easily wipe down the inside, and the lemons make it smell great.
This isn’t really a hack but use wet wipes! I started using wet wipes instead of paper towels and cleaning spray for my bathroom countertops and it makes my life SOOO much easier!  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
If you have stainless steel appliances that always get fingerprints that you struggle with, use baby oil on the appliances. It’s amazing .
Have you ever tried to unclog a drain with Coca Cola? It really works!
White vinegar removes hard water stains! Mr Clean removes scuffs and sharpie from walls. Those are the weird ones I can think of right now  Edit: also boiling half water half white vinegar in the microwave for five minutes helps remove all the gunk super easy!
Sometimes buying the tile and hardwood cleaner gets expensive. In a pinch, a dilute vinegar solution works wonders for cleaning hard surfaces.   And while I’m on the topic of vinegar, you know the gunk that forms when a battery leaks (blue or white)? If you mix some baking soda and water to make a paste, and use a q-tip to scrub the gunk, it works really well. To clean up, you can just neutralize the baking soda with some vinegar on a q-tip. This way, all that’s left is water, which can air-dry. This trick has saved so many electronics from the brink of death.
my weirdest cleaning hack is actually nail polish remover on linoleum! it got up years of my moms hairspray residue off it!
Sell all of your belongings and then astral project out of your body. Then nothing needs to be cleaned!   (As much as that sounds like a certain kind of mean comment, that's definitely not what I'm saying.)
Vinigar and baking soda mixture. Great for icky drains. Also. Have your boys clean the toilet
I clean my windows with vinegar white vinegar and newspaper lol because it leaves no streaks and it keeps bugs away. People say I'm weird but honestly I  save money on buying window cleaner lol  Anyway 3 boys! I thought 3 girls and 2 boys was bad lol I get the whole boy thing though I'm forever tell the boys of the house to be a sweetie and wipe the seat lol
Here are a few of my tips I've learned over the years:  * Instead of buying Swiffer refills, just attach a microfiber cloth into the holes where the refill pad would go. Works just as well, cheaper, reusable, and better for the environment! * If you use a wax warmer, burn the wax inside a silicone muffin liner instead of the unit itself. It makes clean up a total breeze. Just pop it out and you're good to go. * Rub your water faucets with wax paper to help prevent water spots. * Seam rippers are the perfect tool for getting tangled up hair out of your vacuum bristles. * Get permanent marker out of clothing with hand sanitizer and off of walls with hairspray.  Thanks for the contest!
When cleaning the microwave you can fill a cup with water add some drops of lemon juice and the lemon peel and microwave it for about 3-4 minutes, pretty much until the water boils, it makes it so much easier to wipe down the microwave after.   Another hack is to clean a cutboard with the remaining shell of a lemon after cutting up chicken, meat/ other difficult to clean foods. So say that you use half a lemon’s juices, take its hide, squeezed side facing the cutting board and rub the lemon in circles, it helps get the smell out and helps make it easier to clean!   My aunt taught me that before you put a pan in the oven to wipe around the edges so that it doesn’t get caked on in the oven.   You could use one of those weird beige socks you find at shoe stores (the ones they have so that you could try on shoes) to drain frying oil so that you could reuse the oil without all the fried bits  Edit: another thing I do, which I’m not sure if it’s a hack is: I usually soak my pots before I wash them, but if I’m in a rush I’ll put a little bit of water and a dot of soap and put them on the stove so that the stuck on grime will become softer and easier to remove.  I’ll probably come back with more as I think of them
I like keeping one of those dish scrubbing wands in the shower filled with dish soap and vinegar. Then when I'm in the shower I can scrub the sides of the tub real quick and easy rinse the soap away. It takes less than a minute but it keeps the tub a lot cleaner so I don't have to do a deep clean very often.
I’ll scoop the dried crumbled bits off the bottom of the oven with a spatula; if you try to pick them up normally they just break apart
Hi. Thanks for hosting. To get kid finger and tongue goop off glass doors I use newspaper and works beautifully and doesn’t leave streaks or paper towel fuzz.
1.If you have stains on light color fabric, soak them overnight in Biz or Oxyclean diluted in hot water. Rinse them completely. If there is still dark stain, repeat. If still a minor stain, lay the object outside in the direct sunlight for all day.   2. Don't make piles of things you've sorted. Touch things once, twice max after it's clean or you're finished with it. Piles are overwhelming and just get disorganized and then you put it off longer. It helps you get your steps in if you walk each thing away at the time.  3. Everything left on the floor goes into a large hamper or clean garbage bin and stays there until the end of the week when it can be retrieved and put away. No sneaking things out of the bin midweek. Learn to put away or learn to go without until the weekend.   4. Use old socks to dust. Sprinkle or spray oil on the sock, the wipe. You can reach easily where you need to.   5. [Un-du](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Formula-Sticker-Remover-California/dp/B003TZQPTS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=un-do+adhesive+remover&qid=1610785130&sr=8-1) will get sticky residue, price tags etc off anything. It's amazing and leaves no weird scent or residue. It's terrific!
i don’t know if this counts as a cleaning hack necessarily, but whenever i want the house to smell good, i boil some water on the stove and stir in some cinnamon or like a bit of caramel coffee grounds and it makes the house smell good! but not on high heat or else the cinnamon and coffee burns.
Cream of tartar works well to clean stainless steel.
I have this little straw cleaner that I throw into my drill when I need to clean something that’s tough to fit my hand into (like a vase or a water bottle). It works pretty well!
Put toothpaste on your headlights and brush with an old toothbrush. Bam. Super clear headlights.   Use a dryer sheet to clean the bugs off your car. Much easier.   Coffee filters are lint free and make dusting the car a lot easier.
I've used a can of coke to unclog a toilet.  I've ground up lemon peels and left them in a bowl as air freshener.  I've used a baking soda and vinegar mix to take carpet stains out.   I've used apple cider vinegar as a trap for a ladybug infestation.  Clean unfinished furniture by lightly using a dry scrub pad.   I hope these hacks help! ;) thank you for the contest!
If your rug has a wrinkle in it or your wooden floor has a dent. Take a damp towel, place it over the area and a hot iron on the towel for a few second. Might have to do that a couple of times, but it works!   Take a dry disposable sponge and mark with a sharpies where the treads of your window or sliding glass doors are. Cut through the sponge up until the scrubbie part then wipe down the window ir door tread. [This](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.kidspot.com.au/lifestyle/home/home-solutions/mums-hack-for-cleaning-window-and-sliding-door-tracks-goes-viral/news-story/a82f0736ba470823c5e228a30b89988e) shows it well   Also not really a hack, but don’t forget to wash your curtains. They get real dusty.
Silly putty to use to clean out your computer keyboard.  It sticks to the dust and such and gets in the crevices.  Plus is is fun!
I learned this as a teacher...if you get Sharpie on a white board, just write over top of it with a dry erase marker and then wipe. It will come right off.
The most useful cleaning tip I know is mixing hydrogen peroxide and baking soda to get blood out of fabric. It makes a paste on the stain, and the blood just magically vanishes. If it doesn't completely go away the first time, use cold water and try again.
Vacuum the bathroom before you wash the floors to pick up all the hair and dust.
Toothpaste helps get out permanent marker on surfaces! Hand sanitizer works better, but it will also remove paint.  Thanks for the contest!
Put a paper towel down in your microwave to help prevent some mess
Kosher salt and rubbing alcohol make a great soaking agent to clean sticky stinky resin! Sometimes small items just require vigorous shaking in the mixture.   Salt and ice swirled around in a glass coffee carafe will lift any burnt on residue too.
Use vodka to remove carpet stains.  Use chalk before washing clothes to get rid of greasy stains.   Use an old toothbrush to clean keyboard.
You can use Coke to clean the toilet!  And shaving cream to clean the faucet of the bathroom sink.  :D  I was really shocked about the Coke one, especially.
Here’s a mental or motivational cleaning hack! Some people say setting a timer works well to clean in small increments, but that’s meaningless to me. So I combine the timer with something else! Sometimes it’s “when the timer goes off I get to go on a little walk and maybe check the mail” or “when the timer goes off it’s time to pull the brownies out of the oven” and having something else to do, a REASON for the timer, lets me be very productive for the 10, 20, 30 minutes I’m cleaning. :)
Those slipper socks that are mops at the end get baseboards so clean for real
Babywipes will get virtually any stain out of clothes if you use it immediately. I was at a conference and tripped going down the stairs, spill coffee over a white, lace blouse. 5 minutes and a trip to the gift shop later, no one could tell!
i find using a "junebugging" method for cleaning helps me immensely. it's basically tailored for people with adhd or focus issues, where you have a focal point like say the bathroom sink. you start to clean one part, notice something else that needs to be done and go do that, then come back and work on something in the same area. it's hugely helpful.  i also find, with my depression and fatigue, making little tasks or "rules" for myself like putting away three things when i get up, or next time i go downstairs for a drink, taking three empty cans or other stuff to go back down. just little things like that
Scrubbing countertops, cast iron, and other things with salt.  I was surprised my roommates weren't familiar with this before.  It's allergy friendly and you can scrub things clean and it washes away with ease.
Yessss shaving cream is awesome!!!! I use shaving cream for water stains all of the time.   I make my own febreeze with the laundry scent beads and water.   Pour a little laundry detergent into your toilet water tank for a fresh smell everytime!   Use baking soda/vinegar mixture to clean basically everything (it's amazing for the bath tub + counters)   Pop your wet sponge in the microwave for 30 seconds or so to clean and get rid of bacteria.    Use olive oil for stainless steel appliances! Works wonders.
My roommate taught me that if you have a pot with food stuck to it, put water and soap, and sometimes baking soda, in it and heat it over the stove, once the water gets hot enough and sits for long enough the food will be easier to scrape off
These are all great tips!! Now if I had a cleaning fairy I’d be set!
instead of draino - I pour baking soda, then vinegar, and then flush with hot water.
A widget tool is amazing at scraping junk or burned stuff on the stove, counters, even floors!
Not entering because in the UK but Tide2Go pens are the best!! My uniform at work is white shirt, white jacket, white trousers and we are allowed to eat and drink in the office. You can see where this is headed. More than once I've been the office hero when I pull that out of my desk drawer!
When cleaning a blender just put water and soap and blend! Minimal scrubbing. Thank you!
Carry a laundry basket with you while you clean up. Stick everything that needs to be put away in it. It saves so much time walking back and forth from room to room putting things away.
I tried this hack for the first time a few weeks ago! It worked!! This is a good one
That sounds easier than what I do now- thanks!
I wonder if this would work with hard water stains too?? I don’t have any now but I used to have a well and the staining was horrible.
Word of warning: leave a note or something so you don't accidentally turn on the shower when you're half awake the next morning. I scared the crap out of myself with this, it makes a terrifying noise. 😅 it was kind of interesting though, the bag started filling with water and I turned off the water right before the bag burst and the reverse pressure sucked all of the water and vinegar INTO the shower head. I had to pry the suctioned bag off the shower head and then run the shower for a while before getting in so I wasn't showering in vinegar. It did clean the shower head though 🤣
Noice.I’m going to try this one
😂 I do this too.
Note: heat up the vinegar before pouring it in. It will mix with the dish soap a lot better.
Do you think Coke would unclog a shower drain?
Yes it does totally works but the key is leaving it over night
🤣😂 oh my goodness I would have freaked out lol
Can't hurt to try!
I'm pretty sure I started screaming. I don't know why but in those few seconds I thought it was going to break the shower head (I was still not fully awake haha) my husband was not amused 🤣
🤣😂

Thank you both so much for the lovely pins u/GeekyDee and u/So_Appalled_! I love them both so much!  Thank you for the hanger, u/chevygirl815! It will come in handy for air drying my washcloths and face masks!
Thank you so much u/Dobbaebi for the gift card! I used it to get myself a new mat for my desk. I really appreciate it!
More pins for you. Might be time to stage an intervention. ;)
I love them! Especially the overthinking one, that's so me 😂
These are great!
You’re oh so welcome hon! It inspired my gifted post which was a lot of fun to make for you.
You're welcome! I overthink everything so I had to grab you that when I saw it. Also, gotta say I love your Mr. Bean pin!
You’re welcome!
You’re welcome!!  Btw those pins are adorable! Are you collecting them? :)
Never! I refuse! 😝
I definitely noticed, and appreciated the added personal touch. 🥰
Hahaha thank you! 🙂😘
I am! I have PTSD and one of the things I struggle with the most is my identity (remembering who I am, what good qualities I have, what my interests are, etc.) so I recently began collecting pins and storing them on some corkboards on my wall, so whenever I'm having a hard time remembering, I can look at them and be reminded "Oh yeah, I do enjoy those things." So far it has really helped me in my recovery. [This](https://imgur.com/a/jrHdnCd) is my current collection after adding these.
Whoop whoop! How big is your pin collection??
That’s amazing, I’m glad you’ve found something that helps. And what a gorgeous collection, Thank you for sharing! It feels like each one tells its own story
[This](https://imgur.com/a/jrHdnCd) is my current collection (sorry for the poor lighting)
Thank you for asking 😊

Can someone confirm that they can see the two photos I uploaded, Reddit mobile is being weird. 😅
Link for those pins pretty please? 🥺
All great stuff!!!
Those brush markers look so cool!
Such cute gifts!
Thank you so much u/HeirOfGondor for the absolutely amazing gifts! I didn’t know you gifted me so much!   I am so excited to start my pin collection with the cork boards and super cute pins you got me. I can’t wait to draw and color with the markers and the cat mousepad is awesomely adorable. Thank you so so so much for everything! I can’t even express all of my gratitude. ❤️
Yaaaaaaaaaaaay!!! You got them!!! I'm so excited for you!  Most of the pins I've liked on Amazon can be found on [wish.com](https://wish.com) for a fraction of the price. I suspect a lot of Amazon sellers are buying from there and reselling on Amazon.
The cork board is so cute! Love the shape of it.   I can see both photos that you uploaded.
can confirm they are seen! they look great! 🌸💗
I see them
Of course! 😀     [Link for the mason jar of flowers pin!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KHLSL9X/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glc_fabc_RPLaGb0HN9PHS?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)     [Link for the 5 cat pins!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZNJG9F7/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glc_fabc_UQLaGbECD34BG?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)
The original artist for the hugging cats is [Glitterpunk](https://glitterpunk.co.uk). The original artist for the cat in a coffin is [Manière Noire](https://manierenoireshop.com/). I don’t recognise the others but I can guarantee that they’re made using stolen art.
You’re very welcome! ❤️
Thank you!!! 😆 And thank you for the recommendation, I love the cork boards! I used to shop on Wish all the time, I’ll check them out for pins tonight! 🥰
The pins on wish and AliExpress are all made from stolen art, and are much lower quality than the ones you would receive from the original artist. The pins on Etsy cost more because it’s more likely that you will find an original artist. Some people do buy in bulk from wish and AliExpress and then resell for higher prices on Etsy too, but it’s usually pretty easy to tell if you’re looking at an art thief or an original artist.
Thank you!
Thank you so much! 🥰
Thank you! It uploaded as a blank picture last time for some reason so I had to repost it ugh.
Thank you!!
Thanks for letting me know! I've never bought pins off Amazon before so was unaware. The cat in a coffin is the one I was interested in so this is perfect will save the link for later :)
You're welcome hun! 😊 Happy hunting!
Thank you for your input. I recognize that it's probably not the best means of obtaining pins; my recommendation was based on the fact that if she’s going to put her money towards pins on Amazon, which are just purchased from Wish and resold for profit, then she might as well just purchase from Wish directly and save the money.

Dang, ribs are awful slow and painful to heal.  Sorry to hear that.  He called for an apprentice and they sent me out. I was third term  electrical meaning I knew a little about running EMT, equipment, JLGs and forklifts, etc. This was an industrial job with huge conduit at a paper mill. He (unbeknownst to me at the time) called the union hall to complain they'd sent out two women in a row. He was foreman on the job with about 15-20 guys. He had worked at the company for 30 years. I proved I could pull my weight (which wasn't new, had to do it at each new job they sent me out on). About 8 months in, we went on a date. The next day, the owners called me in to the shop and said they were firing me because they didn't have enough work. My boyfriend knew how much work they had because he estimated it, so he confronted them. They admitted it was because we had a date. He told them they were wrong to fire me, they should have fired him because he was the foreman. He said he didn't want to work for a company that fired the underling when a supervisor was involved, so he quit that day.  They couldn't believe it. He'd worked there almost his entire adult life. We both got new jobs and married a year later. We raised my kids, his grandkids and some foster and relative kids. They've all grown up and are on their own. Nov 12, 2020 was our 30th anniversary. We didn't celebrate because of Covid but that's no matter. Life has ups and downs. We've seen a few.   A little Neil Diamond for you:  "One, touching one   Reaching out, touching me, touching you   [sweet caroline](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHgdhuGBB5m/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)    Good times never seemed so good..."
Sweet Caroline. I met my husband on a dating website called POF (plenty of fish) when it first launched. Turns out he graduated with my older brother.   I love him because he made me want to better myself for the first time in my life. I was the self destructive type. I pushed him away several times dating. He never gave up on me even when I had given up on myself. Now we are happily married and laugh a lot. [This is us ](https://imgur.com/a/OS8EuGl)
Damn you, now I have SWEEEEEEEEET CAROLIIIIIIIIIINE BUM BUM BUUUUUUUUUUUUM stuck in my head.   &#x200B;  Great contest!
This is so so kind of you! Me and my bf met in high school when I was actually seeing one of his friends lol! After me and his friend went seperate ways, I reconnected with my bf and we've been together ever since! It's been 8 years in August! we love just hanging out and watching shows together but we also enjoy traveling as well! thanks for hosting and sweet caroline!
Sweet caroline  We never met until we were 6 months into relationship. Also, we survived a long distance for two years from different parts of the globe.❤️❤️❤️  Thank you for the contest  Bear hugs for ya
I’m so sorry you haven’t been feeling so well. I hope you start to feel better soon!  sweet caroline  I met my other half playing an online game! We started out online for the first 3 months!  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
I hope your ribs heal quickly - get some rest. Also, I just watched WandaVision today. It was great!  My story is really fun. Let’s say timeframe, last December, senior year of high school.   Friend of a friend, got to know each other better when we were partners for a game at a Friendsgiving party (of all places). Sat next to each other in Stats, and watched really crappy movies in class (shhhh - we both did fine :)). Hung out a BUNCH at math team competitions, also cried at them lol. Got into fountain pens together (highly cool).   Flash forward to the summer, before moving to college, different states, first real date. This was supposed to be a big night. I found a nice cozy spot in the woods, got some blankets, a big white sheet, and borrowed a projector. Forest movie night delivered on all counts (we watched Palm Springs, which was a fantastic movie).   It’s nice to have someone with radically different interests, mildly different personalities, and the same, zany sense of humor!  Thanks for hosting and sweet Caroline!  Edit: also somewhere along the line, two stuffed moles were stitched. When you put them together, they form an avocado, complete with pit when separated. [pic of my half](https://imgur.com/a/dWMnrPk)
I'm not entering because I believe we've got most of it planned out already but this is so cute! Also, his birthday is the day after so he's just gonna get one big present he's been wanting for both of the days 😂 it's up to him to plan the date!
Hi! I've heard that fracturing ribs is quite painful. I wish you a fast recovery! I'm not in the US, so just wanted to wish you well. I recommend you to watch Another Round from Thomas Vinterberg. It's about a group of teachers that decide to prove a theory that humans are born with a deficit of 0.5 alcohol in their blood.
Oof cracked ribs are painful! It could end up really hurting if you get hiccups so let me tell you the best hiccup remedy I know: get a glass of water, put a paper towel over the top of it and drink the water through the paper towel. It forces your body to use the muscle and get it to stop contracting randomly. It also works to suck water out of a wet cloth but I prefer the paper towel trick. When my mom hurt her ribs she got hiccups and it hurt so much she had tears in her eyes. The paper towel trick got rid of them in seconds and it was a huge relief to make the pain stop. I just wanted to let you know that in case it happens to you friend; you don't need any more pain!  Anyway, the contest. I met my husband at a game night in college. I actually had a boyfriend at the time so I tried to set him up with my roommate. He and my roommate spent a lot of time together which meant he was around a lot and we became best friends. They ended up not being a good fit for each other and I ended up breaking up with that other guy. By that time we were best friends and had major crushes on each other. It was one of those situations where everyone knew we were crushing on each other except us haha. We both kept insisting we were "just friends" which is now a running joke. His sister (who became my friend while we were both single and denying the attraction and thus ended up in the middle of it) teases us about it constantly haha. When we finally started dating it was so obvious we were right for each other. We were already best friends so added the romantic aspect was so easy and super fun. We got engaged fairly quickly and have been married for over four years now. But of course we're just friends ;) lol  Sweet Caroline
Sweet Caroline! My s/o and I actually met on an anonymous posting app, and we messaged eachother but shared non-anon details lmao. Now we’re practically married. Please heal up safe!
I'm single-and-not-looking, but wanted to say this is a great contest! Happy early V-day!
I don’t feel comfortable putting my email on my wishlist, but if I win, I can DM you my email?  We met online on a dating app. I love how caring he is.  sweet caroline
Sweet Caroline!   I'm sorry about your health problems, I think about you a lot. I hope you feel well soon!   My husband and I met on a BBS (bulletin board system). This was pre-internet! In the mid 1990s. You used your phone modem to call the central server which in our case had 4 phone lines total. You could chat or post messages, and since it was local we liked to have meet ups in public places. That's how we met but it took a while for me to be willing to date him, I was smitten by another guy I met from the BBS!  Thanks for the contest!
I actually met my sweet caroline off the dating app OkCupid! She messaged me first bc we both had art museums and puns in our common interests. Tbh at first I was convinced she wasn't real. This unreal gorgeous girl messaging me first and wanting to meet?? No way! But I agreed to pick her up, and when I saw that it was actually her walking to my car, it still didn't feel real. Well, one month of hanging out and making nonstop puns later we started dating, and now in 2 weeks we're going to Niagara falls for our one year :)
Not entering, but just wanted to say that you're amazing, and I hope you feel better soon!
Feel better 😘 luv ya & let me know if you need anything.
Not entering because my relationship is absolute shit right now. Just wanted to say that I hope you feel better very soon ❤️
We went to high school together. We’ve been together 16 years but have been close friends for 19. I love a lot about him but I really do treasure the fact he still makes me laugh. It’s what attracted me in the first place and I hope it lasts forever ❤️❤️  Sweet Caroline   Thank you for the contest!
sweet caroline 🥰  I wish I had an elegant story but we just met on a dating app and hit it off from there 😂 happy palentines/galentines/Valentine’s Day!!
Sweet Caroline  I  met my boyfriend when I was 14 at his baseball game. We’re now 26 and have been together ever since :,)
Not entering, but wanted to say that this is so cool 💖  Also thought you might be interested to know the deliciously trashy fact that I met my husband at a karaoke night hosted by my ex-husband's best friend's wife 😂
Not entering but just want to say I hope you recover quickly! Fracturing a rib sounds pretty scary. Sending you positive vibes!
Sweet Caroline.  I hope you feel better soon.
Sweet Caroline, this is a beautiful thought contest :).  Im 2006, I met my husband on Yahoo 360 (it was just fancy yahoo profiles where you can add a lil but about yourself). I clicked the add friend or whatevee it was on there. The first thing he ever said to me/posted for me was "Now I know Im in love". A year later, he came to visit for a week (i was scared he wouldnt like me cuz im big... i didnt show him full body pic til a few days before he came) from NY. Couple months later, I went to NY to visit him and pretty much just moved on in lol.  Hope you heal quickly!
Not entering but this is an awesome contest!
I met my sweet Caroline on POF back in 2013. We went on one date and i took him home with me after and he pretty much never left. We were married 6 months later and now we have been together over 7 years 💚 ty for the giveaway!! We usually don't do anything for valentines so this would be a really sweet surprise for him
I met my Sweet Caroline in the Starbucks drive thru.    So we both worked at Starbucks and he was transferring to my store. He decided to go through the drive thru to kinda feel the vibe out. Well, what he ordered was unusual (at the time cold foam didn't exist so a grande iced cappuccino was a werid order) And lots of customers don't know what the words mean and so I was questioning his order (thinking he meant Frappuccino) and apparently he thought it was adorable. I thought his smile was adorable and the rest is history. ❤
Sweet Caroline  My husband and I actually met in first grade. We went to the same school our entire lives until we graduated high school, and then we both went to college in the same town. We didn’t start dating until college, but we both sort of had a thing for each other for a long time before then. I am love many things about my husband. He is very nice in a genuine way. He cares strongly about women’s rights. He treats me as an equal. He is very smart, soon to be a doctor (in English). He’s very funny even though I won’t tell him he is. And he loves our cats as if they were his biological children. He is currently living in a different state than me because he just started a new job and I am running out our lease here, so I won’t be able to see him until May, but I can get dinner for myself and zoom call him 😂😂
Sweet Caroline   What an amazing contest! It’s so creative and thoughtful!!   My husband and I met in a funny way. An ex-friend of mine gave him my photo and number without asking me and I guess he really liked what he saw because he called me. We lived in neighboring states and met in person a couple months after we started talking and the rest is history. We’ve been married since 2012 (we met in 2009) and have two kids together. I love that he always puts his family first. He’ll gladly sacrifice his own comfort and desires to make sure that the kids and I have everything we want and need. He also spends almost all of his free time with me and our kids. He’s really a devoted family man.   Thanks so much for the amazing contest! And I’m so sorry to hear about your ribs. Ouch! I hope you feel better soon!! 💖
Sweet Caroline  The wife and I actually met as children.  My dad had a auto shop/gas station in my tiny home town, and she would come through town with her mom to visit her grandparents.  I remember the first time i saw her.  I was 8 or 9, she was 5 or 6.  She came in and asked my dad for a drink.  He said "of course you can darlin" and she giggled and turned bright red.  LOL  Some years later, I was 17, working in the local grocery store.  She had come in with her mother quite a few times that I had seen, and we were both too shy to say anything to each other.   Then she left....  and didnt come back in for months.  I had thought she had moved away, and i missed my shot.  Then one day, i saw her.  She had come back in, and i couldnt let my chance slip by again, so i had to talk to her.  I asked her for her name, and i was floored.  Beautiful name for a beautiful girl.    That was in 2003...   we were married in 2006, had our first son in 2007, and another in 2015..   She has dealt with me for literally half my life at this point.   As far as what i love about here..  theres too much to list.  Shes great.  Shes beautiful, shes a great mother to our boys.  We can be stupid and crack each other up at 2am, and be happy to get up just a few hours later..  But my favorite thing of all.....  those eyes.   She says theyre "just boring old brown eyes"  but they are not.  They literally look like pools of honey in the sunlight, and can make anyone stop and take notice.
Sweet Caroline   I met my boyfriend actually when I was 12 LOL I looked like a little boy still at that time but I never realized I would like him until many years later when I saw him at a thanksgiving celebration at my friends house. He looked very cute and I guess he thought the same about me so we started chatting and slowly began dating!
I’m so sorry you fractured a rib! It seems like you can’t catch a break. I hope you are feeling alright.   sweet caroline   I met my husband 6.5 years ago. We were both in college and met on Tinder! We have been married for 5.5 years now.   I love him so much! He is a good husband and a great father to our daughter. He is intelligent, hard working, and full of charity. He is in medical school studying to be a family doctor for the underserved. His dream is to go on mission trips and run a free clinic for those without insurance. He has such a kind heart.  Thanks for the Valentine’s Day contest!
Sweet caroline is a great song! My story is kinda serendipitous. I fooled around with this boy back in high school though we never officially dated. fast forward 8 years and we are both in our late 20's with careers and all that. Surfing tinder and see his face. Swipe right. Immediate match. We fall in love and are now engaged. I cant believe tinder brought the love of my life back into the fold. Thank you for the contest!
Awh this is a great contest. Thank you for hosting. Sweet Caroline  I met my husband at Amazon on our first night of work. I instantly was crushing the moment I met him. We started talking and had our first date after graveyard shift at Denny’s. We instantly clicked and formed a great bond. That was 2014 and here we are 6 years later ❣️ He is my best friend. We do everything together. I love that he is patient with me, he is caring, he is so so loving, and he has a great sense of humor. I wouldn’t make it in life without him. 💙  Hope you feel better soon. Thanks for the contest
Sweet caroline  I love love!! I met my boyfriend through bumble, my opening line was "wow hi" I quickly followed that up and gave him my number and texted him saying "hey lets go out tomorrow" he called, me, I didn't answer, he thought he was getting punked. Late late that night, I called him back to make plans for the following day. We were going to meet at the park and go for a walk with his friends puppy. We did! But we didn't want the date to end there.. so we scrambled for more things to do together, we went to get coffee,  went to his friends house to drop off the dog, continued walking, and then went out to dinner! My boyfriend is so supportive, so loving, gentle, caring, helpful, insanely smart, very articulate, the most handsome man I've ever seen, a great brother and son and uncle, he makes me laugh, makes me feel special, makes me feel like anything is possible, I just love him to pieces and hope to make him my hubby someday. (soon preferably)
I met my husband on November 23rd, 2013. I have a best friend I've known for more than 15 years. He had a best friend that he grew up with in Alaska. They had moved down to WA together. I'd never met this friend. In 2013 I was throwing myself a birthday party and decided to invite this Joe guy I'd heard so much about. He walked in carrying a huge dinosaur for my Toys for Tots birthday, cracked a joke and I knew I was in trouble. We started seeing each other and when our mutual best friend found out, he was excited. He gave me away at our wedding and was Joe's best man. We were married on April 1, 2017. April Fool's Day, which was perfect for us. He once told me that he could never leave me because I was his Pikachu, lol. He's kind, loving, affectionate and amazingly supportive. I didn't know relationships could be like this until I met him. He changed my life. He loves my daughter so much and our grandbaby is his pride and joy. He is my rock and I am better for having him in my life. 💚💚💚  Thank you for the contest and the chance to brag on my Joe! Sweet Caroline. I hope you heal quickly! You've been through so much. Take care, friend. 💚💚💚
Sweet caroline ☺️  I met my SO through friends in high school. We were friends for a little but quickly realized we were more than friends. We always were "together" when we were together but also went through periods of being apart and dating other people. Our paths lead back to one another and we decided we couldn't live without one another anymore and made it official. That was 9 years ago! Woo. It's been a wild ride.   We haven't had a date night in forever so thank you so much for the opportunity friend!!! 💗

Hi everyone!  English is **not** my native language so please forgive me for mistakes ;)  I'm an 18 years old teenager (male), just finished high school last year (a senior year that got fu\*ked by covid). back in my home country, Israel, every person that finishes high school need to donate three years of his life for protecting the country in the IDF (israel defense forces). I know it's sounds weird but it's mandatory for the safety of the country, please don't make any remarks against israel or the IDF as i know it's a big subject and my wish is to meet new people and friends and not to argue or fight :)  so in my case i postponed my service in a year to come here to the united states (los angels) to do as many volunteering and as much help as i can in this year with the Jewish community. my main goal is to give the Jewish people that live in the US as feeling of a connection to the country of israel and to the israelis as we are a big family :)  one of the things that i always saw online was those kind of subreddit and always wished to join one but I couldn't because I didn't lived in the us but now i finally can :)  so a little bit about myself, I love music, all kinds and genres. my favorite band is arctic monkeys and i have a tattoo of them on my right hand :) I've got to be in a lot of concerts for someone my age (pearl jam, guns n roses, arctic monkeys, dua lipa, sia, depach mode and more..) but my best moment ever was when i was in a twenty one pilots concert and the lead singer stood on top of the crowd and sang, and i got to hold his foot and put him up in the air :)  I also love movies and tv shows my favorite show is friends and my favorite movie is pulp fiction and I'm a Huge funko pop collector.  I'm not so good with introducing myself so please feel free to ask any questions you want  so excited about this!
First, don't apologize for your introduction. There are as many ways to make them as there are people. Just be you and let whatever comes be natural. Besides, if I had to introduce myself in a non-native language it would be a catastrophe. So welcome here to the US and to the reddit. You're in good company. Look around, read some activities and respond, set up your wishlist, give a small gift or two if you can. You'll make friends.
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Shalom! It's nice to see another Jewish person on this sub. I held a Hanukkah contest not too late ago, haha.  Do you like The Smiths at all? They're one of my favorite bands. Also, what are some concerts you want to see in the future?
I recently watched a show where one of the characters is from isreal and he has an interesting thick accent, well I read your post in his accent, I didn’t mean to but it kinda just happened lol   Hopefully you enjoy your time in the us and have an awesome time part of this sub! Arctic monkeys used to be my favorite band and then it shifted to bmth, and again shifted and now I’m nameless lol
Hello and welcome!  I too love attending concerts! I’ve been to two twenty one pilots concerts, they’re so much fun! The second one we were in the pit and we’re so close to them as the end. It’s so cool you got to help hold Tyler up!! When concerts are a thing again, who do you want to see?
Welcome to the sub! That's so amazing that you came here to the U.S. to interact with the Jewish community, but sorry that COVID messed it up for you. I thought your intro was great! Have you ever heard Los Campesinos? I love their music.
Welcome!
Welcome
Thank you for your impending service in the IDF.  And welcome.

Welcome to RAOA, Rgvili.
Hi! Welcome! What's your favourite funko pop you own?
Welcome! Nice to meet you! It's so cool that you are spending a year abroad to volunteer! I hope you enjoy it!
Hi and welcome!
super appreciated🙏🏻👏🏻 can't wait let's have some fun😜
Hi! Thank you for welcoming me❤️ I just got experience Halloween and Christmas for the first time and it was super exciting! But still I have to say my favorite holiday is purim🤪(Jewish Halloween basically) I love nature and doing hikes, I've got to go to Joshua tree a month ago and it was amazing! My favorite view in nature is rivers and falls I love cats! Although I have a dog I always say that the dream is a cat and a dog that can be best friends😅 I really appreciate you working with special needs kids, I'm volunteering a lot in kids education programs but after a few times of trying I can sadly say that working with special needs kids is just not for me. It's super important to me but I just can seem to handle it, so I can understand and appreciate your work🤝
Omg hiii❤️ that's really cool seeing there's more people here from the Jewish community 😃 I love the smiths! I actually had tickets for a Morrissey concert that was canceled due to covid😓 BTW Morrissey himself loves Israel! He had like a million concerts in israel and he really protects her
LOL which show is it? if you want to hear an Hebrew accent just watch any movie with gal gadot, it amazes me that after so much time in Hollywood she still has it 100%. thank you! Arctic monkeys will forever be my no.1 but horizon are definitely amazing too
I had so much concerts tickets canceled because of covid I just want every one of them, there was red hot chilli peppers, iron maiden, the pixies, Morrissey, Khalid, Billie eilish, andersson pack, another twenty one pilots, Taylor swift, faith no more, alt j, frank Carter, can the elephant, Mumford and sons, kings of lion, rex orange county, Kendrick lamar and even more...  covid had us bad... 😢
thank you! covid does make it harder to really experience the US but I still love it here😅 I haven't heard them but I'm really looking for new music to try so I'll give them a listen, what kind of music are they doing?
hii👋🏼👋🏼
heeeyyy👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼
thank you! ❤️❤️
hii and thank you ❤️❤️👋🏼
Hiii! thank you  [<3 <3 <3](https://gph.is/g/ZYAq6v3)
hiii! thank you for your welcoming 💖 we're gonna have so much fun
Hiiii thank you for your welcoming💖 I'm consistently re-watching friends for the last 8 years 😂
hey👋🏻👋🏻
Joey and phoebe from friends! (from the first friends wave that they've stopped making😅)
hiii!! thank you so much❤️❤️
How exciting you were able to go to Joshua Tree that's like a magical dream for most people. Do you have any pictures of it. I do know when I 1st started working with children 20 years ago I found myself a little uncomfortable a little nervous and a little unsure but as we grow with age and we mature, we learn how to handle situations differently and we look at everybody with love and tenderness and you find your way to work through it knowing that you're helping them out so maybe with a little bit more experience as you get a little older things my change never give up.🧸
I got to see him in concert once! It was really amazing. He's good in concert when he actually shows up, lol.
Haha you don’t want to know...  but the third season of 90 day fiancé lol I just finished watching it...   Arctic monkeys are really amazing, but music always shifts for me, but I’m glad to know it’s a forever favorite!
Oh my goodness, those all sound so amazing! I hope you’ll get to see them!
They're sort of indie rock I guess? I like their earlier albums a bit better but they're all really great in my opinion!
[I do! ](https://photos.app.goo.gl/xfAyVcVZfmDMiK5m9) a lot of people are saying that we haven't got to really experience Joshua as we did a hike right next it appearntly and didn't went in but idk it was really great 😅😊 I guess you're right, I love working with kids and I really hope that in the future I'll the find the way to access kids with special needs too as it it a very important cause for me✊🏻✊🏻
that's really cool that you got to see him, he has one of the most special voices ever. but yeah he is a character 😅😂
And those pictures are nothing more then just breathtaking wow. Thank you for sharing
This really warms my heart and with an attitude like that and your personality you're really gonna go far and make a difference good for you my friend

💞💞💞💞💞💗💗💗
we were wondering how long a 3 lb bag feeds your stray babies?
Ah. Thank you. I feel honoured. No really. I'm like nearly crying and stuff over here. I think it's because my 30 lb cat is on my chest. Well, at least part of it.
awww such a happy image! they know how loved they are! do you have a little house on your porch for them too? I couldnt remember if you did!
Thank you🤗❤🧸🐭🌸
He must crush you with love!!!
Yes,they sit n sometimes are waiting for me when I get up..to know these babies rely on me just tears me up🤗🐈🐈🐈    I built a shelter in backyard,raised off ground by bricks from rain n snow..n put tarp over it to drain off.. rain n snow.. n I carried about 80 bricks cross the yard to help build it..lol..THAT was hardest part..making the foundation😁
He holds me down to tell me it's time to get up to feed him. Smartest cat I've ever had. Dumbest too.
Theyre so loved.do they ever come in?
Ah yes sounds like my Napse. I call him poo brain. Couldn’t fight his way out of a paper bag but if there’s food involved he’s problem solver extraordinaire... kinda...
Oh no,sadly..mr jj is an indoor cat only..and not sure if they have any diseases or such...so sadly they outdoors. I think 1 may be someone's, as they look very clean...but theres food water n shelter for all. I will never refuse any animal ,nor a human.
Hank, mine, has a nickname. Princess Train Traxxx. When it comes to food, he wants to be spoiled but has a one track mind. It's confusing. He's confusing. For a cat that I take on walks by just leading him with commands, he's a blasted moron. He has to see his food be filled or other wise, it's empty. Love him to death though.
Hahaha he sounds wonderful! I couldn’t get mine harness trained, they ragdoll!
Poo brain right now https://imgur.com/a/gBU95Z3
Such a cutie. Getting those snuggles.   [Hank enjoy the fresh morning air. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/zTqsYmp)

Happy cake day!
Not entering (in Canada!) but wanted to say Happy Cake Day, aaaand congrats on your first home! That is so exciting!
Not entering - in the US. But have a couple small waste bins(trash), a good can opener, corkscrew (if you drink), nice wooden spoon and spatula for kitchen, as well as cloth towels and napkins. Best of luck with your move!
Not entering but wanted to say Happy Cake Day! 🎂☺️
I really enjoy organizing a house once I have moved!! I hope you enjoy it too. To simplify that I recommend you fridge and kitchen  organizers and storage like Progressive brand (in amazon).  And household essential brand for baskets and others storage items.   I'm obsessed with pinterest interiors, something that has helped me a lot to imitate those designs is having many plants and avoiding leaving many objects in sight (on furniture or on display)
If you don’t already have tools, start by getting a hammer (and some nails, screws, and anchors) and a screwdriver (or drill).
Not entering but.....  You must have  this [hand candy broom holder ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DI8H364/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glc_fabc_HDMaGb700VW5J?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) it saves so much room and so useful to store things like your broom mop flies swatter and aprons  Happy cake day
Not entering but there's this really cool skinny rolling shelf thing that fits between that annoying space between the counter and fridge! Big enough to add pantry space!
Okay I have the best tip for you.   It’s so, so easy to make your own all purpose cleaning spray, and it’s all natural and 100% kid and pet safe.   All you do is soak orange peels in a jar of vinegar for 3-4 weeks, then pour the vinegar into a large spray bottle and fill it with water.   Works like a charm and is cheap as chips!!   As far as home must-haves, I’ll say hanging rope shelves in the kitchen for all my tea. Wax melts. Pretty throw blankets and cute cushions on the sofa. A Hetty vacuum. An InstaPot. And plenty of books!! xx  Thanks for the contest!! [List](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2P51VE00NVI9M?ref_=wl_share)
For me it's something for storage . Especially my husband and I were moving with both our stuff. I have quite a bit of make up and this was super handy [link](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07PB7SMMJ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_67RaGbDQZVK4B?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)  Other money saving tips - once you're with a broadband provider call them up towards the end and see if you can get a better offer. I'm with Virgin Media paying £30 a month, was going to go up to £41 and after calling I'm now £25!  [wishlist ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/CDQP6YS0HB9M) Thank you for the contest 😊
Congrats on your new house!   Home must haves for me I love   [Kitchen Trolley ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08DNKH2J6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fabc_n5VaGbZBQ2WA2) We don’t have a huge kitchen and hardly any cupboard space so this has made life a lot easier to keep veggies and packets in.   [Fairy Lights](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08FB834PD/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fabc_z7VaGbRBVRA9E) Fairy lights make any space cosy and homely. We have fairy lights around our fireplace and in our bedroom.   [Salt Cellar ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00309ODRE/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_fabc_f9VaGbYSFASN9) I don’t know why but I love my salt cellar it’s so handy and I think they look cute too.   Thanks for hosting such a interesting contest.   [Wishlist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2041JXB4IB40T?ref_=wl_share)
I would recommend some stainless steel baking trays (they will last a very long time, no rust) and a good set of chopping knives (bravedge are my favourite brand). Smelly sachets to sit on your radiator as they make the whole house smell good.
My must have is plants! They always make rooms feel so open and fresh and they are so good to keep a good air quality in the house! In my opinion, even a small plant can make a house feel like a home!  [List!](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/URVP101R6HUM?ref_=wl_share)
Congrats on your new home!! My must have are [these containers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/MyChoice-Snap-Airtight-Storage-Container/dp/B078Y5HR3K/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=containers&qid=1610812245&sr=8-5). Really useful if you made a large portion of food so you can save them for later in the fridge. Also these [clips](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ikea-103-391-71-Sealing-assorted-30-pack/dp/B00C65BLD2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=food+clips&qid=1610812441&sr=8-5) are life savers for sealing packets.   Moving out for the first time and living with your partner is such a lovely thing. I did that around 4 months ago and learnt a lot of helpful things and recipes :)  [WL](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2O4ZOXGXPQ8ZB?ref_=wl_share)
Congrats!  Darkening curtains for getting better sleep. Like [these](https://www.amazon.com/Deconovo-Darkening-Insulated-Blackout-42x63-inch/dp/B016MB5K0A/) and they come in different colors.  [Wishlist](https://smile.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/OQ499Q1NOTN7)
Not entering as I’m in the US, but congrats!   Look, I’m old(er). I’ve washed a lot of clothes and shut a lot of bags of potato/tortilla chips. These are the absolute best clips ever. Don’t waste your money on wood ones that mildew and break.  Buy these.  [I’m not even kidding.](https://www.amazon.com/Heavy-Clothes-Italy-Clothespins-Cosatto/dp/B00ZSQMPDG). They’re amazing!
Congrats on the home!!   For me it’s cancels! I love having nice smelling ones all around as it’s super soothing!! [this is awesome! and a fav of mine ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yankee-Candle-Small-Snowflake-Cookie/dp/B00DS4OXYE/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=Small+Yankee+candle&qid=1610822731&sr=8-5)  That or some nice plants are always a go to!! They make things smell nice and seem more homey! They  aren’t the most practical but they are things  to have to make a house a home!  Thankyiu for the contest and hope uou are well  [wish list ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/I7BRJF66NU8C?ref_=wl_share)
Congratulations on your new home! I hope you and your partner are very happy making it a home 🏡.  I had been kept separated from my partner for most of 2020, and 1 week before Christmas we secured the keys to our forever home. It was the best gift we could have ever wished for 💕.

u/VexedKitten94 Figured if you didn’t have to buy these, you could buy yourself something!
That’s so nice for her and her bub!
What sweet gifts!
What a sweet and thoughtful gift!
What a sweet gesture!
Oh my gosh, you are seriously so thoughtful! Thank you so much!!! 🥺💕
I know, so sweet! 🥺
My pleasure 🥰
Also your thank you posts are always so lovely, you’re so talented. 🤩❤️

But how do you fold it in?!
u/so_appalled_ Waheyyyy! Here’s a thing.
Happy bday to your daughter!!
Happy birthday to your daughter!
Lmao that is the best show EVER
Like... with a spoon, duh
My bad, with a spoon is not what she says. She says YOU JUST FOLD IT IN
Holy crap!! For real??? You spoil me my dear!!! Thank you so much 😘😘😘
Also!!!!  I loveeee the title! How you fold in the cheese??!!
It is. Catherine Ohara is fricken hilarious. I never understand how she doesn’t break down laughing in most of her scenes.
But how?! Do you fold it in half like a piece of paper and drop it in the pot? Or like what do you do?!
Yeah she is wonderful. I watched a behind the scenes type docu on Netflix called Best Wishes, Warmest Regards and it just made me love them all more. Highly recommend
I watched that too! It reminded me of how much an act her character really is. She’s such a calm and gentle person. It’s crazy she can stay in character so well.

Hey! If you remember, after you read it, could you message me and tell me what you thought of it? I’ve been looking into a book like this to help my best friend be more confident because me telling her how awesome she is all the time isn’t doing the job 😅
Book looks absolutely amazing and I hope you enjoy it you absolute gem
You're a Baddass with a capitol B, OP.
This is a great book, I really enjoy it! If you get the opportunity to listen to the audio book, it's a fun listen!
I have this book its great! 100% would reccomend!
Thanks again to u/ssmith71608
Yes you can!!!
Nice! Looks like good advice
Hmm somehow my earlier post got deleted 😕.   I missed reading out on this one, maybe I should add it to my list?
*psst* You already are a badass 💖
The author's last name sounds like a superhero would be super genuine with you.
Oh this is great!
💛💛💛
Great book!  Enjoy!
You are a total badass!
I’ll have to check this book out!
Need this! Let us know how it is please 😁
You sound like a good friend. 👍🏽
Yeah absolutely!
You’re welcome. But I have to politely disagree with you - you already are a badass, in my humble opinion. 😊
Aww thanks! ❤️ I try!

So I probably should’ve made this sooner because I dived right into commenting but omg you’re all so kind and supportive! The whole community is giving me the warm and fuzzies!   Hi! I’m Lottie! Im 27, honorary Scottish. I’m a biologist, and until recently I was working on running Covid tests. They shut down my lab and I miss my machines! Thankfully my line of work seems to be in high demand so I’ll have my science back soon.   I live with my fiancé and our three cats, and I’m definitely a crazy cat lady! I’m also into gaming, we’re building ourselves a fancy gaming rig with our “covid crashed our wedding” fund and in the meantime I’ve gotten totally sucked into animal crossing.   I’m not sure what else I should put here! I’m just excited to join you all :)
Welcome to the group! What kinds of kitties do you have
Hello! Welcome to RAOA! 👋 I’m Lily, it’s so nice to meet you! I hope that we can be friends! Being a newbie can be pretty tricky, so if you need help with anything - or just want to chat - feel free to PM me and I will assist you to the best of my ability! ✨💛
Woaaah! Welcome!   Wash doing healthcare but now I’m working in manufacturing COVID test kits and R&D for other diseases / illnesses!
Welcome, I have a tuxedo kitty named Bing. It took me forever to figure out the flair!! Lol, I can help if needed
Hi! I just joined this sub too. Science, cats, and videogames ftw!
Welcome!!    What are your cats names?
Ooh, you're a biologist? I'm hoping to become one after college! I wanna pester you with questions about your work but I won't, lol.  I've also gotten sucked into Animal Crossing. I love it so much!
Welcome to RAOA, Lottie.
Hi, welcome to the group! Who is your favorite Animal Crossing villager! 😀
Welcome! There are many crazy cat ladies here, so you are in good company. Your positive energy is a great addition to the group. 😊
Welcome fellow crazy cat lady! I love Animal Crossing, too! :) The gaming rig sounds awesome! I just got my first gaming pc this past year. What games are you looking forward to playing?
Animal crossing is so fun and you said cats now hand over the pictures of the fluff balls🤲.
Welcome!  We’re happy to have you here!
Welcome! Nice to meet you! I have a kitty cat named Astra. What are your cats' names?
Hello I’m a fellow cat lover also meow!!
I am a crazy cat lady as well. I have two cats: Sylvester (a tuxedo) and Squeaky (looks like a Russian blue).
Welcome! Crazy cat lady here.
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Welcome. I've got 2 cats.
Hello and welcome to the sub!
Do you like Garfield?
I have three cats too! No fiance though, but I like it that way. I play Animal Crossing. In fact, it's on my TV right now. I had to restart my island when I upgraded from a Lite to a Switch because I was a dumb dumb. It's okay. I got RAYMOND.
Hello and welcome! Just recently got sucked into Animal Crossing myself! Do you have a favorite villager?
I’m running immunizations at the moment! Thanks for being part of the solution my pal💕
Welcome! What is honorary Scottish?  Sorry to hear they shut down your lab, fingers crossed everything opens again soon (especially schools, I cannot wait for them to re-open!).   I'm also a crazy cat lady, but I just have the one because she needed a nice home where she was the only cat and could get nice and spoiled. She's very shy so she's loving lockdown because it means no visitors to disturb her. She's started jumping onto my lap while I'm at the PC now which is adorable, but makes it very hard to work (she also loves to play with her noisy toys whenever I'm on a call). I was very tempted to build a PC during lockdown but I decided to get a really cheap one for now, I'd planned on upgrading it later but actually it runs everything I play on Steam pretty well.

Hello from one crazy cat lady to the next!  Actually, my whole family is a crazy cat family. 🤓  Welcome to the sub! We are excited to have more fur baby pictures in the future!
Hello there! Welcome! I hope you get back to your machines soon. I can't imagine doing anything science related. I'll stick with teaching English. ;; You're wayyyy more smart than I!
Hi! Welcome! Do you have a favourite video game character?
Hi Lottie! I had a great aunt Lottie - you are only the second person I’ve ever known with that name!
Wow that’s so cool! Thank you for working on the front lines!
I have three short hair black and white kitties, all with science names!  Synapse (Napse)   https://imgur.com/a/UJQaR89  Florence Nightingkitty (flossie)   https://imgur.com/a/A6S9hbV  And Rosalind Frankitty (Rosie)   https://imgur.com/a/f0YbSYQ
Thank you lily that’s so kind of you :) I’m getting into the flow of the threads a little bit now!
Ah that’s exciting! That’s what I want to be doing too. Unfortunately in Scotland they like to place the labs in random tiny towns in the middle of nowhere, and no ones teaching driving lessons right now!
I think I know how, it’s more a matter of remembering my password finding the time between exciting conversations and animal crossing! I’ll get to it before I go to bed (I hope)   Kitties https://imgur.com/a/IBQTCdm
Best combo! Welcome fellow newbie!
I replied elsewhere, but here are pics with their names affixed, because some smarty pants gave them long names 😅  https://imgur.com/a/IBQTCdm
Secretly I haven’t got the biggest depth of knowledge about real labs, I just got my first lab job (4 years after graduation because autism bleh) and then they shut the lab. I’m happy to give any answers I have though! Biggest piece of advice is get any experience you can during your studies. The industry is killer without experience.    I just got my switch and I love it. My fiancé wants to place AC too but I heard it’s one island per switch and tbh I think I’d rather buy him his own switch than share my island!
Thank you :) how do you get the smile link by the way? And will it donate to the charity chosen by the giver or the reciever?
Hello! Thank you! I’m not sure yet, I’ve got 5 now but I can only remember the original names! I think I’d have to say Boone because I was outraged on his behalf when I walked in on a new neighbour lifting weights. Where’s boones weights?!
Ah excellent! Do you know, I do try to be open and friendly but that’s the first time I’ve been described as having positive energy, at least in a very long time. After years of mental health struggles that feels like a real achievement, thank you!
Thank you :) were very excited about the rig but the motherboard keeps being delayed and they won’t ship the rest without it. We did manage to (separately) get a rtx 3070 graphics card which a reliable source told me is pretty good, but I’m not up to speed on the hardware size.   You know, I’m not sure. I have so many games I can’t play on my laptop (thanks steam sales...) that I’m a bit spoilt for choice. I might just default to a good old game of Skyrim to test it out.
Yes boss. https://imgur.com/a/IBQTCdm
Thank you!
Hello Astra mama, my babies are called Napse, Flossie and Rosie   https://imgur.com/a/IBQTCdm
Hello cat person! Here are kitties! https://imgur.com/a/IBQTCdm
Oh lovely! Give them snuggles from me. I have two tuxedos and a black with white spot :) https://imgur.com/a/IBQTCdm
Hello crazy cat lady! Enjoy cats! https://imgur.com/a/IBQTCdm
Happy new year! Thank you for welcoming me.   By holiday do you mean festival or vacation? I’m going to take a guess and say Easter. Lots of chocolate and it’s spring, my favourite season. As for things about nature, simple answer cherry blossoms. Nerdy answer: Genes like green fluorescent protein found in jelly fish.  That’s lovely, you must be such a kind and caring person! Give mr JJ a snuggle from me! I’ve just been woken up by Rosie and every time I stop fussing her to type she gets grumpy haha  Thank you, everyone here is so kind and helpful!
Yay cats!
Thank you! I love your username, I’m just rewatching community lately to make my fiancé watch it
I am unfortunately indifferent to Garfield. It wasn’t really a thing when I was growing up and r/garfieldminusgarfield and the other one has put me right off!
Yay three cat families! Don’t worry, fiancé’s can be a hassle of their own. Mine just convinced me to let him set up a tent on my AC island. I think you’re better off without 😝  Oh no! Your poor island!
I like Boone because he’s the least sarcastic so far! I’ve heard good things about Bob though
Hats of to you. Let’s get this world back!
Thank you! I’m honorary Scottish because I’m actually English but I’ve been here 8.5 years and I’m marrying a Scottish man so he says I can be Scottish too now.   Oh dear, have you got kids that are needing back in school?   It sounds like you are a wonderful cat mama to build up her confidence like that, but now I need pics!   Yay for running your games! That’s all you need really, the great thing about pcs is you can upgrade them little by little I think. What games do you play?
Hello! I know that feeling, I have a crazy cat fiancé and our mums are crazy cat grandmas  Thank you! I shall share them at every oppotunity.
Hello and thank you! If it helps you’re much braver than I, I considered teaching at one point but I don’t have what it takes. Are you drowning in red tape over there like our teachers? Thank you regardless for all your undoubtedly hard work right now!
Oooh excellent question! I scrolled my steam library to think on it and I think the khajiit traders in Skyrim haha
Hello! I am quite a rare thing, but I hate the name Charlotte! Most other Charlottes seem to go with Charlie.
Thats really kind of you. All I want is our world back!
Sweet kitty taxes
Hahaha we’ll it’s probably for the best. Research is crazy with all the compounds we use. Best of luck driving! Do tell me how that goes haha
my baby after surgery: [Bing](https://i.imgur.com/IGWAQNO.jpg)  I feel like Napse and Bing could hang
That advice honestly helps! What sort of experience do you think is best? I've thought about working some lab assistant jobs in college to get a good resume built up.  I feel the same, lol. My bf wants his own Switch, which is good, because ain't no way I'm sharing my Animal Crossing island! What are your Dreamies, if I can ask? I have one of mine (Bob!) currently.
Replace *www* with *smile* and purchases benefit the buyer's chosen charity.
Haha! Biff the hippo was my first villager on my island and he has the jock personality type too. His room was so totally opposite of his personality so I had to build him a little gym outside. 😂 He left me a while ago ugh, so rude. But my favorite villager is Bob. ☺️
In addition to crazy cat ladies, there are many people here familiar with mental health struggles. What’s so great about the community is that we are here for each other and lift each other up when needed. If you ever need a boost, come find me. 😊  Your intro radiates good humor and positive energy. I am looking forward to interacting with you more!
Awww man, that sucks! I hope it gets to you soon! Ohhh that's a good graphics card!   Haha, steam sales are definitely like that! Ohh Skyrim seems like a good place to start :)   Let me know if you are ever looking for more steam friends!
They’re adorable thank you lol
Aww! Napse looks a little like my Astra.   [https://imgur.com/gallery/oAwjfXx](https://imgur.com/gallery/oAwjfXx)
Aww how cute ! :)
They are precious. The last one looks like my Sylvester.   https://postimg.cc/HJ3XHHLv both of the boys  Squeaky with his tongue out: https://postimg.cc/pp8jrKTF  Sylvester in a cave of blankets: https://postimg.cc/9w9D4jWh
They are beautiful 😭 I have 2 black cats, good luck charms!
Well hello there my friend I will say this is a first I don't think I've ever heard Anyone mention protein found in jellyfish how interesting can you tell me a little bit more about that? Yes this is a loving friendly community and I'm hoping that you enjoy your stay with us🧸❤
I love that sub LOL
Psh, if you live in Scotland and want to be Scottish then you can be as Scottish as you want! You don't need to marry one of us for that.  It's actually the opposite - I want to be teaching in a classroom again rather than doing online learning.   I've not really done that much to build her confidence as she already knew and trusted me (she's was our family cat), I just gave her a home away from the horrible neighbour's cats who used to bully her and because my sister got a kitten so the kitten got all the attention. Here's an old photo of her at my mum's - she doesn't get outside now because it's not safe. https://i.imgur.com/h3LQPC2.jpg  Yeah, my original plan had been to buy a really cheap one specifically so I wouldn't get distracted by games then build a fancy one later so that I would already have the peripherals but actually it runs better than my laptop does. At the moment I'm playing a lot of Hades (although on the Switch rather than PC) and Cook, Serve, Delicious 3 as I adore that series. I played a lot of Animal Crossing last year but not played it in months so my poor villagers will be wondering where I went. What about you? What other games do you like?
Nice 😂 I've always liked Maiq a lot haha
That’s a great nickname for Charlotte!
Awwww that little neck cushion! He doesn’t look too impressed. They could definitely hang :)
Anything in a lab technician/assistant position helps, they like to know you know how a lab functions. Beyond that anything with techniques you haven’t done before. They’ll vary within the field but I studied molecular biology so I’ll name a few relevant to me. Things like cell culture, pcr,  cyto/histochemistry are simple enough techniques but it’s good to have them down really well. More complex testing and assays is really good to have experience in too. Thermofisher have a lot of good educational resources that I use to brush up on techniques but I’m sure you’ve got enough resources in college. I just like to brush up really well on specific techniques before interviews.   Dreamies? Is this an AC thing? I’ve only been playing a week so I don’t know that term! The only dreamies I know of are cat treats!
Wonderful, thank you!
Oh! I assumed the first two villagers were the same for everyone! Some one else said Bob too but I’ve not met him yet, so I’m excited for that now.  I just caved and let my fiancé move in to my island 😬
I’m honestly so glad to have found such a community! And I see (in my brief peruse of the info) there’s a gaming group somewhere so I’m excited to join in.  Looking forward to getting to know you all better!
I’m always looking for more steam friends but idk what it is about my username, it seems to be impossible to find!   Skyrim is the first big game I really played so it’ll always be my favourite.
I bet you say that to all the kitties
I think I’ve seen a picture of Astra around here recently! She actually looks a lot like our girl Freyja that we lost last summer. https://imgur.com/a/MnLpIXP
Awh! Haha I love the squeaky deep face. Sylvester reminds me of our fourth cat Freyja, who we lost last summer. https://imgur.com/a/MnLpIXP (yeah we had 4 cats in a small flat...)
Of course! And the most personality too
There are lots of genes that can be really useful in fields like synthetic biology (think GMOs but for research) but my favourite one is the one for green fluorescent protein (GFP) and it comes from the jelly fish *Aequorea victoria*. It glows under UV light and can be used as a marker for various things, like proof of transfection (ie proof your cells have taken up the genes you inserted). During my masters I was working on some really cool research involving having cells react to the presence of GFP by lighting up with BFP (which I think is actually a genetically modified version of GFP now that Im looking it up!)   Its my favourite part of nature because I think the ability to manipulate these things like building blocks are cool and its amazing that things we once never dreamed possible just exist in nature like magic.
I love that sub, but it doesnt endear me to garfield haha
Ah you’re also Scottish! Yay, I just started assuming everyone was American... Good to hear though, I’ll tell the Fiancé to pack his bags :P  Ah, I didn’t know we were doing that here! Our friend is homeschooling his little girl but she’s only P2. Poor nip barely knows what school is at this point!   Awww what a floofy floofer! She’s so pretty!   Im currently into AC big time, I bought hades on the switch too but I’ve not played it yet, fiancé says it’s good though. Once we get the PC I’m excited to play Skyrim again, it’s my favourite game, some fall out, far cry (lots of RPGs!) also lots of smaller games like don’t starve, binding of Isaac, plus some civilisation, I’ve promised to give 6 a proper go haha I’m hoping to stream a little bit too!
That was the one I was trying to think of!
I'll definitely keep that in mind! I'm a huge nerd for virology and parasitology- it'd be my dream to work studying those, especially a neglected tropical disease.  Dreamies are your 'dream villagers'- the ones you want moee than any others! Bob is a funky little purple cat and I love him. My other dreamies are Eugene and Julian.
You're welcome.
Oh, weird! Maybe if you used your ID number instead? I'm under the same name there :)   Aww, that's awesome! To tell you the truth, I've never played it D: Maybe I should soon
I do because they’re all so gosh darn cute!
Aww, that's cool! I'm sorry about your Freyja. I lost my Cami girl in August. And now I have Astra!
Freyja was beautiful. I love the black on her nose. i am sorry for your loss.
Well this was very advanced for me and I try to follow along the best that I could it sound very exciting and I'm sure during the time that you were exploring it and doing what you did must have been a fantastic experience. Thank you for sharing
Yep! I haven't been active on here for quite a few years now but back when I first joined there were quite a few other Scottish people on here, not sure if they're still around though! I did reply to you at around 4am so can totally understand assuming I'm American rather than just somebody with a very messed up sleeping pattern. You can always keep him for the accent, or for getting to see him in a kilt at the wedding.  Currently the schools in Scotland are all closed except to children of Key Workers (and both parents need to be key workers) so it's all online. I'm not a full teacher yet, just a student, but I start my next placement next week so no idea how we'll get enough experience as it's not likely they'll open again anytime soon. I feel so bad for the P2's because they missed so much last year and are missing even more now! My class before Christmas was a P1 class and I observed part of a P2 class and some of the kids were doing the exact same material as the P1s because they'd missed so much because of the first lockdown.   She's very floofy and so pretty, I have so many photos of her and could just sit and watch her for ages. My sister has an even fluffier cat so we just send each other photos of our floofs (she also has two non-fluffy cats who look very similar so my favourite is the floof as he's the one I can accurately identify). What do your cats look like?  Hades is incredible, I'd recommend starting it when you don't have anything else to do though because I played it non-stop for hours. My bf and I take turns playing it as it's just so addictive as you always want to do one more run. I love Skyrim! I've not played it on the PC so I've never been able to use mods which look so much fun. My favourite character to play is my sneaky Khajiit archer but I also really enjoy being a mage. I've never played Far Cry but I've heard really good things about it so might give it a go when I finally have time to sink into an RPG (which I also love, the Final Fantasy series is my favourite, and I adore Dragon Age). I'm now really tempted to have a game of Civ VI later, I was a bit unsure at first too but with the expansions I love it more than Civ V. I've also started playing a lot of board games on the PC now too, I've played Ticket to Ride so much that my bf now can't stand the background music.
Definitely diagnostics then! PCR/qPCR/RT-PCR are going to be your best friends!   Ahh I see! I definitely want Bob by the sounds of it! I’m looking forward to meeting more, most of mine are very sarcastic! I’ve just caved and let my fiancé move in on my island 😬
Ah maybe! I will have a look tomorrow but unfortunately it’s almost 2am and I’m away to bed. Could you possibly pm me so I can remember to send you my details in the morning?
Well... you’ve got me there...
I’m sorry for your loss too, it’s so hard losing them! I’m glad you have astra for snuggles though.
Thank you, she was a lovely wee girl.
Sorry! Reading back I kinda info dumped a little there. It’s very exciting stuff for me, I’ve always wanted to be a mad scientist!
Thats okay, I think I was replying at 2am! I think its just the reddit effect, everyone here seems to be american! He is very good at reading r/scottishpeopletwitter in a thick weegie accent (despite not being weegie) so he'll do :P  I feel so sorry for all the kids right now, theyve been almost completely forgotten. Theres a lot of teenagers round by us that are resorting to antisocial behaviour like breaking and burning things because they are so bored. Thank you for being part of the force fighting to give their generation hope for the future. And good luck with your studies!  Here are my babies https://imgur.com/a/IBQTCdm I so want a big floofy floofer, but fiance says no cats till we move to a bigger house.   I will have to give it a go, I think the art style put me off, which is super dumb I know. I just spent like 3 hours on AC so maybe I should do some humaning today and get to Hades another day though. Im more of a hack and bash type player, makes up for my lack of dexterity haha. Ive never played Far Cry either but I was watching Griffin McElroy (of MBMBAM, its so funny, check it out) mod skyrim to death and he made a comment that far cry 3 is just skyrim with guns and I was like I WANT THAT so I went to the steam store and it turns out Far Cry is up to 5 now but 3/4/5 were all on 80% off so I bought all of them! I think Im going to start at 3 so I dont have a repeat of the oblivion effect, where the difference in skyrim was so great that I couldnt convince myself to go back and play oblivion.   So do you recommend the expansions to enjoy Civ VI? I couldnt get to grips with the districts and the lack of automation in workers and things and it was just way too much to digest. I have been playing board games on steam too, though I prefer carcassonne right now. If youre on steam you should total add me!
Sure! :) Have a good rest!
Thanks!
Hurrah for unhealthy sleeping habits! I'm really good when I have something to get up for in the morning (like when I was on placement) but at the weekend and while I have Uni online I just stay up far later than I should.  In 2019 at the Fringe they had a museum of Scottish Twitter which was the most amazing thing! They had a map showing tweets from around the country, illustrations of tweets, a translation section where you could hear them read, then hear them translated into posh English and they gave you free gifts like canvas bags and pencils.  Thank you! It took me ages to figure out what I wanted to do since I love learning but do not love academia so Primary teaching is perfect because I can teach all the subjects and learn as much as I want without having to write essays. I had a fantastic experience at Primary School because of my teachers so I was definitely inspired by them.  What fantastic cats! I love the stare while you're playing the Switch, mine does that all the time demanding I pay attention to her not the game.  My sister is put off by the art style too, which is frustrating as she loves Roguelike games and I know she would enjoy it. Hopefully once lockdown is over I can just let her try it and that might convince her.   I'm so bad at hacking and bashing because I don't pay attention to things like my health so I just die a lot, while being sneaky forces me to actually do things slowly and can heal if needed. I'm sure I have Far Cry on the PS4 and if not my sister probably has it as she has a ridiculous amount of games.  I definitely recommend the expansions, it took me a while to get used to the districts too but now I really like them as it makes it easier to focus. It is annoying having to manually choose everything for the workers so I definitely don't use them as well as I could but oh well, I still have fun which is the main thing!.  I used to have Carcassonne on my old phone and it was the only game I had so I played it obsessively for a while and haven't been able to play it since! My Steam friend code is 64689002 and uh...I'm also a little obsessed with getting achievements (I was beating my friend, but he's overtaken me so now I need around 200 to beat him...I even have a post-it with 5 digit increments to mark off until I manage just because it really annoys him whenever I manage).
I have sent you an invite! We shall chat more on steam while I scope out our mutal games?   BTW the switch cat, thats just flossies resting bitch face haha
We have a friend in common!
We do! In the least creepy way possible, I have heard of you! (And by heard of, I mean that I know he has a friend with your name who is geeky but that's all)
I know of you too! You took him in for Christmas! He’s one of my best friends. I think I sent the request, looking forward to gaming together
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kyciit/brainstorm_what_is_one_movie_you_can_recommend_me/
This is my first brainstorm post so hopefully this is right!  Some people are passionate about cooking. Some are passionate about making art, or their children. I am passionate about watching movies! Since I was a child, movies have never let me down, movies give you something in common with most people. Watching a movie is a way to bring people together.  I love to rewatch all of my favorite movies throughout the year, especially around Halloween and Christmas time. (I have a schedule for those months lol) And, yes, I am one of those people who has their own little Oscars Party. Sure its just me and my mother, but what the hell? I love showbiz.  My goal this year is to enjoy more movies, just like I always do, but I mustn't watch Forrest Gump every other day, or Girls Trip every week. I need new material! Is anyone like me and has the issue of adding new things to their Netflix list and then just rewatching the same shit all the time?  So, if you could please recommend me at least one movie, or TV show, to watch this 2021. Film makes me happy, and I need more of that this year! I may weed out a few, but I will do my best to see everything that is suggested that is new to me. Suggestions may be new, old, foreign, short, animated or anything inbetween.   Thank you so much, and I wish you all a wonderful weekend!
My Neighbor Totoro. The Shape of Water. The Princess Bride. Little Miss Sunshine. Galaxy Quest. The Station Agent. What We Did on Our Holiday. Baby Mama. Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Moon. Kung Fu Hustle.
I recommend Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind if you haven’t seen it! It’s an all time favorite of mine. Love the concept and raw emotion in this film! 😁
If you haven't had the chance to watch 1917 yet, watch that one. I'm not usually a war movie person but it kept me hooked!
Your name and spiderman into the spiderverse are good!
Harold and Maude! It’s an amazing movie about breaking the norms and just living life your way.
I cannot more highly recommend The Good Place, it has genuinely amazing characters, interesting plot, great intellectual themes, and is also so so funny. One of my favorites!
Molly’s Game, so good!
Same Kind of Different as Me. Its on netflix, I believe. Its incredible. Or watch Mr. Church. Both are such good, heartfelt movies.
If you like asian movies I recommend Kim Ki-Dul films, especially "spring, summer, fall, winter and spring again"
I’ve been really into Korean movies lately. Mother, A Taxi Driver, Burning, Parasite, Train to Busan and The Witch were all fantastic. I think most are on Netflix or Amazon Prime.   I also really enjoyed The Guilty - which was a Danish film and The Invisible Guest which is Spanish.   I’m a huge movie watcher!
Hmm if you like anime then Hotarubi no Mori e. It's a fantasy romance movie. Not sure if there's an English dub as I watch sub.  For a live action I'll recommend the Korean movie Forgotten. I watched it on Netflix. Very interesting movie with a crazy twist I'd definitely say give it a go!
If you like horror/thrillers, I recommend The Host and Sea Fever! I watch horror movies throughout each October, and those were my two favorites this year.
Ohhh, I recommend for you to watch Another Round by Thomas Vinterberg, The Hunt also by T. Vinterberg and a fun and silly one that's very short called Kung Fury (you find that one on Youtube). I love movies a LOT! Hope to hear more from a fellow movie lover.
I am the same. I love watching movies. I am actually make a movie collection. Well i can't really help unless i know what type of shows you like. I can recommended some tv series for netflix avatar the last airbender, Lucifer, full metal alchemist brotherhood, NCIS, and the good place. These are great series to watch or binge. All of these are finish except for Lucifer. I can't help with movies unless i know what types of movies you like. Also if there is a place like a library nearby that you can checkout movies.
Hacksaw Ridge ! its about a man who refuses to pick up a gun during ww2
Escape room!
Greenland
If you like a sort of mixed method animation, our movie night last night included : Yamasong:March of the Hollows (prime video, Nathan Fillion, Whoopi, etc voiced).
if you've never watched justified, IT IS SO GOOD. i highly suggest it!!!
Not sure if you’ve seen it before or not but The Heat is one of my all time favorites. Every second of it is hilarious!
'76   Bobby sands:66 days   -2 movies about the troubles in Northern Ireland
Promising Young Women though you might have to torrent it
*Soul* is the newest Disney Pixar movie. It is amazing! It's on Disney Plus, and I highly recommend you watch it with a box of tissues!
I love watching films too! I’d highly recommend ‘Hunt for the Wilderpeople’ and ‘Captain Fantastic’. Also, if you like a bit of horror (it’s not too scary) I really enjoyed ‘The Platform’. Have you watched anything recently you’d recommend?
firefly is one of my favorite tv shows to date. and as for movies... if you like horror or gothic romance, I'd recommend crimson peak. otherwise, blues brothers
Raising Arizona, Young Frankenstein, and Something About Mary are some fun romps.
Out of Africa is visually and emotionally stirring.
I'd say to try the Bo Burnham specials that are on Netflix! Also just scrolling through my "watched" list on Netflix, some of my favorites are: Special, Feel Good, Lovesick, Love, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Social Network, American Vandal, and Sex Education
Good Omens (TV show) or The Imitation Game (movie about Alan Turing)! One is more uplifting than the other, but both are very good!
I've seen a few of those, but I will add the rest to my list! Thanks :)  Little Miss Sunshine is one of my favorites! And I quote Inigo Montoya most days of my life lol
Thank you! This one has been on my Netflix list for so long its not available anymore! I will find it somewhere :)
I'll add it to my list! Thanks :)
Into the Spiderverse is SO good!
I've been meaning to watch Spiderman since it came out! I must watch it! Thanks :)
Concur!
I did see that one when it came out on Netflix! I rewatched it too many times, but its soo good I had to lol. Crazy that its a true story. Thanks anyway :)
I shall watch both, thank you!
Thanks! I will give it a watch :)
Since you like Korean movies I just have to specifically reply to you (in case you don't read other comments) and say watch Forgotten if you haven't! I'll definitely look into the ones you said that I haven't watched so cheers for the recommendations :)
I will add those to the list! A few of them have been on my Hulu and Netlix lists for a while... I will conquer those lists this year!
I LOVE FOREST OF THE FIREFLIES. It’s so good and I don’t wanna spoil anything if anyone wants to watch it. But 😭
I've never seen an anime, so hopefully Hotarubi no Mori e is a good start! I prefer subtitles when watching foreign language films, English dubs are weird lol. Thanks for the suggestions :)
I will give them a try! I'm a scaredy cat, but I am trying to watch more horror. Thanks :)
Thank you, I will have to watch these! Movie lovers are the best people :)
Some of my students have recommended Lucifer, so that's been on the to-do list for a while. And I know Avatar is supposed to be really good, are there many seasons?  I enjoy drama, comedies, action, thrillers, and I am going to start watching more horror this year. I also love animated movies. Occasionally a good rom-com too.
Oh yes! I must add this. Thanks :)
It really is!
Its really good but im biased cause it has my favorite comedian in it lol
I recently watched it for the first time, it definitely is worth the rewatches!! haha. Do you believe that player x was based on Tobey Maguire?👀
Oh I haven’t seen that one! I’ll add it to my list, thanks!
I’ve found Korean movies almost always have a delicious twist that I really enjoy! Actually, all of the movies I listed are pretty twisty!
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN!!! 😭
Yep 100% agree with you there. The English dub voices usually bother me and if it's live action then it also bothers me how the mouth doesn't align with what's being spoken haha
Sure thing! Out of the two, I’d say The Host is the less traditionally “scary” one. It’s more of a monster movie! It has some comedy/silliness mixed in, and a theme of family. AND it’s directed by Bong Joon-ho, who I adore.
now that many only 3 seasons of avatar but there is sequel series called legend of korra.  Spider-Man into the spider verse is a good action, animated, comedy and it is on netflix. You also can't go wrong with the how to train your dragon trilogy and it has a good tv series on netflix. The Lego movies are also good they are so childish that is great for everyone. One of my favorite animated movies is Iron Giant that i would recommend to anyone. Also knives out is an amazing mystery movie.
OMG John Mulaney is in it???? I would have seen it already if I knew that. Damn I am missing out.  Is that who you are talking about? lol I see Donald Glover is also in it :)
I had to pause the movie right away to find out who that was and ugh, I KNEW he was a weirdo! lol I want to read her book someday too.
Exactly! Also, even though I can't understand the Mandarin or French or whatever, you can hear their excitement or intensity when they are speaking.
Thanks! I will have to check all of those out :)
Yeah he plays spiderpig and it’s beautiful!
Yeah the emotions are usually more genuine in the original language!
Also try Vudu they have a lot of movies and tv series with ads but they are from everywhere. The movies have good ones but also bad ones. The tv series are good. it also has some complete series like Rosanne and 3rd rock. Also when you buy a movie say like a blu-ray of spiderman it comes with a digital copy. you make an account an put it into your library then you can watch it anywhere you go. Also if you have one that can connect to moviesanywhere it can send it to any type of device. Like it can send the purchase movie to both your itunes and youtube for free.

Happy 21st to your Daughter 🥳
YASSSSSSS I’M GOING TO BINGE WATCH THIS SHOW THANKS TO Y’ALL   Long weekend, here I come!!!! As a whole attorney 🧡😃  These cakes are lit. I love as skeptical but Duncan Hines is legit
Thanks! I’ll pass it along. She’s out doing “legit” grownup things such as waiting for a tow truck because her friends car got stuck 😂
Hopefully I’ll be in a gifting spot when it’s time for the next season, then I can be responsible for 3! 😂 Congrats Madame Attorney!
Nothing like doing Adult things when you turn 21 to seal the deal! Hopefully her friends car is okay and they get home safe.
Keeping me up to date on my trashy period drama!!! And I’m definitely waiting to start on the rest of the recommendations from the last time!! I’m going to be so cozy with my tea (which tastes lovely by the way!) and my show. Plus since I don’t have the tv in an actual spot, I can watch it IN THE BATHTUB 🛁 real bougie lifestyle   DUDE BEING AN ATTORNEY ROCKS
Bathtub reading reminds me of something. When I was around 18 a book came out that was waterproof. It was called Aqua Erotica. I will not lie, I bought one as a gift because it felt amazing to touch and I needed for someone to enjoy a book like that. Catered to women, erotica and bath time. I really wish more books had this option because it was really cool.
That’s a lot to unpack but I’m so exhausted from today all my brain is doing is yelling “WATERPROOF BOOK?? HOW NEAT!!”
Yea, waterproof erotica novel. Super neat. I just want normal books to be like that.
I’ve only had a waterproof field notebook. But that would be cool. I’m sure they have waterproof ereaders now but that’s not quite the same.

I don’t know why it shows a bear/- it’s a book. 🧐

u/tmrajgray Thank you for my new stapler! Now I just have to get back into my classroom to put it to good use 😅
Hello, fellow teacher. Staplers are so important.
That looks like an amazing stapler, wow!
hello fellow teacher! :D these staplers are the best lol  are you teaching online or in person currently?
Have you seen my stapler?
I see you are a teacher and would like to send something to help with your classes. I’m not able to click your wishlist, though, and the full link doesn’t show up on mobile.   Can you comment or pm your link?  Also, thank you for helping shape minds!
Right?! The one I had did not open to staple on cork board so I kept borrowing the support teacher’s stapler... and she kept wanting it back 😅
Hi! I was teaching in person until Christmas break and now we’re back online, for now until mid February. What about you?
I put it back on your desk before break I swear!
Awe you’re so sweet! You absolutely don’t have to but here is my [classroom wishlist](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/2ZZKB7LW9K651?ref_=wl_share) 😊
Lol, totally get it. Some teachers borrow things and never return it.
wow that's crazy! hope the online program you use wont be too much of a pain. ive been lucky to be in person all year, but I have to live stream my classes all day to the students who have chosen to stay home while also teaching those who are there in person. it's hectic, but, for me, better than all online like we had last march.
I always ended up returning it but her classroom was on the third floor so it always took a while because I didn’t want to climb all the way up there 😁
I hate doing online with all of my beings. I teach Kindergarten through Teams and it’s absolutely the worst... doing hybrid like you do sounds like hell too though 😅
Loll. At least you returned it

u/HauntedCoffeeCup something useful arriving Monday :)  I absolutely love your wishlists. So many great items to build off of!
Awww, you’re sweet as a peach. Thank you so much. Yes, I know my wishlists are fricken ridiculous, but my kids and family are so wishy washy about their lists and it gives me hell when it’s time to gift them what they really like, so I’ve made mine super fat as an example 😂

How many cake puns do you knead? For goodness cake, I hope I can come up with a few. I'm guessing about a leaven should do, but I'm not sure I can rise to the occasion, so instead, [here's a song from my favorite bands - Cake!](https://youtu.be/Zip4QyJyD5g)
"Here dad, try my sponge cake!"  *dad takes a bite, gags, coughs, and politely spits it out in a napkin.*  "Your cake is a bit rough, dear. "  "That's weird, I used a fresh sponge!"
Happy cake day! The best cake I've ever made is a recipe on Allrecipes for [Sam's Favorite Carrot Cake](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8270/sams-famous-carrot-cake/?internalSource=hub%20recipe&referringContentType=Search).  Seriously,  so good abd really really easy to make gluten free and/or dairy free.  I like my carrot cake with all the goodies in it so this fits the bill well.
Magnolia cupcakes are the best!!
Not entering but happy cake day!
My favorite cake is chocolate cake with chocolate icing and strawberries. Mmmm my birthday is in a few weeks and I plan on eating that cake for my birthday lol
Happy Cake Day!  [There's an episode of King of Queens where they forget to make a cake for a church fundraiser "cake walk", the participants have to walk around and when the music stops they win the cake they're in front of...so they just put frosting on a couch pillow and make sure Doug will be the one to "win" it so no one will find out, but then...at the cake walk... there's a cake that is a volcano... a caramel lava erupting volcano cake... and he gets so distracted....someone else wins the frosted pillow...lol :D ](https://youtu.be/8LoVcguUzLo)  (I watch too much tv)
Happy cake day!!  I made this [Llama cake](https://imgur.com/a/5fXcD6s) for my daughter's birthday a few months ago. I had a lot of fun figuring out how to frost the thing.  Thanks for the contest!

Happy Cake Day!

Now I tell him it is because he loves to make it for me :-)  and it is quite tasty!
Happy cake day!  Cheesecake.   Just classic rich NY cheesecake filling on extra thick crust. With homemade strawberry topping. My all-time favorite.  I've got health issues and the doctor put me on a diet, so I haven't had it in a while, but I'm patiently waiting for my actual cake day to bake one again lol
okay and you have been bear-hugged because I want to
Where I live there is a place called Jerry Frank's Konditorei and it's all cake all the time. Never thought much of it as it was a small building old fashioned just a few employees. Tried a champagne cake it was sooo delicate it was amazing the business flourished and still the best cakes of my life.  https://images.app.goo.gl/UxDmk2EFT3N8FjN58
[These](http://imgur.com/a/SgA5i56) are some of the first cakes/cupcakes I made as part of a cake making and decorating course I did! The rabbit ones are carrot cake cupcakes and the very chocolatey looking cake was a chocolate orange cake (who would've guessed). They're very fun to make :)  I was very proud of the rabbit with the bum sticking up like it was digging in the cupcake. I thought it looked cute as heck 😂
Happy cake day!!!  So, if you have Instagram look up Shyndigzdessert because Oh. My. God. It's the best cake I've ever had and they deliver to my house 😍  I like the fresh berry cake, which is vanilla with vanilla buttercream frosting and fresh fruit between the layers. Ah five of them. Did I mention I can have slices of five layer cake delivered to my house??? It's a problem 😂 My husband prefers the spotted cow cake, which is chocolate with cream cheese icing.  They have a cake of the day each day, and a cake calendar! Seriously, look them up. They have such beautiful cakes 🎂💖🥰
One of my favourite cakes is when my friends made me an ice cream cake! It was rock hard and covered in sprinkles. It ended up being more of a joke cake but the thought was what counted. The fact that my friends made me an ice cream cake warmed my heart!
Thank you for hosting the contest and happy cake day!   Have you heard of the pizza cake? Would you rather have pizza cake or Chicago deep dish? Both are pretty huge lol
Happy Cake Day!   The craziest cake I've ever had, in terms of size, was at Claim Jumper's restaurant in CA many moons ago. It fed 3 or 4 of us if I recall. This isn't my photo but this is ONE slice of their chocolate [cake](https://www.goldennugget.com/contentassets/de8a8243b65e4a3da8febd3e49827f3e/chocolate-cake-995x525.jpg) . It was very, very chocolatey.   I took cake decorating classes as a kid. I was so-so at it. I remember shoving a Barbie doll into a cake and making wavey frosting lines for a skirt. I can't letter. My work would become memes for all to laugh at.
Not entering :)  just want to place 🎂 🎂 🎂 and 🌹 🌹 💐 💐 here  ❤️ happy cake day
Happy cake day!  I made this delicious chocolate cake for my daughter's birthday from scratch. I also made a mint whipped topping for the middle and a yummy chocolate ganache frosting. I forgot to take a picture of the final product because we were too excited to eat it.  😂  http://imgur.com/a/v9jnAGR
The best cake I ever had was rum cake when I was four and at a wedding. Now this wasn’t just any rum cake. This was rum cake baked with rum and then saturated in it after it came out of the oven. EVERYONE that tried it got tipsy off this cake. My aunt was a closet alcoholic and got hammered between that and the open bar and was giving me allllllllllllll the cake I wanted because no one realized they were getting drunk off the cake. My parents figured it out when I was on my fourth piece and had to fight to take it away from me. I was NOT a happy camper!!
The best cake I've ever had would have to be a Tres Leche cake from a Mexican bakery here in Tucson. Especially considering I'm not much of a cake fan, this one was AMAZING. I'd probably be 30 pounds heavier if I lived closer to that bakery, I swear. (Okay, technically it was a Food City, but that one in particular had the best Tres Leche cake I've ever had.)  What's really fun is cake pops. I keep meaning to make some, and then I forget to buy everything I need for them and end up eating the components that I *do* have, and the process starts all over again.  I also love seeing people make the super elaborate cakes on YouTube and stuff. The process is so much fun to watch!  Happy cake day!
Happy Cake Day! My favorite cake is choco chip!  Here's a long ass joke I recently found out:  A Catholic priest, a Buddhist monk, and an atheist walk into a restaurant.  After they put in their orders, the three strike up a conversation about what they believe awaits them in the afterlife.  The priest says, "I try to live my life according to God's word, so that I may go to the good Lord in heaven and live in paradise for all of eternity. I do not curse, I forgive freely, and I pray continually However, I know I am a sinner at heart, and I deserve to burn in hell like the rest of us."  The atheist replies, "Don't worry, that's probably bullshit. There is nothing waiting for us after death, only the void and nothingness. That's why I try to live my life to the fullest."  The two of them ask the monk, who had been silent up to that point, what he believed. The monk started, "Well, I certainly won't be seeing the afterlife anytime soon. I have lived a bad life, however, I am trying to earn enough good karma to reincarnate into a better life. If I earn enough good karma, then maybe I can eventually go to the afterlife."  "Well how are you supposed to do that?" asked the atheist.  Just then, the group is interrupted by the waitress with their meals. For the priest, there is a meal of bread and wine. For the atheist, a hearty plate of ribs sits in front of him. For the monk, there is nothing but a slice of cake on his plate.  In response to two puzzled looks, the monk quickly says, "There's no easier way to earn karma than to have a cake day."
Happy first cake day SmallGingerLady!   I like big bundts and I cannot lie! 🎶 Have you ever bought a cake from Nothing Bundt Cakes? I’m sure you haven’t because you are a magical baking goddess but because I am a mere mortal I have and they are divine! They have mini bundts and they are so cute and FLAVORFUL! I love them all but I really love the Lemon flake red one.   I drew you a ~~butt cake~~ oops I mean [bundt cake!](https://imgur.com/a/5zmxiaX)  Thanks for the contest! I hope you had a fabulous day.
Happy cake day!!   I'm México there is a tradition called "Rosca de Reyes" It's a kind of cake what is only eaten in january due a catholic celebration.   When making the cake, one or more small plastic dolls are introduced. These doll represent "Baby Jesus". The person whose slice touches the doll must make a meal for the other people, but not just any food, it has to be a very complicated dish to make called tamales. Unfortunately some people have drowned with the doll, and this year there was controversy because some people sent to print small Baby Yoda in 3d to replace the traditional doll. Many people were offended and in the end banned its sale in some places.
Happy cake day🎆🎈🎇🍰🎉🎊🧁🎁🎂🥳🍨🍾 best cake is the marble chocolate pound cake I made with my son when I was homeschooling him and we did it for home economics   /u/external-nobody8500 and /u/bratmomjad and /u/ssmith71608
Happy cake day!  I love the simplicity of the cake for our wedding that we had in October. We saved a lot of money by just going to our grocer and getting a big sheet cake instead of a fancy cake or cupcakes. In the end everyone loved it.
This is one of my favorite cakes by [Maggie Austin](https://i.imgur.com/eDwEGoI.jpg). She's a magician with cake!
Happy cake day!!!!   The best cake in my opinion is Ice Cream Cake. For my birthday, I always ask for an ice cream cake instead of a normal cake. Sometimes, I just go out and get a mini one and indulge alone!! lol!
I am having my daughters cake tonight for her birthday :) here’s a first pass at it - she said she was doing a couple more things then bringing it over :)   https://imgur.com/a/LQIuI8X
Happy first cake day! One of my favorite cakes I ever made was [this coffee cheesecake](https://chrisdoka.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/wp-1474054253738.jpg?w=1440). It was SO good: creamy, decadent, and tasty. Thanks for the contest :D
Happy cake day!!! 🎂  I love cake, but my favorite so far has been this green tea chiffon cake! It's so light and fluffy! I really loved its fruit toppings and whipped cream as I'm not a huge fan of icing 😅 and the green tea was sooooo good, not bitter at all and not overwhelmingly sweet! 🤤
Happy cake day! A cake that brings me good memories is [this slight nsfw cake](https://imgur.com/a/xWuGRyW). Shared between two friends between their common love of.. well.. you’ll see. One of them unfortunately passed away to suicide, so we have the photo we took of the cake on the wall to make us laugh.
I love ice cream cake and nobody ever remembers. They think it's chocolate (which is good, but it's not ice cream). I have to remind them every time and can't remember getting one after 13 years old or so.    At least the store has ready to eat ice cream cake. And there is always Dairy Queen.   Hope you get a piece of your favorite cake on your cake day!
My favorite cake isn’t really a cake at all, but a strawberry and Nutella pavlova- so good!  Happy cake day!
Okay, so my favorite cake is what I refer to as THE cake with THE icing. Those around me learned real quick what that meant. SO - funfetti cake with rainbow chip icing. It’s a celebration!! Other than THE cake with THE icing, I also love cheesecake!!!! HAPPY CAKE DAY!!!!! Thanks for the contest!
A few years ago I made my husband a chocolate and peanut butter Reese cup cake. Seriously, it was the most amazing cake I’ve ever had.   Happy cake day!!
My favorite is [carrot cake](https://www.google.com/search?q=layered+carrot+cake&safe=strict&client=safari&hl=en-us&prmd=sivn&sxsrf=ALeKk02QY7R7KiOmx9kKPVUV9r-KEPqOUw:1610737592232&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjShouQ0Z7uAhVVJjQIHRetBUoQ_AUoAnoECAQQAg&biw=414&bih=703) with cream cheese frosting. Delicious and so pretty, thanks for the contest!
Happy cake day!  My favorite cake is German chocolate 😋🥰  A fun cake story: my mom’s fav is red velvet and got very upset the day I told her it was just chocolate flavored and insists its flavor is “red” 😂  Thanks for the contest!
Happy cake day!   One of my favorite cakes is coconut cake. Look at this [beauty! ](https://imgur.com/a/v5xzfes)
Happy Cake Day!! 🍰   [the best cake ever ](https://imgur.com/gallery/83gvTs2)
yay for cake day, here is a cake joke! 🌸  why didn’t the cake make it on time to the party?  it was choco-LATE 😹🎂
I messed up a cake recently. I don't know what the hell I did to it, but it dried up SUPER fast and did not taste good at all. I even added an extra egg to make it more moist, so I truly don't know what happened.
Happy first cake day! 🍰   My favorite cake is chocolate mousse! It is like heaven on earth.  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
I love cake but the last time I made it I ruined it :P I guess I beat it too hard and after it cooled down it completely hardened. I make great cake-mix cakes though. Charlotte cake looks so delicious but I've never tried it! Some day though :)
Happy cake day! 🎂  Pineapple upside down cake is an extremely underrated cake.   When trying new cake recipes, don’t be afraid to take whisks!
Has to be the chocolate marble pound cake with my son when homeschooling for home ec
Funny enough my actual IRL cake day is tomorrow and I'm having homemade cinnamon rolls with homemade Cinnabon icing! I'm not a cake fan nor a frosting fan. But a pan full of cinnamon rolls using my great grandmother's recipe? Yes please!!  Happy cake day!!
Happy cake day!  This is the last [cake](https://imgur.com/a/kNz2ZEy) I baked! It was really good. My boyfriend's mom said it was the first time someone had ever baked her a cake for her birthday. Major points :D
CAKE!!!!! I like to make spice cake from scratch. It's warm spices and delicate sweetness is amazing. No frosting needed but I do love frosting as well. I tend to make a homemade buttercream.
Uhhh my favorite cake would be the [Sacher](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/702882309619056683/799722398387404900/image0.jpg) torte which is an Austrian chocolate type of cake filled with apricot jam and covered in chocolate ganache 😋✨ ... muffin compares to it 💥🙈
Happy Cake Day!! Thanks for the contest! You have brought back some good memories!  I’m going to show you a pun and tell you about my wedding cake.  Pun: [Wedding Cake](https://www.letseatcake.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Cake-Puns-Tiers.jpg)   Story: A little embarrassed to admit the ending but here goes. 🤪 Our wedding cake was the best I have ever tasted. Three layers in a slice, some slices vanilla and some chocolate.  The frosting was a decadently smooth buttercream.  The lusciousness was in between the layers. A big layer of cannoli filling and a big layer of raspberry in each slice. Tasted heavenly! When we arrived home we noticed we were given the top two layers ... we were thrilled and placed it in our freezer! We ate one of the layers when we arrived home from a short honeymoon (I had just started a new job which cut short our honeymoon).  It was beyond amazing! As tradition, we froze the rest and ate some after year one, and reluctantly stating, year two too!  It tasted like the night of the wedding, just colder.   We are celebrating our 23rd anniversary this April. Kid you not, I still have a small piece of our wedding cake in our freezer!! We did not eat any after that second year, but sentimental me could not throw away the last piece (no mold, always frozen). It is in shambles but when I pull the ziploc out of the small box it is in every year on our anniversary it brings back such good memories. We also get a good chuckle that it has been in there that long.  Kind of disgusting, but a loving memory at the same time. 🤪😃🎂🤣
happy cake day!! Here's a pretty [heart cake](https://www.instagram.com/p/CE3qm5Tg2rS/) I saw! I really like to eat victoria sponge cake or red velvet cake!
Why do we put candles on top of a birthday cake? Because it's too hard to put them on the bottom!
This might be the prettiest cake I’ve made: https://imgur.com/a/GoBoHU7
Happy cake day!!! I love cakes. I used to be in 4H, and I went to the semifinals for cake decoration judging :)
I find baking to be more challenging than cooking since I dislike having to measure stuff.  I find decorating a cupcake or cake to be super intimidating because it really takes talent to make it look better than something a 5 year old did.  When my kiddos were born I decided that I wanted to get over this intimidation and make their birthday cakes, so I’ve been doing that.  This is the one I’m most proud of despite it being pretty simple because it was the first time I used fondant.  https://imgur.com/a/PaJ1eUa
[this](https://imgur.com/a/RyPZbJx)  count? Because it was ahhhhhmazing 🤤  Happy cake day, smallgingerlady!
The best cake I have ever eaten was actually my wedding cake. Bottom tier was Boston cream, middle tier was chocolate, and top tier was cherry. Each cake was great but that cherry cake was absolutely the best cake I have ever had. I actually think about it sometimes lol and contemplate getting a small cherry cake from the same place lol   Happy Cake Day
Happy cake day! 🍰  Here's a collection of my [bakes from 2016 to today](https://imgur.com/a/gMxhRcg). I am in no means a professional but I find baking so therapeutic! Until I have to decorate, I'm not great at that but it's a work in progress 😅
Happy Cake Day! I'm hoping to bake a heart shaped chocolate cake with pink strawberry frosting for Valentine's Day! I never made a shaped cake before. 🎂
I make [these blueberry and pumpkin cassava cakes ](http://imgur.com/a/OcWvQfG) for my husband every week since it's the only sweets he can really eat. Plus they are super yummy! It's my own carefully crafted recipe, so I'm very proud of them.  Happy cake day!
Happy Cake Day!  My favorite cake is red velvet, and ice cream cakes!  Pretty much all kinds.  I really love ice cream.  :)
Happy cake day!  My absolute favorite cake is from our local grocery store. It's white sheet cake that is suuuuuper moist and then they put a raspberry filling between the layers, and then top with the most delicious vanilla buttercream. ::drool::  Thank you for the contest!
Happy cake day!!  I made [this cake](https://imgur.com/a/c9i7PVB/) for Christmas! It’s naturally purple from purple yam (ube). It has a leche flan filling too!
Happy cake day! I think the best cakes are homemade. With that said I really love any cake. Me and my mom are the cake lovers in the family. If someone is coming over we bake a cake. If someone leaves we have cake to make us feel better. The family teases us about it. We love cake. So I hope you get a piece of cake for your cake day! 🎂
Here’s the [cake](https://imgur.com/a/wcbqrlO) my daughter made me for my last birthday (she’s 13)
You butter believe I’m about to make a joke about cake. Thank you, thank you...I’ll see myself out.    Happy cake day!
HAPPY CAKEEEE DAY!!!!!!!! 🎂  i made [this chocolate orange rum cake](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/88qupq/i_finally_finished_my_moms_chocolate_orange_rum/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) for my mom’s bday and then i also made [this Dunkin’ donuts coffee cupcake ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/89p6w9/my_dunkin_coffee_cupcake/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from when i was preparing for a cupcake showdown against my sister ahahahaha.
Happy cake day!!!!  My husband is not a baker - heck, he is barely a cook! But this year for my birthday, he looked up a recipe for a white chocolate cake with buttercream frosting. He spent ALL day making the cake for me. He did such a wonderful job and it was absolutely delicious. So much love went into that cake.    [https://imgur.com/P35ABXh](https://imgur.com/P35ABXh)
Fun!!!  Cake puns bake me smile. They bake my day.
My absolute favourite cake is vanilla cake with vanilla icing. Yup. That super cheap grocery store birthday cake. I LOVE IT.
Whisking you a happy cake day! 🎂   What did the cake say to start the fight with the fork?...  You want a piece of me?  One of my favourite cakes is a yummy [lemon drizzle cake](https://images.app.goo.gl/a1nsP16M3vmhNoSr6) 🍋  This is the [baking ](https://share.icloud.com/photos/0zYepCkwNXpXYsOpmoc0cZiCg) I do every year for my folks around Christmas 🎄. Unfortunately 2020 put a stop to my tradition but hoping this year I can make up for it :)   Thank you for the contest <3
I just ate cake for pudding. Literally.  Then I went back and ate more. Oops. Still a bit more left for when the kids are in bed too.   Always cake Friday in my house.
Happy cake day!   All I can think of is tiramisu. It’s so far and away my favorite type of cake that I’ll barely eat any other cakes. This is strange but nobu sushi had one of the best I’ve ever tried and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to afford to go back lol
Happy Cake Day!
Happy cake day!  I had this cake recently for my sisters birthday and it is super good. It's light and fluffy and not super sweet. I really like this bakery franchise.   http://imgur.com/a/Msfq1gF
Happy cake day!  The best cake I've had is a homemade one I helped my grandma make for my mom. It's a yellow cake with chocolate frosting and it's the perfect amount of fluffiness.
[Opera cake](https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&ccid=dgkAs7qy&id=C089EC7F17C9885184D2A12B26F955ADE54BA343&thid=OIP.dgkAs7qyHhSweycG0M04ZQHaEK&mediaurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fd8NimVk8VIg%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&exph=720&expw=1280&q=opera+cake&simid=608043678918510360&ck=16482FEF04B1F6939BDD474D1F65D331&selectedindex=13&form=EX0023&adlt=demote&shtp=GetUrl&shid=00a4bd06-f189-4a6e-8f46-a12c60a2b079&shtk=T3BlcmEgQ2FrZSB8IFJlY2lwZSB8IE9wZXJhIGNha2UsIERlc3NlcnRzLCBDYWtlIHJlY2lwZXM%3D&shdk=Rm91bmQgb24gQmluZyBmcm9tIHd3dy5waW50ZXJlc3QuY29t&shhk=F2euHZ5uHTVLM6jZOiooWLzIrUSHaApYOBeKZ4kKKUA%3D&shth=OSH.H6abYd%252BpyQqs8QnHIIlI1A).  Thanks for hosting a contest. r/cakeday!
Happy cake day! My favorite cake is a Norwegian kind called Kvæfjordkake. I recommend looking up a recipe. It’s also nicknamed “the world’s best”. Not the world’s best cake, just the world’s best. So there ya go.
Happy Happy Cake Day!! I hope that it's as wonderful as you are for offering someone else a gift on your day!  My favorite cake to bake is just a plain chocolate cake with chocolate icing all from scratch. When my stepson moved in with us, he insisted that he hated cake... Until I made this cake for his brother's cake day. I coaxed him into trying a piece and he has amended his opinion to, "I hate all cake, except yours." This kid melts my heart without even trying and I couldn't love him any more than I do.
One time I had my own made-up cake day. I went to spend time with my family shortly after I started my freshman year at the university. Lo and behold there was a fish cake present!  My aunt saw this fish cake in a magazine or something and wanted an excuse to make it, so she made a “yay jen’s starting college” cake. Maybe I can find a pic of it.
Happy cake day!   Don't have anything special to show but for each of my kids 1st birthdays I made their cakes. Nothing special, just out of the box with icing but it's something I felt was special for them. For my son's 7th birthday he actually asked me to make him a cake, I asked him what kind, and be got a pineapple upside down cake, didn't look the best, but he said he loved it.
Happy first cake day!  This is my favorite cake I've ever made!  [pool cake](https://imgur.com/gallery/OiO1kXM) I had soooo much fun decorating it with my momma! The pool itself is blue jello, but it didn't last long in the Florida heat.
Have a caketastic day!!!
Happy cake day!!  I'm pretty sure the best cake I had was at centre parcs! It's a great vacation resort. It was a chocolate cake with whipped cream but it tasted amazing!
Happy cake day!!  The best cake ive ever eaten was a cake with cream an peaches \^-\^
Happy cake day!! Today I had an interesting conundrum related to cake! I use an Alexa to keep track of my grocery list, so I tell her verbally and then can see the list when I get to the store. Sometimes, alexa mishears things. Today I ran out to pick up a few things, and found one of the items on the list was “happy cake”. Now, what in the world did I mean by happy cake? My birthday’s in a week, but I wouldn’t add a cake to the list normally, or so I thought. I thought maybe it was a medication, and wandered through the pharmacy area, trying to figure it out.   I came up with nothing there, and kept repeating “happy cake? Happy cake?” To myself, trying to figure out what it was. Nothing in the food aisle rung any bells. Finally, I was just about to check out when I figured it out. Happy cake = packing tape! I had used up all my packing tape around Christmas time! So that’s the tale of the happy cake, I hope you enjoyed 😅  Thanks for hosting, have a wonderful day!
Happy cake day!!  I've had a tiramisu cake that was the absolute best!
Happy cake daaaaay! My fav cake is lemon-lavender! OOoo or actually, ice cream cake! (I think it's a tie - haha).
Happy cake day!  What did the cake say to the fork? >!Do you want a piece of me?! !<
Happy cake day! The best cake I have ever had was a dark chocolate raspberry tiramisu. It was so rich you could only eat a few bites.
Happy cake day!   Something cake related eh? First thing that came to mind was the following recommendation. To celebrate, I suggest going to Coldstone (assuming you have one around) and try cake batter mixed with caramel. It’s to die for imo
Happy Cake Day, woo hoo! 🎉💕  [These baked goods](https://imgur.com/a/mCwjJQp) were NOT baked by me (I wish I was that talented!) but these were from my daughter’s ’little pumpkin’ 1st birthday in October! The baker that made the cake and cookies is so incredibly talented! And looking at these pictures make me so happy because even though it was a very small birthday party because of COVID, it was still lovely and spent with the best people.  Cheers to first years and first cake days! 😀
Happy cake day!   &#x200B;  So the best cake I had ever had was a beautiful Tres Leches at this fancy restaurant I went to. It was the first time I had ever tried Tres Leches, it's so creamy and light! They even had all of these crushed pistachios on top.....yum!
Happy Cake day to you!!! I love a good cupcake and can also bake! I usually always am the cake baker for any family events, holidays, birthdays etc. my favorite to make is a chocolate cake with vanilla mascarpone frosting. Omgggg!! 🤤  Enjoy your day!
Happy cake day. Hello there!    My absolute favorite cake is chocolate mousse cake. It's decadent chocolate mousse with a dark chocolate cake and whipped cream. It's got alot of different versions but the best I've ever eaten is at vilagios in pelham ny. I go there for my birthday if I'm visiting relatives.
Oh wow, what an occasion. Happy Cake Day! I was so surprised when I had mine because I totally forgot at what time I signed up here.  On cake related things, my sisters birthday cake last summer was the first cake I made from scratch including creating my own recipe and it was a hit so it will now become a classic in regards to family birthdays. I am forever grateful for having written down how I made it!
Happy cake day! I couldn't have found a batter way to celebrate! ;)
Mmmmmmmm cake.  My favorite cake is Black Forest cake. It’s fantastic. Tasty. Happy cake day.
Happy Cake day :)  The world went into lockdown and I was stuck in a remote village in Bolivia for 7 months. The family that took me in had a huge farm that had produced lots of pumpkins. We got sick of soup so I looked up some recipes and came across a pretty neat vegan pumpkin brownie that could be made with the limited ingredients we had in the village and used lots of pumpkin! Through lockdown my brownie was selling in the market and my housemates (I moved to a shared house/hostel) were randomly buying large pumpkins and leaving them in the kitchen for me to find :p  Strange because Bolivian cuisine doesn't use pumpkin much but that's how I'll always remember that country :)  I'd would've loved to bake you one for your birthday :)
Happy cake day!  I'm a professional baker so allow me to give you all one of my best/favorite recipes that always gets praise: [Sacher Torte](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NhOQGSESsfTTLMVf1aXICFRaDyY0PHzEuzd8qDF9Trs/edit?usp=sharing)  This is a google docs link, if it doesn't work let me know. It's based on weights so use a scale for utmost accuracy! And if you don't like, can't find or can't have apricot jam, feel free to replace it with what you like. I usually make a pomegranate jelly to put on instead.
Red Velvet is the BEST CAKE. Fight me on it.
Happy cake day friend!! Love it!!  Omg. So the best cake I’ve ever had. I still remember it, lol. It was SO amazing. It was at my best friends 2nd bridal shower. I threw her one and invited whoever she wanted, but one of her grandmas wanted to throw her one too. So this was at that shower. So her grandma got this beautiful, big, sheet cake. But it was a fancy sheet cake. I think they said it was from Cost-Co? But honestly, I’m not totally sure, and there’s not one within an hour of me anyways, lol. I just remembered that cake was SO dang good. It was vanilla/ white cake, super moist, with buttercream icing. But like, the best dang buttercream I’ve ever tasted. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD. My bff hooked my up thankfully, lol, and got me a couple pieces I could take home. Cuz I like, could not stop talking about this darn cake! My mind was definitely blown, and it was still just as epic if not better eating it at home days later, cold out of the fridge, lol. I miss that cake often!! ;)  Haha, thanks for hosting! I hope it’s been a great day!
Happy cake day!! I love baking and decorating cakes, but I’m not great at it. I would practice more, but it’s hard to find the time (and the money. It’s an expensive hobby!). I hope you’re having an excellent cake day and are celebrating with some cake!
the best cakes are always the fruity ones! I love strawberries!
You know, I've seen a lot of good contests, but this one really takes the cake.  Also Tirimusu and Carrot Cake are the bomb. Can't choose a favorite, they're too good.  Happy Cake Day!
Happy cake day!  My favorite cake is homemade confetti cake with sprinkles. Nothing better than that with some ice cream! Yum!  Thanks for the contest!
Happy cake day!!  [My best cake ever!](https://www.imgur.com/a/4CanGnn) I made it for my friend's birthday after taking up baking during early covid days.
The best cake I have ever eaten was this brandy cake from a hole in the wall the Baltimore.
Happy cake day! It was my little brother's birthday two days ago so I've been eating the leftover cake. Sadly I'm pretty sure there wasn't any left in the fridge when I woke up and got a drink. Now I'm tempted to go have a look and see if I can have one last piece of that cake. It was a marbled mud cake.  Edit: there were two pieces left. They were moved into a container to make space. So I'm eating one now and left the other for the birthday boy.
[This cake ](https://www.delish.com/food/a43842/hulk-princess-birthday-cake/)looks amazing!!! I didn’t bake it, but it looks a bit beyond my microwaving skills. 😂 Happy cake day! ❤️
Cake related story: I was 6 years old and happily eating cake at my friend's birthday party. All of a sudden this girl comes up and steals my plate of cake! 😂 She just took it away and when I went back to get it, everyone thought I was trying to steal her cake. Smh.... I now guard my pieces of cake.  u/Zeunicorn come tell me about cake
Happy cake day! I've made quitea few cakes in my day and this is one of my favorites. [cake](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKF9s7kBnez/?igshid=1486o6mb5zljf)  My mom is also making me a vegan chocolate cake for my birthday, I hope its good! (I'm not vegan)
Happy cake day. My favorite cake is Carrot Cake with real cream cheese frosting or a legit black forest cake.  Because we are all adults here... ill leave this joke i found... (its disgusting, but Im immature so I laughed...)  One day a little girl was watching cartoons when a porno came through. The little girl asked her mom "What are they doing?" The girls mom said "baking a cake."   Then the next day they were walking in the park and there were these people making out And the girl said "Look mommy they are baking a cake!"   The next day the girl says "Mommy you and Daddy were baking a cake last night." Her mom replied "how did you know?"  The girl said "because I licked the icing off the sofa!"
My fav cake is [German chocolate cake](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/german-chocolate-cake/) we used to have it at every birthday with my dad!  Happy cake day!!
My favourite cakey cake (since cheesecake doesn't count for some) is a chocolate one with cream cheese frosting! Making puns aren't exactly a cakewalk for me so I'll pass on those haha  Happy Reddit Birthday :)
One year my friend made me a lemon cherry cake and it was the greatest cake I've ever eaten.  Why did the cake visit the psychologist? It was feeling crumby.
Hmmm, my favorite cake... I honestly don’t know! I love so many but my current go to is this [better than anything cake](https://www.iheartnaptime.net/better-than-anything-cake/)! It is soo good! I highly recommend giving it a try if your a fan of its ingredients! I usually substitute brewed coffee for the water content though!   I made this [Neoplaton cake ](https://imgur.com/a/gLnmkla)and it was so good, even though the strawberry layer was a little funky! Flavor wise it was awesome though. Most recently I made a really pretty apple pie but I have no good pictures 😞
[Black forest cake! ](http://imgur.com/gallery/A3GMKnA) I made this for my 40th birthday
Not entering.  Happy cake day!  I hope your year here as been fabulous.  &#x200B;  Here are my sons helping me [bake a cake](http://www.debstone.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20.jpg) many moons ago.
My friend’s kid just had their 4th birthday party; the cake was banana cream!
Happy cake day!! Oh man, the best cake I’ve ever had was my wedding cake. It was all proper expensive and professional. Lemon, too. Mmmmmmmmmmmm. TFTC.
I like German chocolate cake, coconut cake, chocolate birthday cake with buttercream frosting, and white cake with chocolate frosting. I love tiramisu, that counts as a cake right? I've never tried tres leches cake but that's what I'm having for my birthday because it looks so good with all the fruits. Happy cake day!
Happy belated cake day!   My favorite cake is a classic cheesecake, berry on top optional. I know I'm a heathen, but I rarely have a sweet tooth.
The best cake I’ve ever eaten.........wild. Hard to say but I LOVE the sachertorte in Vienna and I love the original at the hotel  Happy cake day!
I make a cake that has mandarin orange in the batter, and crushed pineapple in the frosting. It is SO good. Uve been wanting to augment it a little and instead if having a white cake batter doing luke a banana or carrot cake batter before adding the oranges. Make it closer to like a hummingbird cake (which ive only heard of)   Ty💚
My favourite cake is one that we sell at work!  It is a 3 layer Oreo cake, with chocolate icing and cookie crumbs all over it! It is so good! I've really missed it since work has been closed because of lockdown.
I love cake! Are you familiar with Tomato Soup Cake? It's delicious!  Happy Cake Day!
Happy cake day!! My favorite cake is literally anything with nuts! I work as a pastry chef so i get to see lots and lots of cakes everyday! Speaking of which if you look on my profile you can see one of the cakes I’ve recently made, I’m honestly kinda proud since that was my first custom fondant cake! If you want „cake advice“ feel free to ask :)
Happy belated cake day !!!!!!!!!! 🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂  I just recently learned some tricks on how to make boxed cake taste better that I thought I'd share!!!!  Use melted butter instead of oil.   Use milk instead of water.   ADD AN EXTRA EGG!   These make boxed cake taste so much better!!!  Here's my favorite dump cake recipe right now:  [Lemon Cheesecake Dump Cake](https://neverendingjourneys.com/2018/02/04/lemon-cheesecake-dump-cake-recipe/)  Happy cake day and thanks for the contest!!!!
Heyyo! Your cake day was my birthday !! Check that out ! Sweeeetttt- Ok so little known fact about me- I LOVE to bake, and dream of owning a bakery one day, but tbh- I have a lot going on atm so it’s a second life dream, maybe when I retire, and can get up early in the morning 😂😂😂  My favorite cake is this one my step dad used to make for every special occasion, it’s kind of become a staple here for when I need a bit of a reminder of home. It’s dark chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting, by far the best combination of flavors 😋❤️  What has almonds, honey and sugar — and swings from cake to cake?  Tarzipan.
How about a cake story. On my 28th birthday I was staying in a halfway house so my step dad couldn't make me my usual birthday cake. So I decided I was going to make it myself. I rode my bike to the grocery store and got all the ingredients, came home and started making the cake. Everything was going well and I was really excited. The cake was in the oven for about 7 minutes and the power went out. Something happened and my town had a 100% power outage for about 9 hours. I was pretty disappointed but the house manager had secretly gotten me a cake from Publix so we all sat around in candlelight to eat it and laugh about the ridiculous situation. It was very bizarre
The best cake I ever had would have to be the dominican cake i had on my brothers 8th birthday. I swear i ate like half the cake it was sooo good. I remember also having a delicious tres leches on my bil’s birthday which was so delicious. Thank you!
We had a monty python themed day at work. In honor of holy grail I made a cake in the shape of a bunny. It was vicious. And had teeth. And a tail. 🐇 It was red velvet so it looked like muscle being cut into and had coconut on the outside for fur. Best cake I've ever made!
The best cake I ever had was this like buttercream cake I got at Wal-Mart for my birthday once. It was incredible. But also I deeply enjoy butter pecan cake and I have it almost every year for my birthday.

hi friendo <3
It’s a bakery! But I’ve made my own following their recipe [yum](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/magnolias-vanilla-cupcake-recipe-1953849)
It definitely was!
It could me more than one reason. Some "jiggliness" in the middle when it's just out of the oven is normal, it will settle when it cools. If that's not the case, either it needs to cook a bit more, or maybe the oven you're using does not heat evenly. That's the case in the flat I'm living now, the bottom of the over gets a lot hotter than the rest! What I do to minimize the issue is put a layer of tinfoil under the cake pan, so that the crust doesn't start burning before the filling is cooked. Hope this helps!
It was like a lemon cake, with cherry filling, and lemon icing, with maraschino cherries on it. It was so good! Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm gonna try to recreate it this weekend
You know it! Always and forever! ❤️
Why thank you! And you know I always am!! That 2 week mark is getting close... any changes?!
You must!!! It’s sooo gooood!!!
Did I mention the homemade spaghetti and homemade garlic bread with prosciutto? 😋

Hey!  Where do I start with my introduction... I just recently decided to make my own Reddit account after playing around on my boyfriend's account for over a month. Decided to give his account back and make my own. Haha! I thought that this subreddit was interesting and liked how everyone is so nice to each other here.   I am a little boring, but a little bit about me. I'm from Hawaii, but I am currently living in Arkansas. I am going back to school to get my Masters in Public Health. I really enjoy traveling and hiking, and I love corny jokes! I watch WAY too much TV, which is so bad, but please feel free to give me some recommendations! I have a bad habit of shopping a lot and getting things that I don't need. I really like cute things-Cute animals, cute colors, cute flowers (I have cute binder clips that have smiley faces cut out, haha!). I am into makeup and skincare. I love doing people's makeup and have thought about becoming a cosmetologist, but decided I wanted to separate hobby from career.   Anyway, ask me anything!

Hey welcome to the sub! Fav tv character ? Mines Barney Stinson! At least for now it is. I’m alwYs changing ! But loved Barney for years now. Never get tired of Himym
I always recommend john mulaney but thats cause im a dork. Also same about the shopping. What kind of things do you like to watch?
Welcome to RAOA, Rose_Petal71.
Hello and welcome to RAOA!!!! What's your favorite tv show. Mine is The Office and Parks and rec.
Welcome to the sub. Glad you have your own account. Where would you like to travel to next?
Welcome! It's nice to meet you! I have those same binder clips! Aren't they cute?    Have you ever done stage makeup for theatre?
Hi! Welcome! What's your favourite skincare product and tip?
Hi and welcome to the sub!
Public Health is so interesting!! It's a possible career path for me I think. Do you have any favorite fun facts or things that you learned about it?  I also have the bad shopping habit- I recent bought a "Cat-opoly" (Cat version of Monopoly) game so I can play it with my roommate. I think it will be fun haha  What is your favorite makeup look to do? Last year one of my roommates and I always talked about makeup/ did our makeup together. We learned that I always focus more on the face makeup (bronzer, blush, highlighter, etc.) and she always focused on doing elaborate eye looks. Sometimes I would do a full face with a really simple eye look, and sometimes she would do an extravagant eye look without even any face makeup. It was a fun discovery that we approach a common passion so differently.
Hello and welcome to the sub!! What are your favorite tv shows?
Thanks!! My favorite TV character.. tough question. I can't pick between these two. I like Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) from Parks and Rec because of how funny he is, but I also really like Dexter Morgan (Michael Hall) because of how smart he is with every move... Even though he is twisted in so many ways.
I had to Google who John Mulaney was. I'll have to look into it. I love anything that makes me laugh! I watch a whole bunch of different TV shows and movies on Netflix. Few shows that I just recently finished was Lucifer, Dexter, and Cobra Kai. I am currently watching Orphan Black on Amazon. I love Grey's Anatomy, and I got hooked on 90 Day Fiance (the drama that I have in my life).
Thank you!!
Hey and thank you!! I really like Parks and Rec too! My favorite character on the show is Andy Dwyer-he has me laughing all the time! Who is your favorite character in Parks and Rec? Anyway, I would say Parks and Rec would be one of my favorite shows. My second closest would be Lucifer!
Thank you!! I've always been interested in traveling to Japan, but haven't gotten the chance to do so yet. When travel restrictions lift, the first place I plan on traveling to would be Japan. After going back to Hawaii to visit family. I would also want to travel to Europe too. Are you into traveling as well? If so, where would you like to travel?
Thank you!! It's nice to meet you too! Yes, those binder clips are so cute!   I haven't done stage makeup before, but I think that would be so fun to do. I've only dabbled into doing my friends makeup for special occasions and stuff like that. I don't think I am good enough to do professional makeup.
Hey! Thanks!! My favorite skincare product has to be Youtg to the People green tea and kale cleanser. It's the best cleanser I've used so far and have been through so many bottles of it.   A skincare tip... I'll have to say always wear sunscreen and moisturizer!   What's your favorite skincare product? I love trying new things!!
Thank you!! :)
Yeah, public health is interesting. I actually didn't get my bachelor's in this, but decided 3 years later that I needed a change. I just really like learning about diseases and viruses and educating people on things I learn. Hoping to get into research one day! Are you currently going to school? If so, what are you planning on studying?  I think I'm similar to your roommate. I normally do full face of makeup, but I would prefer doing a full eye look. I love dark eye makeup and I'm always picking dark colors in my palettes to make smokey eyes. I do try to make it lighter during the day though, but I just like that dark look. Haha.
Hey!! Thanks!   Some of my favorite TV show consists of Parks and Rec, Lucifer, Cobra Kai, Grey's Anatomy, 90 day Fiance ( love the drama that I don't have in my life,lol), the Good Doctor, the Good Place and many more. I just love anything that has to do with drama, romance or comedy!
Both are firm shows I haven’t seen! I really should watch them! I have heard such good things about parks and Rec!!
I usually watch anime but yeah john is a good comedian. Is gray’s anatomy any good? Ive heard a lot about it.
I did like lucifer a lot. It's gotten kind of dumb the last couple seasons though. I don't know if I can choose just one favorite character it's a tie between Ron and April. I know they are two completely different characters but I love them both.
I haven’t been out of the country in over a decade. I would like to visit Vancouver and other parts of Canada on the pacific side. Some day I would also like to visit Europe, especially Greece
I ask about stage makeup because I do a lot of volunteering and acting at community theatres. And, we're always looking for volunteers to do makeup. If you ever got into stage makeup, you could always find a theatre to help as a hobby. :)
Influenster sent me a box of the PTR Thomas Roth Peptide 21 stuff...it was honestly amazing. But super expensive so I haven't gotten anymore since. I think the Murad acne control clarifying cleanser is fantastic too!
I have a degree in Sociology! What is yours? Currently I'm working as a data analyst but I'm trying to decide what to do a master's in. Social work has always been a serious contender but I'm drawn to a lot of things.  I feel like I can never pull off dark colors on my eyes. I once did a really nice black smoky eye and felt like I should've gotten a beauty guru certificate or something. But usually I just do soft looks, usually with browns and plums, with lots of highlighter
I want to watch Cobra Kai! I loved The Karate Lid when I was a little kid. Is it on Netflix or Amazon?
Yes! When I finished Parks and Rec, I recommended that show to everyone at work! It's a good show if you want some laugh. I heard that some of the the things that Chris Pratt said on the show was improv and wasn't on the script!
Yes, I love Grey's Anatomy. I might just be bias because I have invested 16 seasons worth of my time. The first few seasons is worth the watch, after that, I just feel like they kind of coasted. It's nice to watch if you like to watch drama. If you like medical show's The Good Doctor is so much better.
Yeah, I have to agree. The last season of Lucifer was kind of disappointing compared to the other seasons. But yesss, April is so funny even though her character always has this serious personality.
I went to Vancouver about 4 years ago and loved it there. Was there for 4 days. There's so much to do and the city is beautiful. If you do end up traveling to Canada, save a day or two for Victoria (need a boat ride to get there). Saw pictures and it looked so pretty. My friend was talking about wanting to visit Greece too. I don't know much about it, but I would definitely travel just for food!
That's a good idea! I've never thought about that. I should practice makeup again and see if my local theatres need volunteers. Thanks for the recommendation. It would give me something else to do during the weekend or at night, so I'm not home all day.
I've tried Peter Thomas Roth anti aging cleanser once and it was really good! Some how it cleared my face even though it wasn't meant for that. It started drying my face out though, so I had to switch cleansers and started using the Youth to the People cleanserI.  I havent tried the peptide one, but would be interested trying it. Maybe I'll check it out once I'm almost done with what I have. I have heard a lot about Murad, but some how I never really tried it.
Mines in Public Administration with a concentration in Health Care. I know that sounds so boring. Haha. I rushed into finding a major. That's the whole reason I wanted to get masters in Public Health. I have a whole bunch of friends who did social work as their degree and love it! I always like to tell people to follow their passion and do what they love. As corny as that sounds.   I'm sure you rocked that smokey eye! I wish I could go out more to places, so I could put on makeup more often. I love just glamming up and feel confident! Haha
It's really good! I didn't think I'd like a karate show, but it caught my attention. It's available on Netflix.
I’ll defo give it a watch! Currently going through some Simpson’s on Disney plus so after that I’ll try parks !!
Yeah i hate it when shows just keep going to make money and not cause they have any ideas.
That would be cool!

Welcome to todays thread! If you haven't been around before, here is a quick explanation for you to enjoy!  The Daily/Nightly thread is a place for you to enjoy the company of your fellow RAOAers in one place! This thread is for many awesome things such as:  * Being judged for gameplay * Cleaning * Jammin out * Laughing  Plus many more fun things!  So come on in, grab a blanket, and enjoy the company.  **QOTD: What is your ultimate comfort food?**
Yay! 2 user(s) grew one year older today! Happy Birthday to:  * /u/TheGreatTyrant * /u/kitty-purrs  Since their last birthday, 50,631 threads and 1,531,396 comments were posted on RAOA!  Make sure you have your own birthday correctly entered [here](https://raoa.tech/settings).
QOTD: Chicken and dumplings!  Anyone watch any good movies lately?
I was a background extra in a movie over a year ago.  The movie just came out today.  So I had to wait over a year to see if you can even see me in it.  And you can't.  Not even out of focus way in the background.  So that stinks.  But we did Christmas with my mother today.  We always do it after Christmas because she likes to get the after Christmas sales.  I'm still not seeing anyone in person, so I just left her present outside, she dropped my stuff off at my door, then she left, then I brought everything in, then we opened everything on video chat.  She got me a lot of soap, candy, lots of socks for my husband, some dog food, and groceries so we can stay in longer.
I hope you all are having a lovely Friday night!  Stay safe, wear a mask, drink some water!  I think I'll be finishing my night off by reading the rest of my book and relaxing.
I hope everyone is having a good day!!      Almost done at work. Thankfully! I'm so excited to be home!!     QOTD- My favorite comfort food is absolutely pho.
The CEO of the company I work for praised my work again today. That was cool  I also got to leave early today
I'm having a rough night, so I just bought myself chocolate and ice cream.  I'm going to go pick it up soon.
Y'all. It is snowing outside my house. I am in the Deep South. I left the North because of this. What in the world.
My ultimate comfort food is my moms beef stroganoff. Maybe l will make some this weekend. I haven’t  made it since she passed away.
QOTD: Lemon Rice Soup, forever and always .   I had a rough one today.  Just snuggled up with my heated mattress cover on.  I’m starting *Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer* on Netflix.  Hope y’all are doing whatever makes your heart happy!
QOTD: casseroles and hearty soups!   It’s only 6:00 pm here and I’m already ready for bed.
QotD: Potato soup maybe?  My new pillows arrived today! Just one of my new ones is the same thickness as *three* of my old pillows, which is a little bit hilarious.
I really think it’s time for a haircut.
just found out about this sub, such an amazing idea! I'm working on my intro right now :)))
Anyone have a recommendation for Bluetooth ear buds that are NOT $150 to $250? I have excellent wireless ear buds for jogging, but I'm looking specifically for some that have a good enough microphone to actually talk with people on the phone. But I really don't want to pay $200 for Apple's Airpods.
Had a good Friday with the grand toddler. Stopped and picked up grocery's on the way home. I knocked that out and don't have to go out at all this weekend if I choose not to. I have been on a breakfast for dinner kick lately so I had waffles for dinner. Glad I didn't have to set an example for anyone and I can eat what I want to. Have a lovely night and don't forget to hydrate. 💦
Hi friends! Its the weekend finally! Cant wait to properly catch up with you all this weekend! Hope you all had an amazing day!
I haven't left my bed or the warm blankets at all today.      QOTD:: I don't care what the situation is, I will always feel better with a bowl of spaghetti. I love spaghetti when I'm happy, sad, bummed, sick, celebrating, IDC what going on. You put spaghetti in front of me I will devour it and feel better. lol
I'm so ready for bed. I used up all of my productivity earlier today, so aside from a beer run this evening, I've done nothing. Gotta go to sleep so I can wake up and get back to it.  I hope everything is having a wonderful Friday night! ❤️
Hey there friends! What are y’all up to tonight? We just made and ate some yummy cinnamon rolls! It’s been a looooong day working on crate training the puppy, lol. But we are making progress! Woo! ;)  QOTD: Prob Funyuns, lol.
Qotd.... making chocolate chip cookies. Just the action of making them is so soothing    So in about 8 hours my kid will be moving out to go live in another state with her mom. Granted the kid is 20 but it still makes me sad.
This has been a rough week but today has been awesome! The items I bought for mamas in need arrived today and that makes me happy. I was also able to eat dinner with my family tonight, which I haven't been able to really do since my headache started a week ago. Plus, while I was out of the room, my husband put up bookshelves that I received. So walking into my room, it was nice to see our books proudly displayed!  QOTD: Chocolate!! Dark chocolate preferably but I can deal with milk chocolate if there's caramel too! 😂
I hope everyone had a good day. I hope it was good despite anything that happened to you or those you love.
Been a rough day. Found out that my grandfather passed this morning. As a result, my mother (abuser) is trying to find a way to get up here to be with my grandmother, which is triggering for me to say the least. I moved away from her back in summer of 2013 and I've had frequent nightmares about her coming here and finding some way to either hurt me or start something since then. She hasn't actually been here since I left, but now might actually have a reason to come and while I know there probably won't be any issues, it still terrifies me.
Happy Friday everyone! Tomorrow is my Monday so I spent today getting some last minute chores and grocery shopping done. The laundry is put away, and I had time to read and play Animal Crossing. I made shrimp tacos for dinner, and now am almost ready for bed. Today was overall a really good day. I was fitted for my retainer today so at the end of February I will be getting my braces off! I have had them for 3.5 years now and am so ready. I’m nervous to get them removed because they’ve been on my teeth for so long and I’m scared of my teeth breaking or chipping :/   Hope everyone has a good weekend. Thanks for listening to me ramble.   QOTD: Honestly pasta. Mac n cheese, shrimp scampi, spagooter, or even tuna casserole. I love me some pasta
[deleted]
Japchae for dinner and watching Super Troopers
Woooo hooo. I sent out my first batch of [masks](https://i.imgur.com/v6yk3dT.jpg) into the mail - I did not expect such a crazy demand, so I just basically made a list of everybody who replied in order, divided into two lists (glasses and no glasses), and every time I go to the post office, which is about twice a week to mail business crap, I bring a big stack of them with me. I learned more about international mailing today than I have ever before in my life.   I wonder if anyone can [guess who](https://i.imgur.com/SDoRKOB.jpg)I’m sewing for tonight?  I already had like 100 of them ready to go, but im also putting a few special requests together... and I’m making me one to match a friend on here!  CORGI TRAAAAAIIINNN!!!
i keep looking up disney vaca stuff... wanna go so bad, stupid covid
My feet are tired and I’m happy to be home... hope everyone has a great night!   QOTD: mashed potatoes with a lot of butter
Happy weekend everyone!  &#x200B;  QOTD: Ice Cream I think
I'm reading a book right now that's very interesting. Thing is, I think it's poking at the edges of some stuff I've blocked out. I don't know if I can keep going with it.
French fries. 🍟🍟🍟
QOTD: I make a very simple soup with veggie broth, onions, carrots, and potatoes. I also like to eat this when I'm sick. My mom always made it for me when I was younger 💜 very comfy meal
QotD: Bacon and hasbrowns and fried chicken.
Hmmm, mac n cheese with tomatoes and avocados like at Panera :)
Hey everyone!   Hope you all have had a decent week. Even if it wasn't... you survived it.  So go you, it may not mean much but for anyone needing to hear it...I am proud of you and I'm glad you're still here.    I managed to score an interview for my show that I'm super excited for.  Had a website I'm building for a business give me fits in coding.  Had a really positive talk with the lawyer this week regarding my mother's death.   And I'm starting to see a light at the end of this long tunnel I entered in November.   QOTD: Home made pizza. I worked in a couple small pizzerias in my youth. I learned to make great pizza and the whole process lends to its comfort factor for me.
Tonight is a late night half-off donut run kind of night.
QOTD: Ice cream. Cheesecake. Tomato basil soup with a grilled cheese. Earl Grey tea. Frozen grapes. :)
Had a good evening. Watched Soul for the first time and really enjoyed it. Tomorrow is just a chill day, will try to go for a walk with baby boy and let him get some fresh air that is longer than taking the dog to go potty.  Nervous for work next week as we are going back in person but I’m thankful I have a job. I’ll just be even more careful for the sake of my family and those I work with.  I hope everyone has a lovely weekend!
So two months since I “recovered” from covid. I finally tasted something today and it was macaroni. But wait,  there’s more! It tasted like bitter and soap. 🙃🙃🙃🙃  I hate it here ☹️
QoTD: Today it's burgers and fries.  Haha.  Just found out that my husband is going to be working a lot of overtime the next month.  So I'm treating us all to some pity food.  😂
🎶 And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone  I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me  'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street 🎶   *hype hype hype*  *jump jump jump*  Doing some minor light cleaning and something something.  🐣  QOTD: uhhhh uhhh fries or sushi
Good evening all you great people of RAOA!!!! I hope your Friday was as amazing as you are. Mine was particularly amazing today, found out that our vacation is still going to happen, so super excited for that in 2 weeks.
I’m so exhausted today ugh. My daughter’s check up went awesome, she’s perfect! I always get super stressed before going because I’m worried about her getting her vaccines and just general doctor anxiety. But then afterwards, she does amazing and I’m so proud and feel like I’m doing a good job as a Mom. But I need a longgg nap, my brain’s fried lol.   Hope everyone’s Friday was fabulous! 💕
I’ve been having a panic attack for like 20 min now
I'm having a rough night. Don't really know why. I mean I do, kind of. I saw a cute pregnancy picture of Bindi Irwin and it made me sad. But that's not the only thing.  Probably shark week has something to do with my emotions. I just really miss my bf.
Just relaxing with my dog, in some comfy clothes, catching up on all I've missed here, Well trying my best but work wiped me out lol Hope everyone found one thing today that made them smile :)
I find comfort in the act of cooking, but if I had to choose one for myself it would be simple. I had 13 fertility surgeries that consumed my late 20s, early 30s. During my recovery I adored silly snacks that no one else would likely enjoy, like cheese popcorn and strawberry milk or malt, savories were rye crisp crackers, cottage cheese and peach slices. My favorite soup to create and eat is chicken with homemade noodles or dumplings. I love family feasts, like many others, and can’t wait until we can safely gather again. Whenever that day comes, it will be our new thanksgiving. 🖖🏼
Have a rough day and night here to tomorrow's my birthday and seems everyone forgotten, comforting myself with hot chocolate and a grilled cheese
Good evening, it’s very late here in the U.K. but I am decompressing with some Skyrim mod videos while I play animal crossing.   QOTD - either tomato soup or mash potato (...both?)
Today started out good but ended up bad :( well, tomorrow is another day, right?
First day back to work after recovering from my cold, I'm tired but it was good to be back. We ordered in Indian food so I had tons of delicious food which is a bonus.  Tonight's plan is to just get my kanji reviews done so then I can relax and play Animal Crossing. Work again tomorrow but then I think I might see if my bestie wants to go for dinner.  Also I got the silk eye mask I ordered from Poshmark today and it's soooo cute.
Happy Friday! Anyone have fun plans for the weekend? I’m staying in and relaxing :D
QOTD: homemade mashed potatoes and meatloaf with au jus gravy  So good news it the job I applied for last night took a look at my application late this afternoon, now I wait to see if they reach out to me for the next step in the process in the next week or two.
[This](https://imgur.com/a/PY1MCdK) is how my night is going. 🤷‍♀️ No more adulting here, lol
Finally [did something](https://imgur.com/gallery/h5KijcN) tonight.
4 day weekend yaaay!!!!
Hii I hope everyone had a great day 💕  [Cosmo and I just watching TV😺](https://imgur.com/a/rFyJHnH)
Of course!!! I can send you what we use!!!
Good evening, everyone! Sitting down to dinner and watching Harley and the Davidsons with the bf! Had a mostly good day so far and hope the rest of the weekend will be too!
Today I went to Trader Joe’s for the first time ever! I loved it so much, I wanted to get everything. Not necessarily the cheapest obv but found some really great stuff! (Bought this spicy Chai tea latte mix that I’m excited to try tomorrow!)  QOTD: I know it might sound weird but my mom makes the best lentil soup. It’s “Venezuelan” style and has potatoes, carrots, bacon chunks and chorizo. *chef’s kiss* the best thing to eat, specially during rainy/cold weather. Always makes me feel so good!
So glad it’s the weekend. This week has been rough. Courier service right now is a rough industry to be working in. We are being slammed with deliveries and can’t keep up. And it’s hard when customers don’t seem to understand or have any compassion for delivery workers and how hard they are trying to get everything delivered.   QOTD: Ultimate comfort food is my moms cooking, pancakes, or shumai from my favorite restaurant. I know it’s a weird and random list.
My best friend (on again/off again partner wrote me a poem  Inside your brown eyes I will look and see Images of bluer skies And future things to be  And when I'm done looking Into what seems to be infinite  You will look at me and say "It's been about 30 minutes"
Having some communication issues with my s/o but I have the weekend off, so I’m hoping we have a chance to talk through our feelings and really “get to the bottom” of it all.
Biscoffs! I keep accidentally eating the whole package in one day😓
Guys, I'm officially getting (at least slightly better) at making mixed drinks! Anyone who comes over is welcomed to have one 😄
Hi peeps.  My house is getting a new printer do to a non-fixable paper jam.  The only way I can see to get it unstuck would be to take the printer apart.  But we got 5 years of use out of the printer, and it only cost $35.  (The toner was more expensive, lol.)
This evening is being spent browsing for baby clothes. Baby girl needs to move up a size soon, and I think I want to just get small packs of matching pants, long sleeves, short sleeves, and sleepers. Keep it easy so everything goes together and we don't have a ton of stuff she'll outgrow.  My ultimate comfort food is probably macaroni and cheese. Of just about any kind.   The wind is so crazy here today. I was trying to walk into the building and it caught me and almost knocked me over. It made my glasses slip off. Had it stopped suddenly, I would have face-planted because I was leaning so far forward just to stay upright. I'm pretty sure that if I fell over I wouldn't be able to stand back up! It was one of the most insane things I've ever experienced!
I am crampy and bloated and blah today, and my wonderful husband picked me up some feminine products this evening along with [this](https://imgur.com/PcQ1kBm). Dear Lord, what did I do to deserve such a wonderful man? He truly is a keeper. 💛
Evening all. Really didn’t do anything but we have obtained a new coffee frother to steady command the coffee. Contemplating on writing a book on the truth of domestic violence and the conditions it’s causes. Idk yet  I got a title The low, dirty, shame of domestic violence.
yay for wonton soup tonight~! 🌸 hope that you all are having a lovely dinner, don't forget to stay hydrated and remember that you are loved! 💗
Hope everyone had a good Friday! I'm listening to Broadway showtunes, and it's making me happy.   QOTD: Usually my comfort food is chocolate and milk. But, right now, I could really go for some good homemade mashed potatoes.
Quick comfort food is French fries and Dr Pepper from McDonald’s. Ultimate is biscuits and sausage gravy with hash browns.  Y’all, I’m sad. I’m having intrusive thoughts (now like, those kind) that won’t go away. Just like every time I’ve ever done something stupid, shameful, wrong, just on rotate in my brain. It’s gotten the best of me today. Is it bed time yet??
Hey hey hey! I wanted to  share Kams cake :)   I posted in the daily but forgot there would be a nightly!   What’s your weekend plans?   https://imgur.com/a/6pVomTe  https://imgur.com/a/n8UdnbP  https://imgur.com/a/FDrak7I (there is bad singing in the last link - mute if you can!)
Didn't do my laundry, I want edibles instead....
Didn’t do much, slept in, watched some hockey. My foot has been hurting today but it looks fine. I like being on my feet so hopefully it’s better tomorrow.   Popcorn!
3 good things today:  1. Got some good news!  2. I stalled my new graphics card and my computer is like "oh God thank you" when I run VR haha!  3. "The Lab" from ~~Valve~~ Aperture Science works now that the new graphics card is installed!! (It was stick on a loading screen before that)  Bonus 4th thing: WANDAVISION IS AMAZING!  ACCOMPLISHMENT: graphics card, and went to the dentist for fillings  VALUE PROVIDED: I guess that I gave an award to someone on reddit?? I don't even know today... maybe I'll count doing these "3 good things today" posts. Maybe they'll encourage someone to be grateful as well, and evaluate their day! ♥️
What is one thing that you wish you could be doing but the pandemic has put a hault to it?
Good morning everyone! I hope y’all have a good day!!  I’ve become a major procrastinator. My family (all in my bubble) is doing out “Christmas” today at my sisters which is 2 hrs away. I was up until after midnight finishing wrapping presents/packing everything and then making some goodies (special k bars, Oreo truffles, rice crispy bars). Before getting sick I NEVER put things off tell the last minute, I was that person that was always 20 mins early, had everything done and ready to go 2-3 days before they needed to be. Now? Nope though I’m never technically late for anything, I get there the exact time I’m supposed to be there rather than early and I leave everything to do until last minute and I hate it but can’t seem to get back to where I was!   QOTD: chocolate, or Mac & cheese
Cereal!! Ugh I love cereal. Almost all kinds of cereal. I can finish a box in 2 days...
I cleaned my room today....3 months of avoidance and its finally done! Its not perfect but you can walk through it. That's an odd thing to be excited about I know but im proud.
Happy Friday! Had a lovely lazy day where i was fighting a migraine for half the day. So that’s neat! Hope you all had a good day!
I’ve got an absolutely wicked headache. I get them a lot because I have Chiari Malformation. But this one is especially bad - so I’m on the internet 😂  Made a delicious chicken tender salad for dinner. Considering making cinnamon rolls for dessert. If my Advil kicks in I probably will. Hope everyone had a great day!!
happy birthday!! 🌸🎂💗
Happy birthday 🎈🎂🎊🎉🎁
Happy Birthday!!
Happy birthday! 😊
That’s a favorite of mine too love chicken and dumplings
I finally finished watching Wonder Woman 84.  I enjoyed it!
We just watched Beautiful Boy on Amazon prime.  It’s not new, but was new to us.  I really liked it.
Im here with you, too! How do YOU dumpling?! I just use cut up biscuit dough (the cheapest cans lol). Honestly, I dont even care for the chicken part. Oh man, this sounds oh so good! I wish I didnt do grocery shopping already lol. Next week its onnnn!
OOh definitely!
I recently watched two different movies starring Charlize Theron that I really enjoyed.    The first is a Comedy co-starring Seth Rogan called "Long Shot" where Theron plays the secretary of state that I found surprisingly enjoyable.  The second is an action flick called "The Old Guard" and Theron plays a part in a group of people who have become immortal for no apparent reason and are often fighting for their right to live. A very entertaining adrenaline rush.
Ohhh man! It would be mine, but I only get it on super rare occasions. My cousin makes it and she lives in a different state and doesn’t always have the time to cook them when I come.
Just watched 7500 and it was really good for a movie that essentially takes place entirely in a cockpit.
It's cool that you were a background extra for a movie, even if you aren't seen in it. Merry Christmas! My mom and I are doing Christmas on Sunday. We will get to see each other in person for Christmas dinner, and I am so excited!
I hope you're having a lovely Friday too!
You too!
I love pho! I hope you get home soon!
damn, I want pho now... do you make it?
Its always nice to receive recognition for a job well done
That's always great when the CEO acknowledges your work. Congratulations!!
Great job!!
Congratulations on being acknowledged! You did great. Hope you're enjoying even more of the early start to the weekend!
Congratulations!! You must be doing a great job!
I hope the ice cream and chocolate helps you get through whatever it is you're dealing with tonight, and tomorrow is a better day for you. Sending hugs your way!
Hope the night turns around for you. <3
I hope the snacks have improved your night
Ooooh ice cream!  I want the king cake ice cream in our freezer but I can't fit it in today's budget. I hope your night gets better and you enjoy your chocolate and ice cream!
Climate change my friend.
That sounds like a good weekend plan
I know how that goes - the first time I made something that my mother made I busted up crying the whole time.
Sounds like an interesting documentary.
I woke up ready for bed.
Me too. I’m perpetually sleepy.
I've been ready for bed since my nap.
Mmm casseroles.
what's your favorite soup?
Yum potato soup is one of my favorites. 😋
potato soup, with cheese?
Do you have a hard time finding the right combo? Like, one flat, one new. One firm, one soft.
I want one SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad but I don't trust going to a barber or anything right now. Ugh. Nearing my breaking point though. I usually only chop my hair off really short once a year and it's almost been 2 now so my hair is REALLY long! And I haaaaaaate it!
Welcome
Welcome to the sub!
Welcome!
Welcome!!
I have heard really good things about raycon they have a set that are $79. Here is a code for 15%off FSAFE15
I use jlab air buds and they're pretty awesome. They're $50 and they are a nice smaller black design instead of with those long white nubs.
Oooh waffles for dinner sounds amazing!!! I'm glad you had a good day!!
Ooo that makes me wanna have waffles tomorrow haha I'm sure something will come up so it doesn't happen but maaaaybe haha
Hope you did too!!!
How do you feel about being in bed all day? Are you holding up OK?   What do you like to garnish your spaghetti with?
Nothing wrong with that. It’s good for the soul once in awhile.
Goodnight and have a lovely and productive day tomorrow!
Woohoo for being productive! You're an inspiration for a slacker such as myself...proud of you! Goodnight, and have an extremely efficient day tomorrow, as well!
Yay! Progress! I played around making some cal coffee. It's not too bad! Funny enough, the actual coffee I made is Cinnabon cinnamon roll!
That's a big change. They will still always be your kid, and you their parent.
Home the on the mend continues. I love dark chocolate too... salted with toffee is my fav.
Dark chocolate is my favourite kind of chocolate! What did y'all have for dinner?
Aww that's sweet. How are you today?
I hope you had a good day too!!!
Awful, I'm sorry. Sending virtual hugs.
Hugs
Your justified in feeling that way. You dont have to allow someone back in your life if you dont want to. Maintain whatever boundaries you need to in order to stay safe and sane.  Im really sorry for your loss.
*hugs*
I'm so sorry for your loss  Edit: removed my wishlist link that apparently gets placed when I comment from the computer
Shrimp tacos sound goooooood.
where do  you get said spread?
Excuse me.... Bear... Bear fucker. Do you need assistance!!!
always wanted to try that!
Very stupid covid. Still crossing my fingers for the glimmer of hope with the new vaccines. My fiance's and I made a plan that we wanted to go to Disney World for our 30th birthdays this fall but we shall see!
You're back!! How are you doing? 🙂
Happy weekend to you also!!!
Happy Weekend!!
Happy weekend!  Question is, what kind of ice cream??
Aaah, maybe time to take a break from that one 😎💞
Yeah, def put it down for a bit if it's just gonna cause trouble. Sometimes I have to do that too.
But...what if they were soggy french fries?  Just kidding. No judgement. French fries are yummy.
That sounds so wonderful.
How could you destroy precious mac n cheese with tomatoes!!? Lol
Happy you hear things are looking up! Good luck with your interview!
What kind(s) of donuts will you be getting? Any particular favourites?
Oooh what kind of donut?
Ooooh, here's a dollar 💵, pick me up one, will ya? 😆
Frozen grapes! That is something I have not thought of in a very long time, but they are so delicious. Especially in the hot summertime.
I really loved soul!
Dang, that's some baloney! I hope you recover your sense of taste :(
That's horrible, my wife only lost hers for like a couple weeks.
Whaaaaaat 😔😖💜💜💜
Oh no. Have you seen the crazy thing on TikTok to get your taste back?
Oh man that sucks 😟 I have that gene that makes cilantro taste like soap. It ruins so many things.
burgers ftw, it's been far too long since I've had a good burger
Also, somehow I messed up my Starbucks order and got myself a fully caffeinated beverage (I ordered from my favorites so I have no idea how it changed it...).  So if anyone wants to chat, I'll be up for the next three days 😂🤪
I love sushi!!!
sushi made with fries?
Where are you heading to, if you don’t mind me asking?
Yay!
That's fun!
Good for you! :)
That's great!
That really great news!
Sorry you’re sleepy friend! I hope you get some rest!   I used to get super anxious before doctor appts too when my girls were tiny. You just love them soooo much you don’t want anything to be wrong or to see them in pain with their vaccinations. I get it. I wish I could say it gets easier but it doesn’t 😂
They can be so hard. I'm glad she did well!!
Do you need someone to talk to? I hope it's over now or ends soon.
Panic disorder literally runs in our family. We take turns comforting each other, often. Consider yourself family and txt anytime!
I'm late to this comment but I really hope you're feeling better by now!
I hope your night improves some. The Irwins still make me sad to see them :(
Hugs!
Sending so much hugs!
Definitely having impending shark week blues too haha feel better soon!
More virtual hugs to you! Hope things look up for you.
I hope you did too!!!!
I need to get my comfy clothes on too haha hmmm I got a new tube of my favourite mascara so that made me smile!
I like to keep it simple with cooking too most of the time. Some of the best stuff is simple! I do get the urge to make some complicated stuff sometimes though. What's the most difficult thing you've made?
Happy early Birthday!!!🎊🎉🎂
Aww, happy birthday sweetie, we will be here with you 🌻🌸🐭🧸
Happy Birthday ❤️ I hope your day is much better than today.
Happy birthday! 🎈🎁
Happy Birthday!!
I'm sorry to hear that. It will be better tomorrow.
Going to my dad's tomorrow to drink some beer and hang out. Other than that probably nothing at all.
Happy Friday! Hiking an interpretive trail inspired by MLK on Monday, otherwise staying in and relaxing too.
Looks like you are having a pretty fun night!  Enjoy your weekend!
Love the fabric!! 😷💜
They look great!
Lucky
That's so awesome! I miss those 😂
I hope you did too! What was the best part?
Psst, I think your comment got lost!
Good evening to you! Enjoy!!
The rest of your weekend would be great! Enjoy the rest of the night with the bf!
Be wary of Trader Joe's...once you've been exposed, you'll be addicted! I also want to get (almost) everything in Trader Joe's. I'm a sucker for packaging details, and they definitely have that down pat!   Excited for you to try the Chai tea mix!   The lentil soup sounds amazing. Better get that recipe from your mum!
I need to go when I actually have time to look around. Lol I almost never find anything I really like there but as much as I hear about it and see things I like in other people's hauls, I'm not looking in the right places. Or our Trader Joe's sucks. It's like an hour away so I don't go often haha
I love Trader Joe’s so much!  I had one really close to my former house, sadly we moved in 2014 and the closest one is 2.5 hours away!
Haha l am not allowed in Trader Joe’s without a responsible adult. Same goes for Ulta and Nordstrom Rack 😆
Trader Joe’s has some cool stuff! Their Cauliflower egg frittatas are absolutely awesome
I'm sorry work is rough right now! Maybe it will slow down a bit soon! Have a good weekend!
Hope y'all have a good heart to heart <3
Okay but why are they so damn good though? It should be illegal 😂😂
I had to Google those lol, they look yummy.
Nice I nominate as group bar tender
What are you making?
That's a pretty good life out of a printer!
Isn't it crazy how it's cheaper to buy a whole new printer than it is to buy the ink for it!
Hey check out the Carter’s web site. They have tons of adorable stuff on clearance. I just bought my granddaughter some cute stuff. I love their three packs of shirts and pants.
Ah good. He knows how to not get murdered. lmao Chocolate is the most important thing during lady times.
I just finished feeling this way!  You have an awesome hubby for sure!  My guy brought home a couple of king sized snickers for us last weekend and it was awesome!  I'm sure you are a wonderful human being and you most certainly deserve the amazing man you married!  Have a great weekend!
It's that way in my house now. I came home with two Kinder Joy's today and a bottle of coke to put a smile on my wife's face.
Halfway through reading this comment, I expected some weird thing he thought you would need because guys usually don't understand how women's bodies work but that was so sweet!
A new coffee frother sounds amazing!
I would read this book.  ETA - and you may use my therapy notes for case study.
Have you ever read the book “Why Does He Do That: Behind the Minds of Angry & Controlling Men?”
you make it yourself? sounds great!
Yum!! 💗💞
what's your fav show right now?
I love musicals!
I'm sorry you're having a tough day :/ I get thoughts like that on occasion, where my mistakes just play on repeat. The thing that helps the most is to remind myself (as much as I don't feel it in the moment), that I ask loved and cared for and valuable, and that those things are true despite my mistakes, because everyone makes mistakes! I hope you can hear those words for yourself too, because you were made lovely and beautiful!
I'm so sorry. I hope you can relax and get passed these 💕
I'm so sorry you're struggling. Talking to someone always helps me. My PM's are always open <3  Edit: commented from my computer and it somehow posted a wishlist link in the comment so I removed it
I’d take some edibles as well :D
The Lab?? Is that something new with Portal??
Taking the kid to places like the zoo, museums, playdates, etc...
Oh, migraines stink. Are you feeling any better?
Happy cake day!
Happy cake day
Happy cake day!
Happy cake day! I’m sorry you had a migraine. Those are terrible. I hope you are doing better.
Chiari is a nightmare and a half. Have you tried mmj? depending on your state, my nephew who has chiari from CCI takes the charlotte's web strain and says it's the only thing that helps his chiari headaches.
Awwww sending love 💗💗💗
Was it good? I've heard a lot of bad about it :x
My mom does that too, along with cream of chicken soup and chicken broth.
That's how my mom does it, I think, and I love hers the best, lol.
I love both of those movies.
Yeah, I'm sad that you can't see me, but it was neat to know that I was there.  Most people can't say they were there on the set while they were filming a movie!  And I did get paid for it!    Nice to see another late Christmas family lol!
Thank you!
Me too!
Right? I haven't eaten today and I'm so hungry!!! We do!!!! Just with simple stuff but it's so good!
Thank you. <3
Thank you. 💚💜
They did, thanks.
Thank you. <3
Oh my gosh that sounds delicious!! Who makes it?
Mmm. And it's just going to get worse.
Awwww I am afraid that will be me too
I started watching that today too! It's well done
They’re so yummy and comforting!
I love minestrone and hamburger vegetable and lentil soup! What about you??
Heck yeah!
Not really? I mean, I'd prefer the pillows be a bit firmer, but it's not that big a deal ~~especially considering just how many years I had been using my previous pillows~~
I am too scared to go get a haircut but I am desperate enough to let my husband have at it again. He did pretty well. I bought this guide tool on Wish and it works! It’s like a giant banana clip you put around your. You just pull it down to your length and cut. It even has a level!
hiiii
thank you!!! I've uploaded my intro and so excitedd
thanks 💖 I've uploaded my intro :)
thank you! I just posted my intro😊     ###
Thanks! And the code is much appreciated!
Thank you! I'll check these out.
Thank you! Have a restful night.
They were chocolate chip yummy goodness.
it was actually pretty good! work went smoothly! how about you??
I'm good. Just one of those fuck getting up days.   And if the sauce is good nothing. If its kinda bland salt and crushed red pepper
Yesss! Toffee is one of my favorites. I have to hurry and eat it before my husband eats all of them though because he has no self control when it comes to toffee! 😂. Good thing we don't keep it in stock often. Lol  Edit: autocorrect is hilarious tonight. Switching my Yesss to heads... Switched it back.
Tonight I made Korean beef and broccoli over rice and a fried runny egg to go on top of it.  It was amazing. 🤓
Thank you. I'm great. As I always am.
😂
sending you so much luck! gunna be a madhouse with the 50th
Hi!! 👋😃 I’m doing good/better, thank you so much for asking ❤️ how about yourself?
All of them! Hahaha   My all time favorite though is Blue Bell’s Brides Cake, their Banana Pudding, any Rocky Road  or Ben & Jerry’s Cherry Garcia.  I love anything with fruit especially cherries and rocky road is a guilty pleasure from high school many years ago. I wish I could remove my sweet tooth 🤣  What’s your favorite?
Yeah.
I might just not finish it ever. We'll see what happens.
I actually like the soggy ones better ._.
Its awesome lol you should try it :)
^ Ditto on Fish's comment! So happy for you that you're nearing the exit of the tunnel. Good luck with your interview! And thank you --to you, too --you've survived this week!
Our QFC (Kroger) just has them prepackaged at the end of the day, so today's options were pretty much just glazed and chocolate cake donuts. If I could pick any though, I'm a big fan of buttermilk and a good maple bar... mmm...  What about you?
Just some standard chocolate and glazed cake ones tonight. If there were any apple fritters left or maple bars I'd be all about those though 🤤
Haha, done and done! Next time you're near seattle you just let me know 😄
Right? I had to drown it in hot sauce to get rid of the bitter lol. I joked to my boyfriend I’m like an old miner who has to drown everything In it to taste 😂
I’m glad she recovered. I still have fatigue and lung issues too. But I’ve been trying to be more active in the hopes my lungs start working. But even walking to the bathroom they burn like I just ran a mile in the cold. I should probably go to the dr but who had the time or money for that these days lol
Surprised the hell out of me lol. I’m like oooo flavor..bleehhh 😂😂
The Jamaican remedy with The burnt orange? I haven’t. I’ll have to try it next time I see my friends they have a gas stove and ironically are from Jamaica 😂
I was just realizing today that I probably need to take a break from caffeine because most caffeine doesn't have much effect on me anymore.  I literally have to take it in pill form for it to have the desired effect. Not a good sign.
Rainbow rolls , how about you ?
pretty sure that is a thing but have not try it.
A resort in Mexico.
I know, it's been about 4 years since I have actually been on any kind of vacation.
Yea, it's to celebrate our 5th anniversary so we are pretty excited.
Thank you! 💕
Thank you! How was your day? ☺️  And exactly! I know she’s perfect and there’s no issues but I still worry about her and can’t help myself. 😩
Thank you! It wasn’t so bad today, she only had to get two vaccines, so that was good. I brought in her favorite kitty stuffed animal and her favorite book for her to hold which I could tell she was happy about. I think that might have been the trick. She still cried for a lot of it, but less, than other times, which is what matters. 😅
Just need to breath
Hugs
I feel much better
Thank you. <3
Hugs <3
Huuugs <3
Damn shark week. Damn it all! T_T <3 <3
*hugs* thank you <3
Probably beef Wellington (number of steps,  temperature controls and length of time) or a standing rib roast, baked Alaska, all from scratch. Homemade chicken noodle soup starting with my own bone broth, roast chicken and day long noodle recipe (my grandma put towels on all the chairs and hung all the noodles to dry, for hours).  These are foods where I love the process as much as the result. It feels like art or music to me.
Thank you <3
Beer with dad sounds fun! Hope you enjoy!
Ooo that sounds like fun!!
Thanks, my friend tie-dyed it
Sort of...next weekend I'm only off Sunday 😭
Thank you for saving me!!!
Good evening, can I ask you how you attached your wish list behind your name ? I can't figure it out and It's probably really easy lol. Now if you needed wound care, a catheter,  or CPR those I can do :)
Thank you! Have a great night as well!
Absolutely, the only thing I didn’t like is that I wanted to buy garlic and it either came pre-peeled or just a little bag. I need ALL the garlic, smh.   Me too! And definitely, they are so good! going to text her tomorrow to steal that recipe (will def share when I get it!) and coerce her into making me some lmao
Definitely go when you have time! And it might be, even my friend said that the one we went to wasn’t the best one and I found a few things I was really interested in trying so I can only imagine at the better one! I held off as I didn’t want to go overboard, but next time I’ll go and really take my time.
I always lived far from the only 2 in existence around my area but recently moved close to one and it’s like 5 min away. Can’t believe it took me this long!
Lmaooo m’am, if this ain’t the truth!! Ulta, Sephora and Etsy are the places I’m only allowed to look, no touchy unless extremely necessary😂 I guess I’m adding TJ’s to the list!!!
They do! We had to leave so quick I couldn’t just really spend time looking at everything but those frittatas sound amazing, so I’ll make sure to try and hunt them down next time!
I know right! You set out to only have one then woops they’re gone!
They are. they’re basically cookies. I don’t how to explain the taste tho.
I'd gladly accept. What's your poison of choice?
Tried my hand at a [Vodka Sunrise](https://imgur.com/a/UBahLuy) earlier. Simple, but the coloration turned out beautifully.
Definitely!
For real.  Not anymore, though.
That's a great idea!! She has lots of carter's.
He came home, hugged me and handed me the bag, and proceeded to go into the bedroom and leave me alone the rest of the night. He is a very smart man. 😂
🥰 That was very sweet of you to say. Thank you. You have a wonderful weekend too!
Aw, very sweet of you!
He grew up with two sisters, so he's totally not phased by any of it. I'm a very lucky girl!
Yes bed bath and beyond were out but target was spot on
Ty I don’t people are aware of what it’s like and the aftermath of having to pick yourself up once you get out
Ty so much
No I haven’t but see how the judicial system treats victims and the reliving of what happened with no regard to the victim
yes, it's super great! 🌸💗
Next To Normal. Yours?
Same! Do you have a favorite musical?
That’s great advice. Thank you so much!
Thanks. I will try my best to relax.
Thank you!! I appreciate that. I’ll save your comment in case I need to take you up on that.
I only have weed.....:(
Well not exactly? But sorta? It's an Aperture Science experiment where they send you into different dimensions/places for mini games. It's cute! It's just a little thing for VR(only). It's funny and cute and cool and impressive and all the things you'd expect! ♥️
Slightly. It’s just a low grade headache now. Thanks for asking!
Thank you!!
Thanks!
I liked it, but I'm not hard to please, lol.
Ill have to try that. I just boil chicken in water and add biscuits and seasoning salt when the chicken is half done. Bet your recipe brings it to the next level of richness. Wowzers.  Dad didnt eat chicken, but mom said something about Ham & Dumplins. Anyone try that? Lol
Its the only style Ive had lolll. The secret ingredient is celery salt (or just seasoning salt as it generally has a lot of celery salt). Wellll think ill hit the store agaun tomorrow cuz man sounds so darn good.
It's nice that you got paid for it too!  lol, yay for late Christmas!
can i have a recipe, i tried once, but it wasn't great
💚💜
Blue Bell I believe :) They should have it at just about any grocery store near you around this time of year!
[He gets excited for it every year 😂](https://imgur.com/a/aX2Sex7)
Yes. The great mother is angry now.
My mother passed suddenly before Easter - the strawberries she had made for the holiday dessert were in the fridge and I cried every time I ate them, and then I cried when they were all gone.
I’ve heard great things about it.  Glad you are enjoying it!
Yes they are!! Some of your faves?
oh goodness, so many, cheesy potato, ramen, pho, thai coconut, chicken noodle.... beef stew, chili
Lol. Well, just goes to show I really am the princess and the pea. I’m super high maintenance when it comes to my bed.
Yeaah I'm in no way trusting my man to do anything to my hair.
Yay!
You're welcome!!
You too!
That's good to hear!!! Mine was pretty good, work was busy my number two called in so I had to do double duty, but it wasn't all that bad. Came home had fish and "chips" and been playing Forza 7 for the past 4 hours.
Glad you enjoyed your time in bed today!   Oh wow. I hadn’t thought of that. Thanks for introducing me to crushed red pepper in spaghetti!
Sooooo good.  Can't stop eating it. I realized I would not be such a chunky monkey if I could taste what love without having to eat it.   I need Wonka Wallpaper
Oh that sounds delicious!
That’s good! 😊
Wow, cool :)
That movie is probably in my top 5 favorites.
I'm well, thank you! I'm so happy to see you back!
Banana pudding?!? Omg I have been out of the ice cream game for far too long!! I love ice cream but it does a number on my family so we don't get it too often. We usually keep it safe with mint chocolate chip or good old fashion vanilla (with fudge or caramel and maybe a brownie under it)! But now I really need to go peruse the ice cream aisle and see what kind of shenanigans I have been missing!!!   I love cherries so I'll definitely have to look for Cherry Garcia. I'm salivating... 🤤 Lol  I'll just need to go run errands on my own so I can sneak off to an empty parking lot and give some of these flavors a try! 😂
🧐💜💜💜
Wow, am I extra glad that I prefaced the comment saying no judgement, hahaha.   What is it about soggy fries do you like about it? A friend mentioned that it’s because crunchy ones have a higher chance of injuring his gums, and potentially causing canker sores, which I thought was extreme, but guess it does happen...?!
I would but I just really can't do tomatoes lol I'm one of those weird people who has more issue with texture than flavour.
Buttermilk?! I had to google that. Buttermilk donuts look absolutely scrumptious!   I’m rather boring, and have stuck to just glazed. So your prepackaged donuts are right up my alley! Hope you’re enjoying your donuts!
Mmmm maple bars are the best!
I'm craving a chocolate-covered Bavarian creme one lol I went to Dunkin a few weeks ago and got one but no chocolate on it! It was good but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little disappointed haha
That’d be nice! I’ve always wanted to visit Seattle
Oh gosh lol Haha no joke that was straight up my grandmother! Except she just PILED on the pepper. Here's hoping you get out of your old miner phase soon!
Wow, I'm sorry that's happening to you. It's so weird how this thing works. She just had minor cold symptoms. And I was around her quite a bit before we realized it. And I didn't even get it.
Aaaaaah you have really been through it!! 🙈 I hope this means full taste will return asap 👅💜💜💜
Yes! And Brown sugar, I think? It's crazy, but hey, if it works. 🤷‍♀️
Caffeine is a strange one.  I am very sensitive to it, it tends to make me have anxiety attacks so I just say I'm allergic and avoid it.  Small amounts like decaf seem to be ok but a full coffee will make me a little crazy.  Repeated daily use would put me in the hospital.  But my mom is like you!  She can drink her espresso at 10pm and to to sleep right after.
California mango rolls! When I went to Japan they didn’t have California rolls :(
Aww yay! Congrats! I’m in the same boat but our honeymoon got canceled because my job made me pick between my honeymoon or getting paid because quarantine would have used up too many days 😞
It was okay. Accidentally found out my boyfriend has an OnlyFans account so that sucks. Just trying to figure out how I want to handle it. I’m tired.
Hey whatever works!!!
Good.
Yea even after 37 years I still love hanging out and shooting the shit with him.
So gorgeous!
Oh wow. Please enjoy this 4-day weekend for you, to the max!
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but --on the sidebar, there's an option to add your user flair. You'll check the box, saying to allow user flair to be shown on this subreddit, and an option to edit the user flair, where you'll insert the wish list link.
Good evening and welcome. Have you read the subreddit information at the top of the page click the drop down arrow This should explain everything. If you still are having trouble let me know and I will try and help. Have a lovely night.
HAHA. Your mum would be extremely proud of her recipe once you text asking for it!   Is there a yearly Garlic Festival where you’re at, or close-by? It’s garlic everything —even garlic ice cream! Once things are safer after the pandemic, consider taking a vacation where garlic festivals are a thing (if it’s not within your vicinity)!
I am drooling thinking about it.  I think it’s time to take a road trip
Etsy is bad for me. Very bad. LOL l just bought a painting from They/Them Gallery. I love it!
Have you tried the cookie butter!? That stuff is dangerous
Well they look good.
It’s called a fuzzy bunny slipper but it tastes like a gummie bear
Wow that looks amazing. Good job!!! I'm usually just a crown and vanilla coke person if I'm drinking mixed drinks. But usually I'm just drinking beer.
Oh, that is gorgeous!! 😎💗☀️
Really? Hmm Didn't know it changed!
Definitely sounds like a keeper! 😂
I try once and awhile
Undoubtedly, those who haven’t experienced it do not.  Dare I say cannot.  I couldn’t appreciate what my Mother was going through when she did.  You’re welcome to dm me if you ever want/need to talk.  It’s a judge free, safe space.
oh goodness... been rocking Spring Awakening lately
I have a few. Rent will always be my all time #1 but I also love Wicked, Dear Evan Hansen, Tick, Tick....BOOM!, and Last 5 Years a lot. What about you?
🧡
💜
Awww haha
I'm going to have to look it up. I LOVED Portal.
I'm glad it's slightly better! I hope it goes away completely soon!!
You're welcome!
I think she puts in shredded chicken too (she'll pre-cook and pre-shred chicken).  I have not tried that, but it sounds good.
Of course!! I can send you what we use!
I am going to look for it tomorrow for sure!
*hugs*
Honestly I haven’t met a casserole I didn’t like lol. If it’s cheesy, I’m going to love it, like tator tot  or any tex-mex casserole. What about you??
I can’t believe I forgot pho!! Especially when I’m feeling a bit under the weather, it just hits the spot!
My pillows may not matter to me, but my mattress is sort of a different story; I would like to order a mattress-in-a-box from an online retailer, but I'm worried that it won't be firm enough.
😂
sounds like a good end to the night!! enjoy!
Soooo good
From one chunky monkey to the next, do you! Gotta enjoy life sometimes am I right? 😊
It was and it's easy too. 🤓 I follow mashup mom's weekly meal plan. We don't use every recipe but we definitely find a few we try and then keep the recipes to reuse later.  The kids love having a fried egg over their food.
Same
Aww, it’s been good to be back 🙈❤️ I’ve always liked your username by the way! Have a great day 😊
Bahahahaha! Blue Bell ice cream is the best but if I start buying it, it creates a bad cycle that we don’t stop 🤣 but yes their banana pudding ice cream is very good. It comes out in summer I think
💚💜
Oh, that actually makes sense. I get canker sores sometimes and have a nervous habit of chewing on the inside of my lips/mouth so then I get sores from that too. Idk why I like the limp ones more tbh. I just always have...I guess because they're a little (forgive my choice of word) moist and I am the kinda person who eats sauce with nearly everything.
Not weird at all lol I have a son who feels the same way about them.
Yup, buttermilk are delicious. Very heavy, but oh so good.  And thank you very much! I hope you get some tasty donuts soon yourself.
Especially with a piece of bacon on top 🙈
Ooo, Bavarian creme is an excellent choice. I guess that just means you have to go back again soon lol
Yes soon. Lol. I miss food flavors
My boyfriend didn’t get it either and he was near me the whole time. Y’all and your immune systems lol.
Yesss. I feel like my tastebuds are trying to regroup and there’s a bug in the system 😂😂
I’ll have to ask them about it and try it
My grandmother reacts to caffeine like you do. When she makes a pot of her flavored coffee, it is always half flavored and half standard decaf (since most good flavors aren't offered in decaf).
I’m getting sushi tomorrow and I gotta check if they have it with the mango. I’m sure it will taste good . I had ate philly sushi few days ago and don’t think I’m a fan.
Aww that sucks, I'm sorry to hear that. This is for our 5 year anniversary. Granted our anniversary was in November lol. But it still counts.
Oh god, that’s insane! Why wouldn’t he talk to you about that beforehand?! If you want to chat I’m just a message away. Hopefully you’re able to get some rest tonight though. 😣
That’s great!
I will :-)
thank you so much :)
She definitely will, she really is so proud of her cooking and loves every time I ask her for recipes!   Also, I did not know these existed at all till now!!! Thank yoooouuuu! I just spent the last 10 minutes looking it up and it seems there’s one 2hrs away from me in March. Seems like it might be too early still with everything going on but thanks for introducing me to this so I can at least plan it!
No but sounds like i should ill check it out lol.
Mmmm... liquid gummy bears.. I can get behind that.
Thank you! It's hard to beat a good whiskey coke. That's typically my go-to when I'm out and about. I like beer, but I gotta be in the ride mood for it, or have like a nice burger alongside.
Isn't it?! I want to keep making them just to see the different colors haha
Oh, I just meant this particular model!  It was a lot more than $35 this time.
Ty it’s just finding the right way to start besides my own experience with domestic violence
I've never seen that one. I like the soundtrack though!
Nice! My number one is Singin' in the Rain! Wicked, Hamilton, Next to Normal, and Into the Woods are some of my other favorites!
It's great!!!
Mmm tator tot casserole for sure. It’s so good! My mom makes a sinfully good sweet potato casserole on holidays that’s my absolute favorite!
I’m sticking with a regular mattress after trying memory foam and gel. Sometimes the new isn’t actually better than the old. And this is one of those times.
Fair... but I might have a million dollar idea here lol
You ever tried one on pizza? Soooo good!
I feel ya there! November and December are our cheat months. We usually have the really naughty but delicious goodies then. Januaey through October we make our own 'healthy' desserts. It's fun and satisfying but we always look forward to the holiday season when we can really go all out. 🤓
Oh! That’s a solid reason, actually. I’m more of the dry-no sauce type, guess that’s why the soggy fries aren’t my preferred ones.   I also have a nervous habit of biting my mouth insides! I grew up with my dad telling me to rinse with salt water to quicken the healing process of canker sores. Still do that to this day...
I bet! I can't even imagine...
Lol yea I work construction outside and use port-a-lets so that probably has helped my immune system hahahahaha because if you can use those on a daily basis and not catch anything then you have to have a hell of an immune system.
Thankful for that small favor- whew! 💕💕💕
For real!
It is always so good to hear that I'm not alone, thank you!
Definitely try the mango one! If they don’t have it just buy ur own mango thinly slice it and put it on the top!
Aww so fun! Where are you going?
Collecting your mum’s recipes would be a great addition!   When you do go to one, let us know how it is!
They have a creamy and a crunchy. Both amazing. The creamy one is good on strawberries
It’s a layered shot glass dropped in Mountain Dew and you slam it back
I hope you do! 🥰💞😎
Hahah gotcha
Old school on the first one!
Sounds delicious!!
Oh yes! Like the bubble gum desserts?  I mean if it doesn't turn little girls into blueberries, I'll give it a try! Lol
I have never heard of this before! I'm definitely going to be searching google for ideas! Thanks for sharing!
I keep bouncing from strict diet to all out hell breaking loose. I’m currently trying to get back on my Whole Foods plant based diet.
Yeah, also take my steak rare. Probably for the same reason. Hmm might have to try that then. I was always just told Listerine. Or whiskey lol
It’s made me enjoy textures a lot more though lol. And I can eat things I didn’t like before bc there’s no flavor
My bf jokes that whatever the military vaccinated him with has made him immune to damn near ever having. He might be onto something lol
Mexico, to an all-inclusive resort.
Now you’re making me hungry lol
That sounds like everything I want to have while playing D&D
Yeah. :)
Yes! But Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds! lol. Can't beat that!
Oh it is! No marshmallows needed.
Tbf Violet was an awful child... what if it only transforms bad children?
It's really hard trying to diet. My husband and I have given up trying to do it all. We pick 4 nights a week and do vegetarian/vegan meals and the rest we make two or three different kinds of veggies to go with the meat/fish we made. It's all about moderation in my book.   If we want pizza, we make a cauliflower pizza crust but then load up on pepperoni or sausage! Everyone needs pizza in their life.
Anything that burns 😁🙈
I imagine! That's so interesting.
Yea he's probably right.
Ooooooo eat lots of delicious food for me!
Sorry! Lolol.
I wish I knew what was in the shot glass
That is true!
That is a fact. Hmm... This sounds like a very effective way of parenting. "Stop talking back or I'm going to make you eat this gum that will blow you up like a blueberry!" Imagine how nice all the kids would be. Lol
Yeah I did keto for a while and lost weight and then stopped and gained it back. Then I went vegan for months before I fell off. I am chronically ill and the weight on my joints causes problems. I’m trying to loose mostly for that and to just be healthier. Got any vegan recipes you love making?
Scary thought alittle bit lol
Oh there will be lots of beer drank and lots of food eaten lol.
I'll see if I can do some recon. There's gotta be some "gummy bear" shot remakes out there.
We're in big brain territory now
I'm sorry to hear that!  Yes, I have a ton!  I'm going to have to go through my recipes and find them first.   I loved keto until I stopped following it. Lol. I lost like 40lbs in two months and then maintained for another six months. Then it was November so I couldn't say no to pumpkin pie and well, here we are.  My husband wanted to go full vegan and I supported him but after a month I just couldn't do it anymore so I fell off that wagon pretty quick.  😬   Is it okay to PM you some of my favorite recipes?  It might not be until tomorrow because we are about to put the youngest one down now and turn on a movie.
Perfect! :)
I know blue curaçao is in it
😂 for sure!!
Absolutely!
That is one I still need to find for my stash. I see a few recipes call for it.

How do you do a random generator? 🤔 I've seen a few posts users saying they pulled a random user name from a generator...how is this done?
Yup I think you tagged her correctly clicking her name leads me to her profile!

Tell me about any scary/paranormal experiences. If you don't have any personal story you can share some good ones you've heard
So one day late at night i was laying in bed. I was in my phone reading and suddenly i felt someone staring i looked in my doorway and i saw a white figure just standing there. I jumped in fright.......it was my little sister who is blonde and apparently so pale she glows in the dark.
I love spooky stories!!! Unfortunately idk if new generations consider spooky the same as me. Anyways!   One of the stories that scares me the most is from a friend, she says that when she was a girlabout 4-6 years, whenever she lay on her bed she could see through the window a figure that she describes as a little devil dancing, like a puppet.   She never felt fear, on the contrary, during the day she longed to go to sleep to see the little devil, who danced for her. But once one day she told her mother about it, the mother was very Catholic and she scolded her. The same day at nigth she lied down hopping to see the little devil and there was the little devil, but instead of dancing he just watching at her, as if he was angry.  My friend says that night she was very scary, and it was the last time she saw the little devil
When I was married to my first wife,  we were raising her child. I would hear a female humming a lullaby some mornings through the vents. If wake up,  see my ex wife in bed next to me and hear this humming.   It was not a tune I recognized,  I'd even get out of bed and go check the kid's room. He was a baby so it wasn't a case of him humming or even a TV/ Toy. It would stop as soon as the door opened... even the slightest bit.   The baby and the dog would also stare up into the corner of our dining room. The baby would giggle and kick in his bouncer and the dog's tail would be wagging happily.
I woke up two mornings ago to actually FEELING someone squeezing me trying to kill me. It wasn't a dream. I actually FELT the pressure on my arms. No joke, my arms got sore as the day progressed. Scared the hell out of me! 😱😱😱😱😢😢😢
Oh man about 10 years ago my family and I rented an apartment in Florence Italy. It was beautiful and sooo old. It was on the top floor had 3 bedrooms 3 baths and overlooked the city. Suiting our time there my parents shared a room. My sister and brother shared a room and I had my own. First night there was normal. Second night I woke up around 2:32 and heard kids playing but didn’t think anything of it because we had kids across the hall and my sleepy brain didn’t demand logic. The next night I woke up again at 2:32 and heard kids playing. I also started getting a weird feeling near a built in piece of furniture. Like i didn’t want to open it. Next night I wake up at 2:32 and hear kids playing above me. Rolling a ball and running across the floor. I get a creeping feeling and don’t want to roll over to face the built in dresser. It feels like someone is right there next to me in bed and they are not a happy spirit. That happens every night I am in that room. I start to get creeped out that I have to go to sleep before everyone else in the house and have to sleep with the window fully open so I can see the church (I’m not very religious). Then on the last night we are there I wake up at 2:32. I hear what sounds like someone standing up after sitting in a tub.   After we all leave the apartment I shared with my sister what happened for the two weeks we were there. She tells me on the last night she thought she heard someone taking a mop out of a bucket. (Same sound) and that once when she used the bathroom after washing her hands she left only to find that the water in the sink had been turned on again. She turned it off, and it turned on again.   We decided to share with our mom our stories. And the night both my sister and I heard the water sounds my mom woke up to some woman standing at the end of her bed frantically speaking to her in Italian. With three of us experiencing something we decided we weren’t all crazy but that it really was a haunted place.
Just creepy, not in my dream, wake up moments: 2 nights ago I thought I heard a male voice, my husband I was assuming, say my name loud at about 3am. He’s dead asleep, tv not on, was in a different dream when woke. 2 other times I swear I woke up to a person right over, next to  my side of the bed, and the other time the figure was by the closet staring at the bed. And I don’t believe in ghosts, so ick.
I once had a dream that I was in the middle of this forest sitting my a fire with this young woman who was supposed to be a fortune teller or something. We were talking and I kept asking her if she could answer my question. I don't know what the question was supposed to be I just know I wanted an answer. It was like we were friends kind of joking around teasing each other and I kept asking "okay but really I want to know!" Then all of the sudden she got super serious and said "okay, do you really want to know what's going to happen?" I said yes and she leaned in close, smiled kind of smugly and said "you are going to wake up and find out this was all a dream" Then I immediately woke up. It gave me goosebumps. I still don't know how to process that.
We lived in a 120 yr old Victorian manse.  My brother said his room always had a cold spot, there was no explanation for this cold area (an inside corner).  After we sold the house we stopped by once to talk to the new owners.  Their young daughter sleeps in the room that was my brothers, and she has said that she sees a fat man in a suit in the cold corner.  Also, one night the woman was woken by insistent whispering in her ear.  When she got out of bed she found her toddler at the top of the stair case.
This made me laugh 🤣🤣🤣
This is like very weirdly spooky!
Ummm what!!!! Creepy and I would never be able to listen to lullabies without being creeped out
Woahhhh!!!! Shit that is Scary!!!!!
Ohh man!!!!! This is one scary goddamn experience!!!!!!
Great I hopped it would brighten someone’s day lol.
It didn't seem malicious... I'm pretty sure I've been haunted my whole life.  Bunch of weird experiences especially after my coma as a pre-teen
I wish more then anything I was making it up. 😰
Haha yeah writing it all out still gave me the creeps
Haunted your whole life!!!!!!!! Share more experiences would love to hear them
You didn't experience that again tho?
When I was a child I had an not so imaginary friend named Aroushia (Ah-roo-She-ah)   There weren't many stories told to me about this period but one or two had some interesting twists.   Like mom told me no about having and cookies. They sat on the top of our fridge and at the back of it. In a screw lid cookie jar.   She left me for about 5 mins she said.  Came back and I had a cookie. We were the only two home. Cookie jar wasn't moved, lid tight and I was small enough that there is no logical way I could have quietly gotten to it.   When asked how...I said Aroushia helped.
So, that was 2 nights ago. Last night I woke up SCREAMING and sweaty. I couldnt remember anything else or why I was screaming, but my heart was RACING. 😰 Freaking terrifying..I cant say they are connected, but neither of these things have ever happened before, ever. I'm really hoping its all just stress..... 😰😰
😳😳🤯🤯
It almost sounds like you've been haunted by a loving nanny.
Ohhhhhhh godddd!
I have more... but I'm going to bed for the night. Another time another thread.
We just figured it was a relative. Loved ones coming to see the little bundle.
Lol thanks, now I'm all scared!!
It is just stress don't worry!!!!

Hi!! my name is Isis, I'm 25/F from México.  A few days ago while camping I had an accident, therefore I'll have to spend several days in bed. This has motivated me to practice my English and help other people to practice their Spanish. Also to understand about reddit since it seems a bit complicated to me.  Well, I'm marine biologist, and i love plants and gardening, I love being outdoors and walking a lot!!! I also like cooking a lot, learn recipes and increase difficulty level.  I really enjoy suspense and horror movies and series, listen to music, mainly jazz, progressive rock and baroque.   One of my main hobbies is swap postcards and candies with people from all over the world, that's why this community seemed interesting to me.  Sometimes I have insomnia, if this is your case, you can write to me and we can talk.  Also if you want to practice Spanish or just speak things in common  Excuse me if my grammar is not very good, I am learning.!!!

Hola Isis! Estudié el español en la universidad y por un año tuve un trabajo en que lo hablé con clientes cada día, pero cambié el trabajo hace seis meses y no uso el español frecuentamente.

Now I work with plankton and algae, they may seem more boring but it has its interesting part. Plakton sometimes look like snowflakes under the microscope  **❄️**  **❄️**  **❄️**
Thank you so much!!! Of course I would like a postcard from Canada! we can swap! I'll go to the post office this monday!!!
Qué alegría !! conozco esa música y me recuerda mucho a mi mamá!!
Siii!!!  Well what I most enjoy about nature is the feeling of wildness althougth I must admit that returning to the comfort of my home I also like a lot.  Happy to know about your cat,  I have a cat too, is called  Niño Erasmo, he is not a Mr, because Niño means kid or  child.   I also work with childrens, mostly in vulnerable and marginalized áreas. I work in an art program focused on preventing childrens from being part of crime. Sometimes I have had to work with special needs childrens and it requires a lot of patience, I admire youe labor
Thanks for your words!!
Yeii!! Que se sienta el poder mexicano!! Saludos!!!
Actualy, I found RAOA through RoAC!! I love it! Thank you!
Hi Thank you!! I  like my area, but i' cheating marine biology with botan xd But marine biology has fun things like diving, going to the beach a lot and sunbathing, besides that there are many things to discover
Hello!!!  I think "Rosemary's baby" and "Carrie"  but idk if these movies are classified as horror. Do you like these movie categories?  what are your favorites?
Hi!! Thank you!!!
Hola!!! No tengo receta favorita, pero me gusta hacer salsas!!!  A veces me invitan a fiestas y me piden que yo lleve salsa, espero no me inviten solo por eso.  Mi salsa favorita es:  Tuestas (calentar en sartén sin aceite) ajonjolí,  chile de árbol y almendras. Después lo licuas con aceite de olivo, mostaza, sal y pimienta. Queda una salsa picante que dura mucho tiempo a temperatura ambiente.
Oooh, that's so cool! I didn't know that about plankton. I have an uncle who is a marine biologist. He used to work with stingrays.
Awesome! :) PM me your details when you can, and I'll make sure to get it ready!
Tu mama esta tan chevere.
When I got my cat his name was J and he told me that we can change it so he added Mr. To it and now hes Mr. JJ lol I wonder Ful the type of work that you also do is it painting drawing is it on easels what type  of arts and materials do you use?
Haha yah, same thing happened with me! 🙂🦕
As Above So Below really scared me! I thought the new The Color Out of Space was really good too.
Ah estoy segura que no te invitan sólo por las salsas ;)
I hope he has never been injured by a stingray, it is very painful!!
how did you start to like that music ??? I love playing that music at parties 🎶🎵🎶
>When I got my cat his name was J and he told me that we can change it so he added Mr. To it and now hes Mr. JJ lol I wonder Ful the type of work that you also do is it painting drawing is it on easels what type  of arts and materials do you use?  I like how Mr. JJ sounds!!    We work printmaking, keeps kids very focused, now what we do is turn their work into postcards
I read the synopsis of both and was interested, I will definitely watch those movies
Thankfully he hasn't been! Have you been injured by a stingray?
Especially "Caridad"
When I was 8, I saw them on TV between cartoons in a series called Menudo on ABC. I fell in love, fast. I've been a huge fan ever since. As I got older and we often visited family in Florida, I got to watch shows like Siempre en Domingo and Super Sabado Sensacional and buy magazines like Eres which were extremely rare in Massachusetts. That's how I discovered other Latin artists. Also, record shops in Florida contributed greatly. We finally got Univision in the 90s then Telemundo.
Wow very impressive!! If you can ide love to see some work,you must be very proud!!🤗🌻
Not yet!! But a friend :( People say you must pee on the wound to calm pain 😅
Thank you so much! I have an instagram account for that project, but I have a few photos, the account is buzon.nomada! You should also be proud of your work, I would be happy when you need it or I to share tips for working with childs!
I've actually heard that before. And in the show Friends, that happened with a jellyfish sting.

What a great gift!
Awesome :D I’ve been so into Minecraft lately, I’m sure my friends are tired of me 😂 Let me know if you need tips or just wanna talk about it (or anything else too) :)
Wow, that's so cool! Hope you have fun!
Absolutely love minecraft and I hope you enjoy it!!!
wow! this is awesome! have fun :D
I’ve had minecraft on the pc since the beta (does that make me old yet?) but I could never get into it. Is it more accessible on the switch/in general nowadays?
ive got a couple pals who play on xbox but i think i can play with them somehow?  im gonna play around with it a bit first see if i can figure it out but any tips and tricks would be muchly appreciated!! ive never played 😅
this is actually my first game so I'm not sure how it compares to pc but im tempted to get it on pc if i enjoy it!  i havent played at all yet as im unsure where to start 😅
Ah cool! Well maybe let me know how you get on as a complete newbie? My problem is that the beta was very open world, there wasnt much direction and so I couldnt figure out what to do. It seems like kids these days pick it up really fast, so maybe with 10+ years of changes I could change my approach haha

[closed, picking someone soon] Hey guys!  I'm having a contest because I'm feeling a little crummy today. We just lost someone in my family. Well, family-ish. She was a close family friend, and I consider her my "Jewish Grandma". I've never been close with any of my grandparents, so she automatically became the 'Grandma figure' in my life. She was the kindest person I've ever known and easily the one of the smartest, most well-read, and most compassionate. I miss her very much, but I feel a small bit of relief knowing that she's no longer suffering. We're having a Shiva online tomorrow, and I know I'm going to be blubbering like an idiot. She was always so curious and kind to everyone she met, and she gave back to her community constantly.   This contest is for Halina.  Rules:  1. DBAD. 2. Ends 10pm, Pacific Time. International friends, welcome.
Oh no... I’m so sorry for your loss!! Sending soooo many hugs! My condolences to your family!! You know, I’d bet that Halina was super proud of you for who you’ve become and will continue to watch over you and protect you. In the meantime, is there anything we can do to uplift your spirits??   Hey guys, we have a friend in need, let’s send hugs and love!  u/mimooshka u/gdarn16 u/purpleteasoul
I’m very sorry for your loss, if you need a shoulder to lean, I’m here. Rest in piece,Halina 💛 a beautiful name for a beautiful person. Sending you and your loved ones lots of love, u/gooberdawg
Sorry for your loss, my condolences x
May her memory be a blessing.  Would it help to pull out some photos to share on the online Shiva? I’m not Jewish so I don’t know if that’s okay. I find when I’m sad pulling out photos helps bring good memories or fun stories to share.   Sending you a masked up hug.
Please bear with my long read. Did not mean to write so much.   My deepest condolences to you. Everything you said resonated with me. I've never had the opportunity to be close to my grandparents because they lived in different countries. They never made an effort to see me or my brother but could easily fly over to our other cousins half way around the world. Whenever I'd see people with grandparents, I'd be jealous and wish for the chance to have something like that.  One day, I met the grandmother of a family friend whom I was close with. I could listen to her talk for hours about what things were like back in her day, and I would love to spend time with her. I've enjoyed every moment of it during these last few years. However, she recently got diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It is clear that she isn't going to be around much longer. It's gotten so bad that she can barely remember me and has totally forgotten about my parents.  Yet, I'll never forget the most important words she told me during one Christmas. She said "I know that I won't live much longer. And I don't want you to be sad about that. It's inevitable and I feel as though I've served my purpose. My purpose was to take care of my children and grandchildren whom I love dearly. When I'm gone, I don't want them to suffer and feel sad for me. I want them to cherish the memories and experiences we shared. To remember me through those special moments means that I'll always live on within them". I know this may not matter to you but I feel as though those words are so incredibly important. They've taught me a lot about acceptance of our fate in life. I know this won't comfort you but I hope something resonates with you. If there's anything I can do to distract you or make you smile, even for just a bit, please let me know.  For Halina ❤️
I'm so sorry for your loss. Sending huge hugs 🤗
Sending big hugs your way!
Ugh I’m so sorry friend ... my thoughts are with your and you’re family :::bighugs::::

I'm so sorry for your loss. I'll say the mourners kaddish in her honor tonight.  And while I am 28, I've been told that I act very much like my own Jewish grandmother, so next time you need someone to tell to you put on a sweater, give you a matzo ball soup recipe, or tell you how you have a shayna punim, feel free to PM me and I will do my best to channel my grandmotherly side!  Edit: I had the wrong prayer in there at first
I’m so sorry for your loss. Sending love your way 🧡
I am so so sorry :( that’s just heart breaking. *hugs*
So sorry for your loss! 💙 My grandma died when I was 8. I don't remember a lot from my childhood but I do remember I loved her so much. About once a year I still have a good cry because I miss her. But I know she's with me in spirit, just like your Jewish Grandma is with you. Sending you prayers and positive thoughts.
I’m so sorry for your loss :( if you need someone to talk to, my DM’s are always open!  I hope you can get some sort of closure with the online service. It’s not like being there in person, but at least there will be interactions with loved ones to help get through the difficult time together 💞
I'm sorry for your loss. My condolences.
I’m so sorry for your loss! Rest in power, Halina.

I’m so sorry for your loss of Helina. I believe she will visit you in dreams and will guide you through your life. I know my guardian angels do.

I’m saving for a ring with ashes in though   My thoughts will be with you x. X
I wish you all the peace in the world, and I wish Halina's memory and good deeds will endure forever.

I’m sorry to hear of your loss. I recently lost my grandma too. I’m always at odds when someone who has been suffering passes. Because I’m glad they’re no longer suffering. My grandma is definitely doing better now. I hope yours is too.
I'm so sorry to hear about you losing such a dear loved one. She sounds like she was a truly incredible woman. I had a "grandmother-in-love" kinda like you described. She was also an amazing lady, and I miss her and her advice dearly. Sending you and your family Love and Light.
Sorry for your loss. I'm glad you had such an awesome Jewish Grandma.

I’m sorry for your great loss. She sounds like she was a beautiful person. Rest peaceful Halina.
Oh I’m so sorry. It’s okay to blubber over it, I hope you’ve got lots of good memories to remember her by.
I'd love to hear a story that you love about her life, I find remembering the good,happy,funny,silly,akward ect makes it easier for the soul, I'm very sorry for your loss
I am so sorry for your loss. Someone doesn't have to be a blood relative to be a family member. If she felt like family to you than she was family. Plain and simple. I hope that the Shiva brings you peace and comfort and that you are able to find camaraderie in your grief through it. If you would like to share a story, or talk about Halina please feel free to message me or comment. I'd love to hear more about her.
Oh no! I’m so sorry for your loss. Hugs
I'm not entering. I just want to wish you my best. I'm sorry for you heartache and I hope you find some comfort with the online Shiva, and I hope you are able to connect safely with loved ones.
Blubbering like an idiot is okay when you are remembering someone, I did it for hours and I started to feel guilty for it, dont feelnguilty. Your grief is your own, and you do what you need to. Honor her memory <3
So sorry for your loss.  Just try to remember all the amazing things she taught you.  Sending hugs for you.
💝 So very sorry for your loss. I was told once by a good friend when I broke down to her about someone close to me passing, "love is love. It may not be "romantic" love, but loving someone is our greatest gift".   So, my friend, love is love. It may not be romantic love, but loving someone is our greatest gift.   Take all the time your heart needs. That will keep her love alive. ❤
I will hug my nana a little tighter this weekend. I am so sorry for your loss
My deepest condolences on your loss.   We lost my uncle last year and couldn't fly to attend the funeral. No one set up a Zoom shiva for family so there's no closure for most of us.  May she send you signs in the months ahead so you know she's watching over you.
I am so sorry. It is okay to be sad. At least for a little while allow yourself to be sad. It will be okay.
So sorry foe your loss. Sending hugs!
awww i'm so sorry for your loss! I'll be keeping you in my thoughts during this difficult time💙
I’m so sorry for your loss. Family doesn’t always need to be blood related, sometimes the people we meet along the way are the most important and feels even more like our true family! Wherever Halina is right now, I bet it’s lovely and she is sharing her compassion and care with everyone else. ❤️
i'm so sorry for your loss, she sounds like a beautiful person. i lost my grandma a little over two years ago and it's a pain unlike any other. sending all my love your way ❤
Sending you positive vibes. u/coffeegator21 will too I’m sure
I am so sorry for you loss. I have had somebody like that in my life, a person who just comes out of nowhere and fits in your life in a way that you never realized you need. It hurts like hell when you lose those people. Sending big hugs to you and strength to get through tomorrow.
I'm so sorry for your loss. She sounds like a wonderful woman. My condolences to you and all her loved ones.
Hey!! I hope you've taken time to grieve your way! Everybody is different. Don't let anybody tell you how.  I could send you a crazy card filled with nonsense. Just pm me.  As for feeling crummy I'm glad you reached out to a community for huge hugs!!
Sending you some love. I know Halina is with you and will always watch over you. Big hugs! 💞
I don't know what DBAD means but I DO want to say I am sending best wishes and hugs! It sounds like she had a great life and was very blessed to have you in her life!
I lost my like a grandma last summer and the pain of losing someone like that is so hard. I’m sure she must have rubbed off on you and made you into another kind and generous person. Sending gentle hugs.   Rest easy, Halina.
I'm so sorry for your loss💗 sending you hugs!
I’m so sorry for your loss. I’ve lost all my grandparents and cherish the memories I have of them all. I’ll be keeping you in my thoughts tommorow. Sending you virtual hugs and prayers! ❤️

I'm not entering but I just want to express my condolences for your loss and let you know I'm here if you need to talk 💙
So very sorry for your loss ... 😔  Those we love don’t go away, they walk beside us everyday. Unheard but always near, still loved, still missed, and very dear.

I’m so sorry to hear this. I hope you’re able to find some comfort and piece. She sounds like a lovely person and I’m so sorry for your loss ❤️
I'm so so sorry for your loss! Halina was a wonderful person!
I'm so sorry for your loss! I know how hard it is with the combination of emotions. You're sad they're not here for you anymore, but at the same time, it's hard watching them suffer. It's nice that you're giving back to your community in her memory. It's a sad time, but I hope you can remember and celebrate her life instead of focusing on how she was toward the end. I hope tomorrow isn't too hard on you. This is an amazing and caring community, so I hope it helps knowing people are thinking about you!
I'm very sorry for your loss. Nothing I can say can make this any easier for you but just know that this community loves and supports you through this.
I'm so sorry. I lost my last living grandparent right around Christmas. Mourning is hard, especially right now with so much stress going around. *Hugs* best wishes for you.
May her memory forever be a blessing and comfort to all whose lives she touched.  We lit an extra Shabbat candle for you in her memory tonight.
Sorry for your loss. It's always hard to lose a loved one very kind of you to host a contest in her memory. I hope the shiva goes smoothly
I am so sorry for your loss! Best wishes to you and your family during this difficult time 💜
I'm so sorry for your loss, family friends that are family are such a big part of my life as well that I would understand how devastating it would be to lose any of them. It seems you have amazing memories with the wonderful Halina. Cherish them and she'll never feel too far. Thinking of you XOXOX
I am so very sorry for your loss. Family is not only blood, and she was your family. It sounds like she had a profound effect on your life and that you are a better person for knowing her. That is a heavy loss. I know words are not the comfort we would hope they would be, but I want to send you all the love I can. You have described what a wonderful person she was, thank you for sharing Halina with us. 💚💚
I'm so sorry for your loss! I lost my Grandma last year and my Great Uncle during the summer, and I can't imagine the agony of losing a Grandma right now during all this!  The world will be a darker place without her. May her spirit of kindness live on through you.
No matter who you lose, blood or not, it’s always hard. Please grieve at your own pace.💕
awww, rip. i can relate with not being close with my grandparents. i know how hard it is. because of this, i’m thankful for my godmother. she is like the grandmother i never had.
I am so, so sorry for your loss. ❤️
😭 I’m so sorry, she sounds like such an amazing person. I’m so glad that you were able to meet her and find out how amazing she is. I’m certain she loved you so much, just as how you loved her.   Even though I can’t even imagine how you’re feeling right now, I remember how badly I took my maternal grandfather’s death. I was in denial for a long time, but when it hit me that he was actually gone, I broke. But I feel so blessed having known him for the amount of time I did. I’m sure you feel similarly. Keep your memories with her alive and remember the best parts, though it’s bittersweet, I’m sure she knows how much you love her and maybe she’ll know when you think of her.  I hope that the shiva goes well and you don’t get hit too hard. Stay strong. You will get through this 💜 if you ever need an ear or shoulder, you can always come talk to me if you ever feel the need.
I'm so sorry for your loss. Hugs to you. May she rest in peace.
I’m sorry for your loss. I hope the Shiva is beautiful.
I so sorry for your loss, she sounds like an amazing woman, who will always be in your heart <3  Sending lots of love and hugs your way <3
I'm so so sorry for your loss 💗
She lives on in your memory! Do something that she really enjoyed.
Im sorry for your loss :(
I’m so sorry for your loss. I lost my own Jewish Grandma many years ago and they will live on in our memories. This song quote really gets it: “And you were a presence full of light upon this earth And I am a witness to your life and to its worth”

I would go to the future. We know, more or less, what has happened in the past. Plus, I am a woman so I wouldn’t want to be treated poorly or get sick and die from a common ailment that is now easily treatable. The future is more mysterious and advanced.

I would go back to an hour before my grandpa died and actually make it to the hospital before he died. I was so close last time but when I was 5 mins away he died. I will definitely make sure to go to play a pickup basketball game this time.   [WL](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/UDI588ITV7AE?ref_=wl_share)
I would go back to speak to my biological mother to ask her what time of day I was born. How much I weighed. How long it took. And why I was named what I was named.   [list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/11FDGVCVAGF7H?ref_=wl_share)
I’d go back in time 100 years and buy some property.   So when I come back in time not only would I have money (because imo if you are a property owner you can generate revenue), I wouldn’t have to rent right now. I’d have a yard with a big mango tree and a dog who loves running about  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/4BM8Z0ZUFWGN?ref_=wl_share

I'd want to travel back to meet my dad's mom.  She committed suicide when he was 3. I'd love to meet her... but simply just seeing her is plenty too.
Easy question. I’d go back to one of the days my grandpa took care of me. He’s gone now, but when I was young, my parents both worked for most of the summer.   He would drive an hour and a half to my house (he’d be there before 6 am) to make sure I wasn’t alone all day. He learned how to cook a couple things I liked so he could make lunch for me. We would go on walks, play games, and hang out.   Those were truly the most pure days in my life, and the fact that I can’t see him anymore haunts me. It’s cool though, because I spent a lot of quality time with him!  [wl](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3SM38ZEOIGM6R?ref_=wl_share)
Cool question! If I could go back in time, I would love to meet Betty White when she was in her 20s and just hang out with her and be best friends with her because she is amazing. Also, Betty White will turn 99 on January 17th. And that's pretty freaking awesome. Could you imagine being BFFs with Betty White?? She is a national treasure!

I'd go back in time to 1976-77 and help George Lucas make the first Star Wars movie. I'd make sure he added more female characters from the get-go, and I'd audition for one of them. Also, I'd hang out with some hippies.  Edit: here's my [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/7M9BJ5MU0P3M?ref_=wl_share)!
If I could travel in time I think I would travel back to the summer time when I was like 10. Every day we just would play outside, collect bugs under rocks, jump on the trampoline, make up games and eat ice cream until it dripped down to our socks. Yesterday I said I would travel a few years into the future though, so it flip flops LOL.

Ohh I would definitely go back to the 1920s and go to a proper fancy speakeasy and wear a full authentic flapper outfit and drink bootleg gin and dance the Charleston all night!! 😍😍 One pure night of Prohibition flapper class and debauchery! 🍸  Thanks so much for the super fun contest.

I’d go back to when I was single, and my husband was single, the time BEFORE we met. We’d have about 7 more years together if we’d met then. And we’d each have one less rotten ex. 🤷‍♀️
Oh so tricky to decide whether to go back or forward. But I'd probably go back to the 1920s to hang out with writers like Hemingway and Fitzgerald. I'd love to learn from them if I could.   Thanks for the contest :D [Here's my wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/121SCEPDXA2PZ?ref_=wl_share).
I’d go forward, to make sure my kids grew up happy and healthy. Nothing else matters to me nearly as much as them just having a happy life.   [List](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/148MIPP17NYXE?ref_=wl_share)  Thanks for the contest ❤️

The restraunt at the end of the universe.
I’d go sideways and chose the sister life I might have had. I like my life but I’m curious about all the ones I didn’t have or might have had.maybe that means I’d go back to about 1972.
Oh mannnn I would sooooo love to go back in time only if it meant I could retain even a part of the knowledge I have now so I could re-do so many mistakes in life!! I would go back to middle school maybe? Start from there?

I’d go back in time and do things a little bit differently. I’ve made a lot of mistakes and it’s been a bumpy road. I really don’t want to go forward. Life is flying by way too fast and I’m only 24 😟  [Wishes](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/29QRPEKRV1FB0?ref_=wl_share)  What would you do?
I would go back and experience a beloved memory again. Something involving my grandparents. Or my folks when they were younger. Why is this making me cry?? I blame late_to_join_reddit. Thank you for the contest. [my wishlist ](https://smile.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/27EZZI7HAZRXO/?ref_=lol_ov_le).
It depends if I can come back. If its there and back I'll go forward 10 years to see how this all turns out and plan accordingly.  If it's one way, go back about 10 years and plan accordingly haha.   **https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/2RTC8VZFNN08X?ref\_=wl\_share**

I would want to go back to the 1900s I know it seems insane but the reason is it simply was a similar time yes people struggled but it was before the scandals and drama of the social media and even new outlets I feel that is such an amazing time.  [wishlist ](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1D2NDB9UF47WB?ref_=wl_share)
I think I would travel back to when things seemed more simple. The ideal cottage core life, walking through fields, stopping to read, heading back and cooking.  I reckon it’s early Victorian times in countryside England.   Wish list can be seen here https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2TIU5FMHPCJ7M/?ref_=lol_ov_le
Id go back into the 50s. Everything LOOKED pure. Just good ol fashioned fun. Great upbeat music, neat clothes, cool cars, the hair styles. Just seems lile a grand time frame to be young in.  This is my pamper me list, I need some pampering.   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/55X3RIWLMSF4
I'd go back in time to Ancient Rome- armed with some kind of Latin translation help- and spend some time taking in the art and the people. I'd specifically go back to the early period of Nero's rule, where there was peace and he hadn't lost his mind yet.  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/D695KQRHCATJ
I would want to go back to Egypt when they were building the pyramids to see the amazing feat as it was created.  [list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/D0ED3F0T4VXC?ref_=wl_share)
https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/MUN3KTE8KP4Y?ref_=wl_share   If I could go back or forward in time...hmm dangerous question because we all know that crossing your own lifeline can wreak havoc.  So first I want complete assurance that this is safe, ok?  Lol, but in all seriousness I would go back to the beginning of my own life and this time really pay attention.  Hug the people I love more.  Worry less about perception and more about being fulfilled.  Laugh more with my oldest daughters who got to grow up with a mom who was very very young and very very serious about doing a good job, sometimes to the point of having too many rules.  I'd stop spending so many Saturdays cleaning for hours. Basically i would apply the lessons it took me over 40 years to learn😄
I would go back and spend a day with my grandparents. I know it's not outlandish, but they were such a loving/kind people. I know that's very "Peggy Sue Got Married" but I really would. I'd bake cookies in the kitchen with my grandmother, and putter in my grandfathers wood shop and just feel safe in their love and presence. :)
I would love to go back record Jesus and bring that forward! I'm sure it would be eye opening!!  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1AK35UH3JU9U1?ref_=wl_share
I'd go back to all of the mysteries of the past and just observe how they accomplished what they did. I want all of the answers!  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3UOVFHB1VZZFQ
I would go back to have one more summer or winter with my grandma to make cookies and hang out by the pool with her. She was the best grandma and I took her for granted when she was alive and then she passed much too soon. But I carry her with me everywhere :)  Thanks for the contest [WL here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/4BOQGVVUFJMP)
What a great contest. Thank you for hosting.   If I could I would go back in time to the day before my brother left on a road trip with my niece and take her with me. So she wouldn’t have ended up in cps in a random state where none of the family or friends live. Save her from the pain of having to endure all the suffering and confusion. We are traveling on the 27th to fight to get custody of her so this won’t happen again. Wish us luck. Send prayers and positive vibes.

I would go back in time to when my parents and grandparents were reading us stories at bedtime. Those were cosy and wonderous moments that I treasure. They were all very animated storytellers! [Listlink!](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3ELF1MZ8MK1Y9?ref_=wl_share)
I'm not entering because I'm greedy and want to answer both lol, in the past to watch Babe Ruth play in person because he is an icon and to be at the stadium when men wore suits and women wore dresses to a ballpark would be so weird. I've seen so many things change in my time I would love to fast forward a 100 years and see what it's like because every time I think something can't be improved on it is. Technology and science is amazing!!!
I would definitely go back in time to help a few people who really needed someone to just be there for them.   u/gdarn16 how about you? :)  [WL](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/2VFPTZ592S5I?ref_=wl_share)
Since I'm hosting and such, and many have asked, if I was to go back in time it would be to see my mother maybe try to convince her to stay and tell her all the things she missed and ask her why we weren't good enough to stay alive for (obviously I have some issues I need to work out) and obviously set my family up for the future by buying land, investing in the right things ect. I'd also like to see atlantis so I would probably make multiple stops going furthest back then to my mother and then to the future with a stop in the present to see if or what changed I'd go to the near future to see that my daughter is happy and healthy and the distant future to see if we really do blow ourselves up or if climate change has disasterous affects what happens with technology and also things like psychedelic medicine and plants and if we start going back to what they were ment for and trust nature more. I want to see if we evolve or die out I suppose.
I would go back to January, enjoy the last month before quarantine again, and invest in bitcoin and Tesla lol
I would go into the future! I find it super interesting to know how the world would be like in ~100 years! Will there be new technologies that we could’ve never imagined? How would the world be? I am so curious!  [My wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2R1GRFEJ4XJRP?ref_=wl_share)   Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
Hmm, I want to say I would go back to 1969 (Woodstock) and live my early adult years in the 1970’s and 80’s. That way I’ll get to experience all the best music as it happens. 80’s hair metal is one of my favorite genres, and I’d love to have seen Motley Crue and Skid Row in their prime. 🤘🏻   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2L0YL8HSON615?ref_=wl_share  Thanks for the contest!
I'd go back in time to when I was barely an adult and not just take every job offered to me. I'd want to see if it would help my health issues. My doctor's told me my stress from one of my early jobs is probably what caused my lupus symptoms to flair.

Oh goodness. I’d either go back to being little for a bit so I could spend more time with my grandma and grandpa. Or I would just go back to when I started college and start at a community college to save money!   [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/Y68C0WXOF672?ref_=wl_share)
I would go back in time to my travels to the Azores when I was young and really take it all in and take pictures, explore more, etc.   [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/YX5WLKEYR30J?ref_=wl_share)
Man, that's a hard one because if I go back in time then I lose my luxuries like cell phones and indoor plumbing but if I go into the future, who knows what I'm going to find. Maybe a deserted planet or maybe a different dominant species that eats me for lunch! Haha   I guess going back in time is a bit safer... So I'll go with that.  Maybe just back to the late 60's to the early 70's cuz that seems like it would have been a fun time to be alive while being a young adult. Definitely would have hit up Woodstock! Lol. 😊  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/AMP9LX2PM1A?ref_=wl_share  What about you?  Which way would you go?
I think I would go back in time and hang out with my grandma more! I just miss her tremendously and always want more time!! Thanks for hosting!! [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2Y59YGF7YB3WC?ref_=wl_share)

Depends if I have to stay or not haha. If I couldn't travel back I wouldn't want to go at all! I think I'd like to go back to the 1800's and meet some of my ancestors. I've read some of their stories and I would love to ask them a million questions and let them know that all of their sacrifices paid off :)
I would go back in time because there wasn't covid and climate change wasn't as bad and things were just a little less scary. I could see people who have passed away be alive again. Seems like it could be nice.  [My wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3OVTK2CCUNHHD?ref_=wl_share)
I would go forward in time about ten years to see what my life is like. I wanna know how a couple things work out!  [list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2TRIVCPV2582K?ref_=wl_share)
If I could go back/forward in time, I would go back to the days of the art renaissance, get to see the artists in their prime, witness art at its peak and see all the architecture as it was coming to life, meet the artists and make a circle of pals. If I could come back to this timeline I’d only come back years later, like I’ll age come back to “relative present” and see how things might have changed lol  [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2J14PCPOCXE12?ref_=wl_share)

I would go back. As an addict in recovery I’ve made a lot of mistakes that have gravely affected my life and where I am at today. Might be a few things I would change.

I would go back and see important people from history in person. Specifically Harriet Tubman. Idk if i would be able to talk to her but if i could then i would ask soo many questions. Also I would go back to see a mammoth in real life, dinosaurs too. Lastly, I would wanna go back to see when jesus died and came back, i think it would be something interesting to witness. Theres so many more i can think of 😂 thank you!!  [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/5SOBYLL2FQEL?ref_=wl_share)

Hugs.
giving you a hug, this hit really close to home 💗
Same. I'd go back and realize time was limited. I'd like to go back in time as an adult though, (as I am now) so we could talk adult things. 🙂
What would the worst scenario be for the future ( not including an apocalypse) be for you?
I would love to go to the future mainly to get all the winning lottery number so if I win the jackpot I will share the wealth with all my friends 😂
Forgive yourself, he knows you loved him.
Awww :/ what a precious request. Have you tried looking for her?
AMAZING idea.
That's awesome
You think they would take your future money? Kidding. That's brilliant!
That is a sweet one. ♥️
Awww that's so sweet. <3
Can I come too? Lmao.
Madmen lifestyle? I wanna go back there too... but I want it "Grease Style" lmao thats all I imagine when I think of the 50s
I'm sure he would have loved that.
I feel you. My dad wasnt a hugger and didnt share emotions (no i love yous and such). But I took care of him when he was failing. And he surprised me with a hug, a thank you and an i love you. It was awkward but im glad I got it as I was feeling unappreciated by the family for my hardwork.  He told to "come here" and did the motion thang. I thought he was gonna tell me a secret. He just kept saying closer... closer... til I got close enough for him to hug me. So it was awkward way of receiving it because it was so strange of him to offer a hug.   But it means so much to me. I, too, wish I could go back and it not be an awkward acceptance but hey!
Awwww! Sending you a big hug!!!
Bell bottoms or leisure suits?
Pretty sure my mom still has them in her closet.
Winning lottery numbers 😁
AGREED!! 🙌🙌🙌 omg, soooo agreed!!
Damn! I really feel that! My dad is a conspiracy theorist, but I literally have no clue what triggered it! It’s so weird cause it gets so tense when we show even a shadow of doubt
What would you do aburdity wise? Like merlin in sword and the stone?
LOL that sounds fun
Oh that would be SO cool, good idea
That would be awesome to see the original dark rides that were so advanced back then and just knowing that 60 years later people would still appreciate them!
What would you say to her
Damn this hit me a lot harder than I expected it to. I miss my grandma. The latter part of her life was filled with the effects of Alzheimer’s and she wasn’t herself. But tbh, if I had another day with her it wouldn’t matter if it were an Alzheimer’s day when it was stressful and sad, or a wonderful day when she made nice things for me to eat when I was truly a kid
I just said something similar! Your grandpa sounds like an amazing man.
99?! Jesus!! That’s awesome!! And she’s in such great condition, too, right?! It’s amazing!
Betty white is a treasure
Awesome!!! Might as well bring a phone with a headphone jack and make them solemnly vow to never remove it lmao
Don't forget a solar charger!
Would you stay in the past if you got the part?
Oh man I miss childhood. What a good time.
That sounds like SO much fun! Your idea is the bees knees.
This is such a great answer that I wouldn’t have thought of.
What would you do if you found out unsavory information? 🤔🤔
What would you ask him?
Would you really though? What would you want to see?
Would you try to see other parts of the world at that time too?
Like in doctor who?
Hitchhiker's Guide! Awesome.
Back in time or into the future? u/pm_ur_uterine_cake u/noimnotsally u/so_appalled_
Nothing!! Because I would lose out on one of my kiddos!! They are far more important to me than anything!!  Except maybe just maybe I would go back to 2003...... Undo that one mistake..... But then I wouldn't live where I'm living right now..... 🤔 I dunno.
What about you guys?  u/purpleteasoul u/neongreenpurple u/AoiOkasan
Haha thats a good place to start! I’d probably even go as far as to say starting from 5 years old or maybe since sperm days I’ll tell that X chromosome to reabsorb or not to swim as hard lol
Go back in time or forward? u/Johnwoods1023 u/mimooshka u/gdarn16
/u/PlantJunkieCass /u/mrsscienceman  how about you two? Forward or back??
id go back in time.. and do a lot of things differently. i learned a lot of lessons and learned to trust and not let my fears control me. i did so many things on impulsive !!!! and made me feel awful. i would go back about two years.

Ahhhh I feel you!
Awwww this is such a sweet comment :)
Haha imagine traveling in time and not being able to go back. You are now just part of that era
Haha that’s not a bad idea!
Gosh let us know when that is
Great idea haha
😳😳 but the Great Depression!! ....lol as if we didn’t live through 2 already 😅 it would definitely be an interesting era to live through. I wonder so much about the past
Large hats and hoop skirts, lace doilies, and chamomile tea.
Would you participate in the toxic fish ceramonies?
Would you visit other areas? Rome? atlantis? What if it really was aliens?
Oooo that’s a good one!! I’d like to know how they were created, too!
That's beautiful
Wow.... that is just such a difficult situation
I am manifesting that everything will work out and in the end it'll all be worth it. positive vibes and many blessings your way.
Oh my goodness, my heart 😭😭
What would be the worst non apocalyptic scenario for you to drop into the future and see?
Anyone in particular in mind?
I always say I would invest in Lysol and Clorox 😂
and zoom
I just read your comment and we have the same answer! Lol
It's crazy how much stress with mess you up.  Also it'd be nice to go back and tell my doctors what my diagnosis is instead of waiting 15 years to figure it out haha
i miss grandparent time so much!
I get that. I would have liked to spend some time with my Baba when she was young, I bet she'd have been great
Yeah theres some paradoxes to worry about to be sure, but meeting your ancestors would be cool. I'd like to meet my great grandma when she was young and ask  some questions
Awww
Man that’s way cooler than mine
This completely skipped my mind. I would too!! I wanna see king tut and cleopatra in real life.
Thanks
I'm sorry but thank you
Most definitely
Hmmm that’s a good question. A world war, no freedom, restricted societies like North Korea.
Yes! That is a great point!
I hope he does. I was too scared as a kid to say i love you to him.
No. I was a foster adopt. So I knew my birth parents. They just weren’t food parents. That said. I never tried to talk to them even as an adult. I cried when I found out she died. More because of a relationship that could have been but never was. I don’t hate them but they also cause me to panic so I never made that contact. Sometimes the choices we make have consequences for our heart that we never considered
And property was reasonably priced back then 😭
So before I go back, I’d learn some history things. So then I can make a lot of back then money gambling or doing psychic ish. 😅
that's so so sweet and heartwarming 💗🌸 my family is a lot like that too, kind of distant and not very affectionate as well-- it makes me smile knowing that your dad gave you a hug and showed you some affection 💗
thank you!! 💗💗💗
Bell bottoms but mostly cool dresses!
LOL. I meant health-related information :)
Aw, I feel bad for those who agree.
It's exactly the same here!
I would transmute books into real life stories and turn fire into butterflies :P
#DisneyGeek
Most of them anyway. Did you see they revamped Snow White's Scary Adventures so when the park re-opens it's going to be a mix of the original, technology from The Seven Dwarf's Mine Train and a new storyline?
I don't know.  I might not say anything but stare.  Maybe learn her likes and dislikes. She the way she acts,  talks,  laughs,  etc.
Right??? She's wonderful!!
Agreed 100%
“The gods themselves designed it this way and it shall always be!   ...   Also the home button... never lose that!”
Oh yeah! That was a close one!
Absolutely! Gotta keep showing my face for the merchandizing team. No one wants to buy a character whose actress randomly travels the matrix.
What’s your favorite childhood memory?
Thank you! Also: the Bee’s Knees is one of my top favourite gin cocktails!!
Do everything I could to prevent it - provided they were unhappy.
If he really had his nephews killed. It would settle a raging debate.
100% I would! I'd want to see how long I could survive! How badass would I be if I survived living among the dinosaurs???!!!
Lol sort of. More like a paranoid android named Marvin.
Make sure to bring your towel ;D.
Ooooh back in time! I feel like life has already flown by so fast, I don’t want to miss any more 🥺
Oh I think I'm gonna go back in time and i think that i would actually enjoy and appreciate my younger years a lot more than one I actually did. Nice to see you again my friend
Makes ya think, doesn’t it! lol
Ooh, good question. I kinda would like to unmake mistakes, but I also don't want to relive some of those things...
Bwhahaha!!! Omg!!! Yaaaasssssss this is GOLD! If I had an award I would awards you! Take this instead 🥇
Thank you for the tag! I'd definitely go back in time lol. I feel like it would be incredibly nostalgic and nice to experience some happy memories
Hmmm... I would go back to the 18th century Scottish enlightenment with my phone and be hailed as a god.   https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/29J15CH9CI75H?ref_=wl_share  (Am I doing it right?)
Wouldn’t it be awesome to go back and relive some of those moments with the wisdom we have now?! 💕
☺️☺️☺️
Right?! Like what if I got back to the Victorian Era and now I'm property and everyone has cholera? OR I go forward and it's the apocalypse and I can't even use a phone because they're eye-phones or something.
It wouldn’t be easy but definitely something to experience what a life those people Lived
That’ll do it
I'm not familiar with that!
I would love to see Rome as well for the architecture. I an unsure about Atlantis with so many unknowns. I would be open to meeting Aliens if they were really responsible for building the pyramids.
I know. To make the situation worse my nieces mom has a sister that is trying to also win custody. She hasn’t been in her life at all until now. So we have to worry about the judge placing her in the hands of another person that is not familiar to her.
Thank you so much.
It is has been extremely hard. My husband and I want kids so bad and would do anything to have kids and then they treat their precious child like that. So we are trying to keep strong but some days are harder than others.
Food being consumed Jetsons style in a pill form and not being able to enjoy food the way we do now lol
Definitely. There were two specific people. A friend of mine during my early days of elementary school. She was struggling a lot and was suicidal from the age of 11. Back then I was a bit naive and didn't endure enough hardship so I couldn't understand how and why she was feeling the way she was. Even back then, I knew I wanted to help. I just felt powerless.  The second was a boy in elementary school who really didn't like me and whom I did not like at all. Eventually, I even took part in bullying him and name calling, and all that stuff. I knew I was being a douchebag but felt as though it was justified since everyone else took part in it and because I also wanted to be a part of the popular kids lmao. Stupid decision.  Eventually, I saw less and less of him. When we went to high school together something just happened. I reflected on what I did for those years and when I made a club, he joined it. We suddenly had the same interests and viewpoints. We became friends and were quite close. It unfortunately occurred only during my last year of high school. When I asked him for forgiveness back then, he told me he had forgiven me a long time ago. If I could go back in time, I'd slap some sense into my younger self. To see that there was a loyal and trustworthy friend right in front of my flawed eyes.
How cool!!
Yeah, like I didn't have a problem doing work, I've never been very strong, but since my lupus symptoms happened i can't even lift a 25 pound box or crouch on my knees. :( Those used to be things i took for granted and I I'm exhausted and in pain pretty constantly now for no reason. I would love to have avoided that. But since I finally got diagnosed at least i can breath properly and my kidneys aren't fxcked up, since I'm being treated.  Yours is good too, my doctor's misdiagnosed me with less severe stuff a few times. Very frustrating. Not nearly as long as yours though. That sounds terrible. :(
I was thinking this the other day that I’d love to travel back in time and visit with my grandmothers as young women.
Aww thanks! Imagine being friends with these guys! Ahhh I wonder how their art would change from just one change
Yes! Id love to know what they actually looked like!
He knew then and he knows now.
Perfect. I like your plan!
If I come across any more in the bags we took from my late grandparents' home, I'll let you know. I'm working on hats from the 40s now.
What about coats?
Oh yah, that too! Haha!! 🙂
Why!? Don’t feel bad! We live and learn! I don’t know many ppl who wouldn’t want the opportunity to go back in time to avoid things that happened to them! But it made us who we are today, so all we can really do is wonder what it would’ve been like, right? I wish there were multiple parallel universes & in one of them I hope I’m a real bad ass!! Hahah In another, I hope I’m living the dream!! ❤️❤️
And the thing is the conspiracies would literally just appear! Like one time he went to the dentist and they took a mold of his teeth, he came back to tell me that they probably took the mold in order to remake his teeth and put trackers in them or something wild like that. I literally had no idea how to tell him that that was pretty much impossible and why his teeth and not someone else’s
No, at Disneyland or Disneworld?
One thing I'd want to do with my mom is learn her cooking never got to. Sometimes someone will make something very close and I'll just cry
Seriously!! I mean my grams lived to 92-93? But dementia totally set in for her! Good for Betty White!! She’s SOLID!! Love her! She still cracks me up!
YES EXACTLYYYYY 😂😂
So many good ones! My dad used to play Barbies with me all the time and that was fun.
You would systematically alter every single thing by changing even the smallest thing though. Butterfly effect! Small changes could drastically change everything!  Sorry, lol, I love this stuff and thinking about what would happen if we could go into the future. 😊
Ah. Don't forget your towel.
I'd just about kill for a Babel Fish.
Exactly!! But make sure you post it under the original post so you’re entered!!
Entirely too hard actually. Because one change could undo not only the awful but the good bits and lessons too
Ugh!!! I’d love to unmake so many mistakes!! Even if it means re-living those awful moments!! ❤️❤️
Haha thank you! If only 💭
Awww that’s really cool!! ❤️ youre like the first person who would go back to experience the happy memories!! Lol I’m like take me back!! I have sh*t that needs to be undone!! Lol
Ooooh fancy!   Yes - reply to me, but also make sure you click the “view all” and post as your own comment thread :D
yeah :((( would save me from so much pain and heartbreak !!!
OH YEAH! As long as you can go back to your time whenever
Absolutely! I always wonder what else went on during different eras that we don’t know about bc it’s not common knowledge to us, ya know? Or ooohhh what if we got it all wrong??
Romans even used one recreational drug which came not from a plant, but from a fish called Sarpa salpa, commonly known as the salema porgy. hallucinogenic fish that was used as a recreational drug in the Roman Empire
I totally understand. I'm dealing with a potentially similar situation with my step son. Its so hard, especially when it feels like nobody cares as much as you do.
That would be a bummer
Chronic illnesses are the WORST
Thank you. Makes me feel much better
That's awesome!
Coats too! I love the brown sherpa? lined ones.
I agree, I like the multiple parallel universes and wondering.  It seems to me like most people think about going back, but wouldn't actually go back. They think of positive things in their lives that they wouldn't want to give up and erase by going back.
I can see my mom do something like that tbh.  Yesterday we found a  painting I made in highschool. It was a girl holding a slice of pizza. She said she'd love to take it over to her new house but she'd have to paint over the pizza because it's a known symbol for pedos. Like.. it's pizza. She sees stuff in literally everything!
Disneyland. They don't have a Snow White dark ride at WDW's Magic Kingdom.
Do you have any relatives on your moms side that might know them?
Right? She's hysterical!
Aww that is so sweet!
But then even the act of going forward (or backward) in time would alter everything.
Thanks for all the fish?
Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.
I’m willing to take that risk at this point 😂😂
Yeah. There are definitely some different mental health decisions I'd love to make differently, but I don't know if I'd want to relive the things that make those decisions necessary.
😂 😂 Trust me, part of those happy memories will also be knowing how happy I am from changing some shitty things that happened
Oooh yes imagine the stuff we have no idea that went on and I am sure we did get something wrong or it was over dramatically told.
Exactly. Kids have that effect on me. Even if they aren’t my own. I feel very motherly. I hope your situation goes well. I will send positive vibes and prayers your way.
Agreed!
The long suede ones?
I’d totally risk it. TAKE ME BACK!!! Bc what if by undoing mistakes, you get greater positivity in your future? There’s always a risk that your life will turn out worse than it was before, but I’m ok w that!!
Omg that’s so frustrating! If I draw a person swimming to a boat or falling off a boat, it has some religious symbology! Like falling off means loosing faith and swimming towards is trying to have more faith. I just drew a boat and a person just to draw them or for another purpose. Like literally everything has to mean something. Like some hand symbols are the devil. Weird things like that.
I'm in missouri we moved here when I was younger and the entire family is in ny my grandma is very let her rest so I don't have alot of resources unfortunately except memory trial and error. When my mom passed that side of the family distanced from us because it was hard to look at us
True. Even something as simple as choosing to leave 5 minutes early/late could change everything! Super cool to think about. I'll stop hijacking your comment now!! 😂😂😂
Well okay this game go back and decide the change then follow it as all the way through. It is what convinced me that no I wouldn't change a thing.
Then we go back even further to avoid that!
😂😂😂 there we go!! 😂😂😂
Exactly!! History is never what it seems unless we live it!! I wish we could just watch how things were in real time! Time travel and see each era for a bit before moving onto the next!! How cool would that be?
Unfortunately it isn't. We got him out of the situation but they've decided to give him back to her.
Yes the only problem is that I'm vegan so I'd have to find a faux suede one.
Yeah, agreed :)
Sometimes time heals of wounds.  Maybe try to extend an olive branch through a cousin.  Explain that all you want to know is your heritage through food.
And that is why you are the wise one I can talk to about things! 🙂
Maybe...
That what freaking be awesome ...imagine what you could see and do
I have no idea if those were even made, there wasn't alot of vegans around then and if you're bringing it back and it was something from the past does it count as breaking veganism there is a mushroom suede but it may not have been made then.
😁🤗  I love you! 💕
I’ll go with you!
IKR!? Omg what if we could influence the past to make things so much more progressive sooner? I guess we shouldn’t mess w history like that, but you know, I’d still love it 🤣
Love you more!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Aww! 💚💜
Bwahahaha to eternity and back!
Absolutely!! We got this!! ❤️❤️

I used to practice witchcraft. I got overwhelmed by all the research i thought I needed to do to make sure I did everything perfectly. I know that’s it’s more about doing what feels right and there’s no right or wrong way to practice. But I need direction, instruction, guidance. I digress though. That’s not even why I stopped. I had to put away my alter and witchy stuff once I rescued a kitten because I didn’t want her up on the altar, knocking everything off. My biggest issue while I was practicing was trying to find spell ingredients. Working in the zoo field, I now have access to all sorts of exotic ingredients that must hold some power. I’ve noticed a lot of natural witchcraft books on the powers of flowers and herbs etc. but are there any resources for animal centered witchcraft? Or at least a natural witchcraft book that includes animals? TIA. Open to any other witchcraft advice you might have.

Hi!!!  I don't have much experience in witchcraft, but I have worked with ethnobotany for a long time, I am interested in how people relate to plants and designate categories such as medicinal, magical and power.   Regarding your question, you can search for ethnozoology, at least in my country there is a lot of bibliography on ritual uses of animals.   If one day you have any questions about plants and traditional uses, I will gladly help you.
Following this! I'm a follower of Pan, so animal-centered witchcraft would be AMAZING to learn about! I do take care of animals as part of my practice (strays and sick animals, etc.), but I would be so interested in seeing some resources!
Ooh thank you!!
That looks super cool, thank you!
Going to search for ethnozoology right now! Thank you so much!!
Glad to help a fellow witch out
You're welcome! She's got books on herbs and crystals as well, if you're interested
I hope you find what you are looking for It is not witchcraft in the strict sense of the word. But if you can find ritual uses in different communities of the world.

CLOSED. I finished at 12:34 am Monday morning, which is pretty darn close to Sunday night. Thanks for the motivation. Gifting to happen soon.  I am procrastinating. I was supposed to have this project turned in last week. Then I got the deadline extended to today. It's definitely not going to be done today, but if I work hard, I can have it in by Sunday. And yet here I am on RAOA.  Here is your task: Motivate me to get back to work. Tell me about all the books I can read once I have this project turned in, all the mac & cheese I can eat when I'm done, the hordes of adoring fans who, many years in the future, will look back at this moment as the one that launched my career as a cookbook editor.  Yes, folks, you read that right. I am proofreading a cookbook for a dear friend. He is a marvelous cook and is finally, finally, publishing a cookbook. This isn't my main line of work, but I do love nitpicking and I do love food.  Rules:  1. DBAD 2. Motivate me to get to work! 3. (optional) share something you have accomplished despite (or because of) much procrastination 4. use the phrase "mac and cheese" for the raffler  Contest ends when I turn the project in, which will be Sunday evening ET. I hope.
u/late_to_join_reddit \- let's help motivate [u/applesaucefi3nd](https://www.reddit.com/user/applesaucefi3nd/) to go back to work!!
You will just feel so much better once it’s done. I think you go through the cook book to edit and think of one person per recipe that you would gift it to if you could. Who reminds you of Mac and cheese? Who reminds you of whatever else he’s cooking.   I love a cook book so when it’s done share it and I’ll add it to my list
Mac and cheese!  Get back to work! You can do this. Just think of how wonderful it will feel to do all of the things you want to do, without your work looming over you. I know you can just do those things now, but I promise they won’t feel as nice as when you are truly free to do them!
the sooner you are done with work, the more you will be able to enjoy as much mac and cheese as you want! 🌸💗 don't let procrastination get in the way of your goals, you can do it! 🌸 your mac and cheese is waiting for you!
Think of how grateful he’s going to be when you finish! And the sweet, sweet relief you’ll feel having completed it!   I’m a master procrastinator so I have no inspiring stories 😂  Mac and cheese!
Just imagine it now, New York, top ten best selling cook books of 2021, the critics claim that it holds the key to the most scrumptious mac and cheese that ever did exist. The only thing that is stopping these headlines is your procrastination. He will be interviewed on the tonight show and every major news channel, but only if you are able to finish proof reading in a timely manner! His fate, as a chef, as an author, lies solely in your capable yet distracted hands.   The time is now to finish and finish strong!
I finally cooked dinner for the first time in a while. So many baked potatoes in my past :')  If you do your thing now, you can relax as you're working on it :D  mac and cheese !
Mac and cheese   Finish your work! Work hard play hard. After you finish working you'll be so relieved. Treat yourself to a ton of mac and cheese afterwards. You got this!   Even though I procrastinate, I always finish my work before the deadline. It feels great to be done.
I love Mac and cheese! You will fell better when you finish. And, you seem super excited to help your friend achieve a really big and important goal. Maybe think of yourself as the last leg of his relay team. You gotta run your hardest to make sure he not only makes it to the finish line but wins the race. Instead of passing you the baton, he literally handed you his life's work and your job is to run it across the finish line. You git this.  You can do it! You were made for this moment!  I wrestle with procrastination on the regular. I have started time blocking to help me focus. I will set an alarm for 1 hour of solid work. When the alarm rings, I reward myself with a snack, playing with my dogs, surfing reddit, etc. Then, I set another alarm and the cycle repeats.   Doing this helped me accomplish 10 challenging reports in 6 weeks. I also use noise canceling headphones and listen to classical music or instrumental worship music to help me focus.
Imagine how much better that Mac and cheese will taste knowing you got your project done and don’t have to worry about it anymore. And a book will be so much more enjoyable when you don’t have that assignment in the back of your mind.  I totally get it. I am the procrastinator of procrastinators. For the majority of my schooling, I’d put a big project off until a few days before after being given weeks to work on it. I’d frantically work all day every day until it was done, but I’d be miserable the entire time with soooo much anxiety, which you’d think would get me to stop procrastinating but nope. Cause I would still get decent grades on the assignments I threw together last minute. Near the end of college though, i started procrastinating til the day before and stuff started not working out as well for me. The last time I got lucky was when I procrastinated writing a grant proposal (horrible awful things, I don’t recommend it) for my Field Bio class. I put it off til the night before and was absolutely not going to be able to get it done. I was still working on it anyway for partial credit when my laptop crashed and I lost everything (which wasn’t that much, in hindsight). But my prof didn’t know that so when I told him what happened, he gave me winter break to get it done.  Saved my whole entire butt.   Sending some motivational thoughts your way. Good luck, I have faith in you. And if mac and cheese is your special treat, save it for when you’re done, but please make sure to eat something while you’re still working, you’ll need the energy. I have a habit of denying myself basic human necessities as a punishment for procrastinating, but you deserve those always no matter what. So make sure you’re taking care of yourself too. ❤️
You can do this!!! Keep going for the sweet, sweet mac  and cheese ! Let it bring you to the finish line!  Procrastination can be tough and it’s something a lot of us deal with but I believe that you can get through it!   Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
Oh man, I love fried mac and cheese.  Not healthy at all, but super delicious.  :D  When you get done with your project, you can eat lots of mac and cheese and maybe sample some awesome dishes from your friend!  (Ask him to make mac and cheese for ya, hehe!)  Congrats to him, btw!  I try my best not to procrastinate, but it happens sometimes.  I get super frantic when it does, and I have to complete tasks step by step to get myself back on track.  I hate the stress that comes with procrastinating.  :(
Mac and cheese.  Well 1st of all I know how addicting it can be talking to everybody here because for the last 2 weeks 😫I've been up to 1, 2 o'clock in the morning talking to people and I have to be up at 6 7 o'clock the following day to go to work 😳so I'm having a hard time being responsible as well lol    I'll put it this way ...once you're done reading this post turn off your phone focus on the job at hand do it and get it done.   You will feel 100% better knowing that the stress isn't there and the pressure is not there to do the job and get it done.   Then you get to spend all of your time talking to me 😁and talking to all of your friends and then he can come back and talk to me again lol🤭 seriously I know it's not easy but once you turn around and you focus and know that somebody left you in charge to do the right thing get it done, a simple as that!
Mac and Cheese!  This is amazing! I'm so intrigued about this!!  OK so here's how you get back to work! Are you fed? Are you thirsty? Do you have some gentle music playing? Or perhaps dead silence? Is the temp perfect for you? Can you sit by the fireplace? Or have a cup of coffee or tea to warm you?  YOU GOT THIS!!!  Think of all the cookbook lovers out there like me who neeeed to read this book!!!
Holy cow u/applesaucefi3nd!!! GET YO BOOTY BACK TO WORK!!! I NEED THAT COOKBOOK!!!   No seriously, I can’t cook for crap! HELP ME help you hahaha for all of us non-cookers, WE NEED THIS!! Omg especially if there’s a mac and cheese recipe in there!!  Then after you finish you can read a bunch of David Sedaris books to laugh your butt off! You can binge watch so many shows!! I’ll tell ya all the good ones AFTER you finish working   GO GO GO!!! Stop reading these and just gooooooooooo!!! We NEED that cookbook!! Come back after it’s done!!! All the secrets to nirvana will still be here!   Gooooooooo!!
You can either spend 10 hours half-assing the work and having this hang over your head... or you could CRUSH the next 2 hours and then be DONE. YOU WANT IT DONE!!  FOCUS!! GET IT DONE!! ...and then have mac and cheese ;)
First off great raffler word choice. mac and cheese is the best. Also seriously think of how much better you'll feel when this isn't on your mind! Here is what I do when I want to finish something. Break it down into BABY steps. Like if it is a 5 page paper, break it down into:  Intro  Paragraph 1  Paragraph 2  Paragraph 3 etc.   Then between each thing you get done you can give yourself a MINI reward. Light your favorite candle after the intro, you get a piece of candy after the 1st paragraph, you get to listen to your favorite song ONCE after the third, etc. Then when you finish it all you can not only eat mac and cheese, but you can also call a friend, watch a movie, eat endless amounts of snacks. Seriously do you want this hanging over your head ALL WEEKEND?! Or.... do you want to have actual freedom to relax before the new week begins. It is all riding on your choice. So... what do you choose?
If you get it done then I’m closer to being able to buy a copy.  I need some help in the kitchen. Just ask my husband. Lol. So get it done.   Mac and cheese is delicious! Good luck.
You can do anything for ten seconds and then you start a new ten seconds. Whether it is eating mac and cheese, working on a friends cook book, whatever your non preferred project you have to finish is. Sometimes getting started is enough of a push. At the same time. Remember to give yourself some grace. This is a global pandemic where it is becoming increasingly hard for people to maintain focus on tasks they need to do. It is very traumatic right now. So make sure to take a set of ten seconds to check in on you as a person. Hugs.
Get to work!! You can do it! And then you’ll have free time!   Mac and cheese   Yo I just became a lawyer and I’m the world’s biggest procrastinator lmao you can do it
Well the faster you finish proofreading the cookbook... the faster you can use one of its recipes!!!   Hope you enjoy Mac and cheese haha
Bro, the second you finish this project you can have endless mac and cheese. You can have 3 bowls full of it and you can eat it all while reading that book you have yet to finish. Come on now finish this project!!!
Late Sunday final motivation push! You're probably so close to being done! Give yourself some sort of delicious treat as a final congrats! Go get a guilty pleasure like fast food fries, or milkshake, or Panera mac and cheese.. mmm..  Speaking of putting things off, time for me to go do like 3 loads of laundry..
Hey! Oooh that is awesome that your friend wrote a cookbook! What kind of cuisine is it geared toward? (maybe that will help me decide what I want to eat for dinner lol). Thanks for the contest!  You should get back to work because the sooner you do, the sooner your friend becomes a famous chef, and then you will get to go on cooking shows with them on tv as their editor, and eat all the fancy food! And it will be awesome!  I am pretty sure that all of my best college research papers were the ones that incurred an extreme amount of procrastination along the way. lol.  Mac and cheese
Remember once you get your project done you are free to do many things without the guilt that you still have to finish a project looming over you. Think about how you can read your books without worrying or thinking abt the project you need to do, how good the Mac and cheese will taste without the burden/weight of your project and think about how happy I’ll be when you hand in your assignment. Uncreepyly I will be outside your window cheering you on. You may not see me but I’m there. Lastly think about how happy your friend will be when you finished proofreading his cookbook.    I just finished all my homework for the weekend after procrastinating for a solid two weeks. I was procrastinating hard by playing video games. Now I can enjoy my games without having the feeling of guilt.   Mac and Cheese
Imagine all the foods you can read and all the books you can cook if you got this done... I thought that sentence wouldn't make sense but it kinda does lol. Finishing a project is great, think of the feeling you get when you're done with something that you worked hard for! It's not easy when you're still missing half of it, but that's just part of the journey. Keep at it and you'll see the progress build up slowly but surely.  Now that you mention it, I want mac and cheese. Thanks :)
Think about how RELIEVED you will feel once that dang project is turned in! You can rest, breathe, literally do anything other than think of the project once it's done. You can eat cookies for breakfast, jump on the bed, have a nice relaxing bubble bath with a book, binge a new Netflix series, try a new recipe, go shopping, anything! You can do it!  Mac and cheese! 🧀
Mac and cheese. You can do this. I know going back to work is hard I struggle as well. But you gotta make that bread!!
Think how happy your friend will be to have his cookbook close to being done.   I've spent years trying to lose weight but always procrastinated out had some excuse but one year ago I started a new health journey and have lost 50 pounds and I'm going to try and lose another 50 pounds.  Mac and cheese
Mac and cheese is the best! Even though I haven't tasted any...  You must get this work done! If you stop procrastinating so will I! Let's get some stuff done together and afterwards we can have a sleepover where we talk about cute people and eat snacks and binge Netflix!
Eating Mac and cheese is fun!  I always wait until the night before something is due then bang it out quickly, easily and it leaves me puzzled every single time. Why? Because it was way easier than my brain thought it would be and I end up feeling silly for procrastinating. Yet I will procrastinate again!!  Have you read the Discworld series? You should they are bloody amazing!!
Duuuuuude. Get back to work! The sooner you finish it, the sooner you can be free! Maybe tell yourself you can cook one of those fabulous recipes from your friends cookbook when you are done. Maybe some ultra gourmet mac and cheese? A cake? Your career sounds amazing! I'd love that job :)   Once you are done you can kick up your feet, look at cute animal pictures online, binge watch a show, play a video game, take a nap... but until then get your tunnel vision on! Drink some coffee and each time your finish a editing some pages give yourself a hug. Then have some coffee!  Attached is a vintage [Matt Groening funny](https://i.imgur.com/BJyBvjo.jpg) from Work is Hell. I used to have an old coffee mug of his, and it said Work is Hell on the outside, and when you drank to the bottom there was a picture of the rabbit yelling "get back to work!"
Get back at it, so you can stay on track! Earn that mac and cheese and your friend's appreciation. You need this for your new career!
mac and cheese is love  work so you can earn and travel. that's how I motivate myself :P  I got into the doctoral program after much procrastination
Get back to work!  You can do this. When you’re done, we’ll celebrate with some Mac and cheese!
Yo mac and cheese  Work hard everyday for those days you cannot. No matter what you face today there's always a fresh new tomorrow.  Don't clock watch and if you can some quiet background joyous tunes will keep the time forgotten and the day pass fast and fun.
I'm a procrastinator myself. Through the Intellect app I learned that it isn't laziness that causes it. It's the avoidance of discomfort. I'm starting to see through the Matrix code and understand that putting things off leads to major discomfort for me.   Its like someone is putting a bug in your mac and cheese that you HAVE to eat. They will keep adding a bug to it for every moment you put off eating it. I decided to eat a little one now instead of a teeming squirming bowl full later.   Eat the damn bug.
Quick, get back to work! The sooner you do, the sooner you achieve the "I finished my work" achievement in the new dystopian RPG that's sweeping the nation: You Live In 2021!  This achievement comes with bonus health points, all you can eat mac and cheese at Golden Corral, and a five dollar footlong!  I earned my achievement back when I was playing the 2002 version. I procrastinated on doing my Comm 101 presentation, and the night before I sketched a booklet about procrastination with stick figure "Bob the Procrastinator" and how it was running his life. I went to my job at the college bookstore early the next morning and my coworkers helped me mass copy and fold the booklet. I then made a fabulous presentation and got an A!
Get back to work, If you complete your task you can build a tent in the living room, have a mac and cheese competition where you will get to enjoy all kinds of different types. You can take a relaxing bath without guilt. Is there something you really want but feel guilty about it because you just shouldn't? You can reward yourself when you're done, and most importantly your friend will appreciate that you went above and beyond for them and that will grow your friendship even more. Have fun with it, place a gummy bear or whatever small treat at different pages to get to it! You can absolutely do this! Remember to do everything with your full ass don't half ass and procrastinate.
You can do this! Then have lots of yummy mac and cheese! It's best to just hunker down and do it so it's not hanging over your head. Though I completely understand procrastinating.
mac and cheese   He's such a nice boy and you're so good at proofreading, what are you doing putzing around typing to strangers! Come, sit, do your work. When you're done you can plop on the couch and watch TV, read, nosh, whatever you want. Maybe he'll cook for you. : elbow nudge: Huh, huh? Such a punim! Go back to work, bubala.   I'm going to apply for this job I found this morning. Okay? Good.
Oh no, good luck! I hope you get it done faster than you think you will :D Sending you lots of energy to put that pen to paper (or hand to keyboard). Just think, the sooner you finish, the sooner you can...  1. Take a nap. 2. Watch pointless Youtube videos for hours. 3. Read all these contest entries.  4. Take another nap. 5. Eat some mac and cheese. 6. Take a post-mac and cheese nap. 7. Enjoy a bubble bath. 8. Buy yourself something nice.  9. Have a little dessert. 10. Imagine how famous you're going to be one day!  Thanks for the contest!!
I can't...people spend way way way too much of their lives at work/thinking about work/getting ready for work/going to work/checking work on vacations and off times. I'm sorry...I cant motivate you to go to work. 🙃  What I CAN do, is tell you to GO READ 5 CHAPTERS OF YOUR FAVORITE BOOK.   Make yourself mac and cheese. It'll be the BEST damn mac and cheese you've EVER eaten!!! 😀😀😀  Your adoring fans can WAIT while you read and eat mac and cheese! 😍 I've taken a number. 😁😁😁  Mac and cheese 😍
Mac and cheese! Hurry up and do it and you might have some free time this weekend to eat ALL THE MAC AND CHEESE  you want!
Mac and cheese,  is there some in the cookbook?  Lol! Ok when you are done your work you can go to recess.  With a mask on ,  and away from other people.  Frolic and be free, safely!!
Mac and cheese  Think of all the shows you can binge watch once you finish you work. There are so many fun and exciting ones to watch and help you unwind. The sooner you finish you can enjoy the holiday weekend.
Look, the only way you get to turn the pages you want to turn and gnosh the noodles you want to gnaw are to get your ass in gear and do what needs to be done. So do this: set a timer for thirty minutes. Get busy. Work hard. When the timer dings, stand up, stretch, twirl, then sit back down, set the timer and go thirty more.   If you can’t keep from peeking at the internet, send me the link to your router and I’ll set up parental controls for you so that you can’t peek. See how awful that would be?   Okay, timer set? GO!  PS you can do it!   Mac snd cheese coming your way. Leisurely page turning coming at you. Only a few hours of edits away.  Come on...... you got this!
Mac and cheese is one of the best comfort foods. The soft, aldente noodles covered in the rich, gooey cheese sauce. The delicate balance of flavors dancing on your tongue. Maybe there is a crunch of bread crumbs from the coating sprinkled on top, or maybe just a bit of salty bacon mixed throughout. The cheese is hot and bubbly and when you lift that first bite to your lips, there is a string of cheese tailing behind. As it touches your lips you realize that all of your hard work was worth it. The struggle melts away like the cheese the cheese coating these perfect noodles.   I have been procrastinating organizing my home office but last week I did it and it felt so damn good for it to be done. I even organized all of my makeup and art supplies and now it is my favorite place in the house again.

Mac and cheese is great, I would find it to be a good motivator as well! Just think of all the recipes there are yet to be edited by you now (perhaps your friend had one in their book), or almost certainly later in your wonderful career as a cook book editor that starts with this first step! I realize this isn’t your main career focus, but your never know XD
I think that the best way to kick yourself into gear is to first determine what kind of motivation technique you respond best to.  So I’m going to put out a few ideas here :).   * I like to “challenge” myself!  Almost like being in a serious battle against the best competitor I know, myself!  So you can basically take what you have left and say .... break it into a few sections.  If you have 90 pages left to proof, break it down into 3, 30 page challenges.  Set an amount of time that you would normally finish in and then - race yourself.  Take the time you think it would take and then  take away 5 mins.  Then STILL try to even beat that.  I enjoy challenging myself so the prize for me is just doing better than my previous best but totally reward yourself once you beat your own!  * “Cheers to the Freakin Weekend”.  Remember that the faster you can get this finished, the faster that it’s no longer looming over your head.  That sense of urgency that you might have had each day as the deadline got closer - welp, you can just toss that feeling away and enjoy what will be left of your weekend with some wine and Mac and Cheese!  Kick your feet up and if you have Disney Plus or Apple TV, tons of binge worthy items were loaded recently   *Find what gets you really moving and determine what really slows you down. For me, if I need to do spring cleaning in my home or really dedicate myself to something and I want to get it done as fast as possible, I turn on some fun music, turn off the TV, put my phone in another room or upside down, eat something light and get into something comfortable but not too comfy (as in my sleep shorts and tank). Music gets me moving where as my comfy couch w my feet up, a full belly and some mindless TV do the exact opposite.  Once the music is on and I’ve limited all my distractions - I amaze myself at how efficient and fast I am.  # “To Do List” - there’s something about writing down all the components of procrastination in my life, those chores that I’ve put off, those errands that I don’t enjoy - there’s just something about seeing that lengthy list of itemized “un-fun-must-be-done’s” and then watching it be taken over by the red slash marks as I accomplish them in a given amount of time.  I work the list in one of two ways each time (depending on the circumstances - work vs home/personal). For a work “list” I like to think of it as a liver and onions dinner with the best cheesecake ever for dessert.  By that I mean, I do all the big, tedious, yucky and boring things first to get them out of the way... and then I can do the things that are more enjoyable to finish up.  For personal/home “lists”, it’s all about divide and conquer. I find all of the easy and fast items and with those first.  When 3/4th off my list is already crossed out, I feel so accomplished and proud that I ultimately feel that extra push of motivation needed to finish off the list.  # 2 for 1, Get-Er-Done - I generally carry some form of work/chore with me at all times, tucked away in my planner.   I am diagnosed as having A.D.D.  However, I like to believe that I’ve found ways to make life with it, of benefit rather than hindrance (definitely not always successful though haha).   In an average day I’ll often find myself in some sort of situation that requires me to sit and wait or I’ll be doing something and thinking to myself....I could be doing 5 others things right now.  So my remedy to fix that for myself?  The little items in my planner.  When I find myself waiting for my daughter to clock out of work, finish gabbin with her friends and actually get in the car... I’ll take that 15-30 mins to work on or complete one of those items.    I end up feeling good because I was able to accomplish something and I’m not as irritated about waiting around for her instead of her being ready outside.  Another 2-for-1 multi-task that I’ve started doing would be utilizing Siri on my drive home to make those return phone calls or set up appointments.  Traffic is never fun but at least when I’m sitting in one spot for 10 mins - I can knock a call or two out.  My brother used this type of method and lost 20 pounds in 2 months!  He had a virtual class that was around 30 mins during the week.  He decided that he would get on his elliptical during the entirety of the class every day because it would help to keep him alert and would provide some exercise as well!  That being said, if you find yourself in a situation requiring your patience or for you to wait for any time period (for example, waiting for the Mac and Cheese to finish cooking) grab a section of proofing and knock it out.  You’ll be finished with all of the editing and enjoying the rest of your Saturday, Sunday and Monday before you have a chance to realize it!  # “Manifesting That Good Life”  My mother had a go-to “momote” (mom+quote) whenever one of us would say something disparaging or such.  She’d say, “Thoughts are things so make them good”.  I would always just roll my eyes when I was younger but as I started to grow - I found there was definitely something to be said about that bit of advice.   So I’ll end my comment by asking you to do this....  Sit back, close your eyes and picture yourself arranging the final mortgage payment on the house of your dreams.  Now, standing at the island in your state of the art kitchen, enveloped in the aroma of the Mac and Cheese named after you... the Mac and Cheese that started it all!  On the kitchen island, next to your glass of wine, you study the highly compelling and competitive offers from two of the top publishing houses seeking your talent, Penguin Random House & HarperCollins, with a smile.  You decide to nearly tuck the two documents back into your briefcase, finishing your second helping of that namesake Mac and Cheese that started it all.  You head into the living room and sink into your chair, grabbing the newest hardcover NY Best Seller you picked up on your way home this evening.  Cracking open the spine of the book and breathing in that unique scent of the pages within, a smile crosses your face again as you think to yourself.....” thank goodness I busted my a$$ to finish my proofing that weekend so that I could be here now “.
I love Mac and cheese! I managed to finally open up my Etsy shop in December. It’s just a part time side job from my normal full time job. But I’ve made 22 sales in 5 weeks! I decided to just go for it and see what happens, so far it’s been fun. It keeps me busy during my time off! Thanks for hosting! Hope you’re able find some motivation. Just think of the relief when you’re finally finished :)
My favorite way to motivate myself is to think of Future Me. Let’s be honest, she could probably use a break. I mean, obviously I’d rather *not* do The Thing, but that means Future Me won’t want to do it either. And she’s already going to have enough to deal with, so let me do her a favor and take care of this one thing for her.    I can always motivate myself to do things for my friends without an issue. So if I can do so many Things for others, I try to think of Future Me as another friend. It doesn’t always help, but it does give a bit of a different perspective.    Also, think of how many new recipes Future You will have when you’re done! Mmm mac and cheese 🤤
Dude!! You got this!! You don't need all these incentives to do your work because you're awesome and you can do it!! Also we believe in you, i believe in you, the raoa community believes in you!! That being said when you're finished you can go get(or order in) some nice ice cream, and eat all the mac and cheese or anything else you want when you finish!  🧀 ❗❗❗
Get to work and help your friend who is a marvelous cook! Maybe he will make you some gourmet mac and cheese and a token of his appreciation.  I got my bachelors. I would procrastinate the hard stuff I didn’t want to do by getting weeks ahead on the easy stuff. I would rationalize it because at least I was being productive.
Mac and cheese! 🤤  Screw it, don't get back to work and enjoy your evening! Lol. Take a short mental health break and get back to it when you can concentrate better!!   I finished my day early today... Which means I accomplished a full week of work despite having a headache for 7 days now.
Mac and cheese.  For me usually once I get started I get into a roll it's always sitting down to start working that's the worse. What motivates me is thinking about how once it's done you can do whatever you please without feeling bad about not doing your work or worrying about it still needing to be done anymore!   Okay in high school it was my final assessment piece for art class ever. The final semester was shorter than any others due to graduation (we graduated I think four weeks earlier than school would normally finish). I had a good idea for what I wanted to do but it involved using paint I had bought myself and I really couldn't be bothered bringing it into school and carrying it around all day. Plus if I worked on the painting in class I'd have to leave it in the room and then come grab it at the end of the day to take it home so yeah not enticing. There were two parts to my final artwork. The main painting and then a bunch of drawings of hands. So I spent every class working on practise runs/experiments for my painting or drawing the multiple hands and cutting them out. My teacher was worried to say the least lol. I'd been enjoying the procrastination life so much I never started the painting at home. It comes to the week before it's due.  That weekend we had a public holiday on Friday so it was a long weekend. Naturally I left the painting all week ready for the long weekend lol. I do the painting in a those three days at home. I set up my final artwork and take photos of it. Hand in the photos.
If you get to work, the proofreading will end sooner! And then you can eat some mac and cheese!  Thanks for hosting!!
Mmm! Reading a bunch of food recipes sounds like a good way to get hungry!   So hungry that you can eat up those grammar mistakes! Yummm!   I do not blame you for missing mac and cheese, but hopefully somewhere in there there is a delicious recipe to fulfill your hopes and dreams!   I literally procrastinate everything the last time I completed a project was.... I can’t even remember! All I know is I’m currently doing many projects to procrastinate the most important one 😂
mac and cheese   My house always gets really really clean around deadlines. "I can't work on this essay if my bathroom is dirty". "I'll just take a 5 minute break and wash all my laundry" I am a shady bee.  But think of how happy you will be when you're done! And how happy your buddy will be! And once you're done, there will be no more stress from not doing it.  And the faster its done the faster it can be published, and then you'll have bragging rights. You'll be my cool friend who helped publish a cook book! And then you can reward yourself with mac and cheese or ice cream. Also remember the dinosaurs were procrastinators and they DIED
Ugh, I have such a hard time with motivating myself to start tasks like these. Once you get started and get the ball rolling,  it will be so much easier to finish.   Think of how happy both you and your friend will be when you're finished proofreading. And yes, you'll be able to eat all of the mac and cheese you want!!!!!  Seriously. Stop reading this comment. Get to work 🙈😉
Mac and cheese ! I promise I’ll send you the recipe for my grandmother’s Mac and cheese AND send a picture of my dog, who responds when referred to as Macaroni (their name is Mack). JUST. GET. TO. WORK. FIRST.
Mac and cheese  The sooner you get done proofreading the cook book, the sooner you can start reading a cook book about... mac and cheese!  https://www.amazon.com/Mac-Cheese-Cookbook-Homeroom-Restaurant/dp/160774466X  I’ve been a couple of times and have had catered lunches from there the restaurants and it’s legit.  Good luck and thanking for posting a creative contest!
Get that cute little butt in gear, ya wee nut. Go on and git that work done!!  I once procrastinated finishing packing to move until moving day. That went about as well as you’d expect. 🙄  TFTC!! Good luck!!   Ps now I’m craving mac and cheese.
Do it for your friend! They’re relying on your expertise!  mac and cheese
I know how getting into gear can be but once you’ve started it’s just downhill from there! You’re a very great friend to do that:)  Mac and cheese !
Awh that’s kind of fun. Well if you love food enough you should finish this proofreading and you’ll get to enjoy some yummy Mac and cheese!    Something I’ve accomplished despite all the procrastination is actually finally putting all my Christmas decorations away. It’s so annoying lol but it’s done until next year. It’s fun putting them up but I hate taking them down and boxing them up.   Good luck and hope you finish soon :)
I believe in you! Just think of all the time relaxing you can have after this project is done! You can treat yourself to your favourite meal of Mac and Cheese, watch your favourite show, and have a well earned nap! But you cant do that till the project is turned in! Come on you can do it!   I've just submitted my final essay for this term, despite being the worlds biggest procrastinator, so I believe in you to do the same!
I know it might be hard but once you start, time will go by really fast when you're focused. Think about all the fun movies, games and books you can get into once this is over! It'll be worth it thats for sure.  mac and cheese
Your friend could use all your kind words and criticisms so he can fine tune his mac and cheese recipe! What will he do without you
The quicker you work the quicker you can lose yourself in a book world and to the bottom of the mac and cheese mountain.
Mac and cheese!  You are so close to being finished with it! You just need to push through a little longer! You've got this and then you can celebrate without guilt!
You got it!! I’m on it!!! ❤️❤️❤️

Ok!
Heyyyy!! Thank you for inviting me! I accidentally put my response here but I’m fixing that as I type lol
That sounds amazing! My family has Italian roots, and we cook a lot of Italian food. Vegan Italian food sounds interesting!

So, I need brainstorm help! I have a group of friends that I play trivia with on zoom just for fun. Tomorrow's trivia topic is Broadway expert level! I LOVE Broadway, and I'm super stoked. But, I don't know a wide variety of shows, and I am usually not a huge help to my team.  I really want to "study" so I can help my team more tomorrow. My friend who asks the questions is an actor on Broadway and knows EVERYTHING! lol. Can anyone suggest shows, soundtracks, songs, or actors for me to "research" and learn more about? OR does anyone know any obscure Broadway trivia fun-facts?
The Fantasticks is the worlds longest running musical! (42 years)
Hmm some good classics to know are Rent, Les Miserable, Chicago, Cats, Phantom of the Opera, Wicked, Cabaret and obviously Hamilton. Idina Menzel was a really popular broadway actress in recent times. Barbra Streisand is good to know in her early career stages. Not sure if off-broadway will be in there too, but if so look up Blue Man Group too.
Kristin Chenoweth!
I’m sure the shrek musical will pop up at least once
You have asked the right gal I’m obsessed with musicals and Broadway. Somebody already named some good ones here are more to brush up on.  Hairspray  Newsies  Rock Of Ages  The Heights  The Wiz (African American version of The Wizard Of Oz)  The Lion King  A Bronx Tale  That’s just off the top of my head lol
Do they focus on past or present shows?
These Broadway trivia things always have lots of questions about old shows/ classics which I never know anything about. So I'd suggest to study those if you're not familiar with them! Like Cats, Rent, Phantom, A Chorus Line, Oklahoma!, Les Miserables, Hello Dolly!, My Fair Lady, Annie, Man of La Mancha, Pippin, Hair, Evita, Dreamgirls, Guys and Dolls, Cabaret, Annie Get Your Gun, etc.  And also all of the "firsts" and records, like Phantom is the longest running show and things like that
Wow! That's impressive! Thanks for the fun-fact!
So many things to listen to! Thanks! I appreciate your knowledge!
Oooh! She's a good person to research more! I love her in Candide! I love the song Glitter and Be Gay!
Oooh I forgot about that one! Good idea. I'll have to listen to it again!
I know a couple of these! Thanks!! I will definitely start listening to these! I've never heard of A Bronx Tale. Maybe I'll start with that one.
All of the above. He tries to ask an even smattering of present, past, and off-Broadway shows.
Okay, good suggestions! Thanks!!!
Haha of course! If you have any specific questions let me know! My mom is a choreographer and has had lots of people she taught end up on Broadway.
I love her in Charlie Brown!
I can tell you that Ricky Martin was in Les Miserables and Evita.
Wow! That's amazing! Do you know any obscure Broadway fun facts? The last Broadway trivia we did, there was a question about how someone (I think it was Carol Channing) used to keep lettuce in her purse as a snack in between shows... So, it's totally random! lol
Oh cool! Who did she play in Charlie Brown?
Wow! I didn't know that! Thanks!
hmm, unfortunately I don't think I know anything crazy like that. But Broadway is the longest street in NYC, and it only has 4 of the 31 theaters for broadway on it LOL. Also Hamilton is based off the book and Lin Manuel Miranda gives a portion of the profits from Hamilton to the author. That's all that I can really think of LOL. Also the actor who played "Malcom" in the 2006 She's the Man movie (James Snyder) was in a show with Idina Menzel called "If, Then" It was a small show, but SOOOO good. I also only know that because She's the Man was a favorite movie of mine, and when we got to go on set I recognized him XD.
Sally! https://youtu.be/JcVa_qe1itE
I've never heard of "If, Then". I'll have to look it up. Thanks! I didn't know that about Broadway being the longest street but only having 4 out of the 31 theaters! That's cool!
That was awesome!! Thanks!
Ahh typo! 41 theaters! haha sorry about that! Good thing you responded!
Oh wow! That's a lot more theaters than I realized!
Yeah, they’re not all always in use but it’s a cool system with theaters of all different sizes!
That's pretty amazing!

Hey everybody, I kind of need your help. As you all know, I participate in the Secret Santa exchanges here on Reddit. I participate in some exchanges but I also do rematches (got my secret Santa 2020 rematch finally 🥺) For the first time ever, in my Reddit Secret Santa (Career? Exchange? Project?) I’m actually stumped on what to get my giftee.  You see, I do not use Lush products due to the fact that their products irritate my skin. A lot of products do. So I do not trust my judgement in buying products that I don’t really know about. My giftee LOVES lush though, so I’d like to buy some products that lush users would recommend (and because I really want to spoil them)   Second, they are a foster parent. Whether they foster animals or children/teens, is not relevant. I want to give them things that a foster parent may need as a form of self care because of all the amount of effort,love and care they put into fostering and we all deserve some self love :))))  And really, I’d like to create a gift box of various items that include their likes along with items necessary to lift their spirits up cause fostering is a lot of hard work and reading their profile, they are adventurous so I’m sure the 2020 fiasco has ruined their plans. Luckily, they did provide a Pinterest but I’ve already covered the majority, now I’d like to give them a little extra as a thank you.   So if you’ve got any ideas, feel free to share them :) Thank you so much! 💛
I'm going to be the one who says NO to bath bombs and bubble bars unless they have specifically mentioned that they want them.  Not all of us Lush lovers have bathtubs that allow us to use those products and it sucks to get them as gifts when you cant enjoy them.  If your giftee lives in a part of the world that gets cold winter temps, get them a Scrubee or  Buffy Bar; the Buffy bar has been discontinued but you can still find it on the shelf in some stores.  Their solid lotion "pots" are also great for dry, winter skin.  I'd get them 2-3 smaller items (bar of soap, shower gel, lotion, lip scrub, etc) along with a gift card so they can go get more.
Hi. The bath bombs are fun and fantastic from lush. I am also fond of some of their scrubs and hand creams. They also do face masks that have  very little in them and are made of organic materials such as flowers and oatmeal. Those need to be refrigerated. I was once a foster child. My mom who later adopted me liked to keep a scrapbook type journal. That may be something your gifted may enjoy.
u/SJRDSJRD is your girl for help with Lush.  You could put a garnier sheet face mask, hand cream, a new book and bookmark, maybe a fun game to share as a family....Maybe uno?
I don’t know about Lush products, but I am a former foster parent.   Self care is so important!  A foot or back massager would be nice.  Or a small gift card for coffee/tea/bakery so they could have a moment alone with a book, even in the car.  Face, hand or foot masks!
For Lush products, I absolutely love the Sleepy products. They make a lotion, body wash, and body bar all in a soothing lavender sent. They sell a gift set of those items, too, which make a nice gift. They also have rose gift set that's really lovely. It comes with a sparkly body bar, a rose body wash, and rose body spray. I bought that one for my mom for Christmas and she really loved it.
https://www.lushusa.com/hair/hair-treatments/new/9999907370.html These hair wax melts feel amazing to put on.  Besides that, I recommend a few bath bombs, and maybe a shower scrub (the ScrubBee is amazing) or a lotion
From Lush I would go with bath bombs. I've been given two and they were amazing. And for self-care for a foster parent I would suggest tea or hot cocoa. A mug that has a positive message like "You are loved." Maybe an essential oil that is calming/balancing. Maybe a squeezy stress ball :)
I don't know how relatable my suggestions will be but im obsessed with lush. I have sensitive skin and I really love sweet or citrus scents so MOST of these will fit my personal preferences....Some of my favorite lush products are: Bath bombs: Sex bomb(very floral. even my kids love this one) Butterball(vanilla. no glitter or dye) Peachy (so cute!) Twilight(really pretty and smells so good)  Bubble bars: The comforter(this one is so popular there's a giant version of it lol) Castle in the clouds(good for sensitive skin) Mrs whippy(also good for sensitive skin) Worry monster(I know it looks silly like its for kids but the fragrance is so relaxing. Lavander and yang ylang) Nana(it smells SO YUMMY)  Other:  charity pot body lotion(smells pretty and they donate 100% of the price) Let the good times roll(facial cleanser that smells like cookies!) Honey lip scrub +honey trap lip balm (cause yum!) Beauty sleep face mask (smells good and feels nice)
Lush bath bombs are the ultimate in a luxurious self care treat. They're fun colours and designs, smell amazing and leave the skin feeling so soft! The bubble bars are a close second too!
Wow that’s so amazing! This is going to sound wild but any small amount of gift cards would be great because then they can really feel like they’re treating themselves. Lush is so cool. I’ve always wanted one of their bath bombs or bubble bars. I’ve heard the shampoo is great. Also like a foot massager would be nice
Lush honey shampoo bar is my absolute favourite
HONEY I WASHED THE KIDS SOAP <3 it's the best Lush scent. Also the Intergalactic bath bomb if they have a bath, it turns your water into a galaxy!
Lush bath bombs are divine, as are bubble bars (cut em up so they last), and some shower gels. I particularly love the Rose Jam line. They also have lip scrubs, OH and face masks. COFFEE FACE MASK is a must!!! Especially when you put it on after it's been in the fridge.  Other items you can include maybe a fictional book to escape in, a foam roller or back massage tool, a coffee mug with some instant coffee packets, a candle, jade or rose quartz roller for the face.
Hello! Future foster parent here (currently hopeful adoptive parent, then fostering once we get the ropes of parenting our first.) Fostering takes up a ton of time, whether it be court dates, or visits with parents, finding therapists, etc, or if they aren't fostering a human, vet visits and pet training. Things that would help give them more time or help them with it would be a huge help. Maybe a pocket planner, or a hello fresh box if you're in the US, or something similar to make meals easier. Honestly anything that will help free up time is going to be so well received! It's hard to relax and enjoy stuff when you don't have the time to do that. Bath bombs, or the shower melts are great if they like bath products. The shower melts are awesome because they can be used when you don't have time for a bath LOL. Also something as like a little get away from their house would be awesome too. A gift card to a local restaurant, or something for date night if they have a partner would be appreciated as well.    Lol sorry for the wall of texts, those are just my ideas!
Lush sleepy cream is AMAZING (unless they're not a fan of lavender)
I shall ask them that, I completely forgot that some places are like that. Thank you for bringing that up (‘w’;)   Luckily for me, they live in the same province, just an hour away so I can gauge the coldness well. I will look into the solid lotion pots for sure though!   Fair enough, a gift card will definitely give them more freedom to choose their favourites more easily rather than have a complete stranger do it. Thank you for your input!
I second the Lush bath bombs!
Bath bombs have always been so interesting for me so that’s a great idea! I will definitely also look at the scrubs and hand creams, hand creams are extremely great for winter too.  I’m really surprised about the organic face masks, is there one that you really liked that most?    That’s brilliant!!! Thank you, I can’t believe I didn’t think of that haha
Oooh thank you for tagging her :D   I literally just bought the uno deck as soon as I read your message, thank you xD
Thank you for being a foster parent 💛  I did nail down the gift card with their favourite coffee shop but the masks and massager are such great self care ideas, thank you so much for your input!! 🤗
Oh man, lavender is such a heavenly scent, I will definitely check that out. A gift set is a good idea so I’ll be keeping that as a gift idea for any other upcoming exchange/contest. This one though, I kind of was envisioning some sort of sampler box set with various scents and items, so thank you for mentioning the sleepy products :))
Oooh I never knew that existed, I hope I can find them in stores, that actually sounds cool!   A lot of people have also mentioned bath bombs so that is definitely what I will pick up. And I’ll also look at the shower scrub too, thank you for the recommendation! :D
They’re this sub’s favourite it seems :D   The positive message on a mug sounds perfect! If you don’t mind me asking, do essential oils require a diffuser along with it? (‘w’?)
I love all suggestions since I’m planning on making a sampler box of lush items that others recommend. They haven’t really answered my question so I am focusing more on sensitive skin types just in case, which is why I am so lucky many people use lush products so I won’t go in so blindly haha  I’m also a fan of citrus scents myself haha   Those names 😂 they’re so fun lol I will totally be keeping sex bomb on any list  I really appreciate you mentioning the type of scents and which skin type the items are. I’ve noted them all so thank you for your recommendations 💛💛  I’ve gotta find a bigger box now, they all sound so good 😆
I can not tell you how mesmerized I’ve become with them after everyone recommended them haha I’ve been watching countless of lush bath bomb videos on YouTube  Thank your for your input! :3
Gift cards are for sure always included in every secret Santa gift I’ve given :)) I too enjoy them for that reason but a variety of them does sound like a wonderful idea, back to Safeway it is ٩( 'ω' )و  The bath bombs really are the bomb lol I’ve been watching videos all day about them 😆  I’ll check the shampoos but my main problem is the type of hair they may have. Although I am keeping that at the back of my head, in case I may need to buy one ;) Thank you for mentioning it 💛💛
Wait what- That’s actually the name of a product??  IVE BEEN MISSING OUT LMAOO  That bath bomb sounds so beautiful, this is sorcery I tell you!
Bubble bars? What a cute name haha but that’s a good one too! I like the fact that you can cut them up so they last and that’s hella smart   Thank you for giving me more ideas to add to my list 💛💛  One of the items I didn’t get was face roller, one was green and the others were pinkish  Are those the quartz face rollers youre talking about? :0
Thank you for choosing to be a foster parent 💛 You’re all angels in disguise honestly   I will definitely grab a few planners and scrap books for sure, the hellofresh idea though, that’s brilliant! I order a lot of shoes and they always send a code for hellofresh, guess I’ll use them finally haha   Those shower melts though, that sounds wack. I LOVE IT LOL If you’ve used them before, what’s your favourite scent? :0  I haven’t really seen any mentions of their favourite restaurants so looks like Santa is switching careers and becoming an interrogator 😂 I’ve been asking them questions left to right haha
I have seen a lot of lavender type items on their Pinterest so luckily for me, looks like they are a fan! Another person had mentioned their sleepy products so looks like I’m for sure getting 2 items or more, depending if I can fit them all in the box :p
The amount of people who have mentioned them, really shows that they’re good.  New contest idea lol Thank you for your input by the way :)))
The oatmeal one is really great
I'd maybe check to see if they have a bath tub, if yes I'd go with bubble bars.. if no, I'd go with the shower steamers! 💜
You’re welcome!  Thanks for making this package extra special for someone who does an extra difficult job!
Ah gotcha! I think they sell the rose products on their own as well.
You don't have to have a diffuser, though they are handy to have, and there are all sorts.
Lush is pretty great about listing their fragrances. I think so far, I've only ever reacted to one product from them (it was a bath bomb called Pink) and I have super sensitive skin!! Good luck on your quest lol
You’re the most thoughtful Santa 🥲🥺🥺
Yes the pink ones are rose quartz :)
Aww haha no, we’re not angels! Just a normal person here! 😅 I just know people who have lived through awful foster situations and want to do what I can to provide a safe, loving home for children in need.   I have used the shower melts before! Makes me feel like I’m in a spa LOL. It’s basically the same thing as a bath bomb but it is just like aromatherapy for the shower. Personally I like eucalyptus, but I also am an anomaly and hate lavender. But a lot of people appreciate that smell too.
I’ve noted that down, thank you :D
It’s the least I can do.  I’m looking foreword to doing these sort of things on this sub as well :))
Ahh that’s fantastic!! Thank you :))
Oh also, when you're ordering, either in store or online, you can usually request sample sizes of most products to try (in case you wanna check some out for yourself lol)
Thank you!! ☺️
Well it’s wonderful that you want to provide a safe,loving home so that they won’t go through awful situations :)   Eucalyptus scented items are really good just as lavender, so thank you for bringing that up. I misjudged the store’s hour of operations so I didn’t get to go and explore the store, so just writing down peoples recommendations are a life saver c:
No problem! Happy to help! You’re a good rematch Santa 😊

Hi everyone!  This sub looks super fun, I'm excited to get to know you guys!  I am a 25/F living in Minnesota with my husband and two cats (Chewy and Rex - check out tons of pictures I've posted of them!). I'm a chemist at a pharmaceutical company, so anything science is right up my alley. I've been thinking of going back to school to get a master's or Ph.D in organic chemistry or something related. I haven't made concrete steps yet but I really want to.   I'm also pretty artistic. Over this covid mess I discovered needle felting and I really got into that. I used to do a lot of 2D art, mostly ink drawing and collage. I haven't really had the space for that in a long time though. Last year I also got into bullet journaling and it's been so helpful. I am actively trying to be more mindful.   When I want to just relax I have a few videogames I love. Breath of the Wild was fantastic and will always be one of my favorites. Skyrim is a classic favorite, definitely many hours spent there. And most recently I played through AC Odyssey and fell in love with it. Now just staring AC Origins!  I'm not great at intros so feel free to ask me stuff if you're interested, I'm an open book!
Welcome!! I’m in the Midwest too 🥰 I love your cats’ names 😂
Welcome to the sub, jeherohaku.
Welcome!
Hi! Nice to meet you! When you did ink drawing, what kinds of things were your favorite to draw?
Welcome and hi! What's your favorite part of being a chemist?
Welcome
Hi. Welcome! I’m in Minnesota too!
Hi neighbor! :)
Welcome to the sub; I hope you'll enjoy it!
Welcome!
Welcome!
hello and welcome to the family! what is your favorite movie?
Hello! Welcome to RAOA! 👋 I’m Lily, it’s so nice to meet you! I hope that we can be friends! Being a newbie can be pretty tricky, so if you need help with anything - or just want to chat - feel free to PM me and I will assist you to the best of my ability! ✨💛
Hi and welcome! I’m also a science geek 🤓 Biology though, with a very heavy emphasis on animals. I had so much trouble with chemistry, I’m always blown away (in a good way) by people who are not only good at it but enjoy it.  I love the Zelda games! I got a Switch and BOTW for Christmas but haven’t been able to play it yet because my left hand is currently not working like it’s supposed to 😬 Ocarina of Time for the N64 is my all time favorite game, so the fact that BOTW takes place in the alternate future of Hyrule and it’s OPEN WORLD has me soooo excited! Do you like other Zelda and/or Nintendo games?   I’ve been intrigued by needle felting since I first saw it. While I understand everything takes practice, it seems easy enough that I don’t think I’d be too intimidated to give it a try. Is it difficult?

Hi! Welcome! Who is your least favourite video game character?
Nice to meet you! What is your favorite art project you've done? What's your favorite food?
Thanks! Chewy was named because she looks like chewbacca and Rex came from a house with a 3 year old who loved dinosaurs lol.
I typically did really intricate mandalas. I was never very good at drawing from life, though one of my favorite things I've drawn was a water buffalo skull from a museum 😊
Hard to pick! I really like the parts of my job that take learning a particular technique. Anyone can fill a vol flask to volume or weigh out chemicals, but the more intricate tests like TLC are really fun. I like seeing how fast I can get while still maintaining full accuracy. My lab is pretty high volume.   That, and growing crystals 😁
Thanks! Knives out was really good, that's probably the most recent favorite. I don't tend to keep up with movies really. I do like the HP, hunger games, and marvel movies too though.
Thank you! It is a bit intimidating at first
BOTW is my first Zelda game, but I should definitely try more. The open world is amazing. There's just so much to do and explore and interesting game mechanics to figure out. My other favorites from nintendo are mario kart (cause who doesn't love mario kart) and pretty much anything Kirby. Dreamland on the DS is what I played the most. I should dig that out again actually, that sounds really fun.   Needle felting is super easy to get started with! And the subreddit and discord are all very friendly and give great advice. I feel like most of the "this is my first project" posts already look really good, it seems like people pick it up fairly quickly. And the starter kits aren't too expensive at all. Would definitely recommend! When I first got my kit I made a little heart and showed my husband and he instantly deemed it black magic lol. It's so cool to see a fluffy ball of nothing turn into an actual thing.
Ooh least favorite. I haven't really played *that* many games, but recently I've been playing AC Odyssey and Stentor or whatever his name is just really irked me.   Also tried Valhalla a bit and I'm having a hard time getting into it because the main character bugs me too. Their attitude towards everything is fight and conquer, which makes sense for a viking but it's annoying if you want an assassin build.
Hi! Favorite art project is kind of a tough one. I took this class in college where we watched old movies and then made art projects related to them in one big foldout moleskin journal. That was really cool and I really liked the end result.   Favorite food is so hard! I definitely love a good steak, that's high up on the favorites list. My husband does a really good job with them.
That's awesome! I've never been able to draw something like a mandala. That probably takes a lot of patience! I do watercolor painting. A water buffalo skull? That's awesome!
Oh I am a huge fan of Marvel and I really enjoyed Knives Out! I take it you might be a Chris Evans fan?
I would definitely recommend checking the others out. Starting with an open world might have spoiled you though, lol. Omg I love Kirby ❤️❤️❤️  That sounds very promising and definitely not daunting. I am for sure going to look more into it. Thank you!
That sounds like a cool project!  My brother likes steaks a lot, at Christmas he made us a steak dinner with his favorite recipe/method and it was the first time I've actually enjoyed a steak
Yes, but more of a RDJ and Ryan Reynolds fan. Deadpool was fantastic!
Nice! We have had a sous vide for a few years now and it makes such a difference. Perfect every time 😊

**CONTEST CLOSED! Thank you to everyone who guessed! Due to an amazing coordinator who kept things hopping and kept 6 professionals on the ball, we were able to finish all appointments before 3. We arrived home at 5:44pm PST!! I am still in shock! I thought it was going to be a much longer day! I am grateful to be home and thank you for all the kind thoughts! 💚💚**  We are in Seattle for appointments with the kidney transplant specialists for my daughter. Because we had to travel to get here, they are cramming several appointments into the day. We have a little down time between them, so I'm going to have contest. It's almost 11:55am PST. We have a few more appointments here and 1 other appointment for a physical around 2. That is contingent on how quickly we get through these. It could be later, but will still happen. We will then grab some food and start the 2.5 hour drive home. This may be in peak Seattle traffic. So what time will we get home? Closest guess wins. Bonus if you can suggest some Seattle grub!   Be an active member of the community. US only. Have an item $10 and under on your WL. DBAB.   Thanks for joining. I can't wait to get home! I'm not a fan of mobile, lol.

Heyy there
This might be weird, but it's always been my dream to be a foster mom and an adopted mom. But I never thought it would be possible as a single person. How old are you? I think I'm probably too young/ inexperienced to sign up for something like that, but it is certainly a life goal. How many kids have you had/ how long do they usually stay with you? Why did you decide to do it and why do you continue to do it? Do you ever want to have kids of your own?  Also what's your favorite book??
Aww thank you! As a teacher I have seen kids go through some really tragic stuff outside of school, so I hope that I can make a difference for at least a few.
Hi Lily! Thanks! I don't really know if I have slipped up anywhere at this point, so I don't know of anything to ask (lol), but I love how welcoming everyone has been so far!
I enjoy painting - most of my experience is with acrylics, but I have been trying to branch out into watercolors the past few years. And of course I doodle and sketch with pen or pencil, for what that is worth 😊
Thanks! I am thrilled that this community exists!
I love basically everything Brandon Sanderson writes (currently reading Rhythm of War). Also Wheel of Time, which is what introduced me to Sanderson bc he took over when Robert Jordan died. Beyond that, I grew up on Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, and a lot of Orson Scott Card's series, so those will always hold a special place in my heart and on my shelves!
Hello, fellow teacher! Thank you for all you do!
Haha I was all about some Veggie Tales back in the day!
That's wonderful! Are you planning to adopt a baby or an older child?
At least a few times a month...I make my own in my air fryer, and any time there is a get-together I'd say there's about a 1/3 chance that pizza and wings will be served 😂
My favorite holiday is definitely Christmas - I love baking, decorating, and especially giving presents! I love snow and the woods, and I'd like to get more into hiking, but my friends are so much more experienced than I am that sadly when I try to tag along with them I just can't keep up.  Cool to hear about your cats - got any pictures? And thank you for your work with special needs kids, that is such a challenging and important job!
Thank you! Nice username, by the way - Animorphs brings back some great memories of childhood Scholastic book fairs!
It's not easy, but our world definitely needs good foster parents who love kids and want to help them!
Thanks! This seems like a great place, everyone has been super friendly so far!
Thank you! It's good to be here!
7th grade English! How about you?
Hey! Good to meet you!
Some great questions! My answers are a little long for here, so I just sent you a DM :)
❤️❤️❤️
ooo yes! I grew up with those books as well!!
You too!
So for our first child we are doing a private domestic adoption just so we can learn the ropes of parenting (we'll be first time parents.). Then after that we actually plan to foster and if any of the children we foster become eligible for adoption we will adopt them. We actually were speaking with an aunt who's nephew was in the foster system (20 months old) earlier this week, but it wasn't a match. :(
Nice! I love my air fryer. We use it a lot to make poutine!
Hello there  Maybe with a little bit more exercise you might be a but it start keeping up with them or have somebody gonna hang out back with you so you can join the group. Yes I do other picture of my cat Mr. JJ in my profile if you like to take a peak. And yes I'm absolutely loving my job thank you. Hope you have a wonderful weekend
Thanks so much! Book fairs were the BEST! They always had the best little erasers too
I am a teacher also so I feel like that would be helpful with my understanding of kids. My parents were foster parents for a while when I was younger. It was a good experience.
That's awesome! I teach 7th, 8th, and 9th grade science and ap chem :)
Sounds good!
Poutine is delicious! I tried some at the county fair once that also had bacon crumbles and jalapenos, and I loved it so much that I add those all the time now!
Awesome! We need good science teachers, so thank you for all you do!
Its become my husband and my "couple's" dish. We went to Montreal in 2015 and had it for the first time. Ever since then we try to get it at each place that has it. We even had it as a late-party snack at our wedding!
and thank you too!!💕🔬🧫🧪

https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/39TB29E5XR07X?ref_=wl_share  Freaky Friday!  So on my list I have a mug that reveals a spider at bottom after you drink all the liquid.  I have arachnaphobia, so this is a fun way to master my fears.  Creepy. Freaky.  Delightful☺
Freaky Friday  I have dragons blood (serum) make my eyes more youthful. If not some dragons were slayed unnecessarily.   A link to my list is [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2URALKC0NMPYW/?ref_=lol_ov_le)
Freaky Friday  I have a star gazing done projected night light that displays the galaxy on the walls and ceiling.  It’s weird cause I’m a grown woman turning 40 next month and the night light is for kids. Do I care? No! Lol I’ve wanted one since I was a kid and my doctor said to get a night light because of a retna detachment that caused issues with my sight when it’s pitch black or to bright. So I have the perfect excuse to get it now.   [wish list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3AJ3XR5NW0Q11/?ref_=lol_ov_le&filter=default&sort=default&viewType=list)
There's a shiba inu plushie on my list.. it seems pretty normal but guess what...  It's wearing a dinosnaur outfit!  I would live to have him to add to the plushie collection on my fiancee and I's bed.  Freaky Friday!   https://www.amazon.nl/hz/wishlist/ls/1HPKMK87GGQW5?ref_=wl_share
I have a backpack for carrying my cat on my list - haha. He hates his current plastic carrier, and I find it's difficult to haul back and forth from the vet (a backpack would be so much easier!). I'm going to have to travel with my cat in the summertime, and this is airline approved, so it would be a big help. I know I'd get some looks - haha - but whatever!  Freaky Friday. [Listlink!](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3ELF1MZ8MK1Y9?ref_=wl_share)
For Freaky Friday,  I want this egg mold that makes hardboiled eggs look like skulls.   My wife loves skulls/skeletons aaaand recently got into pickling things. She pickles eggs, now, and never having had them before, it's delicious! How to describe this?  Its like when skittles came out with sour skittles. It was good and familiar, but sour, too,  which made it fun. That,  but with hard boiled eggs.   She does not add beet juice, so they are white. I'd love to mold them into little skulls so it looks like we have a jar of dissolved shrunken heads in our fridge!  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1BNDIR3E7SEEV?ref_=wl_share

Freaky Friday!  Something freaky looking that I have on my list is a set of care safety hammers! They look like weird little contraptions with a blade on one side and a pointy hammer on the other...but they’re actually super useful and potentially lifesaving!   The blade is to cut a seatbelt in the event that you are stuck in your car, and the hammer is to smash the window.   You never want to need this, but it’s very important to have!  [WL](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3QA0DVUSNFLCJ?ref_=wl_share)
Freaky Friday  Considering I'm a guy, it's probably strange that I have the Cards Against Humanity Period Pack on [my WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/YV2EZJ74FVFS?ref_=wl_share) \>\_< Its mostly for my wife though. LOL  Thanks for hosting!
Probably the weirdest thing in my wishlist the the book "Smoke gets in your eye" its a book all about working in the death field and cremations and I gotta know more!! Thanks for hosting!   [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2Y59YGF7YB3WC?ref_=wl_share)

**https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/2RTC8VZFNN08X?ref\_=wl\_share**   The strangest/freakiest thing I have on my (practical lol) list is the raven lamps? They're so cool and gothy and I love them. But they are very expensive so like the super cool and totally useful bill cipher bath matt would probably be a more reasonable choice for the  ‘Freaky Friday’ contest
an unusual item i have is a witchcraft book- an encyclopedia of herbs. i want this for obvious reasons haha i just started practicing, and would like to learn about the magical properties of herbs.   freaky friday  [https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1ZWCZPP8WEGVV?ref\_=wl\_share](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1ZWCZPP8WEGVV?ref_=wl_share)
I have a strange and unusual (at least to me) book in my wishlist of books and movies. It's called [The Complete Manual of Things That Might Kill You](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/ZUIM7XIU06HF?ref_=wl_share). It seems really funny and interesting, in a weird sort of way. It helps hypochondriacs diagnose their symptoms! 😉 I promise I am not a hypochondriac, but I have known a couple.      Thanks for this Freaky Friday contest!
Freaky Friday! Mine is lava salt! It’s salt. With lava!!! https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/MODB1ZKDOKGM?ref_=wl_share  I love to cook so this will bring extra flavor and uniqueness to my dishes
Freaky Friday!  Mine is a hand held milk electric milk whisker! (You may have seen them on TikTok)  I am a huge coffee fan and because of lockdown my coffee machine is at a different house and I cant access it! This item would mean that I can make frothy milk for my coffees even though I don't have my coffee machine!  Thank you for running the contest!  [List!](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/URVP101R6HUM?ref_=wl_share)

Freaky Friday !!!!  The strangest thing I have on my wishlist is probably this death note 3D night light 🙃 I think it's so cool and it would look awesome in my room! OR the tye dye adult onesie 😂  I also have random things like a sweatshirt that has ears and Misa Misa on the front 😂   Thanks for the contest!  [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/RKWRV843YDM0?ref_=wl_share)

I haven’t heard of the movie but it got me curious...it looks similar to the 1963 movie ‘birds’.  Thanks for entering :)

I'm glad you liked it!  Thank you for hosting!
😂  hey, whatever we need to do to help, right?
They are cool! But who has $50 to throw at cool lamps? Old people maybe?   And yeah, it's a pretty nifty bath mat that may or may not bring about the apocalypse based on the year we've had haha  Thank you for the cool contest!
Thanks for hosting!
Yes I love mine!!!!
Done!! Thanks again for the contest! You're awesome !!
When I was younger I used to feed the spider on the shed ‘George’ with dead flies in the hope he would never feel the need to come in the house hahaha
I lost my furbaby last year and he was my big baby boy (always will be). Think I need to be investing in this item too lol.
I don’t no :(. I liked the tree and guardian angel as thought they would be nice additions to my office and bedroom :)
I might need to take a rain check on that one haha
Most definitely lol
Aww no I’m sorry to hear that it wasn’t a match! I’m a great believer everything happens for a reason and I’m sure the right match will come along at the right time which will make you both see why all the other matches weren’t right :). Nothing wrong with adding to the nursery whilst you wait :)
Haha yeah! 😂
The death note 3D night light is pretty awesome!   Your welcome :)
See?? You knew what to do🤣
Awe I’m sorry to hear that you lost your fur baby :(
They sound lovely. What kind of stones?
I believe that too! The right little bean will join us when they are supposed to. ❤️
RIGHT!!!! There is an L one & one of Light holding the Death Note. Both super cool! I love quirky little things like that. Which is also why I think this contest is super cool haha. I'm browsing through the comments looking for interesting/quirky stuff to add to my wishlist 😂
They are rose quartz :)
❤️
I’ve been doing the exact same 😂. Never knew how many quirky things you could buy on Amazon! Definitely gave me some ideas :)
Ah, great minds!
I love these for taco night! I already have them so they're not on my wishlist but thought I'd share!  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F6VY5RB/ref=cm_sw_r_sm_apa_fabc_Eb0aGbF9ARMAV
Omg they are just amazing! Thanks for sharing :)
Haha aren't they?! I bought them "for my son" but I get more excited to use them then he does 😂 they are great and very efficient too!

u/haliolives thank you so much! As predicted, my hubby loves him too so I see a fight on my hands to keep him. I love him 😍 you rock! ... As does he (sorry, not sorry!) 😆
So cool. I can't wait to see him in the next one again.
“Piss off, Ghost!” - my favorite line of his.
Korg: “piss of ghost” best character ever!!!
Another day, another Doug
My partner collects these! Awesome gift!!
Im glad you enjoy it! 😊
I'm massively looking forward to it. If I remember right, Wandavision is on Disney today so I'll be on that tonight. I'm curious to see what they do with that 😊
Still makes me laugh every time I watch

I paint my nails. I'm horrible at it, but it makes me happy!!
Face sheet masks!! They feel so soothing on the skin 😊
What I’ve figured out I do is clean my room, do the laundry and light a candle. Then put something on on Netflix 👌🏽
I LOVE Lush Sleepy products, especially the body wash and lotion. Also really have been liking the Kopari brand lately, like this [coconut scrub](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B073QN78W6/?coliid=I26NPZM2HGLY45&colid=1V01VLTCCN006&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) or [coconut melt](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07S3TZWJ8/?coliid=I1C9P4M7T5272&colid=1V01VLTCCN006&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it).
I adore [Camille Beckman products. Terrific for hands and feet. if you miss tropical, choose mango. if you like baking, the vanilla. and if you need a grandma moment choose the Camille scent which has a powdery grandmotherly smell but not in an old-woman way. ](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjzmrusiJ_uAhUxA-cKHe80AOoYABALGgJwdg&sig=AOD64_27asIquzuB4LKIH8X1srEbScFQwQ&adurl&ctype=5&ved=2ahUKEwixirKsiJ_uAhWWmJ4KHfmhDIYQwg96BAgBEB0)
I have a few things, it just depends on why I’m treating myself/what’s wrong   A shower where I use this unbelievable [sugar scrub](https://www.amazon.com/Tree-Hut-Sugar-Scrub-Moroccan/dp/B01CGRN8IU/ref=mp_s_a_1_20?dchild=1&keywords=tree+hut+sugar+scrub&qid=1610760252&sprefix=tree+hut+sugar&sr=8-20)  A [book](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Book-White-Eldest-Curses-ebook/dp/B084G8SJ7S/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=cassandra+clare&qid=1610760003&sprefix=cassand&sr=8-4) I know Ill love like the latest by my favorite author.

I don't have a specific item because it's books. When I'm sad-books. Need to relax-books. Bored-books. Lonely-books.
Lavender scented candles definitely!
This [Johnson's Foot Soap](https://www.amazon.com/Johnsons-Foot-Soap-Powder-each/dp/B006IB41TG/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-rsf-lq2a1_0?cv_ct_cx=foot+soap&dchild=1&keywords=foot+soap&pd_rd_i=B006IB41TG&pd_rd_r=3fb457ad-6f09-4a3c-809f-19c2932e7ac2&pd_rd_w=7TCTA&pd_rd_wg=7qTlp&pf_rd_p=52f9c563-bb87-44f4-9d9d-e1c03402d90f&pf_rd_r=5V8KK736ARCYCNT788CM&psc=1&qid=1610752795&sr=1-1-d3e58e83-6458-471c-a87e-175495b96a10) is out of this world. It seems old fashioned, but I swear it just takes the ache out of sore feet. It's also inexpensive, but feels spa-amazing!
Biotera shampoo for my dye job. Makes my hair feel good and smell great, and doesn’t feel like straw after it’s washed.
I never thought about high quality workout clothes but that's true! I made it a point to stop doing my pilates in an oversized shirt and sweatpants...
Same! And it's a money saver doing it yourself.
Yes they do!
I really need to do laundry but I'm avoiding it.
I'm definitely more motivated to workout when I feel comfortable and cute.
Exactly!
Tbh, just get it done. You won’t ever feel to do it. And as soon as it’s out the dryer, pack it immediately. Trust me
I love painting my nails! It makes me happy too!
You are right but laziness wants to win so bad.

u/tinawebmom Thank you so much! Already put two to good use!
Genius!!!
These are such a good idea
I love these. I have them on my phones. Im always hitting the video chat button on messenger and I be damned if Im getting caught slippin lmao. Plus, I play on my phone in the bath. No creeps here lol.
Those are great! I may have to grab some for my phone because I keep turning the camera on by accident.
I didn't know those were a thing. That's awesome! I can see why they'd be useful!
I was wondering if they arrived! 💕 I'm glad those are so super useful remember to turn off your mic!!
That, the part about creeps, reminds me I need to put one on my son's tablet. I never know like if apps can see and use your camera. Idk if that's a thing but I feel a little paranoid about it!! Haha
Oooh good tip!  Yep, they came in yesterdays regular mail that I grabbed a little bit ago! I get a bit excited with mail and had to tear into it!!
Yes definitely. Its a scary world out there. My husband has a playstation camera... in the bedroom.  So pointless, he dont play games with it he uses it for facial recognition to turn controller on???? How lazy lol. We always wave and tell the "people" hi. We know.
I completely understand. I love getting snail mail!! 💕

The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek. That is on my tbr list also. [my wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/D0ED3F0T4VXC?ref_=wl_share)
You should buy and read The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek: A Novel because it sounds charming, based on a true story and we need more LIBRARIAN heroes. Some of my favorite days were in junior high when the bookmobile would come to my neighborhood. I could go in and pick books for an entire week. I adored that bookmobile! It is now parked and dilapidated in rural Washington and it’s sad.  Now I want to read this book too!

Anything from my [Kindle list](https://smile.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1KVZTG4ZMIJJL) would be appreciated.        You should read Opium & Absinthe by Lydia Kang. I picked it up as Kindle First Reads book and really enjoyed it. So much that I have one of her other books on my wishlist.
I see you have Dorian Gray on your list! It's the most quotable book I've ever read. It's not as humorous as some of Wilde's other stuff but it is very thought-provoking and can suck you in. My wishlist has a few books I think are pretty :) I hope you can read something you love soon  [https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/YNK11TYESXYM?ref\_=wl\_share](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/YNK11TYESXYM?ref_=wl_share)

Oh! The Discworld series!! It's amazing! I have the first book IRL and I am hoping to get the second book (wishlist) soon. I've read the entire series via Kindle and loved it so much I've begun collecting them all!!  Pratchett is funny, real, loving, smart and crazy! He was an amazing author and I was very sad when he died. If you love fantasy and magic and scifi this is absolutely the series for you!   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1AK35UH3JU9U1?ref_=wl_share

\+1 for World War Z. I've only heard fantastic things about it, and what better time to read about an apocalypse scenario infection spreading?  I can't help but also give my own recommendation too - I'd suggest you read [Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman](https://www.amazon.com/dp/039360909X/?coliid=I1WOSLKYQC78K9&colid=2OZMNGN3SC0YX&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it). It's a wonderful retelling of older Norse myths, and it's done in such an easy to follow and fun way. Plus the audiobook in particular is amazing as it's read by the author himself!  [Book WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2OZMNGN3SC0YX?ref_=wl_share)
I think you should definitely get The Picture of Dorian Gray or Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, as those are two of my favs ❤️  [Book wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1QEKQ7AQEC0VL?ref_=wl_share)  Thanks for the contest! Books are the best ❤️📚

[Book List](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/1PL4MHV6G87EM?ref_=wl_share)
You should read *The Hound of the Baskervilles.* Easily the best Holmes story. Easily. And I'm not biased because I've been a fan of Sherlock Holmes for five years. XD   Here's my main [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/7M9BJ5MU0P3M?ref_=wl_share) where I keep my books.
The Picture of Dorian Gray!!! I love Oscar Wilde so much! He was so witty and charming and that comes through in his writing. He is one of my all time favorite authors, from a literary and personal standpoint. He was just so fun.   [wl](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2V7UTUZZVY5V6)
I know youre not supposed to judge a book by its cover BUT I think you should buy yourself The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek - simply because I like the cover!!! lol!   Here is my [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3BOZ07V63JNFI?ref_=wl_share). I have a TON of books. Theyre currently all listed as kindle reads since I just got a kindle for christmas but I take any and all books!
I think you should get Dracula! Not many stories (if any) from that long ago are so easily recognized by name alone. You also can’t deny the huge impact it’s had on pretty much any consumable media! Classics are usually a great bet.   I just have a general [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3UPFGP0VHUQQ?ref_=wl_share) that has books sprinkled throughout it.
The book woman of troublesome creek was awesome!  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3I0Q5LZKDDC7V?ref_=wl_share
I like this!  I think you should read the winter of witch (I think that’s what it’s called - my daughter just distracted me and it slipped my mind)  I hope you like whatever book you pick!  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/30YE2A64BBZBK?ref_=wl_share
AH! I love a book contest and will never say no to a new book!! I think you should absolutely get **The Girl in the Tower: A Novel (Winternight Trilogy)**. As you know, this is one of my favorite series, and I definitely think it's worth reading the second and third installments. The storytelling is engaging, the setting is captivating, and the characters feel real (and I'm basically in love with Morozko LOL).   The books I'd like can all be found on my [Books wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1HJAL35Y1XQJS?ref_=wl_share). Thanks for this contest :D

I think you should read I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith. I think it's the right genre for you, from looking at your list. I enjoyed it. https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0099460874/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_apa_i_oEFaGb8QX8SW4  Here's my [list](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/5RM0EDRKT0CX?ref_=wl_share)
Okay so hear me out...  I see you like classic mysteries like Sherlock Holmes, period pieces like Madam Bovary and also some classic women driven literature...so you really should read [The BeeKeepers Apprentice ](https://www.amazon.com/Beekeepers-Apprentice-Segregation-Russell-Mystery/dp/1250055709)  It has a great plot driven storyline, Sherlock Holmes teaching the female protagonist Mary Russell how to outwit the bad guys...It’s great    [my book WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/TY8PZ66RNDLH?ref_=wl_share)
You should get Anne of Green Gables! I just got such a nostalgia kick seeing that on your list, loved it as a kid. [Here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/2NNJ64TXXIIRT?ref_=wl_share) is my books wishlist.
I think that you should buy yourself Jane Austen: a Life.  I love Jane Austen novels and I think it would be so interesting to learn more about her! Plus, it’s on your list, you want it, so go for it! :)  [WL](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/3QA0DVUSNFLCJ?ref_=wl_share)
You should read Priory of the Orange Tree. Or Lilith's Brood. Lilith's Brood might not be your cup of tea but I recommend it to anyone and everyone because it's my favorite book ever.  I don't think I have any books on my wishlist so don't pick me for the contest. I just want everyone to read those two books.
I believe you should get Alice in Wonderland!! Its an amazing adventure for all ages. I believe reading it as an adult holds a different view then as a child. You literally have a land of wonder. You just gotta follow the white rabbit!!  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/ADI6QX39KZHU?ref_=wl_share  The Power of Birthdays, Stars & Numbers. Is the book I would recommend if you like astrology more then just horoscopes.
I think you should choose World War Z off of your list. I love books like that and zombies are pretty cool.    [Wishes](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/29QRPEKRV1FB0?ref_=wl_share)  I have a good variety of books on my list, both paperback and kindle.   Thanks for the contest
You should buy yourself The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek that you have on your list. Just look at all those 5 star reviews! Plus it’s on the bottom of your list so you’ve wanted it for a while.   Thanks for the contest sleepy_pickle! [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2V0AE6R80B0FP?ref_=wl_share) I’m trying to read 50 books this year! Do you have a book goal?
My books are on my main wishlist. There’s a pretty big range of both content and price. I think a couple go over the limit. Some are e-books so don’t require shipping [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/38TVM8K6SO74Y?ref_=wl_share)  It looks like you’re a Jane Austen fan. You should read her letters. See how much she relates to the women she writes.
Alice's adventures in wonderland! There is so much immersion and experience to be delved in with the book vs the movies. The two just cannot compare.  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1UD72M27W0SOJ?ref_=wl_share
You should get World War Z because it's a really good book!

So I think you should read unwind it's a dystopian series where a civil war breaks out over abortion and a happy medium called unwinding becomes law. It's dark and super interesting.

Contest is closed!
Ooo, this looks like a very interesting read that I will enjoy.
Omg, I said the same thing. The book is so much better. I love it so much
I do have a goodreads! The AoGG on my list is a picture book I want to get for my toddler. I have the whole series as well. And have watched the Megan Follows series way too many times. Such a wonderful series of books!
Are the books better than the movie?
Happy cake day.
50! That's so many! But you can totally do it. I believe in you!  My goal is 30.
It was in stock a few days ago and splurged for it. It will arrive sometime in February. 😂
I hope you do😁
Maybe I’ll have to add that one to my list too!
I enjoyed the movie but they toned down A LOT to make it more tame and I guess reach more of a wide audience.
Thank you!
I started my goal with 100 because my mom friend did that in 2020 and I quickly realized that was WAY too many. 😂🙈
Yooooo that’s lit! I kept checking haha I love a challenge
You should! It's the story told from perspectives from all around the world. It's beautiful and tragic, and worth every second of the time spent reading it
Toned down in what way?
Wow! I don't think I'd be able to read that much until all my kids move out. I have one mom friend who did 85 but that's because she has older kids who leave her the heck alone so she can do some proper reading.
I’m gonna dm you cause I don’t want to ruin the plot for anybody who might read the book and doesn’t want to be spoiled
85 is still SO many books! I don’t now how either of them did it. I hope I can finish my 50! 🤞🏼
Sure!

I almost had to drop out of college 6 months before graduating, due to (primarily) financial and some personal reasons. My friend's mom called me and said, "You've got to finish this, and I want to help you." She paid for my books and tuition balance. I graduated school with two kids under the age of five. To this day, I will never forget that kindness.
I had a good parcel when money was bad and couldn’t feed the kids. Someone left it by my front door. I never knew who but it had fishfingers and that’s all my son wanted
Recently, my parents helped me out majorly to get a nice used car (09 Buick Lucerne CXL in case anyone is curious). It will be very reliable and last me until I can  get things together to afford a new one. I love driving in it, and I'm always grateful for the experience and help.
When I was a child I really wanted a pair of footy pajamas with Esmeralda on them. We didn’t have much money so I almost never got what I asked for so I wasn’t expecting anything. But on Christmas morning I got those pajamas! I loved them so much that when I became too tall for them I cut the feet off so I could wear them even longer. It’s just a small thing and I know I’ve received “better” gifts since then, but that is the first gift that comes to mind every time I think about gifts I’ve been excited about.
So hard to pick just one because I've loved so many gifts. When I was in fourth grade, my dad bought me my first sci-fi/fantasy book and that one's been pretty special to me. It inspired a lifelong love of the genre and the desire to write.
It’s actually really small. My ex husband got me a little Lego Harry Potter potion class set. It’s silly but it was the first time in a romantic relationship that I felt SEEN. Like someone cared enough to pay attention and get me something under $10 that I’d really love.
My covid birthday in March 2020 was great... I didn't receive physical gifts but time spent with family,  without arguments. They made all my favorite foods.  Also helped me with a variety of house projects... that was the best part.  I'll take physical labor over physical gifts any day
My horse as a teen. So many years of happiness.
🙂 Lets take this way back to middle school. I was a social butterfly and ALL I wanted for my birthday was call waiting!! I begged and pleaded with my parents, and I was CONVINCED it wasn't happening.   At my party with all my friends, there was a small wrapped up box on the table. I figured it was a little kid necklace. WELL, I opened it and it was a typed note telling me I was the proud owner of CALL WAITING!!!!! 😍😍😍   I busted up crying and couldn't contain my excitement. LOL 😀😀😀 None of my friends understood why I was freaking out because they all had it and it wasn't a big deal. To me, it was the entire world. 🙂  I'll NEVER forget the excellent parenting my parents had. I strive to be like they were.   Call waiting was $2. LOL. It was hands down, the greatest gift I received.
The first Harry Potter book. It totally changed my life when I was little. It made me the avid reader I am.
Besides the sweet things my kids have done, my husband bought me the [Dyson Hair Dryer](https://www.dyson.com/hair-care/dyson-supersonic/dyson-supersonic-overview). I shower in the am and dry my hair daily. It’s super quiet and doesn’t dry may hair out like other dryers. Only issue is, I want all their boar products now. 😭
A stethoscope :)
Muh fiancée
When I turned 10 I got a trampoline. I spent hours everyday on that thing. I taught myself a bunch of gymnastics moves. I would do my homework on it and would lay on it at night and look at the stars.  I’ve been considering buying one to relive some of the memories!
On random acts of amazon, or just in life??  Because on here someone got me a rice cooker, i never expected to get anything that nice or useful or expensive. So that was awesome.  Just in life in general. A kitten. When i got too sick to work i had to move back in with my mom, and she thought a pet would make me less sad, but she doesn't like cats wich are my favorite animal. So we went and adopted a doggo, who i love to bits. But a little later she asked if I still wanted a cat and now i have [these horrible fur children](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/591330324475019280/799759382635216926/IMG_20210115_141745239.jpg) and i love them!
My girlfriend gave me a box she made herself with a lot of candy and another box with a lot of photos she printed from the time we've spent together up up to that day for my birthday. It may sound cheesy, but it made me very happy because no one had ever done that for me. She also wrote me a beautiful letter
When I was a teen my mom and I didn't really get along. It was a rough time. I wanted to be independent, she wanted me to stay a child. I wanted to go abroad for uni, she actively tried to prevent that. My dad was overseas and she was terrified and my bro was...rebellious and uncontrollable (a little shit) and I got the brunt of it. She made some real messed up parenting choices.  I was also full swing into a goth phase she did NOT like.  But for my bday she got me one of those skelanimal teddy bears, and it reminded me that even when my mom doesn't like me she does love me, and she's trying.
Hot mustard packets from Mcdonald's!! Mcd discontinued the hot mustard where I live but Texas still has it so my best friend had her family collect as many as they could and she presented me a huge box of them this Christmas. I haven't been this happy since god knows when. ♥
Hand painted shirt of my favorite artist. Literally love it so much. My best friend really put in so much work to make it.
That is extremely kind of her!  So do you pay the tuition by month/term or something? Also are the books mandatory?
That is so good of them, it’s a smart looking Swiss car. Is it your first? And hey, don’t worry about getting a new one. As long as a vehicle gets you from A to B that’s all that matters.  I wish I had parents like that, I helped mine out years ago by going without a car (despite needing it) and giving them any low mileage car when theirs went to heaven, they went crazy on me because the exhaust needed replacing 6-9 months later...yw
Such a good book, even the cover art had a magical feel to it. What’s your favourite in the series?
Awwwww
Doo it!
This was years ago. I was running out of financial aid, and my husband had just been laid off and we had two little kids... it was complicated. So it was the balance of my tuition that semester and two mandatory text books. I really think I would have lost my momentum, and never finished. But I DID!
Even when I can I probably won't be looking to replace this car right away. Lol.   Had a similar experience trying to give away a van to a relative. It had some body damage but ran amazing. Needed a battery replacement. They pretty much demanded we fix it up before they took it. Nope. Gave to a friend instead.
Yes!! Definitely! My favorite book is Order of the Phoenix. My favorite movie is Sorcerer's Stone. Yours?
:)

Hi! Thanks for the contest. I hope you are feeling better and taking care of yourself, you deserve it! One of my goals for 2021 is to save some more money!

I'm glad you're back! Anxiety can be like an avalanche at times. It just starts and keeps going and going until everything is a mess. But just like an avalanche, there are people who will come searching for you and help you find your way out. You've also done this for yourself through writing your goals and planning something fun for this year. So props to you!   My goal for 2021 is pretty simple. I just want to try my best at whatever it is I am doing. Whether it's cooking and baking, being active on RAOA, or working out. I am not trying to put any unreasonable goals for myself but just want to be a better person than I was in the previous year.   &#x200B;  What's your goal for 2021 u/huntfishcamp u/gdarn16 u/Meraika   [WL](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/2VFPTZ592S5I?ref_=wl_share)
I completely relate to where you're coming from. Most of 2020 was characterized for me w by my struggle with anxiety. Sending you all the positive vibes ✨ Hugs, if you'd like them.  My goal for 2021 is to do more. More reading, more moving, more writing. I don't want to put a number on it because then if I don't reach that arbitrary goalpost, I might quit.  So, more reading books than I did in 2020. More walking/jogging/running than I did in 2020. More writing than I did in 2020.  Oh, and I'm also trying to read the entirety of Stephen King's published works this calendar year. I I'm off to a slow start what with work ramping up for the end of the semester, but I'll make up the difference over the summer 💙  [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/PKVA25CDK8AA?ref_=wl_share)  u/Lucy_Leigh225, u/hungupon, and u/omgitsmoki, and goals you'd like to share?
My goals for this year are to finish my novel (first draft!), exercise more, and start packing my food for work.   I didn't do much last year...and I gained over 30lbs due to stress, lack of exercise, and serious depression. I got a new job that I don't actually like and a place I loved and worked at for 3 years is now gone permanently gone thanks to this virus. This new job is a poor replacement but at least I'm paying bills?  The end of last year was very rough for me but I'm determined to make this year my own!

Thanks for the contest and sorry to hear about your anxiety. I think it’s pretty OK to have anxiety and depression right now given we’re in the middle of a pandemic. So be easy on yourself and get as much rest as you can and feel better because the world is a little nutty right now!  My goals for 2021 are to eat more veggies, eat at home and only eat out as a treat, drink water as my main beverage and send tons of cards with RAoC! I also have a den now, and once we finally get our Christmas tree outta there I look forward to curating a space where I can meditate, do self reiki and journal and overall just work on my well-being in that room so I can be a better me for myself and others. I have pent up anger and sadness that could use some exploring and this year I feel it’s right to tackle it.  Take care! [WL here](https://raoa.tech/random/?activity_cutoff=28&username=Purpleteasoul)
Oh no, I hope you'll feel better soon and that your plan will come to fruition. Sending you positive vibes <3  I have a lot of goals for 2021. My biggest personal goal is to finish the draft of a novel I've been working on. I also would like to be a kinder, more compassionate person.   A big goal I have with my husband is to hopefully find and buy a house this year. We've been looking for quite a long while but just haven't found anything in the area we're most interested in yet.

I'm sorry to hear that you're dealing with anxiety :( as someone who struggles with it as well, I can understand how overwhelming it must be. I usually just tell myself to take baby steps because any progress (whether it's just writing down my plans or brainstorming) is a step in the right direction!  As for my 2021 goals, I'd like to have a more organized routine for school :)) I'm close to graduating, but I still don't have a "study system" down, and I'd like to be prepared for when grad school starts (hopefully!).

I started reading again last year so I've set a goal to read 20 books this year but it would be nice to go over that goal.

Hi!!! I’ve been super busy also. I understand your anxiety. I just left the healthcare field because if burn out and the whole pandemic ordeal. I’m working a different pace now and I’m wondering if that’s the right choice.  My goals for 2021 is to really start taking care of myself mentally and emotionally and also health wise.

Clear an important exam! I have been stuck on it for two years and if I won't clear it this year I plan on dropping it altogether. It is really stressful of a situation for me.

Sorry to hear about your anxiety. I get it. I ride my own waves of it and depression.   This year my goals are based on self improvement. I am focused on creating a healthy diet and eating habits, working out, going to the doctor for the first time in a while and checking out a lot of medical problems I have put aside for quite a while. I want to focus on giving myself the gift of health. I've never done that and it's incredibly important for me and my physical and mental health.   This started for me in November but I'm holding steady. I also plan to save more money so I can hopefully buy my first house next year.

I am so sorry to hear about your anxiety. It’s not fun for sure! I deal with it too and i know how much it can knock you back.    My goal for 2021 is pretty simple but hard - stop smoking. I haven’t had much luck yet and I’m now working on tapering instead of cold turkey.   Tyftc! https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/30YE2A64BBZBK?ref_=wl_share
I want to be a healthier me. How would I achieve that?   Exercise and yoga at least 3 times per week.   Aiming to drink 2L of water daily (and it’s ok if I don’t make it, as long as I try).   Eating healthier. This is my main challenge. While I have reduced the amount of junk food I eat over the past two weeks, I’m concerned that I may not be eating enough. Or even enough quality food. I need to prioritize protein in my meals. This is where I need to try harder.   Pay attention to my mental health. I have been in a serious dump for awhile now. But recognizing this, I know I have to try to do things that will make me happy and happier.   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/4BM8Z0ZUFWGN?ref_=wl_share

Hello :) I am making my goal this year to make sure my friends feel appreciated and know that they have someone they can talk to no matter what. I lost someone I was very close with when he took his life early last year and it rocked us all pretty hard. I don’t want any of us or my friend’s families to have to go through this sooner than we have to again.  Same here too though - if you or anyone else that sees this needs to talk to someone, I can’t always provide advice, but I can listen :) Anxiety is no fun especially when by yourself, and sometimes talking out what’s going on in your head can help make sense of it.  Oh, and here’s my wishlist: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/S988Z4NONMFO?ref_=wl_share  u/Johnwoods1023 and u/poisonedmonkey, what are some of your goals?

I feel you with the high anxiety lately! Maybe there is something in the air! This year one of my goals is to become a mom. It's not really something I can control because we're adopting and we have to wait for our match, but it is honestly something I hope for so badly. I did all the steps in my control to adopt, homes study approved, profile is up, video is in the works! So all that is left to do is wait. But it's a goal, my [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1BVB8G71MFKBJ?ref_=wl_share) even is focused on nesting/preparing for our little one! So fingers crossed!!

Glad you're back, anxiety is the worst-writing can power through and get it out of your system. My goal for 2021 is to take more initiatives. I am always in the background, and not making the first move. Fear and anxiety of being wrong or being ashamed prevents me from accomplishing it. Sometimes I regret it, because I feel bad or I chastise myself. But is 2021 so I hope for it to change.   u/DebStone, u/starboard-to-port, what are some of yalls goals?

The lovely u/huntfishcamp brought me here and I wanted to say that I am so proud of them 💖💓💕💘 they deserve so many wonderful things.   I’ve had super bad anxiety and depression too. So bad that I haven’t been able to sleep and take care of myself. I went 4 days without showering!!!! Cooking, brushing my teeth, etc is difficult. I have a lot of small goals for 2021 though to help me get through this.   I want to take care of myself. More than I did last year. Which wasn’t a lot btw!!! So this is pretty doable. I want to try and brush my teeth and wash my face everyday.  I want to eat healthier too. If I ate more fruits and veggies I wouldn’t feel as sluggish as I do.   u/Sirmiketheyoung what are your goals?

Sorry things have been tough. Not sure about the source of increased anxiety but it’s super high everywhere with everything going on. Not exactly solace to know so many feel this too, but I hope you recognize it’s common and don’t feel alone.   I find making a brainstorm task list to unclutter my head, then categorize and prioritize a balance of little (dust the kitchen window sill) and big (revise Chapters 9-10), then mark those suckers off as I do them, helps keep my head busy. Also, sometimes I set an “anxiety time” like an appointment and then when my anxiety come up, I say kindly, “oh, it’s not your turn. You’re scheduled for 3:15.” And I keep that appointment. I worry about all the things—- then when the time is up, I look at my list and pick a short easy thing snd do it. If intruding thoughts come, I remind them it’s not their turn...  I don’t know if that helps but it works pretty well most the time for me. I use that technique for the critical internal editor when I’m writing too.
I’m sure you’ve heard this plenty but I hope that the horrid wave of anxiety you’ve been dealing with has gotten to at least a manageable level of not completely overcome for now. Anxiety is always a rough onslaught. Also, I love your username. Bears are literally my favorite!  Regarding my 2021 goals, I have a few.  - get a full time job  - maintain a healthy diet and sleep schedule - prepare for moving  - have no regrets this year (or any other)!

u/RosieCakeness u/late_to_join_reddit   My goal is to hopefully lose 35+lbs this year, I lost 31 last year (I fell off my diet hardcore) so I'd like to lose more.  Another goal is to declutter/clean/reorganize a large potion if not the entire house before summer. I am giving myself until then, so that I don't feel overwhelmed that I have to do it all at once.  &#x200B;  I hope your anxiety is doing a bit better. Winter SAD makes this time of year so hard for me, it just piles on top of my usual depression and it's exhausting. I can't wait until spring.

I like the idea of goals. I'm not supposed to make "specific" ones like "read x amount of books" because apparently I drive myself mad. Haha.   But a goal I've been working on in counseling is learning to say no sometimes instead of yes. I'm definitely a people pleaser and I don't like conflict. I want everyone else to be happy even if it's at my own expense.   So that's my goal! Say no!

Waves of constant anxiety like that, on top of daily life stressors, can be so effing hard to push through at times. I'm glad you're making your way through it, and are looking into the future with optimism. Making goals (and the time we spend pondering on our goals) is so beneficial. I struggle with GAD every single day. Some are better than others. But I feel you. It literally just wears you out to even be conscious, sometimes.   My goal(s) are to take better care of my physical health: Lose weight/keep it off, establishing myself with my new psych and primary care doctors, and getting some things checked on that I'm worried about. I've put some of this off for years. But I have a child now, so I have to take care of myself in order to do my best for her. I'm also hoping that, somewhere in all of that, I might find an increase in self-esteem along the way.    https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2H53KOUAHYWIA?ref_=wl_share  u/orcprincess32 what are your goals for this year?

My goal for this year is to be healthier both mentally and physically. I know this seems like the typical new years resolution, but for me it is much more than that. My husband and I have been trying to conceive the last 4 years and I have been pretty ill while taking fertility drugs and doing what I need to do to get pregnant. The stressed has also affected our marriage, mental health and emotions. We decided at the end of 2020 that we are going to table the discussion of having a biological child for now. In the meantime, I want 2021 to be about me, my health, our relationship. So this year is about self care and wellness - not a number on a scale or clothes size.

Thanks for the tag, water bro!
Thanks for the tag :)   I AM GOING TO FINISH MY HECKIN NOVEL (first draft) THIS YEAR SO HELP ME GOSH.
Sounds like amazing goals!!! Thanks for the tag. How are you today? Happy Friday!
u/overthinkee1234, u/PositiveCompetition7, u/chloroform-girl
I'm trying to finish my novel and exercise more, too! :) I gained too much as well, just from sitting around way too much. Trying to do a bit of exercise every day after work.
Thank you for thinking of me!
Awesome goals!! I'm actually thinking of writing a book myself. But I've been using my alone time for much needed self care. Maybe that will be a 2022 goal for me!   I wish you all the luck!!
We have the same main goal my friend!! Same main goal!!   Although id love to start a Dane Rescue Sanctuary! Hehehe but that would be selfish of me, it should just be a Dane Rescue Organization. What’s your nonprofit about? Ive worked for 2 in my life!
Seriously, can you be any wiser and zen-like?! I honestly aspire to be more like you!!! My God! You just blow me away!
Thanks for the tag friend 😊
Thanks for the summons lovely :) I will add my comment 💜   I hope you finish your novel and you & your husband find your dream home 🏡
I haven't really got any goals this year, just take it all a day at a time at the moment. 🙂
Thank you for the tag! Your goal is a really good one and especially important during these days.
I need to cuss less, too. So far, 2021 had not been a good year for me cussing less 😂  I love that we tagged each other at the same time 💖
Thank you for the tag. 😊💚💚
Hi,I think he will absolutely succeed! Hes got a great mom 👍whose caring for much needed support!! Ty for the tag my dear🌞
Thank you for the sweet summons friend!  I have a resolution to show more compassion towards others and try to do 1 act of kindness every single day.  Plus, to journal more - I always forget then try to remember and write all down in one go and I need to use my generously gifted gratitude journal properly!!!
My main goal is increasing my savings and stability. Leaving my ex husband was hard, I left with the clothes on my back and not another cent and had to start over. It’s was really hard to restart my life. My fiancé and I want to buy a house so I’m saving for a down payment. Start a house folder of all the things we want to incorporate into our place :) get my daughter back for at least a visit - I have seen her for a weekend since February 2020 and she’s almost 4
Heyyyyyy!! 👋 thanks for the summons!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️ I was just checking to see if you entered yet so I could tag you!!! Totally beat me to it!!
Shut up!!! I’ll go to S Korea with you!!! I have family there!!!
Thank you bc I’m def trying to keep up!
You raaaaang? 😅 hi hi!! My goal, to counter your goal, is to avoid surgery this year!! lol
Hello my friend thank you for tagging me. I'm also attempting to try and get organized and teaching from home and I now have 2 special needs students so I'm going from one Room to the other from the couch to the chair to the table so I know the feeling wishing you all the best good luck in the contest
To be stable......
Home improvements are pretty fun! You'll have to show us some before 'n after pics of the Great Door Exchange of 2021!!  I'm going to start trying to finish applying for disability again. It's always frustrating. LOL
Good luck! My goal for today was to clean out my desk-it has a compartment built in that was full of all kinds of crap from last semester. I’ve been meaning to clean it up for months. It’s finally done! Going forward, my goal is to go hiking more as the weather gets warmer.
Hello there! My goal is definitely to try to organize myself, particularly in the office.  My brain needs a restful place
Thanks for the summons! A budget is a great goal! And meditation too.   I’m hoping to loose some weight, classic. I’m also starting a new hobby so I hope to make 5 twin sized quilts!
My goal is exactly the same as yours! How nice :) I’m trying to focus on smaller goals that will lead to my bigger goal overall!
Those are some really nice goals. Health is so important!
3 times a day?? What distance?
Thanks for the tag! My goal is to work on my self patience, lol. I get too easily aggravated with myself, and often it's over very little things. I need to give myself some slack, lol
Thanks for the tag! I definitely want to check out your etsy shop once you open it :)
<3 <3 <3
Well hello there friend!
That's a good goal!  I don't know what my goals are, I can't think of anything!
Really the only goal I have right now is to get back to work, and that decision lies with the powers that be!  Embrace being wrong, just be brave enough to admit it.
I believe in you! You’ll do it!
I think about you all the time sending you strong employment vibes. It'll happen! It just has to!!
AoiOkasan!!! Thank you for the tag!!!   I need to lose 20lbs! I wish we could do it together!! Bc my place also needs to be decluttered, cleaned, and organized!! Ive been saying it for 3yrs and so far it hasn’t happened 😂
Yaaaaas go you!! Graduate!!
good luck!! I hope you achieve all your goals and get what you want 💖💓💕💘
Not be as much of a mess? Does that count?
I love those goals! I know you can do it!
Thanks for the tag, friend. Been at doctor appts all day in Seattle. We got home a little bit ago. I'm sorry I missed the contest, but I have big hopes for this year. The biggest is a forever home for our family. Yours are excellent goals and I wish you all the best for 2021! 💚💚
Hey! Happy new year! Congrats on the first tat.   I have to learn to sew on a machine this year so I can finally finesse cosplays. 😅
Thank you thank you!! Sorry for the tag!! I did it prematurely!
Money.. isn’t it? LOL jk I mean at this point it’s the only goal I can have 😂😂 thanks for the best wishes!! Trust me you’ll know when I get a bite and might get an interview! You’ll AAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLL know 😂😂😂
I’m glad you know I can do it bc I don’t think I can do it!! 🤣🤣 I have no idea what things I’d like to work for.. I burned out in my last 2 fields and honestly, I’m barely out of bed depression so I haven’t really found a passion, yet. What do you think? I need a job that doesn’t require tons of specific experience unless it’s being senior staff (🤣) and pays a decent salary!
Thanks for the tag ❤️❤️
..... we’ll prevail after we finish our ridiculous 5D posters 🤣🤣🤣🤣 jk jk   Love that attitude!!! I’M W YA!!!
u/bt112506 u/Gwinblayd
Ya beat me to them!! 😂😂 👏👏👏👏
4! A good start.
Thank you!! We probably wont get it for another year but I want to start seriously saving for one! I SHOULD have had this all organized as its literally my job! haha Im a finance manager. But at the end of the day, its harder to organize my own than a companies lol
🥰
<3   a lot of cleaning  lmao  but also gaming and relaxing too I hope!
Thanks for the tag 💕
💕💕
"More reading, more moving..."  I'm stealing your resolution! Lol
Thanks for the tag. 😊💚💚
Any time, bro 💙
You are! And it's going to be amazing and as soon as you publish it I am going to buy it and read the heck out of it 💖
I'm doing well, thank you! Happy Friday to you, too!   It was a super busy morning, but I've got one class left to teach and then it's a 3 day weekend 🥰   How are you today?
Lol I just tagged you too 🥰
See, now I may be biased but...those are excellent goals :3
My nonprofit is for underserved/underprivileged teens, basically helping them realize their potential and showing helping them progress into productive beings. I wAnt to help them be their own bosses and also travel out of the state for leisure and also for college visits. I am a former middle school teacher and I also worked a local after school program for teens for a few years. I have so many things I want to do it’s hard to narrow down but I have to for funding and grants.  At least you know definitively what you want to do with yours. This is our year though!! We need to just do it.
Hahahah it’s been a LONGGGGGGGG journey!!! I’m popping a card in the mail for you today but if you ever want to swap stories, I’m sure we both have plenty to share 😂😂😂 peace comes from having battled many things 😂😂😂
Aw thank you!! <3 How are you today?
I hope each day becomes easier and better for you <3
Cussing less is the hardest lol
Saaaaay whaaaaat?? Cuss less?! I can’t... I wouldn’t even know how if I tried lmao jk!
you have made some big moves and it sounds like you have a plan to continue it through so i’m really happy to hear that you found someone better for you! I am praying hard that you get to spend more time with your daughter! 💜
SAY NO MORE. 😂 i’ll go in your suitcase if i have to! hehe
Yeah I feel ya. If your area hospital isn't up to snuff you need to avoid it like the plague.  I told you my doctor gave me the all clear to begin having surgeries, right? Just have to wait because we have zero ICU beds so surgeries are all canceled. It's very scary.
That’s time consuming. Is it SSA? If so and you have questions, feel free to chat me. I worked there a long time ago but may be able to offer some tips.
Way to get it done!
Omg haha I mean 3 times a week! Lol 3 times a day seems excessive! And not v far, few laps of the park
That's a great one, and I can relate to it at times for sure. Just remember that you're just as human as everyone else, and allowed to make just as many mistakes as other people and that doesn't change your worth or value - you matter, and are valuable!
Oh, c'mon...you know ya want the grits! :D
Ah I feel ya about procrastination. You're right, I really have to embrace it with open arms
Heheh, I guess we could work on the decluttering together if we work on plotting which space we'll work on decluttering at the same time and try and keep tabs on each other? :3
🥰
❤️❤️❤️
Thanks!
Happy new year! That sounds rad! Watcha gonna cosplay?
no worries! I never mind! lol
Sounds like a good plan. :) I can't think of any goals I have for this year... Isn't that sad?
What sorts of things interest you? Big or small!
You know it!!
In every joke there’s a bit of truth lol
For being almost the middle of Jan that is an amazing start!!! Good job!! Where do you find the time?
Sounds good! I hope it's a wonderful weekend :D
That sounds good to me!!!
💚💚💚
So long as you like fantasy drivel I'll send ya a free copy lol
Not bad, yay! I'm also doing well. Only one hour left of work and then a three-day weekend for me too YAY!
Aww 🥰
You and I are on the same wavelength, my friend!! 🌊
That’s an awesome nonprofit!! The downside to nonprofits is definitely being tied to grants and funding.   My Dane Rescue will always just be a dream! Maybe if I lived somewhere on a huge acreage and had the funds for tons of food, beds, and vet bills then I’d totally allow anyone to surrender their Danes to me! I don’t think I’d be able to watch any of them go though. That’d be the hardest for sure!! I had a foster dog and met a lady who only fostered Dobermans. She lived in a HUGE house w TONS of acreage everywhere- I already knew my Honey would thrive there so much more than w me- so I had her re-homed to that foster lady & I cried so hard after seeing her off!
Omgosh I’d LOVE to swap stories!!!
I’m pleased it’s Friday! Been a long old week! But I’m good, thank you :) how are you today?
It's so hard!! My husband is some magical unicorn that can turn his cussing off and on like a light switch. I'm so jealous.   Meanwhile, I'm the asshole accidentally letting a cuss word slip at the pediatricians office 🤷🏻‍♀️  What am I gonna do when my baby is old enough to repeat words?! I definitely gotta do better.
As a teacher, I feel like I overdo it in my private life to make up for having to censor myself at work 😂 I can't even say damnit without getting a write-up
Hahaha we’re going!! We leave from Georgia!!
Whhhhaaaatttt?!?! Aaaahhhhh that’s exciting!!!! Omg CONGRATULATIONS!!! 🎊🎉🎈 you know I’ll be sending you cards to keep you company!!!
Thanks! I think it is? Not sure. I got hurt years ago and there really are no jobs that are suitable for me. I have a spinal cord injury, that's why.
Lmao I thought maybe you were training for the Olympics or something 😂
🥰 you are so sweet. Thank you for that. Sometimes we just need a little reminder ❤️
Well, you said *besides* the grits!
I tend to make a super bigger mess when I try to declutter 😂😂😂 but lets give it a try!
Honestly I’m not sure entirely. But I definitely want to do a bunch of Bioshock and Borderlands characters. They’re the most fun to complete with makeup.   Btw tattoos are like Pokémon, be careful or you’ll want to catch them all LOL
Right?! Me either!! I love being tagged
I can think of a goal for ya! KEEPING ME SANE!! Trust me, hardest goal you’ll ever have in life 😅
I.... don’t know... 🤔 I know that sounds stupid but you know... it’s been a crazy 7yrs and well... let’s just say I have to find all these things over again! Likes, dislikes, hobbies, passions, the works!!
Hahah stop it!! You’re gonna make me sit and finish these posters today then!! LOL
Most of the books I read are pretty short maybe 300 pages at most. I just read at night after my daughter is in bed!
Yours too!!!!!
I love fantasy drivel 😍😍😍 It's seriously the bulk of my bookshelf
Yay!!! I'm off in 30 minutes 💖
Well never say never. You never know what the future holds. At least you are aware of your limitations right now and aren’t trying to get in over your head. Sometimes doing the right thing hurts the most. I know your baby knows you love her and you know she is being cared for and loved on.
Also very glad it's Friday!! Just looking forward to relaxing the rest of the evening :)
Hahaha it’s hard I have 2 kids who now tell me all the time mom you have a potty mouth 😂🤣
Oof that’s brutal!! I used to make the kids I had (for work) do wall sits with arms up and push ups if they cursed but they had noooooo idea that when I spoke without them around, it was a curse word every other word and sometimes every word LMAO!!
😊🧡
Cheesy grits with a *side* of butter garlic grits then! LOL!!
That'd be dope! Either the little sister or the girl from infinite would be cool ideas  And I already feel that lmao I need more
Hahaha!  That's a good goal.  I'll work really hard on it!
I would start small then, perhaps a specialty store like an art supply store or a book store or if you like tools (just as an example) a hardware store because typically people go to those stores because they know what they want! Or maybe a consignment store or the container store is a fun one! Haha
Hahaha Omg!! But yeah same 😂
WELL THEN YOU'RE TOTALLY GETTING A COPY!
I told my students once (joking) that I was going to get a swear just and make them put a dollar in each time to find an end of the year class party.  And of course one complained to his parents that I was encouraging swearing and I got in trouble 🙄
Nah, it's all in one - cheese, butter, salt, and garlic! :D
You’re gonna have to! It’s not gonna be easy!!!!
I like it I like it!! But I’m not sure if any of these places are hiring right now! Doesn’t hurt to look and ask around! ❤️
YAY!!! I shall give it the best Goodreads review 💖💖💖
Omg.... wowwwwww did ya tell that family to pull their sticks out their asses?! Watch that kid grow up to cuss worse than all of us 😂😂😂 repressed angry curser coming right up! lol jk but I am really sorry you deal w so much BS at work!
I just had to set my container of grits out on my counter to remind me to have some later! LOL
Hahaha! :)  How's your day going?
Idk if you have Target around you but in my state they just upped their starting wage and it would be a good place to get a discount!! Also with your personality perhaps a coffee shop!!!
Noooo you got be an honest poptart.
Ah, it's all good. I knew what I was getting into teaching in a super conservative county. They're paying for a lot of my certifications, though, so when I finish all those up I'm looking to teach elsewhere.  It's been nice being online this year! Far less BS
That's an excellent strategy!
I’m barely getting up and deciding I don’t like it so it’s back under the covers for me 🤪 got my bbb (big booty boy) snuggled here w me so eyes should be shutting in 3...2....zZZZzzZ 😴😴😴
I personally hate Target now but it’s bc I had a string of bad experiences w them in my late 20s lol
I will be an honest poptart! I know I'll love it 💙  I already know from reading your short stories on here that I'll be able to wax poetic about your imagery and tone perfectly evoking the mood of the piece
Oof... super conservative county... yup, that’s a tough one! I worked w troubled inner city youths so cussing was the total opposite problem for me! Couldn’t get them to stop!! Finally found making all of them do push-ups, wall sits, burpees, etc, got them to watch what they say around me!! LOL   That’s awesome that they pay for your certs!! Hahaha you should be like adios MFers!!! Lol jk jk!! I’m glad you caught a break w online teaching! You deserve it! Definitely deserve it!
We'll see....we'll see if I remember to make 'em even after sittin' 'em out! LOL
Nice! I love going back to bed.
Ooooo hahahahah
Ah, I love the phrase wax poetic. Highest honors <3   Well buckle up everyone because I'm doing a thing this year!
Thank you so much 💖
Hopefully the reminder helps!
It was superbbbbbbb
Seeeeee more story swapping!! lol!!
Yay 💖💖💖
Excellent!

u/jessdb19, the random roller chose you! Some doggy treats are heading your way!
Oh that's awesome! Thank you!!  I was just thinking I needed to buy more of these because my dog LOVES them. (Plus, it's helping add weight back onto him)  Dog tax for the buddy that gets them - [https://i.imgur.com/u3HbBuR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/u3HbBuR.jpg)
Oh what a cutie! Please give him a pat for me!

'You have saved our lives, we are eternally grateful'     I love this so much!
Always wanted one!! Looks super amazing!! Have you seen people cutting their heads and finding goodies?
Such a cute caption/title

Is the 1st photo not showing up? Bc it’s not showing up for me, there should be two
What are you talking about!! It’s about time you are gifted and OMG what can be a better gift that the **********?! Although come to think of it, maybe that was selfish of me bc I kept thinking about how many ppl’s lives you’ll be touching! Hmm ok lemme go see if I can find something a bit more fun!  I totally forgot it’s a surprise gift so I really hope I didn’t spoil it LOL
I see both
I see two photos!!!
Thank you! My stupid phone gives me so many problems when it comes to Reddit for some reason!
Yayyyy as long as you can see them!
Unfortunately the mobile is glitchy sometimes.

Don’t worry, me too! 🙈
Hahah high5 for us!! Lol

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/ky11mv/activity_lets_play_guess_the_nice_thing_i_just/
This is my first activity. I just did something kind for someone, and it made me feel good! Perform a random act of kindness, it can be anything and it doesn't have to cost money. Then, say below "I just did a random act of kindness!" And then let people ask you questions to figure out what you did! Like 20 questions of kindness! If we don't get it in 20, tell us what you did!
Ooo I want to play although I'm not sure what I can do from bed (in self isolation and feeling icky from pregnancy)
I did a random act of kindness and she'll never suspect it was me! 💕
I did a random act of kindness today. And it saved someone from embarrassment. ☺️
I just did a nice thing!
I just did a random act of kindness (or half of one anyways) 😅
I just did a random act of kindness - not really random is your first clue!
I just did an act of kindness!
I just did a random act of kindness!
Oh, I hope you feel better! I'm going to interpret that as your first clue though. u/lillypop24 is performing an act of kindness that she can only do from her bed :)
Did you send something?
hmmm... embarrassment? Tricky! Um... did it help them with their job?
Did it involve fixing a clothing malfunction?
Yay! Was it for a stranger?
Was it for a relative?
Did you do it from home?
Yeah, I can't leave as I'm in isolation
Are you at home?
Did you give a "gift of self" (non-material)?
Where are you?
Was it for a stranger?
Is the game that I now have to guess what I can do? 😅
Yep yep. This person is having a rough row. Needs a little pouch me up. So without telling them and the world a package has been sent! I love Amazon for anonymous gifting!! 💕
Nope
Yes it did!
Nope!
Yes!
Did it involve your phone?
Yes - but it was done over the phone
Nope. it was more an act of service.
Scotland
No
LOL. I can think of numerous things!
Oh, did you give them something beautiful or funny?
That's awesome! I always appreciate when people do that for me when that happens.
did it involve giving something?
Was it a common household chore?
Nope
Was it someone you know personally?
Did you call a relative?
Hmmmm... did it help a community or an individual?
I meant more as in are you home or out 😅
I want to be where you are! So the thing you did this morning was it for someone at home?
I've thought of something (not far from bed) that I can do 😅
Beautiful like they are.
I didn’t hands on fix the problem but I helped lol  Us girls gotta look out for each other
Yes!
Nope!
Yes
I called for a relative
An individual!
Lmao sorry. I’m in bed actually, it was this morning I did the thing 🤣
No
Is it digital?
Aw... can they wear it?
Is this specifically a feminine issue that needed help? As it, hey friend, do you have any spare lady products in your purse?
Yeah we do! Girl power! lol
Was it in this community?
A parent?
Ohhhh... “for” a relative. Did you make them an appointment?
Is this person related to you?
Did it involve you buying something for someone else?
Did you give to a charity?
Nope
Nope it's pretty and useful!! 💕
Haha No I suppose this could happen to men as well depending on there clothing preference
Nope!
yes!
Hmm, not exactly
No. Got our year old cat a heat pad for Christmas, she has zero interest in it, gave it to my boss for her 23 year old kitty, she was thrilled because she was thinking about getting her one. Sorry for ruining it by telling, but I dropped my son off to go back to Uni and came home to find out one of my closest friend’s husband just died. He was only 44. I’m still in shock.
Was it for someone you live with?
Well, I was thinking like a feminine hygiene product :) Ha!  Was it an automotive issue? (I'm all over the place here!)
Was it to a charity?
Is it your spouse?
Oh my goodness. I’m so sorry. You must be shocked. That was a sweet act of kindness. Do take good care of yourself today.
Yeah
No way off I’m not the one you want helping to fix a car problem lol
No
Nope. My mom.
Was it for your spouse/partner?
Getting colder.... hmmm.... wait, was that clothing thing a clue?
Was it for someone at home?
Hmmm... did you do her grocery shopping?
Yeah
Yes you can read it as a clue 😉
Yes it was!
Nope. It has to do with her doggos!
Did it involve food?
Oh, did you walk your mom's dogs for her?
Nope!
Yes! I went over while she was at work and took them for a walk!
Did it involve honey-do or DIY project?
Yay! That’s so nice of you!!! I bet she really appreciate your kindness!
Nope!
Yes, she was very happy! And I got some doggo snoot-boops and tail-wags in my day!
Did it involve flowers? 💐
Double win!
Was it a family activity?
Nope!
Yes :D
Nope!
Did you cook for someone?
Well yes but that's not it 😂
Blast! Ok! I think we’re at our limit. Tell us! :)
I bought my little sister a small elephant plushie so she can think of me when I'm not there, she was sad that she'd have to miss me
Aw. That's so sweet! I bet she loved it!

Enjoy!

I think I sent that to you too!
You did. I got confused. Allow me to make you a thank you post. Thank you very very much for correcting me. I’m so sorry!
It’s OK!  I thought I screwed up and selected something wrong since I’m a newbie ...And flaky.
Nope! It was me lol. You very much deserve the credit for this! Xoxo

u/sleepdeprivedmama thank you for this!! I have so enjoyed the first gift you gave me. And now this! I’m so sorry for my mess up earlier. I feel really bad. Thank you for speaking up!
No worries!  I’m glad you like it!  It says the third thing I ordered will be there Jan 29-Feb 3!
Yay! Thank you for being so generous!!!

Thanks again u/laciepauline! I’m so excited to try so many of these recipes! All the art and photos in the book are fantastic! 🥰
Ooo I've been eyeing that book for a while! How is it?
Your kitty looks like they’re gonna enjoy the book more than you
I'm so glad that you like it! That makes me quite happy.  Also your kitty cat is adorable!
It’s gorgeous 😍 Every recipe has a little description that ties it into the D&D universe. Most of them that I’m sitting here fawning over seem super easy to prepare, and customizable to your liking. I need to do some grocery shopping now lol
He’ll probably try to gobble up some of the stuff I’ll make too!
Thank you!😻
Oooo, yup, that sounds perfect. Well now I definitely gotta find a copy!
Oooohhh there’s no doubt about it!! He will be the main taste tester!
Food critique of the year
Good luck! It was back ordered so it took awhile to get to me - hopefully you can find one available soon!
He is pretty snooty about foods. He probably would be a food critic if he were human 😸

Adams family is a golden oldy and an absolute gem!!
Looks like you got your weekend planned :)! Great movies.
I love the Addams family! Only watched these about 6 weeks ago :)
Addams Family Values is one of my all-time favorites
u/Redherring19702 Thanks so much! I didn’t realize you sent 3 movies! You’re too kind :) And they came just in time for the weekend :D
It is! I’m so happy to own it :)
Haha I do!! So excited :D
Nice!! It’s such a fun movie
Same here! I definitely wanted to own that one :D
Hope you enjoy! All good movies to own.
Yes! Thanks again so much!! :D

Oh Lord! You are in for it. The second book is so-so and the third thru fifth is mostly setup for the first major arc (finishes at book 12 with epilogue for arc in book 13). The first book is addictive tho. The series really takes off around "dead beat" (book seven I think?) So be prepared for a wild ride starting about halfway through that one that won't let go (I just finished the latest book!)
I AM SO EXCITED FOR YOU!   Please read and come back to geek out with me!
I’m going to have to see if my library is open and if they have these before I start reading, then. If not, I don’t want to start without owning a few more at least 😅
For sure!! 😄

u/ShreddedKnees thank you for the book, I'm tucked up in bed with my youngest (trying to get him to nap) ready to give it a read. I'm excited to learn more tools to help me and my eldest ❤
You got this! my mom raised two autistic kids on her own. It’ll take work but so does any child really!
If you ever have questions for an autistic adult, feel free to PM me
Wow you got it so quick! Hope you enjoy it!
You’re a wonderful mom! 💜💜💜
Thank you, I have autism and adhd myself actually but it wasn't diagnosed until adulthood. I think me being neurodiverse is part of the issue really, I was never given the tools or info for myself let alone someone else. I had the hardest time growing up because I had no support and no one that understood, I want to make sure I don't fail him at home with my lack of knowledge.

I didn’t even know this was a thing
I totally forgot they launched that! Dangerous!
I tried using an Amazon handmade shop for a necklace for a friend's Christmas present, but the person making the necklace backed out of the sale at the last minute. I'm following this discussion though! I want to hear about some good shops out there!
Have you also seen the Amazon pages for [woman owned businesses](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=17964635011) and [black owned businesses](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=21382093011) and [support small](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=17879387011) ?
Two Goats Candle Co has amazing soy candles!
What is Amazon handmade?!
Thanks everyone. Now I'll spend my entire evening looking at all of this.
Oh no  My wallet...it...it's scared
Gosh. Dangit.  Like I didn't have work to still do XD NEVER CHECK REDDIT ON A TIME CRUNCH. I wish to snoop these stores so bad!
I kinda love it!
Oh no!  That’s good to know.  Were you able to review so other people know this happened?
I haven’t!  Thank you for sharing this 🙏🏼
Check it out [here](http://www.Amazon.com/handmade).  It’s like the Etsy of Amazon!
Not *necessarily* a bad thing!
😃🤣
There’s always tomorrow!
Yes, I reviewed them to let others know. But I really hope they were able to fix things. Their jewelry was really pretty.
Awesome, I've never heard of it!

I have a percival graves one that I love
I only have two. They're a set that came together in one box...Freddie Krueger and Jason Voorhees! I love 'em!
My wife is an old emo kid still. She loves her Brendon Urie (Panic at the Disco) and Gerard Way (MCR) pops but my favorite she has is the "Hot Topic Guy" it's just a Funko vision of a male Hot Topic Employee they released for their 25th anniversary. 🤘🤣🖤
My favorite is my Buddy the Elf and Mr. Narwhal.
I would love a Jamie Lannister with his gold hand pop. AND the David rose chase, which is on my list cuz a girl can dream, right? Lol. My favorites I own are my Superbad trio and a couple of my GOT pops - lyanna Mormont, the hound, bron and ser brienne!
So, I have apparently been living under a rock and I only just learned about Funko Pop when somebody showed me an eeyore one. I gifted him to myself for Christmas and he is just the most adorable thing. Now I want to collect so many more! I want all of the FRIENDS characters as well as some Harry Potter and Disney ones. This is dangerous lol
I love Funko! Have you seen thy series that's coming out this month for starwars valentine's day?!  I use to have the characters from Book of Life, but they're lost forever :(
I have two favourites! My Tiny Rick which is the first present my boyfriend ever got me. And my Freddie Mercury... the second present my boyfriend ever got me.
I love the pokemon ones! I don't have any just yet but I plan on getting them soon!
I have two different variations of Spyro and they're so awesome! Also Steve Irwin is a close favourite
Fraggle rock series i love the most. Reminds me of my childhood
My Van Gogh one. I take silly pictures of him doing funny stuff in Virginia and post on my Instagram Van Gogh on the go lol  I want RBG though and John wick
At Christmas we had a very funny moment. [I got my daughter The Nightmare before Christmas Funko game](https://imgur.com/a/67XqDCE), my son got her the Sally funko mug, and she got me the movie moment 😂
I covet the Nightmare Before Christmas movie moment, with Jack and Sally on the hill ❤️
I don't have a single one! I wish to collect atleast some from the Harry Potter series
Murphy and Connor MacManus from the Boondock Saints are my favorites that I have!
I don’t have any but my son (13) collects them - so far he has my hero academia ones :) plus some others but idk what they are
I don’t have any and am not super interested in collecting them in general, but I am OBSESSED with the Elliot one from Disney’s Pete’s Dragon. It’s sooooooo cute 😭😍
I have a bunch of Disney princess ones because I am obsessed. I've also started a GoT collection, and I have a couple video game characters. I would eventually like to collect all The Witcher characters because it's my favorite game.
I used to have one before my grandma threw it out. Now I want to get the office series. Dwight Funko Pop is the one that I love
There's only one in our house, as of now lol. I got my wife one from The Office series of Dwight Schrute as Belsnickle. I hate The Office a lot less than I used to. I'm still not a fan, but it's not at that "If I hear their voice one more time, I'm breaking the TV" level of hatred anyone lol.   .... perhaps that's an overreaction?..... Still, do not like. But, it makes her happy and it makes her laugh, so I'm good with that.
I have some Pokémon ones.
Series wise I adore the Lord of the Rings ones. The designs are all really nice I have quite a few of the villains (Witch King, Sauron, Lurtz, Nazgul and Dunharrow King) and only hero I have is Legolas lol (but I'd like to get Elrond, Aragorn and Gandolf). I have Legolas standing on top of a rubik's cube which makes him above all the villains and I find that a bit funny.
I’ve got 4-Princess Leia, Baby Yoda, Sirius Black, and a hockey player from my city’s team. Leia was a gift, Sirius was a random thrift store find, and I bought Yoda and the hockey one. I really want the Golden Girls ones.
I love the movie moment of Captain America fighting Thanos - it was the first thing I bought with my stimulus check last year 😂😂😂 paid a premium to have it shipped from Australia but it was worth it because it was an exclusive and the only one left on Amazon.
I’ve got Steve Irwin. He’s the coolest! I covet RBG and then Audrey II since that’s my favorite movie
My favorite one I own is Orisa from Overwatch. I have quite a few Overwatch ones, but I would really like to finish my collection one day :) Or at least get all the healers haha
I don't have many but I absolutely love my Night King sitting on the Iron Throne.
I only have 1, Audrey Horne from Twin Peaks.
My favorite is Hisoka from HxH. I even bought two. haha.   I have Elliot from Mr. Robot which is a good series!   Some others I have and adore are Kirito from SAO and Hollow Ichigo from Bleach.
I love all of the ones from Persona 5, and Gaara from Naruto.  :)  I really want the two leads from Miraculous Ladybug, but they are super expensive...  :(
I haven't recieved them yet, but my mom got me some funkos for my birthday! I have a Star Wars themed desk so she got me Padme, Rey and Leia! They will make a great addition to my decor. Other than that, I haven't got any other Funko Pops. I think the set with Flora, Fauna and Merryweather from Sleeping Beauty are super cute though, I may get them someday.
I actually don’t have any. I’m toying with the idea of starting a collection. If I do, it’ll be Harry Potter for sure.
I don’t have any yet but I have been eyeing a Wonder Woman one that is for breast cancer.  Thinking that might be a great start to a collection.
My fav funko so far is the only one I have ever bought for myself , I have a pact that I only get them as gifts.  But the one I bought was Zoltar from the movie Big.  If you know, you know
I only have one so far!! A hockey player!!
Sailor moon and pokemons ❤️
I love percival! I was so mad he wasn’t in fantastic beasts 2! I bought his pop as soon as I saw it in the shop :D it’s so cool.
I just recently bought his because I adore his character and oh my god am I surprised to see someone else who likes him. Doesn't it suck that he wasn't mentioned at all in the 2nd fantastic beasts movie?
The hot topic guy is hilarious!
Oh those are adorable!!!
Narwhal is cute. I haven’t seen Buddy. I’ll look.
I hate how they're usually only available for a very short time period and then suddenly they stop making them and you can only find them for 5x the price (or more). I desperately wanted the old Simpsons ones when they came out, but they're $100+ each now. Yeah, no thank you. lol So if you're gonna get them, you'll want to try to do so while they're still in production. Some only release for like, a day, and then that's it. Ugh!
Spyro looks cool!
Oh fun! I could see that
That’s funny with Van Gogh!
Fun!
Oh that's a gorgeous one indeed!
I like the NBC ones!
I was looking at the Harry Potter for grandkids...
I don’t either... yet!
It is!
What GOT do you have?
So not a fan of that show either
Golden girls! Haha, cute!
Glad you got it!
That one is super cute!
She's soooo cute!
I’ve got a hockey player one too! What’s your team?
Oh, both good! I like the pink cat ear girl.
Yes, highly disappointing
Eeeeps! So much pressure!
Ty
Guess what our favourite movie is 🤣
It really is!
They’re so nice! So far I have a Sally :)
I definitely will start collecting them once I can actually pay for them on my own
I have Daenarys on the Throne, Jon Snow riding Rhaegal, Arya Stark, a Child of the Forest, and Yara Greyjoy. I really want Ghost, because he is freaking adorable 😂 but I definitely want to collect them all
Hey thanks!!
I know right.  Lol
Pittsburgh Penguins!! What's yours?
Feels so good to have someone think the same
God bless Ghost
Nashville Predators!
Enemies!!! Hahahaha just kidding!!!
Yeah, I wasn’t sure if I should even reply when I saw Pittsburgh lol. But you’re on Reddit talking about NHL Funkos, you can’t be that bad.
hahahah! I promise I'm not bad!

Hi! I've been watching this community from a far for some time now but have never introduced myself! I 2as introduced to kindness to strangers through the Secret Santa Reddit exchange two years ago and it changed NY life. I enjoy very much giving to others when I can with a thoughtful gift or gesture.  Well, I guess I'll tell you a bit about myself! I'm a male in my 20s. I studied Design and Visual Communication and I'm currently trying to get my degree. I finished my thesis but Covid has F things up to get a date for my final exam. I wrote it on Character Design, Semiotics, Pixel Art and Concept Art. I love video games, of course. I worked as a QA Tester last year for a company that gives that service to game studios worldwide. Things didn't pan out due to me needing to finish my studies, so I had to resign. Video games have always been a big part of my life. I love them since I was a kid because they are entertaining and they make me think about life. BUT, I love movies even more. They are my favorite medium. I aspire to become a filmmaker and I'm currently writing a script with a friend and learning DaVinci Resolve (video editing software). My favorite movie from these past few months is Druk by Thomas Vinterberg. I also love music and listening to complete records from a lot of different musicians. Radiohead is my favorite band, but I like a lot, a lot of different music and I've spend a lot of time making thoughtful playlists with music I think that works together in a nice flow.  Sadly, I'm unemployed since last November and life's been quite difficult without a job to support me. I suffered from chronic depression for 10 years or more of my life and I can say I'm finally free (but with some low days from time to time). I live with my parents and I worry constantly about burdening them by being here. Where I live, it's acceptable to live with your parents in your 20s due to the difficult economic circumstances and low pay rates. I have a SO with whom I spend a lot of time on video calls everyday and we try to share everything we like when day life commitments aren't keeping us occupied.  I have a podcast on film and TV shows impressions and analysis! It's in Spanish. It's called Second Breakfast. It's a love project by me and my girlfriend. It's been fun, but we don't have many followers nor views. Our most listened episode is our first one with 85 views.  Uhh, I'm also learning Japanse but it's difficult to be constant. Been learning for more than a year and a half (maybe). Oh, I also love basketball and training to be better at it, but haven't done it since quarantine started almost a year ago now...  Tell me about yourself. Also, you can ask me anything!
Hi and welcome! You sound super cool! You have so much going on in your life it sounds like (In a good way) and I think it's really neat that you want to be a filmmaker

Happy New Year! Sure a thing!   My favorite Holiday is Christmas. I really love Secret Santa and I get very excited of gifting to a random stranger online and get to know that person a little. Also, it's a time of relaxation with my family. I love the positivity around Christmas.  Mmm I love the sounds of nature. I particularly love to hear birds sing and I find the sound of rain and the waves relaxing. I love contemplating nature, whether it's a forest or any animal living and breathing.  That's very admirable! You're a kind person, then :) Giving education, happiness, etc. to other people and living beings is very nice. Love carries the world towards a better place, always.  What about your favorite holiday and favorite thing about nature?
Heya! My favorites video games are Castlevania Symphony of the Night, almost every game from the Mega Man series and Trails in the Sky FC. I like to try games in every genre I can. What games have you enjoyed watching people play? I enjoy watching speedruns from [GDQ](https://www.youtube.com/user/gamesdonequick) :)  Mmm favorite fantasy animal. I like Appa, the big flying bison from Avatar: The Last Airbender. What about you?
Here it is, Isis! Hope you like it! It's my little baby. Write us a comment if you enjoy it <3  http://hyperurl.co/2o8z3k https://www.instagram.com/segundo2desayuno/
I understand that. I have a shop so I'm self employed but I've had to temporarily shut it down
Well hello there every day that I wake up is a holiday so I really don't have a favorite and I like to bring nature outdoors indoors every single day I have my windows open to shades are up I keep a couple windows cracked for some fresh air for me in my cat and just listening to the birds singing every day I absolutely love it. Have a wonderful evening
That's awesome! I like watching people play older games like Spyro and Rayman on Youtube. And Octodad videos are always a funny time! Idk the Appa. I'll have to look it up! I like unicorns.
I, that's a bummer. I know it's been hard for small-medium sized businesses. Can I ask what service or good you provided? :)
Unicorns are cool haha. Rayman and Spyro were a big part of my childhood!
Sure, I made earrings mostly! Like made from miniature things or epoxy resin. Like paint pallettes, strawberries, Tombstones, etc. I also want to get into making collars/chokers when I open back up
Yes! I spent so much time playing Rayman and Spyro growing up. We also had the Polar Express PS2 game that we played all the time. That was a hard game actually lol. Oh! And have you ever played Kirby?
Ohhhh that's cool! Could I see some pictures?
Oh I've never played that one haha. Yes, but I find it Kirby games to be too easy. I do find them charming though, but have never finished one
Sure! https://photos.app.goo.gl/DL3qx2w8n2A1Sbqo9
I totally agree that Kirby is easy. Part of its charm, lol. Plus, Kirby is so cute!
Wow those look nice. Hopefully you can reopen again soon!

Spam is so good.
Squirrel spoon is mainly used for rice :) you can use it for anything, but we use it for short grain rice. The little dots help to prevent the rice from sticking to it. In Korean we call it 밥주걱 which translates to rice spatula :)
u/AireyLynn thank you for these three adorable skwerl spoons! one has escaped into the sink because it spread sour cream oh so perfectly! and now the other two are exploring my meaty experiment :D   spam spam spammity spam
sizzled them in a pan and I had two very small slices, that was more than enough for now
yes I know they are for rice, but I like to use a fork for it instead, they were just a cute thing I had on my list and will get used for anything and everything :D
😋 yumm
Gotcha. I thought you didn’t know bc on the bottom of your pic it says “What is this?” They are super cute! Congrats!
oh no! that was because they were looking at the SPAM :D

These looked lovely and I know you've been stressed. Please take you time and relax! 💜 u/happiness0101
Omg you're so awesome. Thank you so much
You're welcome! REMEMBER TO TAKE YOU TIME! lol  Ive found things like arts and crafts. . or reading and gaming to be perfect for just taking my mind off of stress and putting me in a better place. Especially with how cold it is out right now and that I cant go on walks. <3
Thank you. Definitely something I'm trying to do.

u/tmrajgray thank you sooo much for this! It smells sooo good and is so relaxing! (Even Sam agrees it makes him ready for sleeps! 😂)
Haha I love the silly kitty pic!
I keep seeing this bubble bath pop up - does everyone like it?
Look at that big yawn!! I wanna pet your kitty so bad
If you get the chance, you should check out the pink Himalayan salt one. Something about the scent is super soothing and I like it even better than the lavender :)
Oooo I hear this one is phenomenal!!!
Big yawn! Lol so cute
Naw kitty 🥰 thanks you for sharing and glad you like it 💜
Lol thank you!!
It’s my first time trying it and it’s fantastic!
Thanks so much for the suggestion! I will definitely try it! 😊

Welcome back to the John Woods testing centre! Today's specialty is telling you which famous or infamous person you might be related to! I may also explain how you're related to them. This can be anything from Jack the Ripper to Obama to a random Florida man.  So enter at your own risk! To enter, you must comment something about yourself. This can be mundane or interesting to.

The first time I was in uni, I was dual majoring in philosophy and psychology. Now that I may have the opportunity to further my education, I'd like to once again study philosophy, but also branch out into physics. I suppose I just really like asking, *"Why?"*  Also, whoever you give me, I'm probably going to have to Google them; I only know of like three famous people.
Some people tell me that my eyes are little pools of death..
I’ve lived in the same place within about 10 miles, for decades. My hubby has NEVER lived in the same place for 10 years.

How fun   I am seriously the clumsiest woman known to man. I don’t know how I do half the things I manage to do to myself.     Like seriously anything you can do to injure yourself short of breaking a bone I’ve done it. A few years ago at the gym I fell off a tread mill WHILE IT WAS STOPED. (Who does that🤷🏽‍♀️) Busted every blood vessel in my ankle just short of breaking it. Ankle blew up like a grape fruit and I was on crutches for a month. 😫
I have big alien eyes 👽
Your grandmother was justified in her actions and clearly the only reason she was possibly going to jail was because she was native. How unfortunate. I hope she got the grocery money back as well as an apology.  You are related to Buffy Sainte-Marie who is is an Indigenous Canadian-American singer-songwriter, musician, Oscar-winning composer, visual artist, educator, pacifist, and social activist. Throughout her career in all of these areas, her work has focused on issues facing Indigenous peoples of the Americas. I recommend listening to her song called "Universal Soldier".

Haha I love E.T 🤪 That is pretty sweet though! 👽

I had a feeling you would! 🖤🖤🖤
I thought you'd enjoy that :3 glad to know I was right!
😂 😂 😂 Trust me, if I ever found out that through some twisted way I was related to Big Neck Ed, I'd drop off the face of the earth
Exactly!!!!
Awesome!! :))
😂 I think he most definitely can!
😂 LOOOOOL what?! You're actually related to her? :0
Very very strange indeed! What a weird coincidence.
:) I remember the important small details lol
Woah really?! 😂 Omg. Just type in Dwight from The Office.
Oh jheez, nope nope nope! 😂 Did not mean that at all lmao.
Awesome!! I had a feeling you'd like who you were related to :3
I don't know if I should feel afraid... Or worked up..👀😏
I just imagine you, sitting in a log cabin wrapped in the Canadian flag eating poutine and apologetically shaking your head at this crazy and probably loud American woman with a history of violence, intrigue, and mathematics. I hope you imagine me wearing a denim jumpsuit with the American flag printed on it, eating McDonald's in a Walmart 😂  Also, Canada and Mexico are also in America, so I think it's kind of BS that "American" refers to a country and not a continent. That's like if France decided that *they* were the only Europeans and that everyone else had to identify only by country. Like, what's up with that?
You and me both, man.
Not that I'm aware of. However, the late Kirk Douglas and Michael Douglas bare resemblances to my maternal grandfather's side so we're curious if they're cousins. My mom showed me a photo of Kirk when he was in his 40s, I think and asked me who it was. I said, Uncle Sy! Wrong. LOL
LOL! I see the resemblance :D
Oh, whew!!! I was gonna say....he's too dingdongdangity handsome to die!
😂😂😂
Well damn. That is quite interesting lmao. Perhaps reincarnation 0_0 (queue X-files and Twilight Zone theme songs)
😂 😂 😂 😂 He's in tip top shape! Don't worry!
Oh, thank goodness!! He's a handsome feller!!

Welcome!
Photographer here! What is your favorite thing to photograph? And what makeup skills have you learned so far?  Welcome to the sub!
I have a pitbull mix and a chihuahua terrier mix
My favorite holiday is probably either Christmas or Halloween. Halloween brings back good memories for me and Christmas I love because I get to give my friends gifts. I love nature so much. I used to live by this beautiful forest and I miss it a lot. I love how peaceful everything would feel when I went on a walk in the woods like nothing else mattered in the moment. I have two dogs who I love and I have a stepsister who is special needs and one of my favorite people
I love listening to music to relax!
I can send some of my artwork if you'd like to see it?

Yes I would love that!

u/soxgal , thanks for helping me deatroy the patriarchy in style!  As suspected, my niece has ready tried to convince me it was intended for her and i got it by mistake.
I know I received one of these from u/hippyaltaccount  I love it.  We can be twins now - smashing the patriarchy!
u/Rainbowterfly, thank you for my awesome dinosaur plug. I’m glad that somebody appreciates my weird sense of humor, and I actually needed a new plug for my bathtub which is why I had thought of it at that time. It also came with a little gift bag and a little cloud bracelet, so that was pretty cool.
It was u/Rainbowterfly 😃
You can share if you want :)
Lets crush them!  *crushes patriarchy and then goes to Costco for pizza*
You're welcome!  Enjoy ☺️
When Lily wants something, whether I *want* to share becomes a moot point. Lol. Shes a good kid, really.

Quote of the Day : homemade macaroni and cheese, or grits with cheese, or tomato soup with grilled cheese... maybe it's just hot melty delicious cheese  why are we feeling pinchy? it's not St. Patrick's day!
I am so very proud of my daughter. She has been battling for her health with many immuno complications. Running tests to get some answers led to finding she had a hardening liver, abnormal bone biopsy and crazy thyroid (which she had removed after 9 years of meds).  Today she said that on top of her healthy eating, intensive vitamins and EO's, she has been 8 months sober and her dr said that her liver is no longer hard. He said her case is unique as non of her symptoms make sense and test results just confuse them more.   But everything is leading to no cancer!  She has been working hard and it is paying off. I am so proud of her <3
Goood morning everyone! Still feeling the after effect of over doing yesterday. Finished scarf 4 to start scarf 5. I got my coffee about to get more. Hubby gets off early today so we are going to see about recruiting a new coffee frother for coffee service. I’m gonna make jerk shrimp for dinner.  Added a butt ton more books to my I want to read list. Gotta love having a planner for that one 😊
Happy Friday!!!! I started work extra-early today so I could finish early (nothing beats working from home and setting your own schedule!). Hoping to go for a short run later and work on a hummingbird paint-by-number I've been neglecting. Sending you all happy vibes for your day <3  QOTD: Definitely Hungarian plum dumplings! They're made of potato dough and filled with half an Italian plum that's sprinkled with cinnamon-sugar. Then they're boiled, then coated in browned bread crumbs. They're SO good.
Hi everybody! Thanks to everyone who reached out to me yesterday. I'm doing so much better today and bonus: have an appointment with a therapist and psychiatrist in a couple of weeks. I realize that the severity of the mental dip must be related to hormones.   Anyway, today I have a bunch of work to do since I slacked a little yesterday. Gotta get tons of stuff together for /u/Lucy_leigh225 and my podcast, and also have to figure out how to format some of the free stories, etc. that I'm putting up on the website. So so close to launch!
Happy Friday everyone! We had a crazy night of insane wind. Gusts were at 50 mph (80 kph) and it kept me up all night long. Things have died down but they're bound to pick up again today. Not much going on today. Someone please make me take Christmas down. I have no self discipline to make myself do it. We will just live in Christmas land forever I guess.  Qotd: I had a migraine the other night and my husband brought home Little Ceasars pizza. I didn't realize it until then that LC pizza is totally my comfort food. I ate 4 slices, one after the other, and then my migraine went away.
Happy Friday! The garage project is going well! I even have someone on their way to take this vanity that we replaced out of my garage. :)  Hopefully tonight, I can go to bed having the last of the bathroom hardware installed in the master and half baths and maybe get the last of the kitchen stuff situated.  It's all coming together. :)  I hope everyone is having a fantastic day!
Qotd- Mac and cheese  I REALLY HOPE WE GET SNOW THIS WEEKEND❄️☃️⛄️🌨
Happy Friday, everyone!  :)  Ice cream and chips!  I can eat way too much of both...  I have to control my portions, haha.
I’ve been totally MIA from this sub all day! Lots of errands to run and just wasn’t on my phone. I hope you all are having an awesome Friday!   Also friends u/gdarn16 u/late_to_join_reddit u/alopez1592, thank you for all your lovely summons earlier!! I promise I wasn’t ignoring you guys! 😊
Happy Friday everyone!  I have so much to do today and I actually have the energy for once, which is awesome! First task to tackle is making cupcakes for my brother’s birthday. I plan on using my frosting gun to make them look fancy AF. My brother won’t care but I am in a mood and want to do it.  QOTD: fried chicken and mashed potatoes.
QOTD: cheese. Cheese is the anytime food for me  Here's hoping we all have a great day
I just want work to be ooooover for the weekend!
Happy Friday!!  I can finally pick up my library books! i've been eagerly anticipating this all week. and I'll literally finish them all this weekend (its only 3 graphic novels it wont take me that long..)   and now i'll have to decide if I"d rather just buy them outright or wait another like 2 weeks before reading more of them with how long the current system of requesting and picking up books is taking.   sometimes I wish I never had to sleep so i could just do all the things I want to do all the time lol. i have too many books to read, and shows to watch and games to play its like... why is there not enough time to do that and maintain a healthy balance of life and work and... general taking care of yourself lol
QoTD: Beef stew with dumplings  I have a zoom job interview Monday for online customer support. Got the weekend to check into it more and make sure it's a legit position. So many online scams lately
Good morning everyone! Hope all is well!! Almost the weekend! 💕❤️
QotD: cookies u/Zeunicorn   I’m getting sworn in today! Oath time!! Whooo!!! This is the last check mark ✅
Happy Friday everybody!! Only 2 more classes to teach and then it’s freedom time!!  QOTD: cookies or pasta depending on the mood...

I turned off my phone last night so I wouldn't be tempted to look at work things in the middle of the night. But, that meant I missed the news that my best friend gave birth to a baby girl 😭 She is in another country so it's going to be awhile until we meet each other's daughters.   QoTD: mashed potatoes usually. But, lately it's been popcorn.
Hope you have a great Friday. I’m working and my husband is taking the dogs to the vet for a checkup. They will both be 14 years old next month.   QOTD: Muffins
Ultimate comfort food is McDonald's for me 😂
Good morning everyone!   I’m so glad it’s Friday, I just want to sleep in. No nightmares last night though, I’m really grateful for that!   What is everyone else up to today?
Good morning peeps.  I just ate cheese grits for breakfast.  I might go back to sleep soon.  We'll see how the day goes.
Friday fly-day!  It’s gonna go by fast and then——- Saturday Sunday same same. Every day is stay at home day here.  Gotta dream up some fun for the weekend. What will it be?   Help! What are you doing for fun at home these days?
Good morning everyone!  I slept in super late, which both gives me anxiety and is super nice. My test came back negative, though! So that's a plus!!!   I hope you all are having a great morning!!!! Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need a friend. ❤️
Yassss coffee frother new recruit obtained!
I am so glad it is friday.  One of my kitties are at the vet getting all but his 4 canines removed.  It is dark and gloomy out.    I'd love to curl up on the sofa with a coffee or tea, but I have to go to work in 2 hrs.
QOTD: so many things, but today it's hot chocolate and mac&cheese  having a sad day today--things in my life are going to be changing and not in a great way. i don't deal with change well. but trying to stay positive anyway!
My ultimate comfort food is these box white cheddar mac and cheese shells from Wegmans. They’re like 79¢, can even be made in the microwave, and the ingredients are literally like pasta and white cheddar cheese. It’s not healthy, but I feel like it’s better than some other things I could be snacking on, you know? 😂
Its ALMOST THE WEEKEND!!!! I just used my lunch break to swing by the local coffee roasters place and spent WAAYYY to much money on merch and coffee   but Im set for the rest of the month and part of next! Woohoo
Totally took a half day today just because I could. I’m now enjoying a cocktail and sewing memory bears for my friends family who’s mom passed.
Just want to wish everyone a safe and happy weekend! Hugs for those that need them. 😌
Almost done with the work day!!!
Today has been a weird day for me. But, I am dog-sitting this weekend, so doggo cuddles are fixing everything!   QOTD: My ultimate comfort food is cellas chocolate covered cherries and milk.
Is there a way to tone down clinginess in a relationship?  When i really like someone i tend to message them a lot and show a lot of interest in what they're up to?   Im on a new  birth control pill which has been driving my emotions wild   My partner has commented on that fact I'm messaging him all the time and doesn't like it   Im currently unemployed and don't have any hobbies ( i thought maybe a distraction would help)   Any ideas.
Well, I think my chest cold is starting to clear up. I didn't spend the majority of my day coughing up my lungs so that's...something.   Going to spend tomorrow setting up my new computer desk and hauling the old one off to the curb. All I wanted for my birthday this year was to renovate my computer space and I'm thrilled I actually get to do it.   **QOTD:** Probably my grandma's home made spaghetti. She cooks the meat sauce herself and it tastes better than any stuff from a can or jar.
Its friday!!!!!!! My ultimate comfort food is by far coffee. Then Ice cream. lol
Morning all!   I have work later this afternoon and so much to get done before I go! Tomorrow I’m off to spend the weekend with my new love interest. I’m so nervous (despite the fact we’ve actually known each other for 17 years 😂), but excited! I have some anxiety I need to work through, but I’m going to try! I have no problem eating like a pig with my friends, but for some reason I have this huge fear of eating in front of dates. 😭 he’s a chef and is thrilled about making me dinner and I am over here  S C A R E D  to death. 🤦🏻‍♀️ send good vibes!   Also, happy happy HAPPIEST of birthdays to you, u/TheGreatTyrant! I hope you have the most wonderful day! 🖤😊 you are the coolest!
Happy Friday everyone. I hope it's the start of a great weekend for you!  My husband, daughter, Lien Rose and I are on our way to Seattle. It's about a 2.5 hour drive from home. Amber and I have a bunch of appointments with the transplant specialists today. I have to be there because I will be her caregiver if she does need/get a kidney transplant. It will be a long day of appointments so we can learn as much as we can. My anxiety is high, and I've been dreading this, mostly because it makes it all so real. Also, taking my whole family to Seattle during the pandemic is scary for me. We will take all precautions and grandpa will keep baby safe. We just left and I already want to be home.   QOTD: Chinese food.     I want to wish u/ricctp6 & u/lucy_leigh225 all the best on their endeavor!  Have a great day!
Finally got our power back on after losing it Tuesday night in a wind storm 🙏 now I have to throw away the food when I get home from work!
One of my best, most understanding customers this year has been a woman named Karen. I don't know what to do with this information.
FINALLY DAMN FRIDAY! And it's a long weekend for me!  QOTD: Uhm... tater tots? LOL I love burgers, fries, and ice cream.
It’s Friday. I am off tomorrow and I work Sunday. I’m coming to terms with the fact that I actively hate my job. Not the company but what I do. Sigh.   Comfort food? Does coffee count?
Friday!!  This week seemed to take forever!   QOTD- Biscuits and gravy ...soooo good!
Hello everyone!  I just finished my morning rush and am enjoying some downtime before i need to load dishes, sweep and make my bed.  Then i need to study some.  I have no idea what to make for dinner tonight but i have to run to the store so i might get ideas there.  My husband is Mexican and he’s out of tortillas.  That’s like a national tragedy around here.  Qotd:  pasta and more pasta, any kind but especially spaghetti
Morning everyone last work day before a 3 day weekend so I’m pretty excited about that but dreading what is to happen in the US next week I think the media at times is misleading but who’s to really say what is fact and what is fiction when it comes to this wholePolitical mess.   Have a great day everyone!
Good morning lovely people. It's finally Friday!!!! Hopefully it goes by quickly for everyone so we can get to the weekend fun. Pizza is my go to food for anything.
My wife is going to start her new job today! It's hard to believe it has been a full year since she quit her last one.   QOTD: Elvis sammiches. It's got that perfect combo of all the things together.
I’ve been at work for almost 20 hours. I’m exhausted. I was suppose to leave an hour ago. I just want to curl up in bed with my cats.   QOTD: tacos!!
morning everyone! i can't believe we're already 2 weeks into the new year haha  qotd: french fries or tater tots! ooh or mac and cheese or all three
It's fish and chip Friday here. It's been a crappy day but that will be a nice ending to the day
I've spent all afternoon listening to a True Crime podcast. Now I'm anxious for no reason at all. I'm waiting  for my psychiatrist to call for my evaluation because I started mood stabilizers recently.  I hope he will hurry up and call already
Thank god for Friday. This week was pretty rough but things are slowly making their way upward. I’m making plans with friends which’s nice, so I’ll have some pretty good stuff to look forward to assuming nothing falls through.
Hello All, can't wait for the weekend to begin.  Plan is some gardening, but that all depends on if this sun stays about.  QOTD:  Tough one.  I can easily sit and eat a 1L tub of Ice Cream while watching TV, or just lay back in bed with some chocolate.
Good morning everyone!!!  How is your friday going, just few more work-hours and we are free as an elf with clothes (at least for the weekend)  QOTD: Ice-cream, chips, cookies.
Happy Friday all.  Got some great news today that my company finally hired a new manager for me and our team. Why is that great news?  I've been covering for that spot for a while now and was close to burnout. I made it!  Hope all of you are having an amazing day as we head into the weekend.   QOTD: burger and a beer for me. Can't get much more relaxed than that. ;)
I love danish butter cookies mmmmmmmmmm
Happy Friday RAOA!!! It's almost the weekend 🥰  I hope you're all having a fantastic and magical day ✨  QOTD: Spanish rice and beans. I use my abuela's recipe and it's a little bowl of my childhood.
When I need comfort, I usually feed my other vices first. Hungry little guys, they are.   Two things come to mind: açaí bowls and spaghettiOs. Açaí bowls make me feel healthy even though I know that I’m consuming quite a bit of sugar. SpaghettiOs have a serving of veggies, and it’s been one of my favorite things to eat since I was a kid. I eat both of these when I feel sick (read: hungover) because I can usually stomach them.   Happy Friday everyone! Looking forward to having the next couple days off!
Morning friends! I’m exhausted. I was at work until 12:30, got home at 1, and finally in bed at 2. I’m so tired still. It’s gonna be a nap day.   QOTD: chocolate or my mom’s chicken noodle soup or my dad’s spaghetti and meatballs
Happy Friday!!! We have made it to the end of the week!! I am getting off a little early today and going to relax and enjoy my evening! Hope everyone has a great day!
Howdy!!  I think my poor ol' dad got confused this week. I was talking about getting a new laptop (which I did and it arrived a couple days ago). I don't know what he was thinking, but he went out and bought me a new Tablet yesterday. LOL I reminded him last night on the phone that I already got a laptop and told him he could return the new Tablet if he wanted. He said, "That's okay, Punkin...this can be an early birthday present!" LOL I'll figure out a use for it. :) Still, that's pretty sweet!  So, I'm sittin' here killing time hoping Donnie's parents go out for the afternoon cuz I have a bunch of our dishes I gotta take in and wash. I'm so behind. LOL  QOTD: Probably French fries with either cocktail sauce or ketchup...whichever I have handy!
Holy shit. I just saw patient for an evaluation and the only way to get it was to UNPLUG HIM FROM HIS VENTILATOR!!! So he was literally not breathing. We'd do a little, plug him back in for a bit, then unplug for more. Back and forth until we were done.   I am an anxious person to begin with, but this was over the top!! 😲
Good evening
QOTD: Stuffed crust pepperoni pizza  Have a nice day everyone!
Well shit. I brought leftovers of my keto sausage balls that i prepared Wednesday night and accidentally heated them for too long in the work microwave. Burned a hole in the Tupperware i brought them in, and now the whole office smells like burnt plastic. And now, i have to order lunch if I wanna eat. What a fucking disaster lol  QOTD: copious amounts of chinese food. Which is surprisingly not what I ordered today. I got Thai yellow curry instead which is somewhat of a healthier choice i guess?
My kitter has a vet appointment tomorrow, for vaccines. And then on the 19th, my parents dogs have to go in for vaccines as well. I feel bad that I won't be able to be in the room with any of them. ; 3; but thankfully it's just vaccines and nothing real big.  Been playing a lot of My Time At Portia lately. The last time I played was 2 years ago, when it was released, but I'm excited for the sequel which releases in late March.  Qotd: Apparently chicken alfredo because that's what I've been eating a lot of.
QOTD: Either mashed potatoes with country gravy or Hungarian Goulash.
QoTD - my moms tacos, Mac and cheese or mashed potatoes and gravy from KFC (I know it’s gross but it comforts me).   I’m glad it’s Friday but I’m super anxious today for some reason. Doing all I can to refocus my energy into something positive.  Hope everyone has a great day!
Poutine for sure!
Happy Friday! Sent in the paperwork for my new job today!
My dad offered to keep my little ones for TWO WHOLE NIGHTS. I'm super excited to sit and home and whine about how quiet it is, lmao. No, seriously, I'm excited because they are excited. They love my dad and he loves them, I might even be able to talk my hubby into grabbing dinner from a restaurant tonight!  I hope you all are having an awesome Friday so far!  Edited to add: My favorite comfort food is grilled cheese with tomato soup... #omnomnom
Chemtrails Over the Country Club is about to be better than Norman F-ing Rockwell. Mark my words.
\*screams\* nothing like ending your work week with an angry phone call siiiiiiigghhh  &#x200B;  But   it is the weekend now! Woohooo
I had my first day of CNA classes yesterday! I have to read five chapters of my book by Tuesday, it feels weird to have homework after not doing any for like 15 years lol.  QOTD: wavy lays and French onion dip!!!!
I’m off to buy my rematch giftee’s gifts + my oh snap! gIftee’s gifts. It was a grey day but now the sun is peeking through the clouds and I’ll probably make a detour towards a well known lagoon here. Will I make any duck friends today or will I be chased? I don’t know  But I hope everyone’s day goes well. The day ain’t over, so treat yourselves cause you all deserve it :)))  QOTD: Okok so this may sound weird but natto is my ultimate comfort food. I don’t even like natto but when I’m distressed, the texture calms me down lmao And also cause I don’t like the taste so I end up crying but man, crying feels good ya feel?
Man I hate adulting. I spent most of yesterday at the dmv and dealing with other car stuff, then most of today dealing with insurance. At least it's done and out of the way!   Good news! I got into a waitlisted class that I need to retake. Thankfully I got the super easy professor and he reuses all his tests. Praise the merciful academic gods for that. 😂😂😂    Next I'm off to take Lucy to the vet! She's been getting weird green eye goobers. Yuck!   I hope everyone is having a great day! 💜
u/noimnotsally we have a blizzard warning/winter storm warning today. we didnt get much snow but the WIND and temperatures.  it froze my birdies food so you bet Mama fire went out with gloves on and dug up the frozen peanuts, uncovered the bird seed and replaced their suet. I need to get a bird bath warmer soon so they have fresh water in the winter.
I'm addicted to mashed potatoes. They're just so good. And cake, or any sweets really.  Maybe I just love food.
Should I bring travel liquor on my flight next week? I won't be drunk or anything but flying makes me so nervous. How much is to much? Why am I stressing over this trip so much? My best friend has no clue I'm going to see her after 10 years so I'm nervous. It's also driving me crazy I can't talk to her about this.
eeep it is super cold today, the wind is starting to sound a bit too scary! 🌸💗 does anybody have any suggestions for books about meditation and coping with anxiety? 💞 hope that you all have a lovely day and continue to stay hydrated~! 🌸 remember that you are always loved and if you ever need a friend or someone to talk to, you are always welcome to pm! 💗
qotd: ramen for sure, homemade. i usually use chicken, leek, carrot, spring onion, ginger, and bouillon stock. just perfect 👌
Hey guys!! I wanted to share some pics from tonight! I really thank all of you who have followed her birthday week!  She feels so loved and that’s all I ask for ❤️  https://imgur.com/a/6pVomTe  https://imgur.com/a/n8UdnbP  https://imgur.com/a/FDrak7I  (My sil and her kids came over to wish her a happy birthday, the kids are in school together and these are the only people I allow in my house right now)
Goodness today was exhausting!!
Oh man so take kind of sucks because I had to spend $950 on my car. It decided to stall in the middle of the road on Wednesday and apparently my fuel pump decided to go out plus I had to get new control arms. But you know what? It felt really good to be able to pay it off on my own and not have to look at my family for money. So yes it did make a big dent in my savings but I can earn that money again.
Back from the vet! Poor Lucy has some doggy conjunctivitis. Gotta put ointment in her eyes! 😭
Friday night over here, for the week had two recruiters show interest in me but post that no response, spoke with two HR people but with their quoted budget I passed on the offer.   Serious question to job seekers, is HR/recruiters offering salaries with 50% cut, ex:so for a 50k job saying that their offer is for 20-25k, in current job market  or are they trying to save cost knowing they have a choice with the number of experienced yet unemployed candidates in the market?     QOTD dal khichdi, that's rice with moong lentil , hot and piping is the way i love it.
Just wanted to wish u/TheGreatTyrant a HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! 🎂🎈🎁🎉 if I got the username wrong, some please tag the correct spelling!!
Good morning!   I just finished up making our master report template for the clinic. I feel like the IT person because I'm always solving equipment issues and now I'm making stuff like this! Haha.  I'm so ready for noon! I get off then and see my sponsor! Woo! Then home for the weekend!
So I’m trying to look into places I can talk about my domestic abuse... I’m not hit or anything but I am yelled/gaslit at a lot and am starting to develop a phobia of talking to people using my voice. Of course I think I’m overreacting but three people have told me that I’m being mentally abused and I even went on a few sites. I want out so bad but I feel like the place is end up in more toxic. But I’m slowly just not being able to take it much longer. And feel like we should be apart so at least both our sakes. Before a panic attack finally takes me.   I hope everyone else is well.
I finally got back into playing Animal Crossing yesterday! Ah I've missed it. Did quite a bit in the two days I've been playing. Kinda sad I missed the New Years stuff but I managed to purchase some of the exclusive items off other players. Finally moved my campsite to its new spot been meaning to do that since like July last year. Mostly been working on my 2nd character's house which is witch/nature themed. It's really different from my other house so super fun to work on. Gotta go around and decide on wreaths for villager's doors that don't have one yet. Probably do that tomorrow easier to match colours during daylight.  QOTD: Ice cream!
Oh gosh, this week has been quite the stressful one :') I just recently flew back to my home across the country and I arrived at midnight :')) My phone was nearly dying (which I needed to use to call for an uber), my suitcase didn't arrive at the airport yet, and I had left all my food in my suitcase :')) Currently under quarantine and I'm thankful that I have work to keep me occupied because otherwise, I might go stir-crazy! But thankful for the long weekend and for my zoom friends to keep me company <3  QOTD: porridge/congee!!
Lunch time!  Baby boy just face planted and cut his lip but he’s okay. His lip is just a little puffy.  Looking forward to the long weekend and you new able to just chill and relax.  Hope everyone is having a good day!
[removed]
Good morning.  Come enter my funko friday contest.  I hope everyone has a wonderful day 💗
Ugh. I was up 4 times during the night. Woke up feeling like crap from my back, stomach, armpit (guess from how I slept), gastro nonsense, and now a scratchy throat and cough - most likely an ongoing back drip. Going to ice my back. I did heat at first, apparently, I'm doing things in the wrong order. Meh.  I've been job hunting since the one I thought I landed was skewered by the recruiter who somehow changed what I applied for. I've got a formal complaint in with their HR dept because she refused to admit fault and correct the error. I am waiting, if for nothing else, an apology.  Still working o the home office and making progress. I have way too many envelopes and little note pads.  QotD - Popcorn and chocolate milk.
QOTD: Pringles, probably. I'm more of a comfort drink kind of person though, and that drink is rum.  Day 2 of exercising, and I'm so sore!
QOTD: French fries
QOTD: My dad's homemade Mac and Cheese.
How early can one reasonably go to bed on a Friday? Asking for a friend. Who is me.
Good morning! Just got back from my weekly doc appointment and now it’s time for online school with my kids. Besides that I’m exhausted somehow already  Ultimate comfort food is pizza!!
Qotd: mashed potatoes with gravy, and chocolate milk on the side. Or mashed potato sandwich with gravy dip.
Happy Friday!  QOTD: warm baked goods
Ooooohhh this morning I had two moods while getting ready for work: Cherry Poppin' Daddies, and Here Come the Mummies.   QOTD: Mac and cheese.
Thank goodness it's Friday. This week felt so looooooong. I hope wherever you are, you find a little pocket of happiness and moments of peace.  QOTD: My ultimate comfort food is a bowl of spaghetti marinara.
QOTD: This is very mood dependent for me. Chocolate is always a good bet! But I would say most of the time it would be a hot cup of tea with a fresh, warm croissant. Throw in a good break and I’m a happy camper!
I’m so bummed! My kids just went back to school on Tuesday and they’re off today!! Why?! So how they’re going to be home for three days until they go back Monday. Send help! I adore them but man, I need a break!  QOTD: a casserole or hearty soup.
Happy Friday all! Busy morning here, but looking forward to tonight when I can relax and then tomorrow morning when I can sleep in. 😄  Hope everyone has a good day! Remember to take care of yourself.  QOTD: Pasta bolognese with garlic bread. Yum!
Good Afternoon, Cantaloupes!  Hope everyone is having an awesome day!
Happy Friday, y'all! Best comfort food is tough.. but a good solid bowl of fancy mac n cheese will always hit the spot for me. I don't have it too often, which is maybe why I love it so much!
Omg I am so sleepy.  Waiting on an important phone call though.  Ugh.  How is yall?  I'm hanging in there hating the barometric pressure again.    Qotd:. My daddy's mac and cheese
I almost showed up to work today with no eyebrows because I couldn’t find my pencil. Found it in my car last minute 🙏  Qotd: Cracker Barrel comes to mind. I like the chicken and dumplings with mashed potatoes. Another fave is the famous bowl at KFC. Which is basically more mashed potatoes 😋
QOTD: anything with noodles lol
Anyone watching true crime or horror related stuff tonight? :)   QOTD: Uhmmm... strangely enough, I think it would be a drink. Hot chocolate is a really nice comfort drink lol
It's 43 degrees out, and I have my thermostat set almost up to 70 degrees, and I'm *still freezing*. D: My blood circulation is so bad, my fingers are so cold they hurt. I'm gonna go crawl back under the blankets for a while I think.
QOTD:  Delivery Chinese, or Sushi. I can't pick just one.   Yay for the weekend. I have to work of course. It's cold and it hurts. I need to get my thyroid meds from the pharmacy but that requires wearing pants that aren't pajama pants.   I am sleepy, I want to be curled up under blankets and fast asleep. Weee...  I would like to work on cleaning my office/craft space (it's not a separate room) and this weekend. At least somewhat.. Not sure if that'll happen. XD
Qotd. I guess right now it’s cinnamon bears.   I’m not having a good day. Days. That’s all.
qotd: mashed potatoes and gravy. yum.   i have to fast tonight so they can do a blood test in the am. idk how not to eat, becaue night is when i do most of my eating.
Happy birthday 🎈🎊🎁🎉🎂🥮🥳🧁🍰🍾

Stay in Christmas Land. It's nicer there.
Christmas Land is the best land. You don't have to leave it til you're ready. 😁
I started watching NOS4A2 last week, the thought of Christmas Land scares me. lol
omg this is me. I am going to take Christmas down this weekend. .maybe. . we shall see. LMAO   Glad your migraine went away!
My Christmas stuff is still up and I don’t want to take it down either. Half because I’m lazy, half because I love looking at my Christmas tree and the lights. 🤩
How exciting! I love when things finally start coming together.
oooo thats awesome!! Congrats on the reno!
Snow is the best! I love getting snow. We got "a lot" of snow today. .but sadly, none of it stuck
Qotd- fried potatoes    I got snow last weekend it could happen again im so excited!!! I have made a grand total of 3 snowmen in my life and all of them were last weekend!
Oooh I hope you get snow too!!!
We had a full day of snow yesterday, now it's crunchy and icy
❄️❄️❄️💜🥰
What's your favorite ice cream flavor?
Ooooh ice cream sounds amazing!
It’s sooooo good to hear from you!! ❤️❤️❤️ hope you got lots done!! I finally FINALLY got my biggest errand completed and I’m pooped. Haha! It wasn’t even a big deal but I get drained pretty easily

Happy cake day! 😊  I love decorating cupcakes! I'm not great at it but it's fun 💗

Happy cake day, my friend! 🍰 Very fitting that you're making cupcakes on your cake day. 😁 I hope he enjoys them! Are you guys celebrating tomorrow?
Mmm cheese.
Ok but now you have to tell us your favorite type.
Ooooo cheese is wonderful. So many kinds and ways to eat it.
Yummm! Fave kind of cheese?
Me too!
So nearrrrr
The library has been a huge mood booster for me during the pandemic so I'm so excited for you!! Which graphic novels did you get?   I'm a media whore and love video games and books and comics and TV so I totally get where you're coming from! Do you like lists? I love going through lists of media to see how much I can consume. It's the one thing the pandemic has given me time for.
Yay! The library is my happy place. I picked up a stack for the weekend yesterday myself. I held by curbside books to my chest and felt so thankful for the library and librarians. They are unsung heroes. In fact... you've given me an idea. I wonder if I can take one of those big coffees and donuts  or bagels to the library. That would be so cool...
Good luck with your job interview!! Fingers crossed for you
I really hope it is legit and that you have a great interview. It's good that you're taking the time to suss it out.
Good luck on your interview!!
Good morning to you as well!!!
good morning! 🌞 hope you have an awesomee weeekend! any plans?
I’m your ultimate comfort food? 👀👀👀 That’s sus bud...    Have a great swearing in day my friend 💜💜
Yay! Freedom!!!
Love this! I can relate to the miracle on the Hudson because every time I’ve ever left LaGuardia in an air plane I’ve felt the overwhelming fear of going straight into the Hudson. Thanks for all the history tidbits! Great to learn new things!   As for the songs! Great picks! Cabron is also a profanity here, I don’t think I’ve ever heard it used literally. The actual meaning male goat lol! Mileys voice is everything, I had to go listen to the original because I’ve never really heard much of Billie, but I think I prefer Miley’s! Her voice is so incredible, I preordered the plastic hearts vinyl. She fuels my feminine angst!   Thanks for doing this! I loved it. I’ll have to come up with a clever good morning post for you! :)
Imagine how wonderful it will be when your daughters meet! I hope it's sooner rather than later. 🤞
Hope all is well. I love our older pups.  Have a lab that is getting up there and starting to gray in spots. Call him our "reverse dalmatian". Lol
mickey D is always a fantastic choice!
I have been craving Mcdonalds for weeks now.
Yay for no nightmares!!! No big plans today
Good morning  ☀️:D  You should definitely sleep in! Those are the best mornings.
Good morning :). Cheese grits are so so good!
Now I want cheese grits!
Happy Friday! Most of my fun things at home have been the boring watch shows, play video games, read lol  BUT! One of the best things I've been enjoying is working on cooking! It takes time and effort and a little money, but it's really fun to find an "out there" recipe and try my hand at it in the kitchen. Maybe you can cook something neat to keep you going?
lots of crafting, reading, gaming and movie marathons  lol
Woohoo!
I'm glad the test was negative! So was my husband's! ::throws confetti:: Hope you feel better soon!
woohoo congrats on the negative test! I hope your friday is great!
wooohooo
Sending you all the good vibes!!!!
Grilled cheese and hot chocolate are my go to along with a good movie or book
You can never go wrong with that mac and cheese!!! So delicious!
Yay coffee and shopping local! This makes me so happy!
Heck yeah!!!
Ooh what kind of cocktail are you having?
Right back at ya x
I hope you do too!
Sending hugs back! Have an awesome weekend, too :)
aww doggo cuddles sound amazing, happy friday! 🌸💗
Well it sounds like it's time to get some Hobbies! It could also be a sign of insecurity which is something you need to work on through perhaps therapy or some self-love exercises. You could do some self-love affirmations everyday and you can look up those on YouTube. I also suggest definitely taking up some Hobbies. I don't know what your interests are but you could do some light PC gaming or you can do some crocheting or cross stitching. Cross stitching is super fun and very easy and so is embroidery you could pick up some embroidery kits off of Amazon for cheap. You could start learning a new language as well! There are a lot of free college courses that you could take online also.
Glad you’re on the mend!
Coffee is alway comfort, it’s a hug in a mug
Lol, I enjoy coffee but calling it my comfort food..well that would be stretching it. I bow before my coffee superiors and hope to reach to their level 😊
yes yes yes comfort = coffee  how do you take yours?
Agreed. Absolutely.
Omg this is the best love story I've ever heard. I can't wait until you come back here and tell us you chowed down on his awesome food and broke your fear!
Thank you so much friend !!! Good luck on your adventure this weekend I’m sure you’ll have an amazing time 😊❤️lots of yummy dinners to look forward to you in your future 🥰😋
I am sending positive vibes your way that you can kick your anxiety in the ass and enjoy yourself! I hope you have a great time. 😊
this alllll sounds so exciting! 😍 maybe down the line you’ll be so comfortable, [you’ll be chefing it up together! ](https://imgur.com/a/8hZ3B92)   sending so much positive radiance to you! hoping it goes well! ✨
Omg I hope it goes amazingly! Keep us updated haha <3
Thanks so much!! We are definitely excited about it!  I'm so sorry about what you're going through today. Wishing all of you the best and with as little fear as possible.
Bug hugs! I hope today is the least stressful as possible for you.
Thank you!!! I’m so excited it’s unreal!
Sending hugs. I'll be thinking of you and your family today <3
Sending positive energy your way, Stay safe
Oh wow!!! There are very few things that are worse than losing your power. But having it off for that long really sucks. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Glad your power is back
Glad that's the powers back on, can't imagine how hard it would've been without power
Wow that's such a long time! I'm glad it's back on now 💕
Dang. That's quite a stretch without power. I hope you stayed warm!
Tuesday! Dang that’s a long time to get it fixed. I hate throwing out food. It’s such a waste. Hopefully, it doesn’t happen again any time soon.
Wow! That's awhile with no power. I'm so sorry you've gotta get rid of that food 💕 that's really frustrating.  I hope your Friday flies by!
Yay power!  I hope getting new food goes smoothly.  It's a shame you have to throw away so much.  I hope you hadn't just stocked up!
You have broke the Matrix with that information.
lmao
haven't had tater tots in SO long
I would say it does about to have my second cup tbh
Can you talk to human resources about changing depts?
Dude I'm so sorry about that. I'm changing careers at 33 so I know how much it can suck to just admit it. And neither of my careers makes any money so lol  Do you know what youd rather be doing instead?
A good cheddar cheese biscuit is life
I love ordering groceries online, pulling up to the store, and having my order placed in the trunk. It saves time and keeps me away from irresponsible humans.
😂😂😂 in a weird coincidence, I'm making tortillas at home for the first time today!   What kind of sauce do you put on spaghetti usually?
It’s a very scary time.  I feel like they are doing all they can to keep people safe but who knows what can happen.
Pizza’s always fantastic
Congrats on your wife’s new job! I hope she has a great first day.
Congrats to her!
20 hours sounds so tiring!!!
Oh that sounds soooo good.
Fish and chips will set things right. Or at least better! That sounds so good! Malt vinegar?
I hear you there. It's been a crazy week for me as well, but things are looking up. Awesome to hear you have plans with friends coming up, that can always help relieve a rough week.    Keep at it, things will get better!
Awesome news!
OMG yes! I haven't had those in forever!
I love SpaghettiOs! I really like the kind with the meatballs in it. I'll usually eat them straight out of the can. I don't like them warmed up.
One of my comfort foods is spaghetti os with potato chips yummy!!;
I love Spaghetti Os! I don't like the kind with meat in it though.
Happy cake day!
nooo I hope you get to get some rest!
Woohoo!! Happy Friday!! Have a great weekend!
Awww that's so sweet
Aww, that's so nice of him!
Yikes. That doesn't sound fun for you or the patient.
Omg!!!!!!!!!!
That is terrifying!!!
Oh gosh! That’s awful! 😳 I’m glad you were able to get through it though!
\*waves\*
Omg- this is making me want to order a stuffed crust. You know what I used to LOVE was the stuffed crust pizza bites pizza that pizza hut used to do. I hate pizza hut but i love that pizza crust lol
Yikes! That's not good. If it makes you feel any better, during my first week at my last job, I was microwaving popcorn and it caught on fire and nearly burned the whole building down. I now refuse to walk away while microwaves are cooking anything.
That sucks.  I just warrantied a Tupperware lid that had a hole from making popcorn in it.
Oh my gosh. 😳 I invested in some glass containers a while ago for leftovers and they’re awesome! No burned holes lol!
Uh-oh. Ooops. I hope you had a good lunch and a better afternoon
oooo I just got that game! I was thinking of playing it this weekend!!
I love goulash
omfg KFC taters and gravy are so good.
Mmm tacos. Sending you good vibes only 💖💖💖
Oh man, I've only had poutine once, but it was a food experience like no other. I gotta find a way to get some again!
Yumm. I'm glad poutine isn't readily available where I live, I'd be 600 pounds.
that's awesome! happy friday! 🌸
Congrats on the new job! You're going to do great!
Heyyy congrats on the job! That's so exciting.
Congrats!
Niiiice! Congrats on the new job!
That's awesome!!! Way to go, dad!
I hope you're having a good friday too! and I hope you have a good weekend!
oh how exciting! 🌸 good luck with your classes!
What is natto?
Oh, I do!   -Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind  -Living With Your Heart Wide Open  -Anything by Thich Nhat Hahn. Anything at all. Guy's a genius.  -The Book of Joy  -Meditations of Marcus Aurelius  They're all really short, too! So you can gain their knowledge in a short amount of time.
Yikes. Those two are definitely more expensive, but I'm glad it's taken care of.   I'm sure that feels so good to be able to pay for it on your own! Soo nice!
Aww poor pup! Feel better soon!
You did it right !!  Thank you so much !!
HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! u/TheGreatTyrant
🎉🎉🎉🎉 **HAPPY BIRTHDAY u/TheGreatTyrant!!!** 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Heyy I am sorry for this situation!!! Just know you are not overreacting. Please reach out to me if you feel like sharing what you are going through. I may not be able to help you much but I can lend you a listening ear . You are loved and cherished and whatever your gut says you should go with that! You don't have to bear anything .❤️
From experience some leaving a toxic relationship is hard. There time  when I found positive things about being in it but I was fooling myself. Getting away sucks but in the long run you might feel better. I suggest getting free if you can.
Yay animal crossing!! Who’s your favorite villager on your island??
Aww poor baby. Extra mama kisses from you for him today
I absolutely feel you! I lost my job back in March of last year and had to stay unemployed due to virtual schooling. I'm trying to hang in here and not let on in front of the kids or my hubby how hard it has been on me. It's been hard on them, as well and I don't want to burden them any further. It gets lonely, but I firmly believe that we will make it through, though. I know you will as well, even if it's hard, but I hope you take a little bit of time wherever you can to recharge!
I just realized you hadn’t done it in awhile
How are you doing?
Well it's past your bedtime somewhere in the world, that's a reason enough. 🙂
Mashed potato sandwich!? I've never heard of that and it sounds amazing!
I haven't listened to Cherry Poppin Daddies in ages. Might have to spin them up again. ;)
Same to you!
I accidentally over trimmed one of my eyebrows. I don't even know how. So I look like an alien. Thank God for eyebrow pencils!!!
Thank you friends !!!!! Yay for new friends and birthday twins !!! 🎂🧁❤️🥰🥳 /u/kitty-purrs ❤️❤️❤️
A few days ago Rocky had been shot with a .45. The bullet entered his leg and went into his back. Thankfully, the bullet missed his spine, and all of his organs! He's had surgery and is currently healing up at the vet. Animal control got the bullet and is doing an investigation to try and find the jerk that shot our baby.
melty cheese makes us pinchy, I get it, I get it... wait, no I don't XD
I had it yesterday, tummy was so warm and happy and full <3
♥‿♥ Thank you!
Thank you, she has worked so hard for this!
I’m on that but I also like to have visual list
Yes I try to go out side my normal genre of historical fiction and classic lit. I added the Witcher series lol
Yes one of life’s little pleasures
Thank you so much! I hope you do as well :D
HIGHLY recommend, though they are a lot of work. Here's a recipe I like because it feels authentic to me (ie, it's basically the way I make them, except that I also sprinkle cinnamon-sugar inside the dumplings on top of the plums): https://www.thespruceeats.com/hungarian-plum-dumplings-recipe-szilvas-gomboc-1136799
I do enjoy cooking and baking! I don't get a chance to do them as often as I'd like, but when I can, I do enjoy it :D And you're more than welcome, my friend.
Thank you! I'm taking a slow morning but going to go for it on the work front during the afternoon.
Thank you, friend. I'm doing tons better. Think I just need some meds lol
Oh good, yay!! I'll check it out a little later today. I'm going to pull the trigger on a server today.
Thanks so much! I really appreciate you reaching out yesterday. I hope you have a great weekend. And happy cake day!
Thank you! For the first time in a long time I feel like it's coming together
The lights give off a nice ambiance in the room. And I'm lazy. Very, very lazy.
Definitely. I'm excited to get to daily maintenance as opposed to move-in related things. 🤣
Thanks. We're almost done upstairs in the new house except swapping sinks in the half bath. My husband is not excited to do it. 🤣
😞 I didn’t think to hope that the snow STICKS too!!!
That’s awesome!
We haven’t had any real snow this year so I’m hoping for a good one!
Ohhhh I’m JEALOUS
Hey honey! How are you?
I'm pretty addicted to boba ice cream right now, but I also love pralines n cream, rainbow sherbet, cherry Garcia...  I like a lot of flavors.  :)  How about you?
Yes, I was putting off so many things and it feels great to get them done finally. Yay for getting your biggest errand completed! That’s a great accomplishment!!!! I totally feel you on being pooped- I think I’m going to take a little nap in a bit 😴.
Thank you!
Thank you!  Same! I’m not the greatest at decorating cakes and cupcakes either; I do it because it’s fun. 😊
Thank you!
Me too!
Thank you!
Thank you!
I have never eaten a cheese that I didn't like. But if I had to pick a favorite, I think a really creamy brie.
I only just now discovered there are Legend of Zelda ones so i picked up the first three that follow Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. I was going to pick up the Twilight Princess series but as it is still ongoing I figured I'd read the other ones first.   I LOVE to track things. I've been keeping a spreadsheet since ~2005 of every book I read that year. and it has evolved every year. that now I have 2. one for the current year with a TON of stats (thanks to someone far more savvy than I) and then my old one where it just tracks what I'm reading.   I have an app that tracks my tv shows too   I dont have a .... "to consume" list exactly as it's insane length would eventually stress me out lol there is always too much to consume and never enough time. and I'm such a 'mood' person that I'm in the middle of like 3 books and I'm like oh i should start a new one....even though i LIKE the ones I'm reading....
Oh that would be so wonderful! I bet they would love it, if they’re allowed to take them!   I am so glad libraries figured out how to navigate the pandemic. I’ve been mostly utilizing the digital library since it’s easier but I am still very grateful that I am able to get physical books ☺️
🌈🧡🥰👀  Maybe my name is Hannibal Montanibal  Thanks!
One more class 😁
That is true and it's something to look forward to 💛
Lol, that’s cute. Older pups have so much love. ❤️
Get one if you can! Nice to have a treat now and again especially during these hard times!
Good morning to you! They really are!
They were so good!
Good idea. I have done some baking.
I think I’ll do a little collating this weekend...
Thank you!!!!
Thank you!!!
Right
thank you
I found it recently but they are THE BEST coffee place EVER! Iron bean coffee company! Fantastic roasts and the owners are the ones that work it! Small, local but growing! lol  The local book store is my other favorite go to local store! <3
Some vodka with sparkling cranberry water and a splash of cranberry pineapple juice
Yes! Happy Friday to you, too!
It definitely could be because of insecurity. I've gained a lot of weight recently  I feel I'm quite an energetic person and I'm full of energy more than most people. I'd like to do something fun   I don't have a pc unfortunately. So gaming is out of the question. Even if i did im not sure I'd be able to sit still long enough
Thank you! I'm looking forward to being back to full strength again probably by Sunday.
Yes! That exactly!! Especially when its just brewed and the smell is so strong 😊
hahahahhaa love it! Its by far the thing I drink the most  lol
usually black but I do sometimes get a latte, cafe au lait, or cappuccino.  you??
Yyeesss 😄🥰
Omgggg you are the sweetest 😅 thank you soooo much! I really hope it goes well!
Awww thank you so much! 🖤🖤🖤 here’s hoping for the best! 🤞🏻
Oh my gosh, thank you! I hope so, too! 😁  And happy cake day to you!! 🖤
Omg thank you sooo much! 🖤🖤🖤 I just got done talking to him and I’m really excited. 😊
Thank you so much! I will definitely let you all know how it goes! 😁🖤
You're welcome and thank you so much! 😊💚💚
Thank you so much! 😊💚💚
😊💚💚💚
Thank you very much, I appreciate it it! 😊💚💚
Thank you! 😊💚💚
It was a very cold last couple days! I'm glad its over though
I'm glad too! Thankfully I could charge my phone at work
Thank you!
I'm warm now! Lol
Yeah we had a bad wind storm and were apparently low priority 🤦‍♀️
Thanks girl! You too!
I had sadly!! Thank you!
You should probably have some tonight for dinner then!
Whew. I only had one so far. I need to get decaf if I want more!
Heh I wish. I’m a paramedic. This job doesn’t work like most others :/
34 and working on a bio/ecology/environmental science degree to get out of paramedicine. It’s a work in progress but meantime I can’t not be a medic because it’s $25 an hour :/
I need to do that more.
You’re more ambitious than i am, lol.  I am off of shopping duty since my daughter forgot to give me my debit card.  She has it because i have an amazon shopping addiction. Lol.   Anyway, i like to make my own sauce with tomato sauce, ground beef, italian sausage, fire roasted tomatoes, green peppers and onions, plus lots of garlic and italian seasoning.  Then let it cook covered on very low heat for a couple of hours.
I agree
Thank you 💚
Thank you 💚
Pretty unhealthy but totally yummy
Yesss and lots of salt
The kind with meatballs is the definitive edition, let’s be real. I like your style, kid.
Ooh, I’m intrigued. What kind of potato chip though?
Waves back
Papa Johns has stuffed crust now. And it is sooooo good. A thousand times better than Pizza Hut.
Yeah I think you're not supposed to microwave popcorn at work. Kind of an unspoken rule haha but I'm glad nothing caught on fire!!
Warrantied? How expensive was the lid?!
I'm not even sure what the damage would have been if I used a glass container. In this case it was definitely a result of me microwaving it too long
Thanks! Lunch was delicious and I felt guilty af but it was good
It's really fun!
Thanks friend ❤️
Thank you! It IS pretty exciting!
It’s basically fermented soybeans :)
thank you so so much, will check them all out~!! 💗💗💗
It really did I love not having to rely on anyone! How is your day?
Happy happy birthday! Happy birthday to you! Cumpleaños feliz! Cumpleaños feliz!!! Have a wonderful birthday!!!!! You deserve it!!
happy happy birthday, hope that you're having an awesome time!! 💗🌸🎂

Thank you so much friend !!!!
Good luck. You are making the right decision.
Chief! I fell in love with him in the Wii game City Folk and have had him in every game since :) How about you?
definitely extra kisses and hugs from mama today. he's very grumpy right now
Ya I've been in a slump lately
I'm struggling but trying to focus on the now and the positive things. How are you?  Happy cake day
I like this reasoning. Thank you!
Oh yes, or a “meatloaf and mash sandwich”! So carbie lol
Oh my goodness, that's horrible! I hope the monster that hurt him gets caught ASAP! Rocky is a trooper, I'm so happy to hear it missed all of the organs and such. What a nasty person. Give your dear pup a hug for me - and one to yourself! <3
That’s how my daughter is too.
Nice! I love classic lit too but I've been eschewing it lately since I need some escapism lol
☺️
I'm doing the 52weeksofbaking so I'm down for a lot of work! Thank you so much for the recipe. I'm saving it! Maybe for seasonal ingredients 2 week.
One day we'll make it 👍
Thank you! I hope you have a great weekend as well!
That's a nice feeling, hold on to it. 🥰
Hahahha I bet. Glad its all coming together though! Reno projects always sound both fun and stressful haha
🤣 I want it to stick so badly but now its all clear here till Sunday. Then...maaayybbeee . I hope you get snow! ❄❄❄❄
Yes! We haven't had any this year either!!!
I love it but the aftermath is awful, slushy yucky stuff, the horse and dogs hate it
Surviving! Tell me all about what's been going on with you 💜💜💜
Hope to chat it up w ya when you come back from your nap!
Yw
Oooo that sounds good. I'm making baked brie for my birthday this weekend bc I didn't get to eat it for the holidays. I'd say gruyere and blue cheese are my favorite.
You and I are like media whoring soulmates lol have you seen listchallenges dot com before? I like to use it for reading ideas. They have some great graphic novels lists.
I called them, and I thought the librarian would (happy) cry. I sent them coffee and bagels from a place up the street from them. Random act of kindness performed! Your post inspired me!
We said cookies was a euphemism last night dang it 🤣🤣👀 ^please ^don’t ^eat ^me
I keep forgetting I have a brand new container of them in my pantry! They're just plain grits, but I like adding my own cheese. Sometimes just some sugar on them w/nothing else.
I'm here if you need a friend!
That's awesome. :) You're inspiring me to swing by my local tea shop and maybe the Italian bakery for cannolli this weekend!
Best smell to wake up to
i wish i could take mine black, because i like them with some cream and sugar and it’s become a problem lmao. But i have been trying to drink iced coffee black with maybe a pump of flavor which is pretty good.
I'm so jealous you get to get busy w a chef lol nothing sexier than that. Good luck and have a great time!
I’ll keep my fingers crossed 🤞🏻too !!! ❤️❤️❤️
Are you back home? Because technically you started commenting at around 8:11pm my time lol   We will dedicate a special banana episode of the podcast to you! 🍌🧡
Arggh, truthfully I would have gone bonkers without power for so long.
Thank goodness!
Aww darn. :(
I wish I had some here! I will definitely have some soon though :D You've inspired me lol
Oh wow
:nods: Thank you for being on the front lines and taking care of everyone.
I get that. I went from being an archaeologist to being a writer so I never had to choose the money lol. 34 is young and you're already working towards it. I wish it was easier for you!
Oh man that sounds so so good. Maybe that for dinner? Lol
Ehhh healthy is overrated.
Yummmmmm
Dangity...I gotta go to the dollar store tomorrow and get some more! LOL I thought I weaned myself, but...oh no. My gullet is now craving that canned, processed, room temperature satisfaction! LOL
Plain or salt and vinegar and use the spaghetti os as dip!
I was actually doing it for my boss at the time. We were doing a "Popcorn Day" team-building kind of event and she asked me to do the popping. Except she didn't want to buy the microwaveable popcorn bags. Instead, she bought the kernels and some paper bags and told me to pop them that way. Hence, ya know, the fire. 🤦‍♀️
Tupperware, the real stuff is all guaranteed forever. That is it worth paying a bit more for good stuff
💞💞💞
It's so nice!   It wasn't too bad, very relaxing. How was yours?
Thank you so much friend !!!!
Come wish our friend a happy birthday!!  u/alopez1592 u/johnwoods1023 u/pm_ur_uterine_cake

Thanks friend !!! I’m trying to be reflective and do something for myself today ❤️
lol not really .... I got out of the house for a bit, got my sewing machine fixed and bought some stuff at goodwill- ordering food and having ice cream cake tonight- my friend got it for me ❤️
Thank you so much for this elaborate post!!! I love it !!!
Well he’s not on my island....... *yet*....... but Goose!! He’s my boy! My chicken boy! My strong chicken boy ♥️♥️♥️
Oh bless him, it will be throbbing a bit I bet
Hugs it’s ok
I understand, all too well! I’m doing okay right now. Busy this week, which helps keep my mind occupied.   Thank you - I didn’t realize it was my cake day until you mentioned it!  Any plans for today?
Mmm carbs.
Thank you for your kind words! I'll be sure to hug little baby when I see him. I hope the person is caught as well. Rocky deserves justice!
I get that
Ooo awesome, yeah if you can't find the Italian plums (usually out around Aug/Sep), you can use regular though they aren't quite the same. Sounds like a fun challenge!
Thankfully we didn't have anything big to do, but moving in right before the holidays meant that it got sloppy at the end. 🤣 I finally have time and motivation to finish things and get everything where it should go. ;)
Well, after almost a year of waiting we finally got approved for a loan through the small business association and we are going to open a second store with it🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 we are just waiting on the deposit!
oh god that website is amazing  I hadn't see it before but uh... i might live there now
That's so awesome!! What a nice surprise for them :)
Ooh, even better. That's what we use, and we add butter, garlic, and cheese!
thank you so much.
YEEESSSSS  I love this!!!!
if you take a tiny bit of milk or cream and froth it, it does a lot to the flavor too but without adding too much milk! My husband drinks his with frothed milk
Hahahahah thank you!! He’s also a foreman in the kitchen at a federal prison and gets to scream at people like Gordon Ramsay, who is one of my major crushes lmao 😂 be still my heart!
I am home. I added an edit to my contest. Also, I specified PST in said contest, lol. Had to get settled in at home before chatting. How did your swearing in go? 😊💚💚
I was mostly just cold and bored and I spent alot eating out
Haha awesome!
Thank you <3 I’ve been part time/per diem for a while and I’m still just burnt out. I’ve been a medic for six and a half years now and I’m just done.
Thanks.   What do you write?
I’m feeling the same now, lol.
Totally. Finishing my day off with lemon meringue pie haha
Holy shit
Interesting. Think my stuff is actually Rubbermaid brand haha
Aww this is so sweet thank you!!!!
happy birthday!!!! u/thegreattyrant 💜💜💜
Tag some more ppl if you can, noodlers!!!
Thank you so much friend !!!
Thank you!!!!
What do you enjoy doing when it's just for you? Your favorite way to relax?
ICE CREAM CAKE FOR THE FUCKING WIN!!! YAAAASSSSSSS!! Omgosh I miss ice cream cake (can you tell?) glad to hear you got out for a bit! I just got my sewing machine fixed, too! But I think I’m about to break it again at the rate that I’m making mistakes!
You're very welcome! You deserve to be sung to!! 💕
Yesss Goose!! Such a good choice I hope you can get him soon
He seems to be doing much better now!
Thank you
I'm going to clean a little and then play my switch and just relax or try to.
Yes he does!
I'll check around and see what I can find. I'm excited!
Ahh yeah, tough time to move. Woohooo organization lol. My weekend is going to be a lot of cleaning and organizing so I feel that hahha
CONGRATS!🎉🎊🎈
Lol right?! It's so fun! But yeah, can take up some time for sure.

My degree is in literary writing but I'm writing manga and comics with my husband now.

Hahaha you are so fun! Thank you so Much friend you totally made my day today ❤️❤️❤️

You did!   That's great! I am so happy for you! 😊💚💚
We had a bad windstorm
I’m working on a bio/ecology/environmental science degree and I’m second guessing the hell out of it. It’ll be fine, it’s just a big investment
Oh that’s fantastic!
Yes, lol
Maybe take a tub of Cadbury hero's up to bed too haha it's a good job I spend a lot of time outdoors or I'd be as big as a house haha
That's awesome
Thank you !!!!
Crafting sounds like a great way! I know that's what my wife loves to do.  Most of my fun things I do to relax are the boring watch shows, play video games, read lol. BUT! I've really been enjoying cooking to relax too. Trying a new recipe out has been helping me expand my skills, plus once you're done you get to sit down and eat (hopefully) delicious food.
Hey, that’s what we’re here for, right?! I love it when I see someone laughing!!! ❤️❤️❤️ wish I could’ve done more for your bday!
Oh we absolutely will chat more!!! You will forever be tagged by me ALL. THE. FUCKING. TIME.   🤷🏻‍♀️ it’s just what happens when we’re friends 😁
Oh absolutely that!! 💕
Cherry to herd all the chickens
🥰🥳🥳
I definitely will! I can't believe I never thought to put garlic on 'em.
That's excellent and there are a great deal of career opportunities that come with it.
I assume that's ice cream and I don't eat much ice cream anymore. It doesn't like me.
All of those things sound amazing and relaxing !!! I love to cook and bake! I actually went to culinary school once upon a time 😊- what kind of crafts does your wife do?
Hahaha omg I wish I had your energy!!! But I’m happy to be tagged by you and I look forward to chatting with you 🙃❤️
YEA! She’s my cool gal pal
It's really good.
Thanks. I’m just always afraid of change, it needs to happen but this is huge
Ah no, it's a big tub of chocolates. Give it a Google. I'm not such an ice cream fan either, too cold for my teeth. I have to let it go all melty before I eat it
Oh man, that's awesome! When I was a kid going to culinary school was one of my dreams (I guess it still is in some ways).   My wife has gone through a variety of craft phases. I think her biggest were paper crafting, water color, calligraphy, and now (with a son) kids crafts :) She's also pretty talented with flowers and has done a number of weddings, so floristry is her favorite when she gets the chance.
I only give off the energy I receive 😊😊😊 look forward to chatting, too!!! ❤️❤️
If you welcome change it won't feel scary. Just know you are opening a new path and if you love the subject matter then this is where you belong.
Ooohhh those do look good.
Thanks <3
It's easy to eat too many of them

Lol . I use them for things there not meant for.. which is why I break them 😂
Fair 🤣

So yes pens and pencils, but what other things do you budget for that you could not live without? Also, what things do you budget for that are just fun to have around?
3x5 cards that I have laminated so that I can make Braille flash cards.
Sticky Velcro strips or sticky magnet strips to put on the back of posters/flash cards/pictures and hang them up easily. It also depends on what grade/subject you teach!   As a K teacher, my just for fun things, would be ALL THE CRAFT SUPPLIES and water beads because they’re great sensory bin fillers and they’re fun for everybody 😁
Educational board games   Post it notes   Markers/crayons   Scissors   Copy paper  Books  Bean bag chair/ balance ball chair
As a K teacher a good pair of scissors, and construction paper are a must. For more general supplies wall wax so stuff never falls off and post its
Honestly, stickers and puzzles.  My HS students, even the seniors, love stickers and it's a nice reward alternative too candy.  I also like having a puzzle in the back of the room for students who finish their work early to work on as my school has a no phones in the classroom policy.  Essentials:  White board markers. I can never have enough and they never last as long as I think they will 😂
Posters and poster board are good ones, and I never have enough dry erase markers. Stickers for the kids, along with other quick rewards like mini candy or small "party favor" type toys (though I have to be careful not to give things that may become a nuisance in someone else's class). I've used dry erase contact paper in my classrooms for years to transform desks and other surfaces into spaces for student collaboration. And markers, crayons, and colored pencils get used up (or lost or broken) pretty quickly.
That is an awesome item. I never would have thought of that. I would have spent a lot of money on braille flashcards. That is very creative and frugal.
I am totally not a crafty teacher, but the velcro strips and magnet strips are a great idea.
Heeeyyyy fellow K teacher!!
Which Educational board games do you use?
Which pair of scissors do you use?
Do you have a favorite set of stickers?
The Dry Erase contact paper is a great idea.
I’ve been known to do games too. Buy the game and then modify it with tactiles. Card games are a little easier but I’ve don’t mean board games too. I also buy a lot of fabric puffy paint and those little sticker gems. The paint is gray at modifying things with lines and such and the little gems is great for tactiling calculator and computer keys. I also totally make tactile and Braille stickers. Everyone like stickers
Heeeyyyy! What are your must haves for your classroom??
You can make most educational lol. Uno/monopoly/regular cards can be related to math. Taboo for ELA.
I find Scott’s scissors to be really reliable. They’re sharp and can handle thicker paper
I like the ones with fun colors like [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08518LVFD/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_imm_t1_UvCaGbH1Y8M90?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1), but honestly they love stickers. I've used the old [scratch and sniff smileys](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000F8V290/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_imm_t1_yxCaGbSYWF0SF) that have been around forever and they are just as happy.  Then they started making me stickers in graphic art class 😂 My old laptop was covered with student made stickers.
What are your favorite games to adapt?
Here is what I usually end up ordering every year: Construction paper (whatever colors I’m low on) The teeny post it tabs (use them to split the notebooks students bring into reading and math sections)  Alphabet stickers Index cards I’ve been slowly building up my math manipulatives so I usually get a fun counter of some sort Play doh Paper bags Name cards for desks & cubbies Folders (1 per student for take home folders) Astrobright copy paper Chart paper & markers Clear page sleeves (somehow always run out) Ink pads Black sharpies Replacement toys if any broke Replacement leveled readers And usually at least 1 of some kind of environmental student support (wobble cushion,  fidget, kick band, sticky or foam paper for handwriting, etc)  I’m sure I’m forgetting something but those are what I can remember
I’ve done phase 10 and I’ve done candy land. I’ve also done uno and plain old decks of cards. And then one year I did a game called shadows in the forest. Honestly considering doing house on haunted hill. I think it could be possible. I’ve considered adding board games to my list for that purpose. Some games already exist modified like monopoly and scrabble. But they cost a couple hundred dollars. They are time consuming to make so they are expensive
Nice! Here kindergarten is play based so no notebooks or leveled readers but a whole bunch of toys, games, manipulatives, markers and craft supplies!
What is shadows in the forest?
Ugh! I wish we had that!!! My school district is SO competitive and we have a full day curriculum in a half day program. They even expect them to be reading at the 4th level by the end of the year or they are “behind” 🙄
[shadows and n the forest ](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/shadows-in-the-forest/)
Yeah I’m more of an in between kinda teacher, I like the play based things but sometimes you also need to do some pen and paper activities because writing in sand is all nice and good but you also have to know how to do it on paper 😅 I don’t force the reading and they’re absolutely not expected to know how to read by the end of their 2 years (I actually have to tell parents that in September) we just focus a lot on phonics and syllables and all that good stuff. A lot of my kids know how the basics of reading at the end but not all of them and that’s okay :)
Yes I totally! Agree a balance is good! My school is just so far to one side 100% play based sounds so nice at this point. 😭
Aww well you’re welcome in my classroom anytime 😁
Haha thanks!

Fun fact: Bees have 5 eyes! Why so many?
Love this idea!! Here is a Fun Fact I learned recently from the book I'm reading:  The Eskimos (this is the correct term for Indigenous Americans who historically have lived on the tundra/non-forested riverbanks in Alaska) are considered by many anthropologists/historians to have achieved the greatest technological advancement in the entirety of human history. The traditional Eskimo way of survival in the sub-Arctic tundra is so ingenious and advanced--making a life out of virtually nothing--that many consider it to be the most advanced and astonishing display of human technology and resourcefulness in the history of humanity.  Isn't that cool AF?!  Thanks for the contest!

Fun fact!   Japanese game designer Kenji Eno of Sega and developer Warp learned that they had a considerable amount of fans that were blind/visually impaired. To help them and give them a game they could easily play without depending on the visuals, they developed the game  ***Real Sound: Kaze no Regret*** for Sega. It is still one of the most popular games for the blind/visually impaired thanks to its audio-based gameplay, it's ease of access, and it's beautiful storyline.   Another Fun Fact!   Kenji Eno also developed this game with help from his own fans. He made personal visits to many of his fans who had written him letters of appreciation for his previous games and found out what would help them, what they enjoyed, and how he could make the gameplay easier for his fans. It's one of my favorite stories since my little brother went blind 2 years ago. People go above and beyond what you ever expect!

Fun fact...   Cats purr on you to heal you, as I mentioned to u/poisonedmonkey the other day!   Now, I’m going to let the scientists explain this because I’ll balls it up, but here’s the info:  Scientists have demonstrated that cats produce the purr through intermittent signaling of the laryngeal and diaphragmatic muscles. Cats purr during both inhalation and exhalation with a consistent pattern and frequency between 25 and 150 Hertz. Various investigators have shown that sound frequencies in this range can improve bone density and promote healing.  This association between the frequencies of cats' purrs and improved healing of bones and muscles may provide help for some humans. Bone density loss and muscle atrophy is a serious concern for astronauts during extended periods at zero gravity. Their musculo-skeletal systems do not experience the normal stresses of physical activity, including routine standing or sitting, which requires strength for posture control.  Because cats have adapted to conserve energy via long periods of rest and sleep, it is possible that purring is a low energy mechanism that stimulates muscles and bones without a lot of energy. The durability of the cat has facilitated the notion that cats have "nine lives" and a common veterinary legend holds that cats are able to reassemble their bones when placed in the same room with all their parts. Purring may provide a basis for this feline mythology.   (I pasted quite a bit because I find it super interesting but you can read the rest of the article, [here. ](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-cats-purr/) Thanks for the contest! 😃

Fun factor or random short story! Whenever people hear the phrase "Death by Chocolate," they probably assume it’s a joke or a really embarrassing play that they were in junior year of high school. Thankfully, they’re usually right, but on one occasion in Mexico in the 17th century, chocolate was the culprit that did a man in. To be fair, it wasn’t the chocolate itself, but the poison injected into the chocolate, which killed a Spanish Bishop brazen enough to ban the consumption of chocolate during church services. If only he could have abstained, he might have survived. Chocolate: the food so good you eat it even though it's poison.   Ancients believed chocolate was the food of the gods. Aztec and Mayan kings drank cups of warm chocolate on a regular basis, and the magical cacao bean, so valued in pre-Columbian America, was used as a form of currency.

I'm watching True Blood right now and agreed so much with this comment a vampire made, about how humans are the only animal that willingly destroys its natural habitat. :(
Well their traditional way of survival--the subterranean huts they made to keep warm, their rock lamps, the way they devised perfect hunting methods for seals and whales, the way they learned how to make clothing to survive in temperatures like -70 F, the layering techniques to keep from getting overheated, how to avoid getting lost on the tundra, training dogs to pull sleds and help them move from camp to camp. The meticulously precise stitching required to make sealskin boots entirely waterproof, the correct furs to wear in what layers to avoid freezing or overheating, whether to wear an item of clothing with the fur facing outward or inward, depending on what was needed to regulate body temperature. Their extensive knowledge of ice and how to hunt on and through it. On and on. They survived in arguably the least habitable environment on the planet; it's so remarkable.
That is absolutely amazing.
It's called *The Cruelest Miles: The heroic Story of Dogs and Men in a Race Against an Epidemic* by Gay Salisbury and Laney Salisbury. I read a lot of non-fiction, and it's absolutely in the top 5 nonfiction books I've ever read. I strongly recommend it--it's a comprehensive history/look at Alaska in the 1920s and before, and it's absolutely fascinating.  Bonus: It has pictures of early 20th century Alaskan sled dogs in it.
Right?! So surprising but also cool
Twos day. Has to be
Nightmare fuel. lol
Oh I was wondering if anyone was actually gonna read it 🤣
I mean, it is to me ;)
Yup they're devious
Me too! With cute little kitty backpacks!!
No! I'l have to watch :)
It is amazing!!! I wasn't quite aware of the layering and the fabrics and what that meant! It is all truly remarkable!
I am definitely going to look that one up!
LOOLL
Chapter 6 of *The Cruelest Miles: The Heroic Story of Dogs and Men in a Race Against an Epidemic*, the book I'm reading, goes into it all! Well worth a read even if you don't read the rest.
Excellent!!

Unintentional stay at home mom here lol. I have a teenage daughter and a 2 year old Frenchie daughter. Born and raised in Memphis, TN, but I would love to move to Toronto, ON or Denver, Co. I went to the University of Memphis and I have degrees in Sport Management and Instructional & Curriculum Leadership. Safe to say I love sports. I found out about this sub while participating in the Secret Santa sub for the first time this past Christmas. It was a good experience plus I absolutely love Amazon so I had to come check y’all out. Not sure what else to say but AMA!

Hi there and welcome to the sub! Hope you'll enjoy your time here. If you have questions, feel free to let me know. Toronto is pretty cool, though I also really loved Montreal when I visited there. Where's your favorite place you've visited?
Welcome!! Favorite team?
Aww Frenchie! I have an almost 2 year old Frenchie son! What’s her name?
Hello and welcome
Hello! Welcome to RAOA! 👋 I’m Lily, it’s so nice to meet you! I hope that we can be friends! Being a newbie can be pretty tricky, so if you need help with anything - or just want to chat - feel free to PM me and I will assist you to the best of my ability! ✨💛
Welcome, fellow Tennessean! I was born and raised in East TN, in a little town somewhere between Knoxville and Johnson City.   I'd love to see a picture of your Frenchie!!
Welcome to the sub!  I hope you enjoy your stay!  :)
Welcome! I’m currently working on my degree which I hope to change to teaching. What hobbies do you have?
Welcome! Secret santa is a lot of fun. They do numerous other exchanges in many themes through the year as well.   &#x200B;  What did you send and what did you receive?
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Welcome! What is your favorite sport to watch and favorite team in that sport?
Hello and welcome! What is your favorite way to relax? I love colorado! Vail is my favorite area! I went there for my honeymoon!
Welcome to the group! 😀
I hope to get to Montreal and other places in Canada one day, but I’ve been to Toronto 3 times and that’s my favorite place. I been twice for Raptors games and once for a getaway. It’s just something about Toronto that attracts me. Plus I love the weather
NBA= grizzzlies.  NFL= Titans and Panthers
Her name is MJ, what’s your baby’s name?
Thank you so much 😊
Thank you 😊
Hey! Are you a Big Orange fan?    [Here](https://imgur.com/a/8IIyzfc) she is giving me the “take me outside” look 😄
Thank you!
Thanks for the welcome! I love reading and also doing jigsaw puzzles. My daughter has recently been getting me into playing video games with her so that’s a new thing.
I can’t wait until they reveal this year’s calendar I will definitely be participating in more things. I received a Harry Potter cookbook and a Walking Dead escape room type game. I gave a book, journal, and sports paraphernalia.
Happy New Year to you too! Thanks for the welcome!   If I had to choose a favorite holiday it would be either Halloween or Thanksgiving because fall is my favorite time of year and I love to cook/eat and I have a major sweet tooth. It’s hard to say what’s my favorite part of nature. I’m a country girl, grew up on a farm, so I really appreciate and love nature. I love listening to birds chirp, I love love love seeing the animals(especially deer), I love the smell of cut grass ...there are so many things.    Like you I have daily visitors that I feed. I even keep dog food in my car in case I see a stray. I love animals.
Thanks! My favorite sport is basketball and fave professional team is the Memphis Grizzlies
Hey 👋🏾 one of my favorite ways to relax is curl up with my dog by the fireplace and read.   Vail is definitely one of those places I want to visit. I bet it was a great place for a honeymoon
Thank you!
Nice! Yeah, it's definitely a great city. So much to do and see there, and good places to eat!!
Goose haha
I get a lot of shit from my family about this: but I'm just honestly not into sports, like, at all. But, if I had to pick one to watch, it'd def be basketball. Mainly because I played in elementary school for a few years (lol) so I at least know what it is I'm looking at, as far as the game goes.   She is a cutie!! I bet she's a good cuddler. She looks like she'd be a good cuddle pup ☺️
Nice which games have you tried with your daughter
Awesome! Sounds like it was an aweome exchange each way!  My santa sent me Reign of Cthulhu (board game), a mug with an octopus in it, and octopus ice mold. And then I sent some fabric for my giftee's quilting project, embroidery floss, reese, and stitched up a little scene of Mt Shasta since she loves the outdoors but is in her car for work a lot. I hope he can hang it on her mirror (it's very small), or somewhere else in her car.
Oh I love the Grizzlies! Ja Morant is so much fun to watch!  I’m a Jazz fan so I was super excited to get Mike Conley.
It was! We stayed in Avon because it was quieter but we traveled to Vail and Beaver Creak a lot! The entire area is just lovely!  OOO I love to read! I usually light some cracking candles and listen to thunderstorm white noise and curl up with a blanket and a book! What are some of your favorite books ?
Lol that is cute! Frenchies are the absolute best
Nothing wrong with not liking sports. I just know most people from that area diiieeeee for orange. Lol.   She is definitely a great cuddler. I can’t move an inch without her. She’s really spoiled.
So far Call of Duty and Mortal Kombat on the Xbox one but also I now have a roblox and among us account lol
Wow sounds like you both got what you wanted. I’m sure she already has it hanging in there ☺️ had you participated before?
Ja is such a breath of fresh air for us. First time in a loooong I’ve been proud of a grizz 1st rd draft pick. We had a great run with Conley but I’m one of those ppl who was ready for him to go so we could start over. I still root for him though. He did a lot for the city.
Wow. Now I really really want to listen to thunderstorm white noise and read. I’ve never thought about doing that and I love rain/thunderstorms!    I can’t really say what my favorite book(s) are. I’ve been an avid reader since elementary school. My favorite genre is mystery/suspense and my favorite authors include JD Robb, Harlan Coben, Robert Crais, and many more. I also read a lot of zombie poc and post poc books. I read a little bit of everything except romance. I hate romance lol. What do you like to read?
They are! I love him so much 😭 I feel like they have the personality of an actual toddler. Or mine does anyway LOL
They definitely do, I am in the minority here as far as that goes lol.   I've got a literal baby at home right now, so I'm trying to hold off until she's a bit older, but I'm dying to get a dog!
Nice I want to get into video games but idk really
I have, in so many exchanges
Definitely, I think it was time for you guys to rebuild as well. How do you feel about Marc Gasol kinda forcing his way out?
oo I love a good zombie read! I LOVED World war Z audiobook! It was fantastic! I love to read horror, Fantasy, YA Fantasy and Historical Fiction!   I started doing the white noise while reading because my family is loud lmao   so I put on headphones and zone out!
Oh, mine too. Their little tantrums and talking back are hilarious
Awww good luck and I wish you lots of rest lol. I have a teenager I def don’t miss those days. Times flying by so fast she’ll have a companion before you know it. Frenchies are great with children too if you’re looking to get one 😊
I can’t really get into it for long periods of time like my daughter and soooo many other people do. Though I do remember being addicted to my Nintendo in elementary school so I get the attraction.
Hopefully I’ll be able to say that this time next year
I wanted Marc gone as well. He’s still my favorite Grizz ever (besides Zbo) but I wanted that whole squad gone: Zbo, Marc, Mike, & Tony Allen. I felt like we couldn’t fully rebuild until they were all gone. They were way too comfortable and a lot of grizz fans really love the players and I feel the owners/front office kept those players around longer than necessary just to keep tickets sales up
I love all those genres as well! That’s such a good idea. Thank you for that tip
Yes! [This](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAyI0LfBR5t/?igshid=14k99l1pszrvy) is honestly one of my favorites. So glad we got it on camera! 🤣
Thank you! And yes, I need a smallish breed (or mix) that I can convince my husband has a good rep for doing well with kids. I'm gonna have to literally do research and a presentation to convince him it'll be okay.   I mean, I know there's inherent risk in bringing any new pet in the home- but he's particularly weird about dogs. He was attacked by a random dog as a kid, so he's still kinda wary of unfamiliar dogs/dogs in general. He is actually starting to get more comfortable around dogs he knows, so I'm hoping we can build up to a pup of our own! Gonna be patient and just let it come about organically. 😁
Yes it was final fantasy and Zelda for me
I get that, it was definitely a solid squad full of fan favs, hopefully this season goes well for you!
Omg so cute. MJ has an IG as well do you mind if we follow ??
He’s going to be one of those dads in the videos you see that say their dad didn’t want a dog then shows the dad being the dogs favorite person and wearing matching pajamas. Frenchies are literally like children who always want to please their parents. I really hope you can convince him. I guarantee y’all won’t regret it.
Thanks, same to you and your Jazz!!
Not at all! 😊

Hello everyone\~  I'm 30 years old, and I'm an English teacher. I teach English as a second language to children in China, but I'll be moving to South Korea some time next year when all this craziness dies down a little and makes it safer to travel. I love my job, I love coffee, I love tea, and I love Korean culture. I speak Korean, and a *tiny* bit of Mandarin. I have a husky that my family rescued from an abusive home almost 4 years ago.   I work from home at the moment for a really great company. This allows me to take care of my parents and younger brother -- all are disabled -- and sometimes I forget to take care of myself. I unwind with Korean dramas, Kpop and good books as often as I can. I don't know if there's anything else about me that's interesting or relevant, but hi, hello\~ it's so nice to meet everyone!
Welcome!! What kdrama are you watching now?
Hi there! How did you get involved in teaching English? Were you recruited or did you search for a company?
Hi! Welcome! What's your favourite flavour creamer to mix into coffee?
Welcome to the sub! Moving to South Korea sounds so fun — what are you most looking forward to?
Welcome!
what's your favorite korean dish?   every time i watch kdramas, i always crave kbbq hahah
Hello! Also a teacher here. What kpop groups and Kdramas do you like?
Welcome!  Is it vipkid that you work for?  I’m a former teacher and have often considered it.

Hi! I have a question about the part where you said you are teaching English in China. My brother is really interested in teaching English in Japan. Did you have to get a degree in teaching before you could even apply to become a English teacher? How did the whole thing work?
Hello! Welcome! I was an English major in college, and have frequently thought about the same career path you're on!   What are you most excited to see or do in South Korea?
Tea and coffee. Hello friend lol. What is your favorite thing about Korean culture? Also, whats your favorite Korean drama??
Hello and welcome to the sub!
Hi! I lived in Seoul for a few years as a kid, it was a really great experience. I went to school on the army base though so I didn't learn much Korean. But thanks for the nostalgia hit! Reading any good books lately?
Hello and welcome!  I love Korean dramas too. Can you give me any recommendation for mystery/thriller dramas?

I just started one called Gapdong. It's got Lee Joon from MBLAQ in it and it's a thriller/murder mystery. It's a little slow but I'm hoping it ramps up a bit.
I was searching for online jobs one day and found it. I just graduated from college last May and I've wanted to teach English abroad my whole life. Because of COVID I can't go abroad yet, so this was the next best step for some good experience! I found a great company and I love it so far.
My favorite is International Delight Cinnabon creamer or the Italian Sweet Cream one. They're soooo good but the Cinnabon one is hard to find.
Thanks! I'm really looking forward to meeting my future students and learning more Korean and more about the culture. This has been my dream, so there's just so much to look forward too!
My favorite is tteokbokki! It's so spicy it makes my ears itch but it's soooooo so good.
Hello fellow teacher! ♡♡♡ My favorite dramas are Dream Knight, 49 Days, You Who Came From the Stars, Boarding House 24 and Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Ju.
I work for EF Kids. I've heard some iffy things about VIPKid so I've avoided it so far haha
My favorite holiday is probably Christmas. I enjoy buying gifts and seeing everyone's reaction. It's also one of the only holidays where my dad gets super excited about things enough to leave his room. He's pretty sick, so it takes a lot for him to get up and out to the living room.   As for nature I enjoy taking walks with my dog. I can see the Ohio River from my house so I like to take him up a hill close by and sit and watch the barges go by. It's very relaxing and he enjoys it just as much as I do!   Thank you so much for your kindness!
Hi Lily! Thank you so much! ♡ I go by Sisi, and I really appreciate your kindness!
I'm not in China, but I can definitely answer your questions since I'm planning to move abroad. Each country is different, but I know the requirements for Asia so here we go.    - A degree specifically in Education would help, but it's not required. I would go for a major in English Education, or anything English related as it will help you in the long run.   - A BA is required to teach English in Japan, but you can apply close to your graduation date to most agencies.    - You must be TEFL/TESOL certified. TEFL/TESOL are essentially the same thing and are used interchangeably in the industry. Do an in person class, not an online one. Some places require the in person teaching portion of your certification, some don't. It just depends on your school.   - Think about whether you want younger or older kids, find an agency that will best suit your needs and has a good reputation and really just have fun with it. I'm not sure about Japan, but I know Korean schools will have good contracts that include flight reimbursements for the flight there and a flight back home at the end of your contract period. Some contracts also include housing stipends.   - Save $3,000 for your spending/living money until your first paycheck.    If you have any other questions, please let me know! I'm happy to help!
I'm honestly most excited to travel. I've never been out of Ohio/Kentucky so traveling is going to be so much fun!
I love the language, honestly. It's so beautiful both written and spoken to me. Also, my favorite drama of all time is probably 49 Days. It's so bittersweet but I love it so much.
Thank you! ♡
That's awesome! I'm excited to see Seoul. I'm currently reading Of Songbirds and Snakes by Suzanne Collins. It's getting good so far! What about you?
Oh! I'm currently watching Gapdong (Gap-dong-i) with Lee Joon from MBLAQ. It's a murder mystery/thriller kind of drama. It's been a bit slow but I'm only on episode 2 so I think it'll pick up. A lot of people have recommended it.
Sounds fascinating. Do you teach from the US then? Since you can't travel?
Awww dang, I see the Cinnabon one a lot out here. We just got a Fruity Pebbles one to try but I didn't like it that much. My favourite is peppermint mocha!
Yeah it sounds amazing!! Best of luck :D
oo yum i love tteokbokki but also can’t handle the spice 😂  i love making soondubu during cold winter days!
You who came from the stars is so good. I watched 49 days too.
Nice!  I’ll have to look into that one.
Well I'm thinking that you should make every day Christmas for dad so we can get him up and moving around a little bit more often. I have an outlet 5 minutes away for me and I have a Little River a few houses down from me though I can't get down the Hill now because of my arthritis in my leg hopefully in the next couple months it gets better and I can go down there and enjoy nature.
Thank you! If I or my brother have any questions I’ll send them to you! Good luck!
ooo I will have to look into that one! I havent heard of it!
I am mostly done with To Sleep in a Sea of Stars by Christopher Paolini. I absolutely loved the Eragon series by him and it's interesting to see him delve into sci-fi. And I'm just getting into reading The Case for Keto by Gary Taubes. My husband and I have read other books by him and done a lot of research on the keto diet and we honestly believe it's the healthiest that most people can eat regardless of weight loss (though we definitely need to shed some pounds too). So I jumped on his most recent book to refresh my memory of some of the studies he's pointed out.   Make sure to visit Seoul Tower 😊 I'm sure you have that on the agenda but it really is beautiful, especially the walk up to it. We lived right on the way up to the Hilton in Seoul too and even though it's just a fancy hotel I really liked going up there and looking around. Lots of fancy cars driving by all the time! This was almost a decade ago now so I'm sure a lot has changed. Oh, and there are these little corn shaped things they sell in vendor booths and markets in a lot of the subway stations! They're kind of a cake outside with a slightly sweet cream in the middle, very mild. I really used to love them. So much to see and do! Bringing back memories is definitely making me miss it now 😅  Sidenote, I've never read the hunger games but would like to. When I looked up Of Songbirds and Snakes it was listed as about physical and emotional abuse. Would you say that's a prevalent/graphic theme? I would love to read it but I'm kind of sensitive to those topics.
Yep! I work from home at the moment because of the pandemic.
I guess people here in KY like it a lot or something because I can *never* find it. I can find it easier in Ohio but I don't want to drive so far lol. I haven't seen the Fruity Pebbles one before! We got a new one called Butter Cookie though and it sounds good. I'm not very adventurous though. Is the peppermint mocha a winter one or do they always have it?
Both of them are amazing. 49 Days was my first and You Who Came From the Stars was my second. I love them.
It's very tiring for him to move a whole lot right now. He's wheelchair bound, and in the late stages of heart failure so just getting up to go to the bathroom is difficult for him at the moment. But we're trying to do more, even if it's going to play a game with him in his room! I really hope you can get out and enjoy nature soon. Have you tried Tiger Balm? Before I had my back surgery, it was the only thing that would help me and now my back bothers me, so I use the patches when I have a bad day and they REALLY help.
Ooo butter cookie does sound good! I'm not sure tbh. I think so but I'd imagine you could just get a peppermint syrup to add into a chocolate flavour creamer!
Have you been watching any k-dramas lately?
Well I'm sure that hes appreciating everything that you're doing for him and the time that you're spending together making memories playing games that sounds wonderful. I've heard of the tiger balm but I can't say I've ever used it a? Here's to hoping that you have a wonderful day.
I miiiight have to try that some time! What is it best in? Coffee or tea?
I'm currently watching Gapdong. It's like a murder mystery/thriller type show and it's kind of slow but it's getting better. You?
I'd definitely say coffee but I'm not a frequent drinker of either. But I am much more so a drinker of coffee between the two.
I Never heard of that one. I finished Sweet Home recently and that one is really good.
Coffee has been my life since I started working on Beijing time. My day starts around 2am and ends at 8am most days so my schedule is... strange.

This is so sweet!
Thank you so much!!! I am always on the lookout for healthier snack options and this trail mix looks like a great mix!!! The last time I signed up at a new branch they gave me a generic Citizens water bottle lol trail mix kicks that bottles butt!!!
Can you tell me how you like the ninja bullet?? Just curious because I heard mixed reviews, people seem to either love it or hate it. And at some point I’m probably going to ditch my ancient blender for one of these! 💕
Now that’s a great gift with purchase. The nut industry must be doing well! :)
u/dumbportagee 🥰
Uesssssss
Awww yay!! He definitely deserves it, he's such a great guy! :-)
that's so so awesome~! 🌸💗
That’s a sweet deal!!
this is so so sweet of you!!
Oooh that looks good, congrats, enjoy!
Yea, ya can’t make a smoothie with a water bottle!
I really like it. It’s got great power (700 watts which is more than other bullet blenders) **but** it’s very small. Like one serving small. I’ve been annoyed a few times that there wasn’t room to add more of something, but if you’re making smoothies and shakes for just yourself it’s perfect. If you like to make larger things I would just get the Ninja blender that you can use these bullet sized cups on or the large pitcher.
Nuts are definitely where it’s at
There are so many younger people in this group that have no idea what a plastic sport water bottle is lol oh the days before yetis and tumblers, strapped to your bike water always had a nice plastic taste lol
Thank you! I would probably have the same issue, but it looks really cool. I’m going to look into the ninja blender!
Oh I remember them. Bleh.
Yes, if I could redo my choice I would get the big blender that you can use these little ones with.

My lil contest  The one joke I always remember from years ago. Boss in a call center trying to be cool, he told jokes and fooled around all the time.   A mushroom walks into a Bar and the bartender says to leave, we don’t serve your kind here. The mushroom replies why not? I’m a fun guy.   I laughed ridiculously hard at that 20+ years ago.   A priest, a rabbi and a preacher walk into a bar. One of them says, this feels funny for some reason.
My Lil Contest   I wanted to be a Mexican archer but I didn’t habanero :(
OMG that is hilarious!!! I gotta remember that one!!
My dad says that last one ALL THE TIME.
My boyfriend does this all the time. "I'm bored." "Hi Bored, I'm Bill."
lmfao

My friend bought me one for christmas, and let me tell you! I wear it all the time. Cleaning toilets? Im sparkly. Getting surgery? yep, I wore it. I may need a dye job, I may look like the pandemic has won, But Im a queen!
That’s beautiful!
OoOo!!! Holy moly it’s gorgeous!!!! I hope you wear it around all day!!! Congratulations, your highness! 😊
👸🏼💖💜
Cute!!
Very sparkly 😍 your Royal Highness!!
Would it be weird to wear a tiara out in public for no reason??? Because....I would TOTALLY do that if I had this! <3
/u/dreyhi   I'm not sure why or what I did to deserve this, but thank you! I was confused when I opened it, but then my husband said, "For the orc princess!" I love it, it's awesome! Also, your face is pretty!! 👸💚💚💚
It's so shiny and pretty!
That’s beautiful! Love it! 💕
Your majesty....👸

Stunning!!
I'd wear that every single day at home.
This is so pretty 👑💖
Aww gosh that’s so cute haha
Dude I never knew crowns could make someone feel so special!! Everyone should get one then! Imagine changing your child's diapers feeling like you're summoning the neighborhood squirrels to your windows as totally not eat creatures giving totally not rat blessings to your new family member. :D
Love it, thank you! I got a good chuckle! 😊😂💚💚
Going to wear it while a wrangle the grandbaby, lol.

A lovely bejeweled battle axe! You know, to match! 😊👸💚💚
Hi there friend! How have you been? 😊💚
Hi moth friend! How are you? 😊💚
Lien Rose doesn't have enough hair yet! 😂😂
A man never feels hungry so long as there's dwarf bread around.
I've been struggling, if I'm honest. But! I'm back and ready to spread happy again! How are you??
That’s fair lol. Have to see somebody in that banana shirt tho !
Right because it'll knock your teeth in.
I am so sorry to hear that! I have noticed your absence and thought about you. I am OK, tired and overwhelmed but OK. I am doing my best every day to get through and stay positive, but it's not easy. I hope things get better for you and I'm so glad you are back! 💚💚
OK. 💡💡💡

Is there really a random wishlist generator?
U/Rosiecakeness, thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you
There absolutely is. If you're on mobile, check out the menu on the main sub, then go to user tools. That's where you'll find the random generator, the contest raffler, and other nifty and easy to use domahickies.  I have no idea how to get there on a computer though. I use my phone for everything nowadays.
You are so very welcome!  It was hard to choose which one to send you so I let hubby pick.  You have some great spice blends on your WL!  Now, what’s for dinner?!?
Thank you so much!
Same thing on a computer  upper right corner - Menu/User Tools/RWG
I made cast iron pizza with vodka and tomato puree and dried aged prosciutto for lunch. Then, Chinese for dinner. I just haven't figured out what yet. What would you and the hubby like? I'm on it.
My pleasure!
❤️

This contest is [CLOSED] just like my work week! It was indeed a freaky Friday. Winner will be announced when I get home. I wish I could gift all of you!   PI was going to wait until Valentine's to do another contest, but damn it, gifting is just soooo addictive and this community is so wonderful, so I need to get a little fix!  1) Please use the term Freaky Friday for the raffle. 2) US only - My bank is jerky. 3) DBAD 4) Tell me what's going on for your freaky Friday. Mine has buckwild COVID patients and is already freaky. I'm out at 7:30 AM, tomorrow morning, which is when the contest ends. 5) Just chat it up. What fun quarantine, social distancing things are you doing for a wild Friday? I'm probably playing The Fox in the Forest with a roommate and sleeping. 6) Summon summon if you like.
My freaky Friday will include chasing down little old ladies.........to turn into paperwork for the feral cat clinic   Other than that I’ll be picking up my kids and then making homemade pizza
Freaky Friday 😉 I’m still on Thursday but tomorrow I’m reading a book I’ve been waiting to break into 😂 how about you beetle? Oh I’m rereading and you already mentioned. Good luck my friend 💙
Freaky Friday !!!   Are you a nurse?   For my freaky Friday I’m going to sleep in and spend the day finally writing my new penpal letters. I’m excited to ship them out this weekend! I have a few people I need to send stuff to. Excited to blast music in the background and sleep !!  u/pm_ur_uterine_cake u/fawn_angel u/Sirmiketheyoung what are y’all doing this Friday ?
It’s almost Freaky Friday !  I’m about to sleep through the beginning of my Friday, nothing has happened yet! 😂
I'll be doing homework and usual stuff. Hopefully doing a little reading for pleasure or Reddit surfing.  Freaky Friday
Im debating on going shopping tomorrow all alone so I can go slow and embrace some me time. I always feel rushed when I go shopping with my husband. So itll be nice. Awkwardly enough, go christmas shopping lmao. Im already starting gathering presents for the end of the year :/ . Hopefully Im not the only lunatic lol.  I spent today cleaning the closet, so its time to reward myself lol.  Freaky Friday :)! Its a good movie ;). Wheres my friend u/queerpenix ?
Freaky Friday! Still Thursday and going to bed soon, but I’m with you in spirit!!! Thanks for the contest
My Freaky Friday will be more of the same: food, internet, household chores, and movies. Safe, but boring.  Thanks for hosting a contest.  u/Serine23
Happy Freaky Friday! Technically it’s not Friday for me for 10ish more minutes. 🤣  My daughter has her 15 month check up tomorrow. I may be more nervous than she is about her getting vaccines. I always feel so bad seeing her cry or if she gets a reaction afterwards. 😩 But it has to be done for her safety! After that my mom is coming over (she’s in our COVID bubble!) and making us all chicken pot pie. Yum! Thanks for hosting!   Tagging u/fawn_angel because she tagged me first so now we’re playing tag. 😝💕
Freaky Friday! I going to work and then relax by reading and taking a bath! Tell them about your candy u/bobacupcake!
Freaky Friday! I used to love that movie when I was younger. The one with Lindsey Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis.   Tomorrow I’m going to take my daughter to a park to ride her bike. Other than that I have no plans.   I’m going to summon some new friends! u/phenix4597 u/limeprobably
Freaky Friday! 🌸  most likely will be making some amazing sweets called tanghulu for this freaky friday~! 💗 it is basically fruit covered in a hard caramel coating 🍓 very easy to make and very aesthetically pleasing and tasty! 💗 hope that the rest of you will have an amazing and fun friday! 🌸  tagging the sweetest u/gdarn16 back 🌸
For the Freaky Friday! I am probably going to work on my homework, play some AC Valhalla, and spend some quality time with my handsome kitty!
My Freaky Friday will be spent the same way I spend every Friday- selling, cleaning, thinking, and waiting. I'll probably read and watch some Disney+, too.
My Freaky Friday will consist of watching the cats and dogs while my mom and dad go to the doctor’s office for a post-op checkup. Going to watch Good Morning America (affectionately known as “Bad Morning America” in our house considering the events of the last year+). Maybe the new season of Hell’s Kitchen as well. :)  Thanks for the giveaway, and Happy Friday!
It is SO fun to host contests so I don't blame you! Happy Freaky Friday — hope you manage OK.   My Friday will hopefully be productive (despite an all-employee meeting) and I will hopefully go for a freaky run! :D To make it even more wild, I'm probably going to do some work on my paint-by-number and maybe even make popcorn tonight!  u/mistermagellan what's going on for your freaky Friday?
Freaky Friday :) My days have been pretty laid back lately. I’m hopefully starting a new book tomorrow but there’s too many to choose from and it’s so hard to decide!   What is The Fox in the Forest??
Freaky Friday 🙃  I have a doc appt early and then I get to be the teacher-mom which means the kids are home from school. They listen to their teachers better than me!   Besides that we are having cake for kam tomorrow night and plan to give her a couple extra gifts. I already gave her a few on her bday bc I can never wait to give. It’s ridiculous. If I get anyone anything it’s really hard to hold onto it in secret for me.   We’ll be doing the same as the last year - at home and staying healthy!   You?
Freaky Friday ! I’m working OT as a pharmacy tech and working vaccination clinics, so I’m shocked to have BOTH Saturday and Sunday off. I’ll be in fuzzy pants the whole time.

Freaky Friday!!  I'm working tomorrow, but afterwards, having some drinks with friends over zoom to start off the long weekend 😊
My freaky friday will be so much work. I'm looking forward to Saturday when I can just chill haha
Ooh, my Freaky Friday is gonna be chilllll.  I'm gonna sleep in (until 9 or 10 probably) and wake up with a nice, hot cup of coffee. I'll watch a bit of TV with my dad and then read a bit more of IT. I'll probably read until lunch time, and then I'll make lunch! I was going to make this today, but couldn't be bothered, so tomorrow, I'm having sausage, onions, and potatoes! After that... it's either a nap or more reading or possibly both lol! And then just a ton of relaxing for the rest of the night!  My freaky friday is getting less freaky the more I think about it LOL!  Thanks for the contest! <3
My freaky friday plans are to chill at a private local beach. Hopefully, there are no people there. Then, netflix marathon. Really trying to relax.
Freaky Friday!   I will be at work dealing with suuuuper rude and ignorant customers, while also having a perpetual anxiety attack over going to spend the weekend with a guy I totally dig. I’m so nervous! 🤦🏻‍♀️
Hey! Thanks for the contest! I don't have a super Freaky Friday planned, lol. But I'll be dog-sitting. So, there will be lots of cuddles, wagging tails, and snoot-boops.
My freaky Friday? My wife is inviting her dad over and she is making a really nice dinner and we’re having beers!
My Freaky Friday will be filled with crocheting as usual. I’m making washcloths using up a lot of brown cotton yarn I have.
Freaky Friday has arrived I am enjoying the last work day before my 3 day weekend!
Freaky Friday  I will be working and then I can enjoy my 3 day weekend.
My Freaky Friday is probably gonna be pretty chill. I get to see my niece, which is exciting! And I'm probably going to a thrift store. Looking forward to that.
I'm just going to.watch horror movies on freaky Friday
For my freaky Friday, I will probably have a solo dance party and dance in front of my dogs, cuz the look they give me cracks me up.
Freaky Friday will likely consist of binge watching Netflix. I’m open for options of y’all have any good shows to throw my way!
My Freaky Friday is gonna be spent playing the piano, learning lab techniques, and maybe buying new boots. I wore holes through the soles of my old ones!
Its finally Freaky Friday! I've got to go to sleep first then work. But I'm planning on cooking some Korean beef and watching a movie with my kids.
Freaky Friday   I’m probably going to go grocery shopping in the later afternoon/evening, and then cooking dinner and relaxing. Not sure what to make yet. Maybe some chili? Or tacos? Idk!
I’m just walking three dogs in the morning on Friday. Then chilling for the rest of the day.  Freaky Friday
Freaky Friday will consist of a morning workout, making a yummy breakfast, and parking my butt on the couch to binge American Dad and play catch-up on Animal Crossing. I’m currently on November 17, so I’ve got a while 🥲
my freaky friday will consist of getting groceries after work, naps, watching a friend stream assassin's creed in our server, and... maybe starting another round of focaccia dough? all very exciting, i know
My freaky Friday will consist of finishing my  school work then right after getting ready to go to work 😅
My freaky Friday will consist of cooking a sexy meal for mr man. Wink wink.  I work tomorrow night so I’ll be practicing safety procedures at work. Yay me .

It’s my cousin’s birthday so I might celebrate with her on this fine Freaky Friday :)   Before anyone says anything we are a part of the same COVID bubble!! All precautions taken.   I also got an EveryPlate delivery so I’ll be in the kitchen :)
I took off work since it’s my birthday. So far no plans, maybe get some takeout later and watch movies. I just didn’t wanna be at work today!
My Freaky Friday consists of teaching half day kindergarten (2 classes) on for today a half day schedule so I have an hour overlap of being responsible for 33, 5 year olds. And then when it’s all over I have parent teacher conferences. 🥲 but the caveat is a three day weekend I get to look forward to!
Freaky Friday, I will be finishing the last day of this work conference nursing a hangover and then I plan to go to the gym but that may not happen if I don’t feel better lol.  I need to go to the grocery store and grab some food to make dinner this upcoming week. But I’ll probably end up cuddling with my dog and watching anime if I’m being honest.
ooh homemade pizza sounds amazing! 🌸 what toppings do you like?
Which book??
Thank you for summoning me! Oh my tomorrow is Freaky Friday already? My goodness 😳  lol it snuck up on me. I'm working on packing and cleaning.  It's a process. One room at a time. I'm working on my dining room, livingroom and kitchen first. Those items have to go in the pod first. BUT my grandson will be here this weekend so we will fit that in too!  SO I'LL BE JUGGLING WITH HIM, LOL 💕💖🤍 u/vexedkitten94 u/ivy_rose204 u/doyouwannasnog

Happy birthday!
We make several pizzas...  My 4 year old gets a cheese and chicken deep dish mini pizza, my 8 year old gets a medium size deep cheese extra pepperoni and I usually make myself a  cheese, feta and ricotta pizza.   We have several cast irons that we use to make all of these. Sometimes we’ll do a thin crust but we all like deep dish style
It’s called Wildwood! A kids fantasy one
Thank you for the tag hun! I hope you have a wonderful Freaky Friday! 😘

That hat is too cute!!
u/TisteAndii
These clips are on my wishlist too! Please let me know how you feel about them
Cute! Are these chip clips made of metal?
Tbh they are really sturdy (and very adorable), 10/10 definitely recommend
They are plastic, but feel surprisingly durable

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kxphbr/discussion_extroverts_how_are_you_battling_the/

This week I am super struggling with not being allowed to see my friends - my people!. Where I am located, we are not allowed any gatherings of any kind right now. During normal times I see friends usually 4-5 times a week and most Saturdays were spent with my best friend and her girls. For most of covid, we were allowed a cohort. I missed ALL my people, but I at least got to see my best friend as many times as I wanted each week. But now cohorts haven't been allowed for over a month and I am struggling. How are other social butterflies and extroverts coping?     I have tried zoom calls, chat threads, and we did a virtual game night on New Years Eve. But I need other ideas.
I am an extroverted introvert and it’s been hard.  My introverted part wants it to never end but i am craving a girls night out so desperately.
Can you go out for walks even if solo? Or small hikes? That might help because in addition to not seeing your friends you might be feeling cooped up
Honestly, this sub! Getting to chat with people here and on discord and getting to game with friends. Its been a huge huge help
Not very well. And now it's gotten quite cold/snowy here and those fresh air walks aren't really doing it for me anymore. I have a lot of chat threads, have watched movies over facetime, online game apps are fun - like Houseparty. I did go to the movies last month because I wanted to see WonderWoman 1984 (it was wonderful!!!!!), but going to the movies often doesn't seem very responsible and isn't the most social activity anyway. I'd love to just go out to dinner or go to a sports game and chat with a stranger about whatever!  if anyone has any tips or tricks on how they deal I am all ears. Or if you want to talk I'm obvs desperate for some conversation hahah!! ::cries in extrovert::
We haven't been able to successfully isolate at all. Donnie and I are both extroverts (him more than me), and his friends always stop by to visit. Not a day goes by without someone coming around.
Gaming mostly, I am currently in isolation since both my parents were positive and I was in contact with them so I am using gaming to connect with friends and so on!! How about you?
Not too well. I feel like I've been doing well up until recently, but the past 3 weeks have been ROUGH! I have been reaching out with friends more though, and trying to play online with them. (Not a gamer, but I play ACNH) Also calling people more and making sure I see those who are in my bubble aka my parents at least weekly.
I'm playing lots of games/doing puzzles/paint nights/whatever you can do seperate together with family and friends. My cousins and I all played among us last week, and my aunt/uncle and I played some jackbox games tonight, and my friend and I are reading a book together on tuesday.
I'm an ambivert with a very chronically sick, very introverted husband. Zoom sucks and I feel like it actually makes me feel worse sometimes. I'd say talking on the phone feels much more intimate and personal to me. I know that doesn't really help, but I can do other things while talking on the phone too, so it feels more normal. For instance, I can play video games or clean my kitchen while chatting with a friend.   I don't have many other ideas. Unfortunately, being away from people isn't easily mitigated. Could you start an art project at the same time as a friend? It might help with a feeling of connection while being alone.
Me too! I want this to last forever but I still wanna hang out with all my friends
I feel this so much lol
I think that is a fair point. Though my first reaction was "alone?". It just feels so boring walking alone. I am working in the office 3 days a week starting next week so I will get to see two coworkers and actually be out in the world more. I am hoping that helps.
I am glad to be here. It has given me a bit joy over the last few days. Does this group have a discord?
Oh! I think I need to do a netflix party. That might be a good way to feel connected with my besties. My mom and I went to the theater in October when things were starting to ease here, but now we are back in an even stricter lockdown and there is nothing open, so even if we wanted to take a risk, it's not possible.
Are there heavy restrictions in your area? They are giving out $1000 fines for anybody who has any sort of social gathering.
I am so sorry. I hope you remain symptom free. I have never been a big gamer. What games do you play?
I found that I handled the first few months ok. I was feeling pretty burnt out in the spring to be honest so the opportunity to be at home and cut out some social activities actually helped, but after the initial lock down we were allowed a "bubble" of people now that has been taken away and I am really struggling.
Yes! I don't know why but zoom makes me feel worse. Its as if it is throwing it in my face that we aren't actually together.   I think I will try just a phone call while doing an art project. Worth a shot, that's for sure.   Will your husband be getting the vaccine? I hope you both can stay safe and things get easier soon. Hugs.
I think this was why I was happy enough in the beginning. We were allowed to have a small bubble and as long as I was allowed to see my people, I was content.
Hugs!
It does! If you reach out to the mods, they can give you access!
Just about anything, I love minecraft since I’ve played it since I was a kid and now play it with friends, forza horizon 4, GTAV, assassins creed... I play a lot of things hehe
I’m so sorry to hear that. How are connecting with other people still? Do you do video chats/phone calls/etc?
Thank you 💕
Thank you!
Mostly it's been written chat/texting as I found zoom made it harder almost. But I'm going to put more effort into doing phone calls and maybe a Netflix party.
Yes! I ended up buying some STEAM game and doing virtual game night which is fun. I’m glad you have a plan. How have you been managing your stress? And what self care have you been doing? It’s important to have a plan for those too.
Gah! Those are tough questions. I really suck at self care to be honest. I tend to take on others stress and problems and try to carry the weight of the people around me rather than help myself. I have been trying to spend some time crafting and I did complete a puzzle recently which was good. I find being creative is a good way to get out of my head. I just struggle with making myself do it.
So try to make a plan this weekend of at least two things you will do for self care. Could be as simple as lighting a candle you like, or as complex as crafting an entire new wardrobe. Just pick 2 things and make SURE you carve out time for them
That is a great goal. Thank you.

u/lbarnes76 I was waiting for the nail polish, but I wanted to thank you for this!
Hey OP can you tell me what.you think about this foaming bath? Was thinking about getting the same
You're welcome! 🥰
Not OP, but I have this and several other varieties of it. It’s actually REALLY nice! It foams well, smells good (scent sensitive here), is gentle on skin, and helps to tame my demon spawn before bed. It’s worth the money. (Most other stuff I’ve tried, you need to use 1/3 of the bottle for one kid sized bath, but this gives you at least 10 kiddy baths per bottle.)
Awesome!!! Thanks!!! That's exactly why I asked hahaha

Hey all! My name is Luke! I am currently finishing up my last year in school for my bachelor's in applied health & fitness and have plans to continue on to pursue a master's degree in secondary education as my goal is to become a middle school PE teacher. After nearly 5 years working in schools helping kids w/developmental & physical disabilities, I discovered I had a passion (and an uncanny patience) for helping the younger generations learn and grow to be the best humans they can be.  I also have an unquenchable desire to write, compose, and perform music and have been scratching this musical itch for almost 18 years now-starting with pumping the sustain pedal as a 3 year old while my mother played hymns on the piano. I grew up playing piano, guitar, and bass at my parents' church and began leading worship in junior high but have since moved away from playing at churches.  Currently, I am living at my parents' place while I finish school and am taking handyman jobs here and there in an attempt to prevent myself from falling into the usual pit of student debt that too many fall victim to. I have been able to further my musical journey by meeting up w/my friend/musical partner and have been slowly but surely hashing out songs to present to record labels with the hopes of landing a writing/producing contract. I am constantly looking for others to write for and help build their own music careers, but that has become increasingly difficult with the social distancing and epidemic that's happening.  I'm not entirely sure if this is far too long of an introduction for this subreddit, but this is just a brief overview of my goals and passions for my life & future. If you have any further questions about my life & goals or want to help out in any way, please feel free to shoot a message my way-I would love to talk!   Thanks for listening!
Welcome you seem very cool.   I just started learning the acoustic guitar. It’s challenging but I’m enjoying it.  Have fun

Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Hi! Welcome! What's your favourite animal?
Hi! Welcome to the sub!! So happy to have you here! What's your favorite dessert??
hello and welcome to the family! what is your favorite movie?
Hi Luke and welcome to the sub!
Welcome. I'm glad you like working with students with disabilities. I'm a special ed teacher.
Welcome!!
Welcome to the sub, Luke! Sounds like you're making so much great life progress. What's your favorite memory so far?
Aww thanks, Chris! Keep up the work on guitar, it'll be frustrating at first but it's so worth the patience and effort after a few years. It's such a very rewarding activity.
I think my favorite holiday would have to be Christmas because there are just so many traditions connected to that season and there are so many warm reunions that happen every year.   My favorite thing I enjoy about nature is the way it is frequently changing with the seasons, allowing me to enjoy a variety of exciting activities like wakeboarding, mountain biking, and alpine skiing!   Thanks so much for the warm welcome! I'm looking forward to this new community!
Oooh! What a hard question! I would have to say my fav animal is a golden retriever! I've had two throughout my life, and every one of them has been so loving, caring, attentive, and active!
Thank you! I'm glad to be here. I'm not the biggest dessert person, but if I would have to choose I'd choose pie!
Thank you for the warm welcome! Oh gosh-I have a list of top movie that I'm always trying update, so I'll give you 10-not in any particular order.  Inception, The Dark Knight, The Green Book, Soul, Crazy Stupid Love, Life Is Beautiful, 1917, Lord of the Rings, Interstellar, The Sting
Thanks Pasvanti!
Thanks! I'm excited to still be able to work with students with disabilities while teaching PE! I'm quite stoked to bring adaptive sports into the mainstream classes, I think it'll be both eye-opening as well as fun for all of my future classes.
That sounds great! Many teachers tend to avoid the sped kids or find them troublesome.
Yeah, I've witnessed that far too frequently as well. I plan on fighting against that common teaching habit.
Yay! We need more teachers like you.  The gen ed teachers tend to pass them onto the sped teachers.

Haha thanks! Sometimes I draw bees on them too 🐝🐝🐝
Youre welcome!! 💜🥰
Oh my gosh, I have to go look at your history to see one now, hope that isn't weird lol. All I can imagine is that you are a tiny little bee hopping around a keyboard. Like a really cute little bee!
hahaha love it! Not sure how far back. I did a bunch of bee themed contests over the summer lol
I found one, it was super cute! Oh my gosh, that's adorable!!! Makes sense I don't remember that, I was a bit MIA during the summer on here (got my first place and had to do a ton of renos)!
ooooo that sounds wonderful!!!! I bet creating your own space was a lot of fun though! congrats!! (also, thank you!! lol)
It was so much fun! I painted my kitchen bright yellow haha. Would have been more fun if my hot water heater hadn't died a week into owning it!
oh no!!!  My friend just bought her first house.  .and two days after they moved in, the heater went kaplunk. In the middle of winter lol  needless to say they were not thrilled! up and running again now though!
Oh gosh, in the winter! That's even worse! I'm glad, having no heater would be so awful!

**CLOSED**  I closed this a wee bit early, but I wanted to say that this contest has been so heartwarming to read over. I wish I could gift all of you, I really do.  Please know that there's always good in you, even if its hard to see or if that little voice in your head tells you otherwise. You're not alone. Someone out there thinks of you so fondly. Someone wishes they were like you. Someone adores the things about you that you can't stand.  Thank you for all the condolences and thank you to those that shared some of your story.   CW: SUICIDE  Hi there, RAOA. On October 30th, I lost a friend to suicide and have been MIA as a result. In my absence, I've battled many demons that I thought were exorcised. In an attempt to not bog things down any further, I'll leave that as is.  So, as a return-to-sub thing, I would like to know what you love about yourself. This is your chance to be cocky about anything you want. Have a great bod? Tell me! Are you really good at playing impostor in a certain game? Shout it out!  We all need some self-love.  As a bonus, tell me what you love about a friend or family member - or even just someone you admire but don't know. We love to see love spread around.  I'm sorry if this is jumbled and doesn't really make sense. I hope it's clear enough. For simplicity sake, I have guidelines.  1.Live in the US for shipping purposes. Sorry international friends. I'll learn how to spread the joy to you one day!  2. Link your wishlist pleeeaaassseee. Its not necessary, but im usually on mobile so it's a big help.  3. Tell me what you love about yourself.  4. (OPTIONAL) Tell me what you love about a friend/family member/stranger/anything really.
Not entering. Sometimes we just need a hug. Have a hug
I love my creativity, honestly. I used to hate it. Growing up, I thought I was just some weirdo who had no friends. Now that I'm embracing my creativity, I have dreams, and paintings, and stories, and poems, and songs. And friends. And I'm writing a book that is a collection of lyric essays and short stories about mental illness and mental health. I want my book to show people they are not alone. I want my creativity to help save lives. And what I used to hate about myself, has become what I love about myself.  Also, u/space_noodlers is an awesome friend of mine. What I love about her is that she picks up on how people are feeling and reaches out with genuine care and concern and love.  <3  This is my [Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2C27S36776I42?ref_=wl_share).
My wishlist is [here](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3MU7KQTTH83CJ?).   I love that I am funny! I think people genuinely enjoy my sense of humor, and that makes me happy.  One of the things I love most about my partner is his ability to diffuse tense or stressful situations. He is the most patient person, and I admire and appreciate him for it.
I’m so sorry for your loss. Losing someone is always hard but when they take their own life, it makes it harder somehow.   I love that I love hard - with everything that I have in me.   [List](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/148MIPP17NYXE?ref_=wl_share)  Thanks for the contest.
I love my eyes. I was fortunate to be born with dark thick eyelashes so I have only worn mascara twice in my life.   Sorry to hear about your friend. That is so tough.

I love my small nose and thin lips
Thinking of you ❤️ I wish I had the right words to offer. I lost a brother to what was probably suicide (or if not, the consequences of depression and substance use). There are very few things in the world that hurt as deeply as watching someone you love suffer so deeply, and not having the power to help them through their pain.  I love me. It’s taken me 38 years to get here, but I think I’m a really good, fair, loving and kind person. I stand up for what I believe in and especially for those whose voice is otherwise drowned out. I’m still learning, but I’m proud of the difference in my strength compared to 10 years ago.  I don’t know them well, but based on our new friendship i can say I love how /u/hexbags is fighting some struggles, but still getting the shit done — cleaning their home, getting homework completed, etc — and I’m proud of them for that.  Thanks for the contest xo  [list](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/ls?ie=UTF8&ref_=aw_ya_hp_wl)
I used to have really terrible self esteem and body image. I finally combatted that with fake it til you make it confidence and self-love until finally I was actually confident and had learned to love myself. That’s my excuse for the list I’m about to give you, lol.  What I love about myself:  I’ve got a phat butt and I love it  I’m pretty intelligent and excelled in school (book smart, I’m lacking somewhat in the common sense department, lol)  I’m also funny. The witty clever Chandler Bing kind of funny as well as the goofy, says the weirdest things kind of funny.   I have beautiful hair. It’s a rich chocolate brown and really thick and silky.   I put my all into friendships and relationships, sometimes to a fault, but I don’t plan on stopping.   Oh man, it’s hard to pick someone to say nice things about because I love so many people! Ummmm 🤔 Ooh, okay!  What I love about my Nana:  She has devoted her entire life to me, and hasn’t complained once in all my 25 years.   She took it upon herself to raise me when my dad didn’t want to and my mom, though she tried, couldn’t.  I’ve always been able to trust her and talk to her about anything. I’ve never had to worry about her snooping in my room or reading my diary.   She’s so strong. Even when something’s wrong, she’s always put on a brave face for my sake.  If possible, she would do literally anything for me if I needed her to, even at her own expense. And not just me. She tries her best to take care of all of her loved ones as much as she can, even if she has to stretch herself thin.  She’s never met a stranger. She can strike up a conversation with anyone anywhere. Everyone of my friends and (ex) boyfriends immediately accepted that she’s their Nana now too.  I could go on and on about how great Nana is, but I’ll go ahead and end it there.   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/30W9G825IOETW?ref_=wl_share  PS I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. ❤️ Feel free to PM me if you ever want to talk to someone who understands what it’s like to live with demons.
I’m so sorry about your friend. Sending hugs.  I love my brain. Not to sound like I’m bragging, but I’m smart, and I’ve always liked that about myself.   My best friend is such a beautiful soul. She’s giving and kind and always, always has my back. She builds me up and die some reason thinks the world of me.    [Wishlist ](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/JEUPUACSO0G1?ref_=wl_share)
I love my heart about myself... I have a huge heart and although it bites me in the ass sometimes I'm glad that I am able to have such a huge giving heart.   My bestie she has this amazing ability to calm me down when I get upset wether pissed off or sad she can make me feel better no matter what and she knows like I don't have to tell her.
Not entering, but just wanted to give you my deepest condolences. This contest means a lot to so many people. Genuinely, thank you for doing this.
I love my green eyes and I love that I can be silly
What makes me beautiful? This week I've been told twice I've got to be one of the nicest people on reddit.  Being nice makes me beautiful.  This week my best friend told me how much our friendship means to them (36 years!).  Friendship makes me beautiful.  My kids took the time this week to make me feel loved and that they are knowingly loved without me spending gobs of money on them.  I am loved and a  loving person and that makes me beautiful.  I made faces (via video app) at a friend making them laugh.  I can be funny to bring a smile into the world and that makes me beautiful.  And oh yeah I look simply fabulous no matter what I'm wearing!!  I love you and I'm glad you are in my sphere.   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1AK35UH3JU9U1?ref_=wl_share

Not sure we officially met but welcome back to the sub! I'm Chris! One thing I really love about myself is my resiliency. No matter what hard situation I face, I can look inside to my core and find my inner strength, and that always helps me make it through.  One thing I love about my husband is that he's super understanding and can make me feel better in any situation.   Thanks for the contest!!

I love my ass. I have a really big one and my husband loves it so it’s turned into my self confidence booster. I used to hate it but after years of seeing him react to it has really made me appreciate it more. I went on new meds - nexplanon and antidepressants and gained about 60 lbs in the last 18m so that’s been a real hard pill to swallow but the fact that my butts gotten much bigger has actually been okay. I’ve had body image issues all my life so accepting myself now is a big deal in my head.   To add to that - I love my husbands humor. It’s the best thing about him. We laugh. I appreciates that about him.   Thank you for this contest and I’m so sorry for your loss - suicide is a hard one and I’ve lost a couple close people that way (mom and stepmom) so if you ever need to chat - I’m here anytime. Stay healthy!   https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/30YE2A64BBZBK?ref_=wl_share
First off, I'm so sorry for your loss. Suicidal tendencies run rampant in my family, and we've lost a few. My PM inbox is open.   I love my long hair and my brick house, hourglass figure. You heard that right. She's short, but she's got it where it counts!   And I love this community for being so kind.   My [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/7M9BJ5MU0P3M?ref_=wl_share).
Welcome back to the sub! It’s a happier place with you in it!   I love my creativity. It just goes and goes and goes seemingly without end. I’ve made a lot of things and I’m very happy with the things I’ve written and come up with.   I have a friend named Elizabeth who’s just the sweetest thing you’d ever meet. I love her sense of humor, and her beautiful blue eyes.   Thank you for the contest. Good luck everyone!  [My WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/28XG2BE7G3FN3?ref_=wl_share)

I am very, very sorry for your loss. There aren't words I can say to help with that grief, but I will keep you in my thoughts. If you need someone to talk to or want someone to listen I am here.   I love my strength.  I've battled a myriad of mental health problems due to childhood trauma, and although I still have whispers of my demons I have conquered 80% of them. Honestly I am really really proud of how far I've come.      Here is my [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1BVB8G71MFKBJ?ref_=wl_share).
I'm so sorry. Losing a friend that way is rough. I'm glad you're here though and plugging forward! Welcome back :3  What do I like about me? I've got huge...tracts of land.  Lol I'm just joking around. But really, I've actually always loved that I've got an hourglass figure. I might be overweight right now, which isn't the greatest for my health, but true to form I still got that classic big ass, big tit, tiny waist Sir Mix-a-Lot was singing about. Thank goodness I gain weight all over(?)   But I think my figure, right now the way I am, makes me squeezable, sexy, and intimidating all at once. And I am so down for that!  At my peak physical prowess in boot camp I had the exact measurements as Marilyn Monroe (minus like..two inches off the top cause she was taller than me.) It was a huge boost of confidence when I learned that.   [Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/319HAY5SBT7FM?ref_=wl_share) I linked the book wishlist (I think) but I've got several (I window shop for myself a lot and I really like lists) so if I win you definitely don't have to stick to that one. Especially cause books are an expensive addiction.
I am so sorry. Wishing you and your friends family comfort during this difficult time. Hugs.   I love that I am productive and kind. I’m a good mom and a good friend. I love my husband and his intelligence, his hardworking nature, and his love for our daughter. I love my daughter and her kind heart, helpfulness, and silliness.   Welcome back, and thanks for the contest. [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2V0AE6R80B0FP?ref_=wl_share)
Sorry to hear about your friend. Its tough losing a loved one. Think of all the good memories you two had and keep your head up. Hope you can rise above the demons and live life to the fullest you can. Coming back here will be a positive aspect in your future to help key in your success.  I have a hard time loving myself, but Ive been slowly working on changing that about me. I have a love-hate relationship with my hair. Its my best feature, but also my worst. It gets so knotted and I get frustrated. Thankfully, my husband brushes it for me knowing its all I love about my appearance.  I have a coworker who I love so much. Shes like a mom to me and everyone. She will do anything she can to make peoples day brighter. Just an over all lovely lady. I dread the days I work without her presence. Makes work worth going to. Her and her husband have got to be the best couple in the world :).  Keep pushing on my love!  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/P7O4DVIVGURQ

I’m sorry to hear about your friend. I hope this helps you a bit.   I love a few things about myself.   I love that I have the ability to make men and women fall in love with me incredibly fast. It’s a blessing and a curse but I love it. My husband says it’s my eyes.  I think I’m fricken awesome but the jury is still out on it.   I love that I have lived a harder life and can help others by listening and having the ability to maybe help them through by giving advice.   I love that I have a caring mother that has blessed me with brains and her beauty.   I hope you stay safe. God bless! [My wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3OP902UYAL2CV?ref_=wl_share)
I love my sense of humor. I often have a dry sense of humor and can deliver one-liners with a straight face. Other times I am a big dork and love silly jokes and puns. I would make a great Jungle Cruise skipper. Making people laugh brings me great joy.  I have a friend who is nothing but pure joy and love with a little naughty side. I love him dearly. I strive to be as happy as he is.  [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/CNRLQCILQFN7?ref_=wl_share)
I work in healthcare. What I love about myself is that I am a very caring person and genuinely care about my patients. I would even go as far to say that I loved some of them.  I hold their hand when they are scared, I reassure them that I will keep them safe (usually when they are having trouble standing or walking), I talk to them about their families. Sometimes I just talk to them about what's on tv.  2 years ago, I worked in a hospice. It felt so rewarding knowing I was making people comfortable during their last days. It also felt good that people were able to see their loved ones clean and pain free during their last days. Obviously it will take some time to get over the initial grief but it's nice to know I helped with that a bit (i know this because they would tell me frequently).  A couple times patients came into the hospice and their hair was a mess. Usually very matted. i would take time out of my day to try to brush it out. Sometimes I even had to cut it (i got the patients and family members permission first). I never studied how to cut hair but I watched some videos on youtube prior to this and I did what I could. They were very grateful. I have always felt little things like that are so important.  [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2QOLD24DSAOBH?ref_=wl_shar)
Hey there! Thanks for the contest. I want to say as a person who has lost someone to suicide, my heart just reaches out to yours to offer comfort!  💛  Something I love about myself physically are my smile lines. Some people call them wrinkles, but I think my lines show how much of my life I've spent smiling and laughing, especially around my eyes :) Emotionally I love my optimism. I get down, anxious and depressed like everyone, but I think my relentless optimism and hope pull me through and help me be there for others.  It's funny, I find that something I love about everyone in my immediate family is their kindness. I come from big-hearted people, and I am so grateful for them.  Thank you for the contest! [My List :)](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/K569SKGXAREL?ref_=wl_share)  p.s. I love hearing all these people saying such kind and thoughtful things about themselves!
I’m sorry you’re going through something like this. I cant imagine how you feel. Please stay strong and reach out to me whenever you need something. I’ll be here always !!! You got this.   I have a hard time saying positive things about myself. I ended up asking my bf to answer this for me and he said “you’re interesting. We always have fun conversations and you make things less dull.” Which made me MELT. I’m really happy he said that. I’ve been feeling boring lately and this was such a 💓💖💕💘   I really love all my friends. I’m talking about so many people I met through this community but writing them all would be chaos. For once i don’t feel so lonely. I’m also proud of my bf. For pushing through everything. For being so strong. For being patient and understanding. He’s amazing and my role model. I look up to him a lot. Makes me feel like everything is going to be okay when I look at him.   [my wishlist !!!](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2OZDCIVGFXG3P?ref_=wl_share)

I am very sorry for your loss.   I love my compassion. It doesn't matter how many times others betray me or try to bring me down, I'll never stop caring about people and doing my best to help others as much as I'm able to. 💙  I love how considerate the boyfriend is.

I'm sorry for your loss.  I love my patience. I am super patient and that is a quality needed to work with special education children. I never get angry or yell at them. I care a lot about them and believe they can succeed just like other children. Their special ed label shouldn't stop them from learning. I'm caring, and care a lot about my friends and family. I don't yell at people, and I'm always calm.    I love how one of my fellow coworkers is such a great educator. She treats the students as if they were her own. If she could adopt them all, she would. She doesn't mind spending her own money to take care of them, or treating them to nice things.    https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3SMGYP8PVEXZ5?ref_=wl_share
I love my sense of humor and ability to see the bright side in situations. That was harder than I thought. Thanks for helping me remind myself 🙂
i’m so sorry and i’m praying for so much positive and healing energy for you. ✨  i love my emotional intelligence. i’m able to observe and truly consider things before i react to them and it’s been a lifesaver because i come from a very dysfunctional toxic family. I think of it as my own little savior.   i love my cousin for everything she is and stands for. she’s beautiful and intelligent. She battles MS and is still able to manage everything that is thrown her way. She’s such an inspiration to me.

I’m really good at making others laugh and I’ve been told I have nice eyes. My eyes are green and gold but i usually just go with hazel when asked.

I’m not entering... just wanted to say I’m so sorry about your friend. Some people have lives that are so painful (mentally or physically) that they see death as a gift... but it’s always painful for the people they leave behind. Please take care of yourself, and remember the good times you had together ❤️
Heya - that's a rough spot to be in. Do me a favor, while you read through all of these lists, take inventory of all the ways you're awesome as well. Know that folks are here and ready to chat.   Keep reaching out, it's the best thing we can do, IMO.
( https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1YHQTWQTB6VZX?ref_=wl_share )   I’m sorry for your loss. My boyfriend lost his brother to suicide in December. It’s not pretty and definitely not easy. Please know that if you need to talk, or if anyone needs to talk, you can always inbox me.  I’m very fond of my curly hair (such a leo thing to say). It’s what I get the most compliments on and it’s what I’d call my pride and joy.
I love how comfortable I have become with my hobbies. I used to hide them because I don't want to be seen as a dork. But now, I'll proudly discuss my love for games, anime, cartoons, and action figures!  I also admire my brother for keeping a stable, well paying job for nearly a decade!

What I love about myself? My positive attitude. I have been through too many hardships. I would like to think that I won't have to go through any more but I know better. Suicide of loved ones is definitely in those experiences, more than one. Choosing life is a reflection of the hope I hold onto.   There are many things that I love and admire about others in my life. I have a friend that works hard to keep her environment positive and happy, we enjoy spending time together and we both like that we are not required to talk every day or see each other all the time to know that we are true friends.  I like that my sister in law is so creative in keeping her home beautiful. I have no desire to live up to that but I admire her work.  I have a brother in law that in general I find annoying but I have a ton of respect for him and how he takes care of the people in his life. We don't have to agree on all things to respect one another.  Live and let live and you can just be happy in yourself. [Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/38I1P6CEGXMWW?ref_=wl_share)
I'm so sorry for what you've been battling. It's so hard to lose someone to suicide and brings up a lot of stuff that we don't necessarily know is there. I'm glad that you're fighting through it and that you're back!  Something I love about myself is my drive to create. I think it's really invigorating and something I've loved about quarantine is how much people seem to have been driven to create as well, so there are just all these creative endeavors all around me. That being said...I also love the creativity of my friends! There are so many wonderfully creative people around me who show it in different ways--painting, making music, photography--and I'm just really proud of them all.  &#x200B;  Edit: forgot my [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/30RDTBPXYNOV3?ref_=wl_share)

I know the words I am sorry are not enough but that's all I can think to say.      What I love about myself. I am kind. I am always kind. I am patient. I work with students and I know these attributes provide a welcoming safe environment for my students. I love the work I do and I am proud of myself for being a teacher. I always strive to be better than the day before.       I love my students. Every single one. They have so much potential and are always learning and growing. Children are so amazing and if you every get to have any or work with them on a regular basis you will know what I mean. I love the work I do.   &#x200B;  Thank you for the contest. Again, I am so sorry. I have been there myself.
What I love about myself is my strength, caring heart and great booty! Something I love about my mother is the love she has for my brother and I as well as my children, how kind she is to others and the fact that she has never lost hope in me during some difficult difficult times when I was going off the deep end.  Thank you for this wonderful contest! Very thoughtful of you! I’m so very sorry for your loss. I’ve lost loved ones to suicide and suffer from mental illness myself.

I'm so sorry for your loss.    I actually really love how stubborn I am...I know it's not normally seen as a good trait but it has served me well because I'll push through anything if something matters enough to me. That and I'm a really good mom,  which kind of is a surprise to me!  For the optional: I love how deeply my wife loves her people. She'll do anything for those she loves (sometimes to her detriment but...) and it's a blessing to be part of her life.

Im really sorry for your loss. I hope you’re feeling better now.  I love my teeth and my smile. I have naturally straight and white teeth and it’s the feature I get complimented on most. I got it from my dad lol! I love getting my photo taken and smiling! I also really love my eyebrows. They’re naturally super thick and i used to get made fun of a lot for it but after i started threading them they look great. Also a feature i get complimented on a lot :)  I think my mom has a really pretty smile. She doesn’t like her teeth but i do and she also has really pretty dimples. Her hair is also really pretty.   Here’s my [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/5SOBYLL2FQEL?ref_=wl_share). I hope you feel better!
Not applying cause out of US but I just wanna say I get what you're going through, I lost my friend last year to suicide. Taking time to yourself really helps but I'd definitely recommend talking to anyone you're comfortable with about it.   I know im just a stranger but my dms are always open if you need to talk. Have a great day!
I’m so sorry for your loss.  My best friend died in December of 2019 and i am still recovering.  As for me, i love my eyes and my crazy sense of humor.  I like that i am a warm friendly person who can make people relax and just be themselves.
I'm sorry to hear about your loss. That's always tough to go through. I've been through it a couple of times myself. Love to you and if you need to chat please reach out.   I struggle finding thinks I like about myself, but I do think I am quick witted which makes me charming and fun to talk to. I have also been told plenty of times that I have very pretty eyes.  I very much enjoy the comfort of my partner. She is always here for me and though she's 1/3 my size, she makes me feel safe and secure which is something I don't feel very often. She's like a human security blanket.
I want to echo the sentiments that have been said and say I am also sorry for your loss. Thank you for not only sharing about your experience, but helping everyone focus on ways they can raise their spirits and view of themselves.  [WL](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2X0P3KVA3HGJP?ref_=wl_share)  Something I love about myself - I'm very personable and good at getting to know people right away. I've been told I do a good job at helping people feel welcomed and cared right when I meet them (not sure how well that translates through to the internet but hopefully it's getting better haha).  Something I really love about my wife is that she is extremely thoughtful and caring towards people long-term. She is very good at taking care of friends in need, and creative when it comes to finding things people need and providing it for them :)
I'm really sorry that you lost a friend. If you're feeling really out of sorts, you should definitely reach out to a professional. Times are really hard right now already and we all need a little help!
I am not entering as I live outside the US, but wanted to say how sorry I am for your loss.  Please don't hesitate to reach out for help.  I love my determination.  I love my son's math brain (he is 10).
First of all I'm very sorry for your loss. Losing friends is never easy. Take care of yourself during this time.  I say that I love that I have a very unique looking face. I've never seen anyone with a nose that looks like mine, Adriana Lima has a slightly similar one. My brown eyes look like beautiful bronze in the sunlight and I was blessed with bigger lips, no injections needed. I'm the only one I know who looks like me. I used to hate it, but now I love it.  I love my boyfriend's ocean blue eyes but mostly his kind and gentle personality. I've never been with someine so interested in feeding and housing all the neighborhood alley cats, most people just ignore them and move on but he's determined to get them to safety.  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/APXVD080EK8N/?ref_=lol_ov_le&filter=default&sort=default&viewType=list
I’m so so sorry about your friend 💔 that’s heart breaking.    Thanks for doing a contest. I’d have to say the thing I love about myself is my hair. It’s very long, blonde, and beautiful.    I love my husband in every way, but one thing I really love about him is he is so caring. He would drop everything about himself just to care for someone else. He’s great ❤️  [Wishes](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/29QRPEKRV1FB0?ref_=wl_share)
I'm sorry about your loss, truly. I actually think my scars and stretch marks are beautiful because it shows I've lived my life. I also love my husband's odd taste in music, the way my daughter never gives up, and my dad for raising 3 girls by himself after our mother passed.  [wishes](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1ENUZ8S9V3MQ5?ref_=wl_share)
I'm sorry about your friend. 😢    I love how caring and loving I am to others. I go out of my way for people who need the support when needed. I have been a surrogate twice. When my husband's co-worker drove to the Midwest to pick up her daughter and her daughter's children (from an abusive relationship), I made sure that she had a crib and toddler beds along with clothes, diapers, food, and toys for the children when she got home. I tutored/mentored this high schooler that was struggling in school due to being placed in a foster group home. She was failing 9th grade at the beginning of the year and by the end of the year, she was a straight B student. I couldn't have been more proud of her. And etc. I will never stop going above and beyond for my community.  What I love about my husband is that he has the same heart as me. He doesn't mind that I spend our last dollar on someone else because they could use it more than us. 🥰  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/AMP9LX2PM1A?ref_=wl_share
I’m so sorry for your loss. That’s tough.   I love that I’m persistent even in the face of struggles. I have a best friend who has helped me through some tough times and she’s the most caring and loving person I know. I don’t know what I’d do without her. I’ve spoken about her a few times here but she’s really amazing. She’s helped me through some incredibly painful and dark times. If I happen to win this incredibly kind contest, I’d like for you to choose something on my list labeled for her with either has a comment designated to her or they’re knickknacks that have the comment 2 for the both of us. Thank you.   [list](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/MODB1ZKDOKGM?ref_=wl_share)
**https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/21WUNWSP8IDC?ref\_=wl\_share**   I love that I find beauty in all situations, that I can read and enjoy books, that I can connect and calm difficult patients/situations, that I'm not afraid to be alone.  I admire my 21 yr old son's selflessness, he always helps strangers without a second thought never thinking of himself and he's always been that way and he's always accepted that I am not your normal mom but a little weird  and never judges me :)
Thank you for the virtual hug 💜
Also, I am so sorry for your loss. Thinking about you during this time!
So lucky! My husband has the glamorous lashes. I have thin ones and mascaras just so clumpy lookin.
Oh wow you’re so sweet.. I’m smiling . You have no idea how much I needed to hear that. Youre the best. Thanks for being such an amazing friend. ILY
Sorry for your loss.  ## 💖
Thank you for reminding me to participate too. It's such a hard thing to talk about myself in a positive way, but im sure many here feel the same.  I love my desire to be the change I wish to see in the world. Giving when and where I can both physically and mentally, from giving food to people in need to teaching healthy coping strategies to kids who are struggling.
And I’m here if you need someone to talk to
❤️
Of course, that's what we're here for! :)   Being an agent of change is a great thing, and something I strive for as well.   You went, so I will in return.   I love the planning side of my brain, allowing me to break away from the trends of our family and allow future generations a better life.   Thank you for the gift of sharing with me and having me share about myself. So often we focus on what we don't love and forget to remind ourselves of what we do love.

Speaking of books, what’s the last you read? :)
Oof probs a candle, my cats and husband are stinky beings let me tell you !
Also I also want to go to Scotland... I hear they have good whiskey 🙃
Oofda- I’d probably do something silly like drive on the wrong side of the road or rip the tag off my mattress ... breakin the law breakin the law
I really want to go to the UK and do a literary tour!!! I’m 25% Scottish I just found out so it’d be cool to trace back my heritage to the clans of the early days !!
Oh I’m totally eating popcorn for the rest of my life, like movie theatre stop your heart there’s so much butter pop or - and Coca Cola —-yum
I miss movie theaters ☹️
Trail mix of nuts
Wow that’s a hard one—- LCD sound system Madison square garden, but I would like to be slightly away from the front row ( I’m very claustrophobic)   What about you??
I’m little and sassy and generally about as useful as a spoon.
This one is hard. Cinnamon gummy bears currently hit it changes like the weather!
I think I have to go with rad- which dates me but I just love the word.
An Amazon gift card so I can have a contest here!
I actually haven’t watched any! I watched a movie yesterday - Light of my Life, but no shows!
Ohh I like this one.   I’d work in developing countries providing food, water and education with a focus on women and children.
I’m small, sassy and about as useful as a spoon.
That’s a good question- I’ve never received either so I’m not sure which I’d enjoy more. Probably flowers - I love buying them for myself!
Both? Vanilla if there’s a gun to my head.
To adopt a child. <3 We are currently waiting for a match.
Hands down New Girl. I think that is basically all I watch anyway XD
If it could be anything, an invisibility potion to play pranks. If it has to be real, I'd pick a blanket & hot cocoa basket because coziness is an underrated feeling.
Haha yes, my username is part of a life motto "be braver and fight" reminding me to not let my anxiety control my life.
Future! For sure, but not too far in the future because I'd probably get freaked out LOL
Venus! Because it was the name of my first car. (2004 Saturn Ion Coup, I thought I was real clever naming a Saturn "Venus" LOL)
It would be the Dr Dre from Deweys!    Thin crust, olive oil, mozzarella, green pepper, red onion, grilled + thinly sliced Amish chicken, crispy bacon, jalapeños, and drizzle ranch after it’s baked.
What’s your favorite type of bean?
If I could choose any free gift for opening a bank account I would choose an iRobot vacuum and give it to my Mom.  Is regifting allowed?
~~Jordan Catalano~~ Jared Leto
Pineapple Upside-down Cake! 🍍 🍒 🍰
“Everywhere” feels like a cop-out answer despite being the most true, lol. I’m gonna say Australia. Been on my bucket list since elementary school
Shag clothes. If I’m not swimming or taking a bath/shower, I hate being wet. It makes me mad, lol.
I would want a zillion dollar gift card to a really good tattoo shop
Ooh please let me pick a few! After rain (but also before rain and during) Coffee brewing Old books
There’s actually no such thing as a vegetable, scientifically at least. Vegetables are just different parts of plants and occasionally mislabeled fruit. Like corn. Corn is a fruit, not a vegetable. But if I’m cooking dinner, corn is a suitable option for the “vegetable” side dish.
I like animal being jerks.
Around 5am...it’s when both my kids have made their way to my bed and then I have to sleep like a pretzel until the alarm goes off.
A vacation house at the beach.
THATS WHAT SHE SAID!!!
I’ve never seen it!  The force is strong in my family.
No way. Haha.
Art supplies. Lots of art supplies.
Also that sounds like a fantastic start to a poem
It’s me me. The person on the inside that I want others to see but that I can’t show to people outside of the internet. I am a childlike fairy person in a world of adults. Who just. Do t get it. It’s the child me that I never got to be.
Big toe. Ain’t no one care about my feet’s
Dolly Parton
Puffer fish
🧚‍♀️
An “S”!  What is your favourite animal?
Jump rope I think!  What is your dream vacation destination?
Dead City Radio and the New Gods of Supertown by Rob Zombie. It’s so good!  What is your favourite movie?
An ice cream maker! I know it would make my fiancé and I super happy and would be fun!  Ouuu good cheeses
Elementary!   What is the last meal you had?
A Northface jacket and I wouldn’t even care if it had the banks logo
Home made Chicken and wild rice soup
Nooo it’s so hard to choose! If it’s a strict one or the other question...savory   If it’s not a strict question then savory before 6pm and sweets after then 😁
savoury any time
Linda Belcher
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts was my last binge. Last series I started was Legend of Korra
Naruto
bu...bbbut.... the coffee cup is haunted! 😭😂  edit: i would choose a madmen style home with a pool.
of allll time? Breaking Bad!
24
you ready for this? ...kpop. it definitely is my favorite as of lately, but i listen to everything! i have no boundaries to loving music and usually find myself listening to motown classic artists.
to my left is my remote and my right is my end table full of skincare products. lol.
Orange Coffee Mug
let the shopping and trickling commence!  😂
Neither!
tangy bbq!
pasta and bolognaise sauce, specifically Gordon Ramsey’s recipe! It’s delicious and it’s like spaghetti and meat sauce - but with more finesse. :)
Oooooooooh - animals as a whole I would say dogs. I mean, the one "animal" has so many different varieties. There's only been a short period of my life that I've not had a dog.  /u/chosengirl what's your favorite liquid?
[This is Bob the Skull mug](http://imgur.com/gallery/JeKIWa7) that I got from kickstarter.  Disneyland vacation! Remember when they use to do a family 4 pack of Disney tickets and hotels when you opened an account - or an I showing my age? Realistically is more like a toaster or rice cooker now, isn't? Oh! An instant pot or an Alexa!
Gray! There are so many different grays. The gray of fog in the morning before it burns off. The gray of pencil on paper. Sooty ash in a fire pit. My gray hair (obtained by pigmented hair color, not age).  /u/be_braver what is your favorite smell?
Potatoes! They only slightly outweigh zucchini.  What is your favorite name?
Left front pocket.  Where's my cat?
I blame growing up with a pot-head father : peanut butter and jelly rolled up on a slice of bologna.  Why did you choose your user name?
The lasagna my mother made only once a year on my birthday.  What is your favorite article of clothing?
Like a mouse trying not to explode after sucking on helium.  What is your favorite candy?
No. I don’t think we would learn as much from each other. I think we would take so much for granted than we already do
French toast. With raw sugar, strawberries and cinnamon. I don’t like maple syrup.
I’ll take the Jansport Fanny pack. Thanks. And the interest free for 1 million years credit account.   Dogs do like to go out, but my little Minnie wants back in now.   I have some lovely places in Switzerland to show you ❤️ my grandma is Swiss, so we got all of the good cheese and chocolate when we went to her house!    OMG YESSSSSSS! Dream job!! Or they have these small planes pilots who work for the forest service abs just survey migrations from the air!!
A brand new house in the location of their choosing.
Hard to say... I don’t eat sweets much. I love tiramisu. Maybe a cheesecake. Or even a churro!
I got it from my Momma ❤️😂😂
If I think really hard. But only in one direction
I don’t know directors... so... My dog Minnie. She would have a fair point of view of what a wonderful mother and human I am 😂
No thanks!
RandomActsOfCards and secretsanta - I love giving! (And receiving but mostly giving) however if I had to pick one that wasn't to do with giving I'd go for TalesFromRetail there's always some good story's there. :)
Skittles ☺️
You guys get free gifts? I guess you american. When we open banks accounts here we don't get anything as far as I'm aware 🤔😂 if I got to chose something though I'd probably want another puppy because dogs are cute as heck! 🥰
Pepperoni and chilli flakes! 😍
Go on my phone and go through all the notifications then I go downstairs and pet my pup :)
Oh uhhh 😶 probably between 10 and 15. I've been at home most of the week because of lockdown and there's nothing better to do 😂
I've always wanted to try sky diving but I'm too scared to do it
2 weeks- well 3 is better - kid free on a tropical beach. I’ve always wanted to go to Fiji and dream about going there someday. You?
Chaos. 😂😂   Usually getting the kids ready for school in Jammies and a robe since M takes then. Once they are out the door, it’s time to smoke (I haven’t quit yet unfortunately) and then I have some redbull while I change into comfy clothes - yoga pants or leggings and tee. After that it’s about 30 mins til the tot wakes up and then breakfast and working on the house. Really nothing major.
Hmmmm I would have to say when I realized I had a gut. Like that intuition. It was a strange realization and hit me hard because I was just a teen. It’s one of those weird things that you don’t forget.
Iced coffee !
Choose a free gift? Probably a baby yoda squishmallow! Lmfaoo
Rock always haha
Only 3 !! How boring :(
Supernatural and also witchcraft 😅 love that stuff
Diet Coke 😳
Not one specific person, but I've given 2 years of my life in attempts to help teach refugees English overseas. Tons of wonderful people over there, who ended up doing more for me in some ways then I did for them.
Ooph, I'm sorry about your best friend. Not my *best* friend, but I had a female friend who's new husband ran into a similar situation, so I understand to some degree :/  Free bank account gift (assuming it's something semi-reasonable that's not magical or like a fully paid off house or something haha) might be weird, but I've always (ever since I was a child) wanted a full-sized pinball machine. That would be my choice and fulfill a childhood dream :)
Thinking about it just two different shows - Blood of Zeus (American anime-style show on Netflix) and Community. OH! And Critical Role on Youtube if you count that.
I would want to be a grapefruit. Beautiful coloration, not too much work to eat, naturally sweet while (still being sour), and delicious in drinks :)
Ooph, tough one. Outside of the Bible (classic Christian answer) I might have to go with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I love the different trial, challenges, and maze so much.
Ooo, good questions. If we had faster-than-light technology (like Star Trek) I'd go with deep space. Otherwise, deep ocean, even if it would be terrifying haha
Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo
What is *your* favorite book?
Free money in that account 😂  Or a nice coffee/tea gift basket
Skydiving for sure!
One show that I wanted to watch, but my 4 year old is currently obsessed with some cat show on Netflix so also that
Oreos dipped in whip cream
I really like the quiet time in the morning before everyone is up and running around
Hahaa I would probably choose a free trip to somewhere 😆 once this all settled ofcourse. (I saw an ad with AAA something that you can win a trip)  Ooh octopuses are intelligent, it would be fun having them 😁
Search myself 🤣 And after that catch up on world events, what's gonna happen in the future 😁
Most probably food! And if anything left, a drink 😁  When I was a kid I found a 100 bill (not dollars) I was so sad that someone is probably looking for it and dropped it off in a donation box for kids because I couldn't bring myself to use it 🤷‍♀️
I think about 6, there are a bunch of short, limited series shows on Netflix that I am binge watching 😁 and I usually watch Simpsons to sleep so that too
100 in the past definitely. Past feels like a safe, homey place 😁
Does twinkle twinkle little star count?!? 😁 If so then that one.
I love the 90s toothpaste in a can thing. It came with the green gel separate than the white. That's always my favourite.
😂😂😂  Tried to rip off all the typical “ pm mr your boobs!” ones, with a twist on placentas lol
All. The. Chocolate. 🤤
Good choice!
Oooooh.... not a mug. Anything but a mug. Probably one of those swanky, heavy pens.
Fourth of July, solely for the sunshine and picnic food lol
Tried to rip off all the typical “ pm mr your boobs!” ones, with a twist on placentas lol 😂
Summer. Always summer.
Yes, I do! I love to hike and I love engaging in natural photography. I always leave the place better than how I found it.
If I don't get a 90's-style fanny pack with a cheesy slogan the bank's marketing department cooked up one afternoon printed on the front, I'm closing that bank account and switching bank accounts again.   And I'm serious. I skate, and having something on my back or my arms is a pain. Fanny packs are how we carry our wallets and stuff when we go out.
Stay hydrated. It'll be a lot easier to tackle your bigger, more pressing health issues if you take care of your everyday ills caused by dehydration.
Unfortunately, yes. 66.
I love my job now (box office supervisor), but I don't think I'd be able to survive on it. So I plan to go back to school and study IT. I'd love to work with computers all day!
Can I get a lifetime supply of chocolate? If not, then a smaller but still very large amount of chocolate.
Probably pizza!
Hmm. Probably She's the Man. I've seen that so many times.
Octarine. (That's the color of magic.)
Hmm.  Maybe hiking?  I don't own a swimsuit anymore.
Green beans!
This probably sounds totally lame but I love getting pens with business names on them. 😂 So I’d want a bank pen. At one point I had like 50 random pens with places on them that I collected, some places I had been to and others I hadn’t been to and had no idea how I ended up with their pen lol.
I have an old oversized t-shirt from my University that has bleach stains on it but it’s my absolute favorite. 😂 I love comfy t-shirts!
Hi there! I’d probably pick Japanese food. What about you?
Tacos! I don’t like beans. 😅
My daughter, my Mom and my boyfriend, if those count. For emotional support. And for help building a raft to get the heck off the island. 😂 But if it were physical items, I’d bring a blanket, rain barrels and my iPad haha.
I’m going to be buying a bookshelf tonight for our living room. More like a toy box/bookshelf combo. My daughter’s toys are totally taking up our entire living room so once the Christmas tree comes down, I want to make her a little nook in our living room with a bookshelf and a toddler table and chairs!
Superstore! All my needs would be met! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'd choose sticky notes! Even with a company logo, you can ALWAYS use sticky notes! 😀😀  You're a good soul! Presidential suite for you! 😘🤗
😊 chocolate
Ohhh, I would bungie jump into an active volcano for sure. The COLORS would be amazing!
Hmm. Tough one. I've had to tell white lies which I knew were lies, so, I guess that's considered bold face. They NEVER work out. Ever. So, I stopped telling them. I would much rather be hurt by the truth then feel good by a lie. So, hurt me if you must but do it with the truth.
😊 Dolphins. My number 1 bucket list item was swimming with them. I did it a few years ago, and it's still one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life!
100% unplanned, unpacked, unprepared road trip with every destination and no destination in mind, and the only clothes/supplies we have are what we purchase from the worst road side attractions we can find. Zero planning, zero preparing. Just cash and go. 😀😀😀
Tacos :)
Nice! Definitely not everyone's cup of tea haha. Or coffee in this case?   Can I ask another question? Are you having a good day?
Poutine for sure!
Oh my, that's a difficult one! I think I'm going to go with London, I've never been there, but it seems like a really cool place with so much to do! I'm a big history buff, so I would totally be into all the museums and historic sites.
Chocolate!
A yellow Mustang convertible.
I'm a huge Menudo fan. American fans sign off with KOLM, Keep on Loving Menudo. Menuditis was a store in NYC that sold Menudo photos and collectibles. Thus, KOLMenuditis.
I can't tell you!
I'm a photojournalist and my ideal gig is to be a concert tour photographer for any of my favorite artists. I love documenting life especially what we don't always see or notice.
Warm apple crumble with vanilla bean ice cream. What's yours?
We have the typical boring ones that came with our dishes (8) plus some nice big ones that I bought but that are also boring (2).  Then I have two that I really love!  They're both from students!  They're big and have inspirational messages about being a teacher lol. So 12 total I think!  How about you?
I'm not ignoring this question, I just can't come up with a good answer!    Probably someone young with no responsibilities so I can go sleep all day. Hahaha.
Hmm.  Hopefully this bank deals in oversized fluffy blankets.  This is my desire!  Haha.
Probably lightly flavoured sparkling water.  Especially grapefruit or raspberry.  You?
100% summer!
I don’t really chew gum because I have braces, but if I had to pick it would be the first five seconds of the fruit stripe gum.
How fleshy we talking? The size of my mom, probably four. If I did some smooshing maybe five.
One human soul please. 😬
Creme brûlée.
Late class on Thursday so I made sloppy joe’s earlier for the husband to deal with. Not my favorite. However, he can reheat crap with the best of ‘em.
SlothasarusRex.... I mean a Tyrannosaurus rex. 🦖
Two! [Gilbert](https://imgur.com/a/72ujGnf) and [Alisoun](https://imgur.com/a/sC6w2wn.) I’ve had him since he was a wee thing and he is about 1.5 years old. She moved in at the beginning of December and is about a year old. Bert is 16 pounds and Ali is 6 pounds. [They hate each other.](https://imgur.com/a/6zc2rRK)
If Texas counts as a country, yes. If not, then no. 😬
A dyson cooling/heating fan lol
Never hear music again
🥰 is my favorite emoji
Chocolate!
Blue icee!
Because your glasses aren't strong enough 😂🤣😅
I think there's a place for everyone on reality tv lol, I would want something useful like those little bullet blenders
On Hagrids magical creatures ride!!!
A crisp apple, but most fresh fruit is delicious except cantaloupe and honeydew can't eat em
Someone from Portugal or Portuguese descent
Easy, worst cooks in america
Super healing, because *broadly gestures at this planet*
I would want to be able to heal! What about you?
I love peonies!
0 shows but I am watching the Divergent trilogy! I’m watching the last one tonight.
Oh man before I had my daughter when I was working nights or in college. 5 years ago or so.
Some bank accounts give you a deposit after opening a new account, so I would take the extra cash.
Orange

Snowflake 🙂
Just one- I’ve been binging Last Man on Earth
A new car why not it's a bank they can afford it!
Quick breads... I just made banana blueberry today!
Turtles And flamingoes
A blue poppy behind my right ear for my daddy that has passed away
Diet pepsi
Yarn!! I crochet🧶
Posh Spice!
Same! I’m a total scaredy-cat!  I would want a grocery gift card or free groceries for a week!
A weighted blanket! It’s life-changing!
See and I thought it came from Addams Family!
It’s a nickname for my dog Mimi actually! 😀
That’s a tough one, but I would love to live in the Avatar the Last Airbender universe!
Teleportation would be so helpful!!
Hmmm... Probably a bunny shaped lamp!
Lily, my name, and deredere, the Japanese onomatopoeia for lovestruck!
Red! They’re my favorite!
Coding in any language
Great choice! I'll add that to my list.
Great question!! I have to say my free gift would have to be a glitter coffee tumbler what came with a Starbucks free drink totally would enjoy that!
Cliffs Amusement Park in Albuquerque NM it’s a family owned amusement park and pre covid I have visited it at least once a year since I was 2. Fun fact I worked there the summer I was 15!
I would have to pick 7th Heaven
A  book themed coffee shop that serves coffee and pastries.
Bahahah no I can’t which I supper annoying.
I'll go with a brand new vehicle 👀 I'm always worried that mine's going to break down, so gimmie that peace of mind!
Damn it....this one is so tough :-( I'll go with strawberries  ETA: NO WAIT...CHERRIES!!!
oranges
Sadly, yes. My parents grow kale in their backyard and little gnats would somehow always find their way into my kale soup no matter how much my mom washed it. Also the FDA allows up to a certain percentage of bugs in food because ya know, they're going to get in a batch of something eventually and who wants to throw it all out
Yes, as a kid we collected termites (during the yam harvest seasons) and pan fried them, it was very tasty I remember but as I got older I could not bring myself to eat them again. With all the gm foods we have today I think I could again if I had the opportunity.
Because you deserve it 😇 Beach for sure, pools don't even come close to comparing...
Therein lies the mystery... I'll let you decide, since what is truth if not what others choose to believe? Even false realities dictate our lives until we discover  how wrong we were 👀   People. Definitely people 😂
I would totally try to get either a house appliance or some form of nice stationary. I'm absolutely plain in that lol.
A nice pen
Hmmm probably Can't Help Falling In Love!
You're the devil in disguise
Monopoly!!!
CashFlow
Brioche bun, burger with provolone cheese in the middle, cheese curds, bacon, and some sort of slight mayonnaise ish/bbq sauce.
I want my husky to bowl me over and suffocate me in love.
Can my free gift be a service instead of a thing? If so, I'd want to get IVF to have a baby. If it has to be a thing then I'd get a new car. My car is nearing the end of her life 😅
I honestly don't do much with my hair. I have long straight hair so I typically just brush it out and let it be. I think it looks pretty that way and I find updos uncomfortable so I just stick with a kind of natural look. What about you?
Hmm I would say I would like a flash drive. I never seem to have any when I need one and free flash drives never seem to break down!  Your username reminded me of that Buffy episode where she turns invisible and harasses a social worker lol
SPACE COWBOY.  Preferably like Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV.
Right now it is Warm Fuzzy Feeling by Fastball but most of the time it is Changes by David Bowie!  You?
I would like an Irish accent! Ooooh that would be wonderful!   How about you?
I used to be terrified of dogs when I was younger...got attacked a few times. So I've always had a preference for cats! Dogs and I are cool now though.
Cannon T6 For Dummies, lmao 📷  As for like.. actual novels.. I couldn't tell ya. It's been awhile.
Haha, you a rebel without a cause!
You would love Scotland!  Edinburgh is one of my favourite places been there a few significant times.
Oh so cool!
I miss them too! You’ve got me craving buttery movie theater popcorn now! Extra butter is a must 🤤
Front rows not the best to a lot of events I should have just said tickets, Yankee stadium any game
That’s a good answer.
That’s a nice gift!
Interesting! Did you like it?
Ooh that's so nice! I would probably just volunteer at pet rescues 😁
Spoons are really useful
Hahaha honestly - same! Wouldn’t want to give up either. But I tend towards vanilla too :)
Oh that is AWESOME! I'm really pulling for you guys this year! We have considered as well - I wish there weren't so many hoops you need to jump through.
Yeeeeessssssssss
yes i would get sooooo paranoid going in the future. i love the idea of time traveling!
Mine is Venus too! But because Sailor Venus was my favourite sailor scout!
I’ve never tried it!
I want to go everywhere too 😉
Ahhh. All those sound amazing
Well that was hard 😀😀😀
So you like the office though right ? My husband would be so upset that you haven’t seen Battlestar ... I’ve seen MOST of it but only because he’s watched it like 5 different times since we’ve been together ( a long time) so I have seen it but it’s not the same as Star Wars.. even though we are totally bigger Star Trek nerds over here
Hahahaha
What kind of art supplies do you like?
I love that! I’m glad you’re able to show the real you here. 💕
that is the only correct answer. 😊🦋
Oh neat!
How fitting!!
African Elephant!  If you had to lose one of your 5 sense which one would you pick?
Prague!
I put on Dead City Radio right now because I've never heard it before!  Favorite movie is tough... but I might have to go with Hot Fuzz. I love that movie on so many levels, and it's the perfect mix of comedy and action.
Frozen pizza for lunch!
Yum!
Great answer!!
It’s haunted with memories of a person I really loved who is no longer around. Not by ghosts.
Good choice!
Not only was I ready, I love it!!
😂😂 same! Prob no one in Costco would even notice
Honest answer will be coffee! I find I drink more coffee than water - working on that this year.
Hmm I would have to say water! It’s my favours beverage, and keeps things fresh and clean!
He’s cute! There’s an instant pot here and I’ve never used it. I think im afraid I’ll do something wrong and blow it up. What kind of Alexa? Like an echo?
Campfire! :D
I don’t really have a favorite name, but I love u/SmallGingerLady ‘s cat’s name Fatboi Jaden! >.<
Behind the coats in the back of the closet.  Have you seen my retainer?
My friends have called me that for a very long time, I think they're friends
Does it taste good? I eat all 3
My Black leggings.
In the current lockdown it has to be my black joggers
:snort laugh:  I like gummies, Twix, red licorice, and Reese's Pieces. I can't narrow it down.
Snicker bar, Twix, Fruit & Nuts
Very true
That sounds great. I too don't like maple syrup it too sweet.
Really? You could choose anything, and it’s a fanny pack?  I must need to try one of those to understand 😂
That’s a great gift :)
TalesFromRetail is so good! I feel similarly about TalesFromTechSupport (and can relate to those)
Delish!
I haven’t seen a free bank gift in 20+ years.
Gotcha, that's totally understandable!  Anything especially interesting?
That sounds lovely! Is love to go to Europe at Christmas.
I had no idea Squishmallows made a baby yoda. Good grief I love squishmallows
Hahaha I like to float in with paper once in a while
That's ok :)
Yum diet is amazing! I like the taste of it, even though some dont!
That’s definitely a cool gift to choose!
Cool!
Great fruit! Also has the ability to block most medications XD
Yes that’s absolutely a great one. It’s my second favourite after Prisoner of Azkaban!
Couldn't have worded it better myself!
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince!
You beat me in the bravery department haha
Ah, I see. :)
That sounds super decadent !!! Cool whip or the real stuff ?
That sounds lovely :)
Oh man, seeing your social media pages in the future would be so weird
Awwwwww you’re a good person!  Once I was at this mega-mall and this young guy came up and randomly gave me a $20 and walked away. I was too confused and flabbergasted to k is what was going on but couldn’t bring myself to spend it either so ended up donating somewhere. He reminded me a ton of my little brother who had died 🥺
Oh nice!
Oh I don’t remember those! That sounds cool though...did they mix when you squeezed the can?
Oooo I love picnic and cookout food. 😋
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 of all the things you could've said, I was NOT expecting that!
I’m an autumn girl myself :)
I’m an amateur photographer myself and love taking pics of nature too!
Excellent answer. That and decent sleep are probably mine too!
Ouuu why unfortunately?
Somehow I don't think I've ever seen that one, but I know I've heard about it a lot over my life.
😮 wingardium leviosa!   That. Is. Freaking. Awesome.
Hey I like those too. Mostly the pharmaceutical pens because they tend to be heavier and nicer!
Oooo, Japanese is a great choice. I'd probably go with Thai - tons of variation and it's all so delicious to me.
Interesting
That’s so cute! It’ll be her own little space :) I’m sure she’ll love it!
Nice. I’ve never stayed in one of those. The fanciest one I’ve been to was the Venetian and the Palma in Las Vegas, but they were normal suites, nothing bougie.
Yup. You win this question. No doubts about it. And if it exploded while you were in it 😄🌠
That sounds so freeing and fun!
I’m having an alright day. Not bad, not bad at all. You?
Yum!! 😋
London would be awesome! It's a great location and there would be a ton to explore in it.
Damn! Almost had you! 🤣
Omg how exciting !!! I am trying to be a film theorist disguised as a librarian so I totally get it lol ... I love concerts and miss them sooo much, who would you want to photograph?
Vanilla cake with vanilla icing!
I have 31 different tea cups (for fancy feels) and about 34 mugs give or take the collector star trek mugs and the one that is broken I can't seem to toss.  I actually counted the other day!
Hey that's a pretty solid choice all things considered haha! Live it up like you're a teen again by just taking s rest.
Haha that was almost my answer too! Love cozy blankets. 🥰
Good choice! I love oversized blankies too. Especially chenille or the Sherpa that’s shiny and soft, not the puffy kind that pills up.
Mine is plain cold water, no ice. :) But if I’m feeling like something flavoured, I like very watered down peach juice!
So key that you specified the first 5 seconds. I think that applies to almost all gum!
Fleshy average person. Not skeleton or mummified.  I have always asked this question when buying or looking at cars lol and the people always look at me funny. Can't imagine why?
Nooo. It has to be an actual thing! Silly.
Sameeeeee!!!! <3
Good choice for later-hubsband's problem! It's almost 7 and I'm still laying on the livingroom floor contemplating what to make.so you're ahead of me massively lol.
Hahahah nice!
They are so precious!!!😍😍😍
Uhhh, no. LOL
Ohhh interesting answer!
I mean...I should probably get a new prescription but they're not *that* bad 👀 Just take the compliment lol
I have one of those and it’s great! It’s a tiny ninja something. Ninja... yea I forgot.
:) yes!!
Ohhhh! Thanks! I learned something today
Me too! That would be the best.
I love that. I think I would like to be able to help make others more compassionate and empathetic.
Nice!
Honestly mine was a looooong time ago, to read a book. Not really something that interests me now- I feel so terrible when I don’t sleep!
Nice!
Noooo.
Cuuuute!  ❄️
Oh nice!
That's really sweet, and classy too.
Yum! Mines Vanilla Coke :)
Ooh neat! I tried to learn to crochet a few times. My LIFE class in high school got me able to make just a single long chain. My Papa tried so hard to teach me how to add more rows but I just could not understand until I found one particular YouTube video that explained it in a way that made sense. I really enjoyed crocheting, but I wasn’t perfect at it right off the bat, so I got discouraged after a while and quit 😢 Do you have a current favorite color of yarn?
That’s not being scaredy cat. You’re just in touch with primal instincts. On no planet is it normal to not fear falling 😂
Ahhh I’ve always wanted one, but they’re so expensive. I just pile on my cheap blankets for now. 🤣
I’ve gotten that a few times! I love the Addams Family but it’s a nickname for my dog! 😄
That’s even better
Yesssss. What nation would you be?
Absolutely! No more commuting!
Ooooooooooooooo
Good choice! They cute <3
What was your job there?
Lol I just realized the contest is already closed, but I'm having too much fun asking people questions!   I didn't even realize that one was canceled, I guess I thought it just fizzled out. Interesting choice.
sounds like the coziest place on earth 😊
Its ok my whistling has been called super annoying before 😂
Same. I don’t even have a car anymore. Mine was totaled by a boulder and I’d just increased my deductible so I only got like $400 for it 😭
I meant intentionally. I should have specified.
I love the beach but the water can be suspect we get red tide up here nasty!!!
Nice.
I like that one, too.
Ha ha! My friend and I played that at work (retail) if we closed together and danced in the store. Good times.
Mmmmmmm
This sounds like the sweetest suffocation I can imagine.
Honey if I ever win the lottery I will find you and buy you IVF. That made my heart ache.
That sounds hilarious. I’ve never watched Buffy. It was popular for my age group when it aired but I’ve never been super into tv.
Nice choices!   Darn, I always ask questions that I can't answer.  I have weird music tastes.  Either anything by Coheed & Cambria or Rise Against.  But my most played song is probably [The Blood of Cu'chulainn](https://youtu.be/XFP2ZB8ngbs).
Nice choice! Mine's not too far off, I would love a thick deep Scottish accent. My goal would be to play a dwarf in any sort of animated show haha
I was really scared of dogs too when I was younger! But weirdly that evolved into loving dogs and being afraid of cats now!
😂😂 I know right ??? What would you do ?
Oh really??? I'm watching Outlander right now and seeing what it was like in the 18th century (even if it's fictional) makes me even more interested in it!
I’m gonna make some now !!! Lol
Yeaaa... I used to be a Red Sox fan just because I wanted to go to see Fenway so badly.. and now I live in Milwaukee and I’ve seen Wrigley and I imagine it’s pretty much the same lol.. I love old baseball stadiums, idk why... the new ones are just monuments to garbage and capitalism
It was dark and sad but good. It’s a post apocalyptic story, where a virus wiped out most women and a man is trying to survive and protect his daughter by pretending she’s a boy.
In certain situations, absolutely!
Thanks!! Haha yeah there are MANY hoop. Home study took us 4 months of background checks, classes, interviews, medical records, letters of recommendations, proof of responsibilty, home checks, it's been a journey!
Hilariously I really want that motto tattoed on my back, but I am nervous about getting it HAHAHA
You must!  So good!
Do you really think you can go all day long?
I love the office!  I’m not sure why I’ve never watched Battlestar. Maybe I’ll have to make a point to do that. My dad used to be big into Star Trek but I never really got into that either.
Currently I’m into ink. Inktense. And color pencils. I’m trying to get better at art this year.
Me too. 😊
Yes 😊
Probably smell. But it’s a tough call!  What about you?
Ohhh that’s on my list too!
How did you like it? It’s such a great catchy rock song!
Nice!
oh. i’m sorry :/
I drink too much coffee too
Water is the most adult beverage of them all
Well it would depend on how nice the bank that is giving away the free gifts are. The Echo is the ground one, right? Those are neat, especially the ones with the clock in them. If it was a super fancy bank they'd have the Mickey Mouse wall clock Alexa, though I'd probably end up at yet credit union that has last year's dots that are like $5.  Instant pots are awesome! Nothing to be afraid of with pressure cookers.
Oh nice! I have bath soap and body spray that smells like campfire
Close - on top of the dog crate.  The red one? Yeah, it needs a good cleaning. The clear one I haven't seen in a while.
If i did roller derby SaraBellum (cerebellum) Graymatter would have been my name
SHOCKINGLY yes! The bologna and pb are virtually the same texture when you chew them together.
I'm gonna go Google joggers
Gummies are the best - they were a weakness in one of my d&d characters.
I didn’t know I could choose anything!! I thought it was like a realistic bank! Not bank of the princesses and queens! In that case I’ll take the 20,000 sq foot house complete with housekeeper and personal chef!
Yes I like the tech support one too!! I like most of the "tales from ..." Sub reddits :)
I watched NCIS which is a show I love and if you havent seen it I definitely recommend it!
They’re AMAZING . I wish they weren’t being resold for $50 😭😭
Ooohh yayyy, it's like I have a superpower haha
And that's probably my second favorite HP book 😅
😂 so much cat show
I've only done it with cool whip and it is fantastic
Hahaa so true! I can't imagine what weird stuff I might have posted 😆
Awww wonder what he was thinking tho. 🤗🤗
Ooh I had them I think 15 years ago. They come thru separate nozzles. But they are side by side so you get both next to each other but not mixed. If you want only one, you can press only one side of the pump 😁
Ahahahaha
I do enjoy spring & fall — anything but winter :)
'Cause I wasn't looking for a lucky number, but life gave me one anyway.
I really like it. Also the previews started coming out when my class was studying Twelfth Night (the play it's based on) in school. So it was extra fun.
It's from Discworld. I haven't read more than one book, and the username predates my hearing about the series, but it's pretty cool.
Well...I may have exaggerated a tad. I've never worked in a hotel that had presidential suites...lol. Guess we just arent the bougie kind! 😀
Ohhh I didn't consider that! But hell yah!!!!! Yep, the conviction for my answer just got stronger! 😀😀
Life. Goal!
Glad to hear it wasn't bad at least! It's been pretty good actually. Quiet, but nothing wrong with that!
Did you ever see the short-lived reality show Hunted? I came up with my own plan if I was ever going to hide.
Olivia Newton-John is my first choice if she tours again. El Reencuentro when they hit the road again. This group is made up of ex-Menudo members and we already have a working history. Ricky Martin - same answer.
Nice! I'm jealous. Although, I'm positive that if we had more I would find mugs everywhere in the house thanks to my coffee addict husband.  I already have to hunt for the ones that we DO have haha.
Kids. Am I right?  Hahaha.
Yessss. My husband just bought himself one of the oversized huge wearable ones and I'm jealous.  I tried it on and it goes down to my shins!
Yes, those are the best!  I have one Sherpa left and it's more dog fur than blanket.
It’s important! Also a valid reason to buy a land yacht.
Damn it. Anything? Are there tax implications?
☺️
Ooh that is a good one too.
I get that! I used to stay up all night the go to my classes and then come home and sleep it was a horrible schedule. I love my sleep now.
Thank you
Aww you should get back into it! Practice makes perfect! My favorite color is purple, and I’m loving the lavender yarn I have right now ☺️
Awww! Even better <3
I would have to be Fire nation! How about you?
Believe it or not a ride operator for a ride called the Yoyo and the dragon boat ride ..... I had no idea what I was doing but it was fun and I enjoyed it.
It would totally be all dim lights and smooth jazz music 🎶 floating thru the air with comfy couches and cute tables
Absolutely!
😂 at least you can whistle
Omg that sounds horrible...how even?!?! Glad you're okay!! I work 30 miles away, so my car not working would be a huge shitty ordeal :-(
Hell to the no, I despise bugs
That does sound nasty! I'm a Pisces so I love the water...I say as I'm living in the desert lol. If the Colorado River wasn't 5 minutes away from me, I'd be so depressed
certainly fun times
Yeaaaa
Exactly
Yeah she walks through a park and takes a lady's hat saying "I am the ghost of fashion victims paaaaasst"
Ah beautiful song. It reminds of this song I heard a long time ago by an Irish singer with his little girls doing an Irish jig to it. Something about an old cul cannon(?) pot? It was about a lady making food and it was very beautiful but I just cant remember it. Now I hafta to go find it lol
That is a great goal!   I did get typecasted in several different productions of A Midsummer Night's Dream as Cobweb so maybe I'm meant to always be a weird fairy.
I would steal large chunk of wealth from the world's billionaires, then redistribute that wealth to people who need it. I've thought about my plan far too much 😅
True, I read the series! fantastic, you can't help but think of going back in history.
Fenway is trash, the old Yankee stadium was unbelievable, the new one is visually stunning but with downfalls
That sounds very interesting!
😆
Push it in as deep as you can 😂
I love ink so much. I’m really into fountain pen ink drawing atm.
hmm... probably smell too.   favorite color?
The beat is killer. I love that drum all throughout - gets my feet moving!
Don’t be. It’s fine!
we both have to work on that!
I agree!
I have a little tiny echo dot my mom gave me. The little flat disc one that isn’t much bigger than a hockey puck. I like it but I’ve heard some newer models and they have way better sound.
Oooo fun!
Do you roller derby?
Fleece bottoms or lounge wears or sweatpants one of these should work. I called them "sweatpants" until I moved to NorthAmerica and no one knew what I was talking about
If your D&D character eats them does that mean you have to? I don't know anything about D&D.
Ooh nice! I haven't watched it as much lately, but it's a very good show.  One of my friend's dad worked on the show (and may still) so I got to tour the set once.  No cast members, as they had wrapped, but it was still way fun!
That’s how I feel about the Emily the Bat from Halloween last year. RUDE.
:)
Haha, sounds... Fun...
It sounds amazing !!!
It was odd for sure!
Interesting!
It's awesome! The color of magic, I've never heard of it, but I kinda love it now. Thanks! 🙂
Bougie ain’t all its cracked up to be. I like a down to earth, simple life myself.
Strap an indestructible Go-Pro on yourself and you'd have some craaazzyy footage!
Nope. I love a quiet day.
I hadn't heard of the show, but just looked it up and it sounds sweet. I love scheming things like that, or trying to figure our how I would catch someone hiding.
There may or may not be science experiments on my writing desk. I've been busy D:
Seriously. Don't know how good they have it lol
Yes! Those are the best. ☺️
😂
See? That's what I always say! You just never know when you need to dump 5+ corpses.
Nope. Just a reasonable gift you might get at a bank for opening an account. You know how they used to do free toasters and stuff?
Me too!
Purples my fav too! 💜 I definitely will one of these days!
Water tribe
Greeeeat. Teens pressing buttons. LOL
Im a live in where I work, and there’s a car for me to use when necessary. Once this job ends it’ll be back to using the bus. Bleh
LOL Just checking.
Rivers, ponds, lakes, oceans I love water!
I did Irish dance for years and I play violin and Celtic has always been my style of choice.  So in love.
All things considered, that's a pretty awesome typecast. Who doesn't love a good weird fairy? I think most of my favorite actors play weird characters.
I was going to say something like that but I didn't want to get too political in case someone would be offended lol
One day... one day LOL
Yes!!!!!!! I got a fountain pen for Christmas and that one of my plans with it.
Dark emerald :)
Glad you liked it!
Plus you wouldn't have so many other drinks without it.
I usually fall asleep listening to a book, they sound really tinny on the dots (my father had one)
It smells really good! Or, at least it DID I can't smell anything right now.
I wanted to, but I was too fat. My doctor told me I'd have a heart attack, so I ran their security.
Like it was a character flaw. Have you seen the second Jumanji (the first one with The Rock), how Kevin Heart can't eat cake.
Oh that's awesome!!
You're welcome!
Agree. Bougie is too stuffy. I made my team different colored t-shirts with our brand logo on them instead of forcing them to wear actual uniforms which only came out for inspection. The guests loved seeing the down to earth "uniforms". 🙂
😯 yessssssss. And by proxy, if I cant be hurt or killed, nothing on me can be damaged either. Id have multiple go pros, microphones that detect minuscule sounds so we can later hear every single thing that goes on....yah, 100% what I'd do!
It's the best! Especially when you don't have much to do (or worry about doing).
You can be my partner. LOL
No judgement here.  Our office is down out of the way so things can sit in here unnoticed for months.  🐛🤢
This is also why you need to have business associates with swamp access. Just saying.
Waffle iron. Definitely a waffle iron.
Yes lol not the most safest of things once while I was working the guy working the roller coaster accidentally got them stuck at the top it was horrible.
Samesies 💙 Even though I'm a terrible swimmer
HOW NOW SPIRIT. is burned in my head forever lol got to wear cheeky black bloomers and gothic clothes because Cobweb is always portrayed as a goth fairy....or maybe I'm just that spooky!
I get that, things are so tense now-a-days it's hard to know what might set somebody off.
I use a TWSBI eco and I like it
Oh you have one? What sort?
Oh no!! Why?
Was the security for fights between the participants or fans?
No, it's on my DVR, though.
It was so fun!
I would like that too.
Yea. I feel relaxed just thinking about it.
YES! I am in haha
I hope it isn't a horror movie when you find them! Be careful lol
Or know the local endangered flora of the area you're doing the dumping. Plant some on top of the site.
I remember when I bought myself a waffle making contraption. I wore that thing out for like a month then I never touched it again. That was about 5 years ago 😂
Swell. There's a family-owned amusement park that I go to every few years with teens at the helm. Sometimes there's an adult pushing the buttons and the teen just loads and unloads.
Its okay, just watching water is so relaxing
Mines a Twsbi diamond 580 emerald. 😆 I also have a couple pilot metropolitan that rock.
My father is about 1,500 miles away so I don't have one lol but when I was there with him I used it. It was a dot, and it was about 3+ years ago - I'm sure the technology is *much* better now. Trying to listen to anything (book or music) sounded really crappy.
Diagnosed with Covid on Saturday - felt pretty okay until the day before yesterday.
For the event - keeping fans in line, no outside booze in, set up the chairs and whatnot.
When you watch it, you'll get it
I was hesitant at first, but it went over really, really well. They turned it into a "right of passage" for any new people. The recieving of the "uniform" t-shirt became a rather big deal! It was fun. 🙂
I'll let someone else do the discovery mission haha.
Also a valid point.
I had one. Used it twice. Got ride of it. Wanted a waffle not long ago. Refused to buy one. Ha ha
Ya I think most smaller amusement parks are staffed by teens
Very true! I can also float on my back for a very long time which is also very relaxing as long as I don't close my eyes and lose track of where I am because then I'd float down into the middle of the river and probably drown lol
That’s way nicer than mine. I would love to upgrade mine to the one with the automatic plunger. I just can’t remember if it’s the diamond or another one.  My pilot metropolitan never worked, not even for a day. It just leaked ink. Disappointing.
Ah I was confused. Mine sounds pretty crappy too. I used it to give my birds music to listen to and they didn’t mind it.
Aww I'm so sorry! Hubby got it in March, and weirdly everything to him smelled like campfire (not joking) for months, so the smell is kind of out lawed, which is bummer because it is my favorite. Hope you recover soon and that your sense of smell comes back with it!
That's great you were still part of the event minus any possible injuries!!
It also doesn’t convey the message that you are seen by your employers as “the help” or as subservient. Some types of uniforms like that make me feel terrible foR people
Good. Call. 😬
Oooooooo that s disappointing.  Mine has a twist based suction feed. Holds a lot of ink and I can see it which is really nice
Yeah my best friend has the glowing one! That is super neat
That's really weird. I wish we had a working fireplace right now, PNW storm knocked out the power.
Yeah - was a good time
Oh, very true. I heard many a comment from guests that the staff didnt look like "staff", but more a group of helpful people wanting to BE helpful and to be there. The shirts had "I ♡ _____" (insert big brand name) in big white and red letters with "Team _____" (name of hotel on back" so there was no confusion we were staff. But we were all on the same playing field. I was the GM and I wore one every single day. There wasn't a time anyone felt "less then" any other department. It really turned out well. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. 🙂
The eco has that twist feed which I like a lot. I bought that as an intermediate pen to see if I enjoyed drawing with it and since I do I’m definitely going to upgrade eventually. TWSBI has a great inkwell that goes with the pen I’m thinking about. I’ll have to look it up.
Aww sorry to hear that!
That’s a beautiful thing. Reminds me of that saying “We’re all just walking each other home”, which I love.
Ooooooo
It occurs to me that I don’t qualify for your contest but I’ve had a blast doing it and talking with you
I still want to burn marshmallows though
I love that. 🙂 I figured out many years ago the kind of "manager" I wanted to be, but more importantly the kind I knew I never, ever would be.
Why don’t you? Maybe I don’t care 😂
do you have a gas stove? XD
Haven’t gifted since last month 😊
Nope lol and all my candles are LED
Aw pfff. Im not checking
Aww man!
Lol
Right! I went on a date in "the before times" and we ordered smores and it was awesome
That sounds like so much fun! T_T Oh I miss those days! There are friends I haven't seen in basically a year at this point.
The before times man
One day the before times will be the current time again. Hopefully we'll all just be like 0.01% smarter LOL

/u/poprocksandrum Thank you for sharing a happy moment with me ♥
love it!
Oh my gosh thank you!! Yay! I’ve been wanting to try the Charcoal Whitening!  :D You are so kind :) :)
You're welcome! :)
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kxlveb/brainstorm_what_books_do_you_recommend/
Trying to get some new books - list what you recommend and it looks like with brainstorm that  we can discuss and recommend as needed? This is a new topic for me :)  Edit - I’m open to all genres! I like reading anything from sci fi to true crime to autobiographies to romance novels. I don’t really have a specific genre in mind :)
The Hobbit is my all time favorite book, I also recommend the Six of Crows books. I’m currently halfway through the Midnight Library and it’s very approachable no matter what genre you’re typically into.   u/sleepy_pickle u/hungupon and u/gwinblayd any recs?
Matters what kinda stuff you like but I personally like the clockwork three and the six of crows books
I recommend the classic Animal Farm! I also recommend The Things They Carried.  And if you're looking to see the fallacies of the human mind, you can read Thinking Fast and Slow.
I really enjoyed *Circe* by Madeline Miller (based on the character from Greek mythology) and *Why Fish Don't Exist* by Lulu Miller (a memoir that also tells about the life of David Starr Jordan, a taxonomist; it does deal with suicidal thoughts, though, so be warned).  Edit: If you're looking for humor, I highly recommend *Hyperbole and a Half* and *Solutions and Other Problems* by Allie Brosh.
See, touch, feel books lolll. My reading level is severely low. But I do like the baby books. I guess I like using my senses. I remember one had a scratch n sniff cookie... nice.
I added the witcher series tbr list on good reads and lots of historical fiction
the cure for dreaming is a really beautiful loosely fantasy book based on the suffragette movement! I loved it!
Cassandra Clare’s Shadowhunter Chronicles Life of Pi Memoirs of a Geisha Wild by Cheryl Strayed
NIGHT CIRCUS BY ERIN MORGENSTERN!!!   My favorite book of all time :)   Will pipe up with more recs when you answer the other people's requests for genre!
Wind in the willows is one you might want to check if you're into classics, for a fast read The Chain Breaker Book series by Holmberg, D.K(fantasy) , The Duncan's series by Michael N Wilton(humor) and finally have a look at the comics maybe, Adoption by Zidrou
If you like some YA books I definitely recommend any Sarah Dessen books. They're always super cute and I have yet to not absolutely love any book of hers that I've read. I would also like to add on the delirium series. It's only 3 books and gosh do I wish there were more but ohmygosh IT WAS SO FREAKING GOOD. I wish I could forget it all and re-read it all over again so badly. Highly recommend!
For fantasy, my all time favorite is Uprooted by Naomi Novik. For horror, Second Child by John Saul.  For historical fiction Shadows and Strongholds by Elizabeth Chadwick, for YA fantasy, the poison series by Maria V Snyder, Stain by A.G. Howard and Splintered series by A.G Howard
I love books!   The Stand  Harry Potter series  The Nightingale   My Sisters Keeper  Big Little Lies  Gone Girl  Girl on the Train  The Lilac Girls  Beneath a Scarlet Sky   Divergent series  Handmaids Tale  Hunger Games  Where the Crawdads Sing  The Passage  The 5th Wave  The Uglies
I just ordered Night by Elie Wiesel to read again. It's one we read in school from a holocaust survivor and its part of a trilogy. I bet it'll be even better now that my brain is a bit bigger 😅   The Silent Patient is one of my absolute favorite books of all time. Words cannot describe it.
Lots of great suggestions in here. Right now I'm reading LoveCraft Country. Great read and very imaginative. If you're into Lovecraft (think cthulu), it's a good read.   Figure it's gotta be good as I suck at sticking to reading a full book and it has me captured.
The alphabets series from Sue Grafton it’s so good! Start from A all the way to X. Unfortunately she died before she could release Z
When breath becomes air.  All the light we cannot see.
There's a trilogy called Wake, Fade, Gone by Lisa McMann. Its all about a girl who can see people's dreams if they are asleep near her. Unfortunately, she can't really control if she's pulled into them. I'd describe it as a drama.
For true crime, I recommend The Night Stalker by Philip Carlo! A great read with so much interesting info! And my favorite fantasy book of 2020 was The Binding by Bridget Collins! I also recommend the Court of Thorns and Roses series, although I haven’t finished it yet myself!
The false prince. Its an easy read but gives me butterflies reading it cuz its so exciting. Its an adventure book
I’m deep in the Bridgerton series and OmFG if you love romance and regency it’s a must read!!
The Post Human series by David Simpson is fantastic.
Discworld series. They are awesome. Light, funny, engaging and sweet.
I know I'm a bit late some a lot of the best have already been recommended, but here are a few I can think of!  Red, White, and Royal Blue by Casey McQuinston (comedy romance)   Heart-Shaped Box by Joe Hill (horror)   The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson (drama)   Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton (sci-fi)   The Body by Stephen King (novella, drama)   Hannibal Lecter Series by Thomas Harris (horror)
The spirit clearing by Mark tufo
Any and all of Adam Silvera's books are great! Gis writing style and diversity in characters are great but his stories can be a bit sad
Have you read All the Bright Places? It’s really good :)
Quick question, you ever read wilbur smith?
Oooooh what kind of stuff are you into?
what genres interest you??
I am so excited for all these! I’m looking up each one :)   I don’t really have a preference or a genre in mind. The last few years I’ve been working on books that were given to me that were all in the romance category but I’ve ready many different genres and I’m open to all :) not picky here!
middlegame by seanan mcguire, the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson, her body and other parties by carmen maria machado, the last unicorn by peter s beagle, and anything by neil gaiman
Fred the Vampire Accountant series by Drew Hayes! It’s an excellent series. It’s super fun.
Educated by Tara Westover!
I just finished Uprooted by Naomi Novik today and it was fantastic! It put me in mind of old folklore and fairy tales. I just started Elsewhere by Dean Koontz and so far it's really good.
Love the Hobbit! My favorite series is the Death Gate Cycle by Margaret Weis and Tracey Hickman. No matter how many times I read it, it never gets old for me.
SIX OF CROWS YUSS
Circe was awesome and so beautifully written
Scratch n sniff cookies are tricky - you sniff too hard and they can just end up in your stomach!
That's really neat!
The Witcher series is definitely intriguing
I’m open to all!
I definitely like YA. Thank you!!
Oooh these look good!!
Awesome list!!! This is a perfect start!!
oo fantastic choices!
oooooo
Hi. You just mentioned *Jurassic Park* by Michael Crichton.  I've found an audiobook of that novel on YouTube.

This looks really good!
No I don’t think I have
I’m pretty open right now - I’m willing to try anything!
Pretty much all right now :)
These look great!!
Its so good!
Definitely!
🥰
It is! Hope you’ll get to read it sometime :)
Awww, absolutely have to try it atleast once
He’s an outstanding writer!
have you tried book of the month subscription!!
It really kicked off my most recent run of books because it was so good and made me want to read so much during quarantine. Ever read Shadow and Bone?
No but I’m open to it!!
No but it sounds familiar. What is it about?
It’s so so cool! Every month you can pick out one of their five books as your book of the month to read for 15.99. You can also add more books for 9.99 each!! They have an awesome selection and i just really enjoy the company overall and look forward to receiving it every month!
It’s set in the same universe of Six of Crows, set a few years before and with different characters. IMO it’s not as good as Six of Crows but still fun to see some character/setting crossover.
I seem to be on a reading trend of “magic users are persecuted” lately ive read six of crows, Children of blood and bone, and currently reading blood heir

Yes, it is I... John! Your magic crystal ball and/or "sage". Clearly, without any doubt, I can see the future... YOUR future!  Ask me one question or request a piece of advice on something... and perhaps I will tell you about if it all goes right. Or... if it all goes wrong.  Examples include: Should I eat ice cream tonight? How do I defeat my anxiety? How do I deal with this bad person? Will I meet my perfect puppy? Within the field of quantum entanglement, if I time travel and meet my past self will I destroy the universe through creating a paradox and thus glitching the matrix?  Beware! Enter at your own risk!     I hope this activity can make things feel a little more certain and ease a bit of anxiety.
Big John -   Is the laundry ever done? Or am I in a cruel cycle of never ended dirty clothes?
what kind of dessert would be perfect enough to impress a certain person of interest? 🌸🍰
Was I right?
Will it matter?
Alright. Alright. I'll play along.   Will I meet the person I've been wishing for?
Almighty John...  How do I find the perfect kitten?
I must know, John the Magic Ball, should I forgive one more time, or it is time to carry on?
Will I get to ever fit my entire foot into my mouth?
I need to know! How do I maintain the resolve to eat well and exercise?
Will I get the apartment tomorrow?
Will I get a good nights sleep tonight magic John
Would staying where I'm at or moving be more fruitful/beneficial for my future?
Should I stick with my current job? :)
Will my new pants shrink in the wash? They're a bit too long
Alright John....I’ll bite...  Within the field of quantum entanglement, if I time travel and meet my past self will I destroy the universe through creating a paradox and thus glitch the matrix?
I have the perfect question!   While using a phone, could John the Magic Ball give directions on how to limit a Google form responses to a certain amount of submissions? If not, its ok. I just thought I'd try.  I know how to do it on a computer, and supposedly I can download a sketcky app, but I don't know if I can trust the website, because it's download straight from their site, not from playstore so it's weird.
Dear magic ball, will I ever beat dark souls? 🙃🤣
Will I be successful at IT? *Evil laugh*
Oh Great Seer John, when I am next faced with my long-time rival Epic Boredom, should I invest my time into a new (inexpensive) niche interest to dive deep into, or rediscover an old one and ignite the flame anew?  May I also be so bold as to also ask what kind of interests you like that I might encounter along my way as a follow up?  🙌👏🙏
Should I get dressed and pretend to be a human?
Should I go to Costco today.
John, I'm finding it so hard to find motivation to do things recently.  What should i do?
Should I move to a new town
Dear John the magic eight ball, will the lockdown be lifted soon?   Whatever answer you give it will have its perks so don't worry!
Dear John the magic ball why am I still wide awake at 1:30am? Whyyyyyyyyy?!?
Will I write a book this summer, oh font of all living knowledge?
Dear John... I have a secret question... but I’m thinking of it right now... please advise
Dear magic Ball, will I get to hang out and watch creepers with a special someone this week end?
The laundry is and will be done! Your cruel cycle of never ending dirty clothes will end. I see a future filled with good smelling fresh clothes, and the joy of being able to feel like a functioning human again :)
Aww, this is quite adorable. I imagine that a delicious red velvet cake would impress your certain person of interest :)
Yes. You were always right!
It will matter indeed. Everything matters and we are all made up of matter. Therefore you should know that it all matters.
Hmmm, the person you've been wishing for huh? Strangely enough, I cannot see this person. They are like a personification or ideal that you have. Why is this the case? Perhaps the answer lies in our attachment to things and people. We can idealize things and lose sight of what is truly important. The development of ourselves to become better people. So then, maybe the person you've been wishing for exists within you but is lying dormant until you reach the pinnacle of what and who you are meant to be.
Well first of all, you are the perfect kitten :p adorable, cute, fun to be around, and just the right amount of sass!   Secondly, I believe that finding the perfect kitten is all in the eyes. Look into the eyes of kittens as you go to shelters and search online. See what kind of a cat they desire to be, what kind of an owner resonates with them, and try to visualize a life with that specific kitten.
You seem to be a philosophical person to me. You are a generous, kind, and forgiving person. People will certainly take advantage of that. This reminds me of Socrates stating that the only true wisdom is knowing that you know nothing. So go into this situation and observe it as though you know nothing.  You are in the third person and observing someone. You see that they forgive others too frequently and it is clearly troubling them. What do you think of the situation? Should they keep allowing themselves to be taken advantage of? Or should they carry on with their lives and move on to more positive things? The answer lies within how you view this situation. You must not allow yourself to see this as you are a part of the problem. But rather, you are a 3rd party and can see things clearly. Perhaps this will give you the clarity you are looking for. The answer has been within you this whole time. You just needed someone else to bring it out for you.
Somethings are unfortunately anatomically impossible. But that does not mean you cannot do it! If you can think outside of the box and train yourself to contort your foot... then surely you can fit an entire foot into your mouth. The whole world will be amazed by your dedication and talent!
Eating well and exercising have this symbiotic relationship. They are dependent on each other and benefit from each other. These are things I'm sure you are aware of. The issue is how you can maintain your willpower and continue to do these things.   Do you know why many people fail their New Year's resolutions? They make it too big and have the wrong motivations in mind. Instead of wanting to live a healthy life, they want to be skinny or lose 50 pounds. That isn't the way to go about things. We must think of our resolutions as existing beyond just the new year. We must think of them as a lifestyle change and make small steps towards them. I recommend watching this content creator. He is genuine and positive. His lessons and mantras are grounded in reality!   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Yd2YpIDkI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-Yd2YpIDkI)
Getting this apartment is incredibly important to you. Not only because of the new opportunities it brings to you but because it allows you to move on from a past place that you may have not enjoyed living in.   I believe that if you have taken the time to do all of the paperwork and negotiations properly, then all you need to do now is keep on wishing for that apartment. Tell yourself it will happen! If it doesn't for whatever unforeseeable reason, that does not mean this is a dead end. It means that another opportunity awaits you. Perhaps something that is even better than what you could have imagined or dreamed of. Amor fati is Latin and translates into "love of fate". It is a principle that many people find themselves wanting to understand. For you must understand that acceptance is the most important part of making choices in our daily lives. Accepting the outcomes of our decisions and the things we cannot control. We must not be so narrowminded as to see things in black and white. We have got to notice the grey area as well!
Hmmm... Unfortunately my friend, I believe that tonight is quite restless for you. Thoughts of people, situations and things may be causing you anxiety. Even subconsciously. This is important as it prevents you from having a proper restful sleep. It is important for you to calm your mind before you sleep
I believe that just recognizing the possibility of moving is in and of itself a sign that perhaps you should consider it. There is a part of you that is excited by new opportunities and potential for greater things. Yet, you are also afraid of there being too many changes or things going wrong.  Ultimately, both moving and staying in place are risks. How you might ask? Staying in place means risking the loss of new opportunities that could be fulfilling for you. Moving to a new place means risking the current stability and comfort you have.  You need to decide on which path to take. But I strongly believe that you asking me this means that you have pondered about it and perhaps just need a push past whatever mental block you are facing. Whatever indecisiveness there is.
Hmm, I believe that your current job is not a bad one. It does what it is intended to do and you may be satisfied. The issue is that life is filled with unpredictable circumstances. Therefore, with the things currently going on around in the world, some may say to stay put and stay in place. But I don't believe that to be completely beneficial to you. I think that if you can explore potential opportunities, and you find one that is promising, then go for it! You've got this!
I believe they will shrink as pants often do! :) I hope they fit you perfectly once they do shrink
Yes. Si. Oui. Ai.  If you go back into the past to meet a younger version of yourself, you will inevitably alter the future and create a distorted timeline. Within this timeline, you have now caused a paradox by seeing yourself for you once didn't know time travel existed but now you do. But at the same time you don't. You should and shouldn't know this. Your existence isn't plausible and the two versions of you upon getting closer will merge into a sort of interdimensional black hole that warps space and time into a distorted mess. It's like taking a loaf of bread, cutting it into pieces that are past, present and future and then putting all the pieces into a blender. What you have now created is the end of the foreseeable future, past and present. Your one action has nullified existence itself by existing.  Ps: I stopped taking science courses at age 16. This is definitely and probably very very accurate 👌😂
"To limit responses, create your form, click on the Add-ons button and select formLimiter". From my understanding, this can only be done on desktop or if you use Google chrome on your phone and select the desktop version rather than mobile. It will be quite wonky unfortunately.
One day my friend.... One glorious day... I believe in you!!! Stock up your supplies and keep dodging those attacks. Learn the pattern of attack of your enemy. You can do this
IT? Like information technology or like a game of tag where someone is "it" or do you want to be penny wise from IT?
Ahhh sorry for the late reply my friend!. Hmm, I believe that trying new things can be quite amazing as you are able to explore the new interest at your own pace. You can be consistent without burnout. Perhaps try mechanical keyboards if you haven't! They're a great hobby/niche interest.   And as for me? I enjoy writing poetry and music lyrics, singing, cooking and baking, playing videogames, and watching terrible horror movies lol
I love this haha. Hmm... no you should not! You are "princess kitty". Therefore you are first and foremost a princess. Princesses do not get dressed to act like humans
Hmmmm... yes, you should! Your fridge is looking rather sparse.
The thing that most people don't realize is that motivation is unfortunately a temporary thing. It comes and it goes. So what we should do instead is rely on routine and rewards over motivation.  The things that you need to do, put them into your routine. Do not overwhelm yourself with many tasks but just enough to be manageable. After that, follow the routine and let it become a part of your daily life. Eventually you'll find that you don't need motivation but can rely on structure in your life.
What is your motivation and reason to move to a new town? Is it to escape something, someone or some issue? If that's the case then you shouldn't move to a new town. You need to face these issues head on and try to find a way to accept whatever the outcome is. Moving to a new town for these reasons will not benefit you or your personal development.
Unfortunately, I don't believe the lockdown will end unless people start taking this pandemic seriously. Many people are trying their best and are frustrated but they need to remember that this is only temporary. The world will move on from this eventually. I know that isn't exactly a great answer but it's how I honestly feel about it.
Well, I have a feeling that perhaps you haven't been getting enough melatonin through natural sources recently. Do you drink milk? It's a great way of having natural melatonin. Especially if it's warm milk. You can even have it as a hot chocolate if you'd like. Just make sure you don't drink it right before bed as the sugar will be a little too powerful. Also, if you've had any recent dietary changes such as becoming vegan or going keto, your body's natural circadian rhythm will be disrupted until it figures out that this new change is going to last a while.
I have a feeling your summer is going to be filled with free time for yourself to enjoy. If you are able to stay focused and have a routine of writing, then you will most certainly be able to finish writing a book!
This is a little difficult... It's not like I'm psychic... Oh wait I said I might be. Ummm....  The question you're thinking of... The answer is a bit of a secret in and of itself. That's because you know the answer is within you. It has always been there subconsciously but you couldn't see it clearly before.  Let me ask you a question. What is your motivation for that situation? Why are you so insistent on ruminating your thoughts over it? In the grand scheme of things, is it really that important? I think not. I think what's more important is your day to day happiness.
Hmmmmm yes. I can see it... It's going to be Friday.  Of 2992
That or... Friday 15th of 2021
That sounds amazing! I’ll daydream as I switch a load 😂
hehe thank you so much~! 🌸
This is a HUGE thing. Life altering. And I keep flip flopping. How do I KNOW if I made the right call?
Sometimes antimatter rains down and I forget.
Keeping them hidden was intentional on my part. Thanks, John!
John the Magic Ball,  Magic you are indeed as I am certain I’ve never, ever commented on Reddit that my degrees are in philosophy.  I am also certain, outside people whom I speak to often, no one knows how frequently I use the Socrates quote you refer to.    I am both frightened and intrigued.   I thank you kind sir.   🙇🏻‍♀️
I’ll be sure to share with you if I am able to fit my foot in my mouth!
I just wanted to revisit this with a few updates.  1) I got the apartment and signed for it today  2) I move in February 1  3) Your response brought tears to my eyes. It was exactly what I needed to hear. It had a dose of reality that helped level my mindset. I wanted to thank you. I don't know if you meant to make a difference in someone's day, but you turned my mindset around for the entire week, and for the better. Be well, and thank you again ♡
I think you are actual magic John
There is much to ponder. Thank you, all-seeing John
Thank you so much!
hahah THE GAME IS SOOOOO HAARRRDDDDDD  *cries*   I did just start Code Vein too! lol
Pennywise XD
You know, it’s funny you mention mechanical keyboards because my friend and I were talking the other night about how I like really clicky keyboards, so maybe you really CAN see the future! (that or maybe you can see the past 😲) but now I have two votes saying I should pick up that interest haha.  Looks we have a lot of the same interests though :D
Thank you, I did.  When I got there the line went honestly half way around the store (longest I have ever seen and I was there 2 hrs before closing time).  But were incredibly lucky, hit almost every aisle and were there a total of 1 hr 15 min.  Spent $489.66, my freezer, fridge and pantry are happy for another month.
That's a great answer, it's the way I feel about it as well. Unfortunately there's so many people here not living by the rules.
I do not drink milk due to allergies. And no new diets. Lol my brain just needs to calm itself the heck down! 🙃 Thank you!!!
Ooh, that's sounds like the kind of summer I need! Thank you, oh wise one 🖤
Uhm rude much?
That’s better!
Beautiful! 😂
You certainly are an interesting person! No problem :)
Haha, no problem my friend! Kindred spirits recognize each other. I would definitely enjoy talking to you further if you would like to. Maybe our likeness can be a potential way of solving our own problems :)
Please do!
I was keeping you in my thoughts and prayers. Hoping that you'd get the apartment. Thank you so much for updating me! I'm really really happy for you.  Please don't hesitate to message me whenever you need someone to pick you back up or help ease your anxieties. I'm here for you
And I think you are actual beauty :) Like L sipping tea
No way!!! I am playing Code Vein as well!!! It's really difficult but fun as well. I enjoy the anime like elements
Ahhhhh. Yes you will be successful at IT! Just do a little makeup and drop out of clown school.
That's awesome! I just got into mechanical keyboards recently. It's reallyyyyy fun and practical since you can use it lol
Wow! That's incredible. I'm so glad you got everything you wanted :) cheers to another victory!
That sounds great!
Thank you 🥰 id like to exchange that love and let you know I'm here if you need anything too. I'm always by my phone and always ready to listen when someone needs me.
Omg same!!! I just started but I LOVE the character customization!! Makes a game ten times better when you can create your own look!
Yessss!! Can't wait to be IT XD
everything I wanted, lol, way more than I wanted.
Thank you so much, I appreciate that! ❤️
Yesssss!!! Not only that but the way you can change your blood code is sooooo cool. I love how the memories of people are still in their code. Like ughhhhh it's such a fun game. I just can't play it for hours on end because eventually it feels a little repetitive. Especially when I have to explore the same map over and over again just to get some parts that I missed.
I havent gotten that far yet   (the over exploring)  but I totally get it. Thats how a lot of games are for me and why I usually will have a TON of games going at the same time  lol and switch between them
No wayyyyy! I'm literally the same. I've been playing Code Vein, Ni No Kuni 2, Devil May Cry 5, and Dead Cells all in turns lol
Hahha code vein, control, resident evil, skyrim, and tomb raider for me. And if I want to be abused and punished, dark souls 🤣🤣
Which resident evil? I've been playing both biohazard (7), and the resident evil 2 remake recently :) and lmaoooo I haven't tried dark souls yet but I guess I'm getting a taste of it from code vein. I enjoy open world games where you have tonssssss of customization.
Resident evil 2 remake!! Ohh and bioshock as well. One and two recently . Need to play the last one. I own it just havent started it lmao.    Yes!! Open world games are so good! Especially when done well!      I am impatiently waiting for diablo 4 and fable 4 and tomb raider 4. ....all the 4s lmao. I love horror games a lot, fantasy games too. Anything with customization gets huge points from me.  Oh! The doom remakes was also fantastic! Haven't played the second one yet but the first was great!
Horror games are the best!!! There's this game called "The Forest" and it's basically what would happen if you take Minecraft and put a bunch of cannibals in it. You're trying to find your son after your plane crashes. The island is inhabited by these crazy, creepy cannibals who sleep during the day inside dark caves. You have to craft, build a shelter, get food, and survive while finding clues as to what happened to these people? As well as your son!  I also recommend games like dishonoured, mirror's edge, and assassin's creed
😲😲😲 well that game sounds awesome!  Im going to have to look it up when I get home!   I want to try the dead by daylight games soon. Ive played, and enjoyed, some of the assassin creed games! Ive been toying with the idea of getting the new one but have been holding off because I want to grab an Xbox x first...if I can lmao.   Haven't played dishonored yet but I did just install it yesterday!!! I am planning on trying it out this weekend!!
Niceee! And ooooo yes the Xbox X will be amazing!! Once you get it. Just avoid Cyberpunk for now haha. It's quite a glitchfest. But in time, it'll be the game you want to play as it has tons of customization!  And definitely check out The Forest! If you want to see gameplay of it, just let me know. I've been doing private twitch streams for friends recently. Just a little bit of fun! But you can see all the crazy stuff that goes on. The game is intense.
Oooo ok will do!!  And yeaaahh lmao i want cyberpunk but have seen enough reviews to know to wait. 🤣🤣 dunkey's review was hysterical
Dunkey is the besttttt! 😂
yesss!!! I love his videos!

Oh just hanging around. Made a bday card for my mother with a bunch of craft stuff I was gifted from amazon over the past few months. I got the last remaining and most important item - blank cards - with  a gift card 😊
Awwwwe, I hope you can use them!! Hopefully I will do another one soon, so you can get more white ones 🥰🥰🥰💞💞💞
I used to love making cards for everybody year after year after year for every holiday and even the half holidays that nobody celebrated OI was so crafty years back good for you
Oh yes I will use them,but they will be pampered n treated with respect!! Thank you for all your hard work for the giveaway!!🌸👍🥰
It takes time to make and time to clean up after. It’s the leaning up part I don’t like
Ahhhhh it warms my heart so much that you appreciate and will use with love!!! 🥰🥰🥰💞💞💞
Love homemade items,and I know all who get yours so appreciate it!!🐭🌸
I know time effort n hard work folks put into it,so you betcha,I'm loving them!! Have a great evening!!🐭🌻
Thank you! That’s kind of you. I keep it pretty basic as I tend to overdo things sometimes cuz I get so excited when I craft. Embossing powder and gun changed the game for me.
Ide love to see your work!!😁
I’ll see if I have pictures of any of them on my new phone...
Yes please do I would love to see them thank you
Omg guess what I did? When making my moms birthday card with my new stuff, I guess I was so excited about my Mother’s Day stamp, that even though I redid the stamp 6-8 times, it never once occurred to me until it was time to give the card to her. Luckily Amazon recommended me a schitts creek bday card I ordered that I gave her, too
I bet she's going to absolutely love it. How are you feeling today?
I’m feeling okay. Last night was pretty rough. Today I’m just hanging in here. Just trying to make it through another day. How are you and jj??
Eh I'm ok. Busy day cleaning n cooking ,mr jj is mellow today too just like mom lol..  Reading how bad virus n new strain is,n it really puts me in a somber mood. But I'm hopeful that tomorrow is a better day for you and me.hugs sweetie 🧸🐭
Tomorrow will be better for us. I just know it! I pray we stay healthy and safe
I really have to smile at this because yesterday was absolutely horrible I cried half the day I couldn't get out of bed was just very depressed and very lonely but I got myself a good night sleep for the 1st time in about a month and I woke up feeling wonderful and I've been busy all day I took a shower I played with the cat I changed my sheets I did food prep for taco meat and then I did food prep and chopped up some celery to make a tuna salad so I'm having a wonderful day and I'm looking forward to hearing that you had a good one is well. Hugs
Oh I am so so happy to hear this!!! I hate yesterday for you. I love today for you! It treated you well and you deserve that. Two day ago was my really bad day. I’m here for you if you need me!!
Big smiles for you my friend. Yes it's amazing how my mood can go from 0 to 100 almost instantly but I think having a good night sleep really really helped me. Sending you hugs from the East Coast from me and Mr. JJ🧸🐈
I feel your hugs! One is fuzzier and smaller than the other. Lol. Im so happy you snd Mr JJ have each other. Makes my heart happy. Wishing you more health, physically, mentally and emotionally. 😊😊😊
Aww ty my dear!! Yes I try to focus on positive in life and people daily,it definitely builds up my mood! I'm off to bed,sleep soundly my dear🧸❤🙏 hugs

The Daily/Nightly thread is a place for you to enjoy the company of your fellow RAOAers in one place! This thread is for many awesome things such as:  * Relaxing * Napping * Still looking up Urechis unicinctus * Slamming your ball into to your friends and taking extra strokes for it.   Plus many more fun things!  So come on in, grab a blanket, and enjoy the company.  **QOTD: What's your favorite animal?**
Well I did it, I pushed send on my job application tonight.  Now I keep my fingers crossed that I can get an interview.  I think I am highly qualified and I should have a shot at getting the position.  This weekend means trying to do some research and making notes in regards to that position, plus doing some Brushing up on my knowledge and skills.
Ate my feelings all day and did a bunch of chores so I definitely started feeling better. Love to all of you.
So today, I accepted an edible from a friend (mind you, I even took just a little piece of chocolate) and ended up tripping so hard I had to go home, ooops. 6 hours later I’m still high, I can’t believe how much of a lightweight I am😂  Hope everyone else is having a great night! Also, my favorite animals are cows & foxes (or honestly any fluffy animals🥰❤️)
Hey, cool. Off hella early haha once again...there's just too many people for any of the stuff to run right. I got a skinny caramel syrup to try. I hope it tastes good. I think the last time I tried one, I hadn't discovered monkfruit sweetener yet. So here's hoping! I want a delicious cup of coffee that's only 10 calories :)  How is everyone doing tonight?
u/Mimooshka u/late_to_join_reddit u/PsychologicalPenguin how are you all!!
Ugh... Sleep would be nice 🙄 anyone else ever get random fits of insomnia? My body is yelling for sleep but my brain is just like... "Hey, remember that one time when you were 11 and you asked if an 18 hour bra had a clock in it and everybody laughed at you?"
Ugh, my Dad woke up with a headache and feels really run down so is getting a COVID test tomorrow. He works for a post office plant where cases have been really bad. Hopefully it’s just a cold ugh.   How was everyone’s day? Ours was pretty quiet!
QOTD: I love everything about bunnies!
Sorry for geeking out over a drink earlier, guys. That was very immature of me. It's not that big of a deal, in the grand scheme of the world.
Almost Friday :’)   I’m going to lay down and play COD for the rest of the night. Feeling sad so I need company 😭
After 2 weeks of searching, my mother's body was located. We had trouble finding her because her husband was listed as next of kin and he refused to answer any calls. With that being said, no arrangements had been made before today. Nice to see that he continues his abuse of her even after her death.
oh god I am so bored. I need new games to play. any pc gamers have some recs?
QOTD: At this point it's the otter, it's my spirit animal. I am having a [craving](https://www.sfgate.com/local-donotuse/article/fat-innkeeper-worm-penis-fish-drakes-beach-14902264.php).
Having a wave of panic attacks tonight. Really awful evening. The festivities included prying a handgun away from my super intoxicated husband. No worries about my safety. I took the clips and hid them in a locked box that is somewhere he would never look. I am so done living like this.
I have totally messed up my sleep schedule. Ughhh.
My stir fry was bitchin. Got some cinnamon jelly hearts from Walmart. I’m happy. ❤️
I spent a lot of time this afternoon making a "master" template for our clinic reports. It's looking good but I have one issue. I want some of the fill-in spots to go down to the footer and I can't make it happen!!  Otherwise it's uneventful today. Counseling got canceled next week (she had something come up) and the last time I saw her was already 2 weeks ago. And I'm busy the next week. So it'll be at least a month. I haven't gone that long yet. Kinda nervous.  Happy Friday eve!
How is yall tonight? I hope good. I did some napping today but made banana blueberry bread too.  It's a hit!!!
Today was totally hard. Tomorrow is going to be a crazy day, but I'm going to try and have a hard conversation with my boss. I hope it makes things better and not worse.
[deleted]
Yay it's Friday Eve!
QOTD: Definitely turtles or orangutans! Both are incredibly cute and endangered.
My test came back negative, so that's good news. I still have a cough and a huge loss of appetite so idk what's going on. I did make a calzone for dinner though and it's super yummy!   On a side note, I've finally just realized that hulu has the final 2 seasons of criminal minds. I've been waiting forever since I finished what was available on netflix.   I hope everyone has a good night!
Qotd: penguins, wolves, foxes, turtles, and red pandas   Broke out my Xbox after about six months of not playing anything and played some more stick of truth 😂 I was gonna play some more assassin's creed but all my other video games are packed up.   So, my 20 month old [niece ](https://i.imgur.com/sYT9ueE.jpg) is starting to talk and she knows EVERYONE'S name except mine. I keep trying to get her to say Rocky but nooo. She calls me Shiny because I wore a shirt with Tamatoa on it from Moana in front of her. 🤦🏻‍♀️
hi friends!!! miss you guys!!! hooray for almost the weekend!!
u/space_noodlers u/Johnwoods1023 u/bobacupcake how have you guys been!!
u/So_Appalled_ u/bt112506 u/Gwinblayd how are my people doing??
I can't just pick one! I love dogs and cats equally. I always thought I was a dog person until I took in a litter of bottle babies, kitties of course 🙃.  Then I realized I was also a cat person! I've also had a strong connection to horses. Since I was a child I worked with horses of all ages. I was given a colt when I was a girl. I have a horse now too! I have a bunch of dogs. And cats. And a cockatiel!   I also love headghogs! My daughter had Rats and they are amazing!   I have fish tanks and I breed mystery snails! 🐌
QotD: Penguins! And dinosaurs.
3 good things today:  1. Did a lot  2. Danced  3. Shower helped me feel not as sad  ACCOMPLISHMENT: shopping, podiatrist  VALUE PROVIDED: chatted with BFF when she was sad tol
Well, that was a night. My toddler kept waking up and crying, like a newborn. I thought we were done with this! 😩
heheh it has been a great night, guess who got some boba tea tonight! 💗 hope that you all have a lovely night, don't forget to stay hydrated and remember that someone loves you~! 🌸
Hi guys. Sorry I ranted about money earlier. It made me mad that the company did not value me as a customer. Today is just a shit day. Simple as that. Didn’t go to the dentist. Didn’t go to PT. Didn’t even change clothes. Just got mad at customer service reps all day. Don’t worry, I wasn’t rude to them. Until the one became condescending. But any who. I have a dog in a sweater. That makes it all ok, right?  https://www.instagram.com/p/CKC2Lmph61Y/?igshid=pcubdy1ovk4u  Edit:  qotd:  guess.
Hi Everybody! I know I'm not very active... the last few months have been a roller-coaster. I got a windfall this week, and want to pay it forward. If you or someone you know has "smaller" feet, and likes pink, I have a [Shoe Giveaway, Ladies' 6.5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kxhueh/giveaway_its_a_shoein_all_the_ladies/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).
It's about time for my car to go in for maintenance .. 😒 The website says it's expected to cost around $250 .. I hope, like last year, the website is wrong and it's much cheaper. Ouch.
Another shift on the self checkout lane. Made some new old lady friends. Talked to one about talking shit to the registers because they always yell at you. Then she told me about how her husband has bonded with their roomba. Weird day 😂😂
Migraine day but I got out for hike after work and it's almost a three day weekend. I can't complain. QOTD My favorite animal is a tie between bats and manatees and sloths.
QOTD: Hamsters  Hope you guys had a great day!
tired, sore and cold. Imma bundle up and head to bed. I hope you have a nice night
Walked 8 miles today and then went and started pulling up the weeds from the backyard area. Filled one contractor bag with 2 more to go. Been productive
🎶 All the things she said  All the things she said  Running through my head  Running through my head  Running through my head 🎶   I miss them ; t.A.T.U — please go watch their music video to this song.   A few days ago , I was throwing up for a good 6 hrs on n off. It was not fun but I don’t know why I’m thinking about it now with a weirdly upbeat attitude. I’m all good...it was likely food poisoning but   Remember to stay hydrated 💧 🤷🏻‍♀️  🐣
Anyone else reading that 4th bullet in a sexual way? I can’t seem to read any other way now.   I’ve done nothing all day and my house is hit. So now I’m getting ready to to a fast clean thru. 6 has crap EVERYWHERE. Plus I gorged on leftover hibachi and I’m stuffed.   I really hate cleaning.   QOTD - I don’t think I have a favorite but I’ll go with cat for now :)
Staying up late again to try and get more work done on my essay, determined to try and get 500 words before I go to bed - tempted to bake a tasty treat with the goal of finishing writing in time for a nice snack but I need to at least get some stuff written first. It's difficult as I have a lot of things to say (and not enough space to say it all) but also means I need to try and find sources for everything as it's a pro/cons essay and I know plenty for both sides but just need evidence so it's going to be fiddly and annoying.  QOTD - I feel I kinda have to say cats because mine is staring right at me, but I also love seals.
Hello friends!!  QOTD: LLAMAS! I love llamas!
Hope you all had a lovely day! I'm excited for my best friend to come over for a visit tomorrow!
I was incredibly productive today. I wrote two course schedules, worked on a syllabus, and made PowerPoints for three chapters. It meant that I didn’t move from the couch all day, but it was worth it to accomplish so much.   Btw, it looks like I found a part time teaching job for the spring. Woot! I’m just waiting on the paperwork to go through. Keep your fingers crossed for me that it works out.  Hope y’all have a good night.
It’s Friday jr!! Hope you guys are having a good week!
Cats are favorite but I also like chickens and horses
Baby boy was put to bed an hour late tonight but maybe he'll sleep in a little later... who knows.  I've been very irritable this evening for some reason and I feel bad and I'm even bothered by that too. Ugh  Tomorrow is Friday!!! This weekend is also a three day weekend!!  I hope everyone has a wonderful night!
Cats and otters.   Watched lots of hockey tonight, and then watched wandavision.
Good afternoon everyone. Hope you slept well.
Good morning y’all! Another work day...but it’s actually my Friday and tomorrow we get to go and look at houses! Officially house hunting, woooo hoooo!!   QOTD: Mythically speaking, Unicorns. Reality speaking....puppers and Corvidae.
Hello everyone how’s it going? Payday is Tomorrow yay!!
I hope everyone is having a good day!      Got covid tested today. I'm trying so hard not to be down in the dumps, but my efforts are not working too well. I feel crappy and I'm sad I'm missing work.      Please send socially distant hugs. I absolutely need them!
If my back could stop hurting for 5 MINUTES! -screams- 😡😩😔
💃
Good evening all!
Hey y'all. I'm sleepy. I might play games with my mom tonight.
QOTD: alligators!!
I love beagles!
I have waited all my life to answer this.  Qotd: Sea Otter!
QOTD: Ocelots, sugar gliders, penguins, seals and chinchillas :))  There were so many replies to my previous contest, I haven’t really responded to all of them But it was such a treat reading all the good things that happened to people. From getting a teddy to getting a pay raise and all the babies 💛   I enjoyed every comment, I was tempted to gift everyone . But my credit card limit is very low and my next bill rotation is tomorrow :p oh the pleasures of being a responsible adult!  However I’m getting close to giving in and just straight up buy a humidifier cause of the dry air. If anyone has any recommendations to share, feel free to cause I’m kind of scared of blindly buying something lol Even though I do it all the time 😂
Hey there watched the little today! He was very good we watched Horton Hears a Who! So cute. His second Birthday is the 23rd. I'm so excited for him! Love that little guy. Hope you all had a great day and yea Tomorrow is Friday! The weekend is within reach! Have a lovely night and don't forget to hydrate!
Well, I've gotten a lot of work done in the garage tonight. I'm looking forward to getting more things settled and cleaned up so we can get organized.   It's way past my bedtime, but I'm sitting with the husband, watching Friends, polishing off a couple of pasties (handheld meat pies, for those unfamiliar), and just decompressing a little.  I hope everyone has a lovely evening. You all matter so much. ❤️
Ordered food from sams to stock up the household. I am really enjoying the grocery pick up a lot of stores are doing. ALSO! As a birthday gift to both of us (bfs birthday was this month and mine is next month) we got ourselves a metal detector! Tested it out in the backyard and so far we have found a random old pipe, some sort of latch, sheet metal, and an old pickle jar lid lol in three weeks we are going to a private beach (if it wasnt private we wouldnt be going, and dont worry we are driving, not flying!) and I cant wait to use the detector there too!
QotD: My favorite animals are dogs, cats of all sizes (house cats, lions, tigers, etc.), horses, and wolves.         Don't forget to [enter my contest!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kty5ao/contest_dream_home/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) It ends tomorrow.
Good morning y'all! Just meetings today so I'm looking forward to an easy work day.  QOTD: Does a unicorn count? If not... frogs are pretty awesome.
Omg good job! I hope you get an interview :)
All the best! did the same today hoping ultimately for an offer.
Wishing you ALL the luck! I'm so proud of you for going after what you want ❤️ I'll keep you in my thoughts, and make sure you let me know how it goes!
Fingers crossed!
Good luck!!
Good luck!!
<3  I hope you feel better soon.
Hope tomorrow is a much better day!
Been there. I bought some edibles and was amazing at their strength. Have to cut them down to a third of their size to enjoy anymore. But, still love them!  Cut the next one town a lot and try it again. Most of the commercial stuff is very strong.
That’s kinda like what happened to me the other night. I mixed two drugs that shouldn’t have done anything to me, and the next thing I knew I was all benzoed. Oops.
Edibles and 🍃 in general always gave me such bad anxiety so I haven’t used in a few years. 😩 It just wasn’t worth the feeling of my heart jumping out of my chest. Though I HAVE been trying to find a good CBD cream for my back ugh.
I've never partaken, and I'm honestly scared to.  My mental health is a delicate balance with three depression meds, so I don't want to disrupt that balance.  But more power to you if you like to and don't drive while under the influence.
Ooh, hope it tastes good.  I've been watching random stuff and knitting, and now my hand hurts.  I'm very out of knitting shape.
Hopefully that syrup tastes good. I always find skinny syrups have a strange aftertaste. I had to train myself to just drink black espresso instead lol!
HI PEANUT.
Enjoy! Have a lovely night!
You are so lucky!! I got asked to pull a double shift at the last minute again. 🤬
💙💙 Doing okay, able to chew a lot better even if it still is uncomfortable. Still avoiding a lot of foods, but no longer starving. Woke up with a puffy and sore eye which is painful and sucks, but hopefully goes away soon...maybe a blocked tear duct or something. Thanks for checking in zap buddy ⚡💙 How are you doing?
Gdarn16!!! Whatchaaaaa doooooing? I’m about to walk my big booty boy so I’ll be back in a few!
How was your day? Talk to me! I took a little break from Reddit unless I was tagged. So thanks for thinking of me!! ❤️🤗❤️
Hey! What are you up to right now? After a late dinner, I’m just finishing up laundry and putting on all the bedsheets. Going to chill the rest of the night before the school semester starts on Monday-I’m not ready to go back!!!
Lol thats so cute though! Its okay, i am also having insomnia rn (body is upset im no longer on anxiety medicine) so what did i do? Decided to order myself some clothes lol i got some giftcards for christmas and I desperately need some clothes that actually fit me
😂 I literally asked the same exact question when I was younger. Those bras that came in the cardboard packaging, so confusing lol!
I can definitely relate, my sleep schedule is not great.
My son, age 5, has insomnia. Sometimes he sleeps really well, other times we're up in bed at 2am talking about dinosaurs. 😂
Hope your dad is ok and feeling better soon. Overwhelmed from work over here, but just relaxing and chatting with folks on reddit is calming for some odd reason.
I hope its just a minor cold or allergies. 🤞💕💕
Fingers crossed it’s a negative and he starts feeling better soon!
Nothing wrong about geeking out about stuff you enjoy.
I'm not sure what you're speaking of but I'd bet it's fine lol
Hey 😁 I also play COD. if you ever wanna party up, let me know! I'm on PS4, and I'm not very good, but I have a lot of fun yelling at people 😂
Why you sad? 😞
I hope tomorrow is better.
Have a HUg 🤗
Sorry, I'm really upset
I'm so sorry.
That's so horrendous.  I'm so sorry.
I am so so sorry for you pain and loss
Oh that’s awful! I’m so sorry to hear this news. May she rest in piece and I hope you’re able to find piece as well.
I'm really sorry for your loss ❤  Did he have something to do with it?
I'm sorry for your loss. Hugs
Basically the only game I play is Rogue Fable III.  It's a Roguelike dungeon crawler.  I really enjoy it.
Hey Boops long time no talkie!! How have you been! Missed seeing you here! Hugs
I play way too much. lol.  Finished Assassins creed Valhalla bit ago, trying to figure out my next focus. What kinda games are you normally into?
I enjoy The Sims 4
What kind of games do you like?
[here you go. ](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CJeIwA_hacC/?igshid=dx4qoboddslg)
I was not expecting that lol
Can you stay somewhere else for the night? You shouldn’t have to deal with that, no one should.
I am so sorry you had to go through that. Please put your safety a priority. Take care of number 1 -You
I am so sorry you are going through this! No one should have to live with that kind of fear.
Meeeeee. I can’t manage to go to sleep until at least 3 AM. Even if I get into bed by midnight, I somehow spend a few hours watching TV and reading reddit. Theeen I wake up anywhere between 7-9 and toss and turn until 11:39, when I snooze until about 1 pm 😂
I can relate.  I think I've done the same.
Same! I've been all over the place this week. One night I got 3 hours then the next 6, then 8 another🤪
Nice! What veggies did you put in it?
Ohhhh yummmm!! To stir fry and cinnamon jelly hearts!!!
Mmmm stir fry
Cinnamon jelly hearts are so delicious!
Cinnamon jelly hearts? Hmmm those sound good!
I’m sorry about your therapy hopefully something it’ll open up
Oh that sounds heavenly
Ooh, I'm planning on making dark chocolate chip banana bread soon but that sounds really delicious too! Do you have a specific recipe for it or just add in blueberries?
Sending good vibes! I'm always here if you need a friend. ❤️
Sending luck and hugs
Best of luck. It's tough to do, but being transparent and honest usually pays off in one way or another.   You've got this, keep positive!
Best of luck to you tomorrow!
Good luck!
Which one is that?
Which one?
Happy Friday eve! Lol
💃
congrats!!! you could have rpv or something flu adjacent. try to chug down those liquids!!!
Omg her blonde wavy hair. 😍 My 15 month daughter has been saying ‘Dada’ since like 10 months old, but does she say ‘Mama’? Of course not. No big deal, I only BIRTHED HER. 😂
Woo hoo! 🎉
just drinking some boba tea and listening to some music hehe, how about you~? 💗🌸 hoping that you are doing okay!! 🌸
I've been okay!!! How have you been?! I hope you had a good day!
I'm cuddled up, reading and drinking tea! How are you? ❤️
I'm doing great fell asleep at like 8 or 9 last night which never ever happens. Hope you're doing well!!
Hanging in here. Glad it’s Friday. This week seemed to go by really slowly. How are you??
How are they mystery snails???
Glad you accomplished so much today!!🤩
Get anything cool while shopping??
Aww sorry!
Hopefully you can catch up on your sleep tonight!
I think there are times where it just goes backwards for a bit, then forwards again. Kids are exhausting. LoL
I love boba. I need to get into my favorite ramen joint again soon and get a solid bowl of ramen followed by some boba for dessert.
owwwww bobaaaaa!!! sounds like a good night to me! 💜
OOOHHH I'm jealous!!!! I miss boba tea!!!
Have a great night!
You're absolutely allowed to vent! No apologies!!! I hope everything is okay!
You don’t need to apologize! We all need to vent once in a while. ☺️
Hi!  I am not going to enter that, as I have really big feet.  I have to wear men's shoes usually.
I wear 6 :) that’s soo nice of you! Hope someone gets them that needs them :)
How are you doing?
Oh geez. I hope it's not that much and the website is just full of poop! ha!
🤞🤞for you!
I hope it isn’t the full amount for you. I’m looking at $800 for routine maintenance on my Subaru in a couple of months, so I totally feel your pain.
Yuck. Car maintenance is so expensive.
lmao. well i can relate. we named our roomba Otto (auto) lol. when it gets stuck, we pick “him” up and say “you’re drunk Otto, go home.”
😂🤣😅 how does one bond with a roomba?
I call all self-checkout registers "Brittany," as in, "Shut up, Brittany!"  Also, I hear that at the Roomba repair section, they get a lot of concerned people that want to make sure they get the same Roomba back.
Oh no haha is she jealous of the roomba? 😂
Oh no hoping you feel better
Oh I love manatees!!!
Hoping you get warm
That was a great song
I'm glad you're feeling better 😘
I thought of ac/dc balls song lmao
I had to re-read it as well. Just add an "s" and the entire context changes.   mmmm, I miss hibachi......
You got this! You can do it!
How's your day?
Llamas are pretty great. There used to be a llama farm on highway 50. That’s how I knew as a kid that I was getting close to grandma’s house.
A company we commonly work with at my job has a llama as a mascot and an awesome branding department. Got many cool llama branded items out of it. Love  it!
Yes, llamas are so cute!!!
Yeah for best friends and visiting
Aw that’s so exciting! 😀
Fingers crossed! I hope you have a great night!
Friday jr haha I like that!
Hope your week is going well!
I have always loved horses even when I was a little girl. 🐎
Sometimes we just feel a little like we're being poked by a stick. That's okay. We all do!
Oh yeah I heard hockey was coming back. How was Wandavision?
Good morning!!!
The kid (5 year old diagnosed insomniac) had some weird issues last night. Like he was tired and kept laying back down, but still awake enough to sit up every few minutes like "What year is it?!?" 😂 He finally passed out then the cats started pawing at the door. 😒 I mean they say no rest for the wicked. 😁
House hunting can be fun!!
Sore but here in my happy place of the internet
yay for payday! 🌸
Virtual hugs and good vibes incoming!
Sending hugs
Hugs
Lots and lots of hugs your way!
oh no!!! have you tried aleve? that usually helps me.
Oh nooooo I hope you get some relief!
💃
💃🏼
Evening
Fun! What game?
They are pretty great!
Thats a really good pick! Otters are so darn cute
If you find a good humidifier, I’d love to know! I’ve been searching for one that can run all night safely.
Good job in the garage! :)
Ok listen... I read "pasties" and got a mental image of a very distinguished butler holding the OTHER kind of pasty and polishing it like it was the queen's silver.   I need sleep 🤷‍♀️
I seriously hope that the grocery pickup will stay long after the pandemic is over. I love the convenience of it and it’s a dream come true for an introvert like me.
Lol same on the mythically speaking animal haha
You know I honestly didn't think about if mythical creatures counted...
Thanks, I hope so too!
Best of luck to you as well!
Thanks you for all the positive vibes, I will definitely try to remember to keep you updated.
Thanks for the positive vibes!
Thank you, I am loving all the positive vibes I’m getting from my fellow redditors.
Thank you
Oh for sure! It felt great, don’t get me wrong but I definitely couldn’t function at all or be productive. We were all very surprised how strong they were but I was the only one who got this mellow. I was so scared everyone around me was gonna notice😂
Honestly I was so surprised how damn high I was, I even thought I was doing my friend a favor by splitting the piece they got in half, good god.
See, so far I’ve been lucky enough to just get super mellow the few times I’ve tried to do any of those things at all so I just fall asleep. That’s the feeling I get with caffeine tho, so that’s why I don’t like coffee (+ how it makes my mouth taste, I love the smell of it tho!). If I hear about any good CBD creams I’ll make sure to let you know!
I completely understand! I’m not on any type of medications and I do struggle with anxiety so I was like sure I’ll try a bit! But all the power for you to wanting  And not at all, I don’t drive but I made sure I was being picked up by someone I trust.
I tasted just a teensy tiny sip and it was actually not too bad! We'll see when I make a whole cup! Maybe I'll be able to make skinny frappes!
Hey Boops! How are you?
Thank you! How is your night?
Screw that noise!
i hope you feel better zap buddy <3 take care of yourself!!! and im okay! ready to be done with work for the week!!
It was good! Just got one more day of work! How was your day!
What are you studying??
Uggghhh, I'm sorry your body is misbehaving. But on the plus side, treating yourself is always a good thing! I won't shop when I can't sleep, lol. Lack of sleep also means lack of reason in my case, and I would end up with like, 12 new bedding sets that match the new dishes I bought 🤷‍♀️
Omg at least I'm not the only one! 😂
Awww, that's actually kind of adorable though 🥰
Thank you! He gets sick a lot for some reason,always  just usually mild colds, so I’m hoping it’s just that. 🤞🏼 I’m sorry you’re feeling overwhelmed. Reddit makes me feel relaxed as well, I love chatting and reading on here!
Thank you! How is your husband doing? Is he feeling mostly better now? 🤞🏼
I deleted my geek-induced ramblings. Lol.
I'm not hexbags, but I'm on PS4 too! I don't have the newest CoD, but I'd be down to play another game with you if you are ever online!
DUDE YEAH let’s play !! I’d love that 😭😭 i sometimes end up playing on my own and would love a teammate. Sadly I don’t have a mic but I hope that’s not too much of an issue
Anxiety !!! It’s been terrible and hard to cope with. But I’m trying my best to distract myself !!!
Thank you so much 💘💓💖
I'm very sorry about everything that's going on and for your loss. Also you have every right to be upset!!! Especially if that abuse was a factor in her passing.   I can't be of any actual help but if you need someone to talk to for comfort or a distraction or or just a way to scream into the void my DMs are open.
he was abusive. she had a fall that resulted in a broken leg/hip and was in a wheelchair since July. she was being medically neglected and refused help from me and other members of her family.
I will have to take a look at it! I'm looking for more 1 player games
Hi honey how are you doing? It's so good to see you again! I've just been working a lot and I am trying to spend a little more time here again!
I need to get one of those games! My problem is I don't really have any games that I'm enjoying playing solo. I play a lot of plasmophobia, dead by daylight, and overcooked. but I want a good 1 player game.
I have been thinking of getting the Sims actually!
Omg, that is so stinking cute!
And now I am ~~stalking~~ following you. :P In case you are wondering who that new stranger is.
😂 The 2nd glass of wine may have contributed to my answer.
Yes. I am someplace safe for the night.
He won’t even remember a thing tomorrow. Ugh.
Lol I go to bed at 2 right now but can't sleep until about 4. Then I wake up only 12689335 times to roll over, go pee, drink water etc. Then the kids (nephew's and niece) make noise starting at 6 so I wake up randomly when they're especially loud. Fun stuff lol
I used to go to bed at midnight and wake up at 10. Now I go to bed at 4 and wake up at noon. I 'went to bed' at 2am yesterday and didn't fall asleep till about 6. Was awful
I did a mix of broccoli, carrots, mushrooms and red bell peppers!
Just add in blueberries it comes.out fantastic
Thank you 💛
Thank you! 💛
I hope so, thank you!
Thank you!
[deleted]
We're almost there!!
😂
Thank you! I'm definitely relieved and I just hope whatever I have goes away soon.
😂 😂 😂 Rayne was the same way. First word: dada. She even said papa before mama.
oooo what flavor today! and im okay! ill be even better with my four day weekend starting tomorrow night!
i hope you had an amazing day! how has your jobs been??
I’m good! I got off work early because I’m a favorite 😂😂😂 enjoy ur relaxing night!!
That's just their name, lol. https://www.dropbox.com/s/n4o0wit30q9ux74/20200922_150234%20%281%29.jpg?dl=0 They come in all colors and sizes! They are so cute!
Thanks!! I love it when they happens!
I just got a bunch of food... But I did get Cara Cara Oranges for the first time. I just had one and it was delish!!! Sweeter and less tart than normal naval oranges!  Oh! And because it was Aldi, and they have an isle for random stuff, I got a pack of 4 different scissors for me (white and gray diamond pattern) and another set for my mom in law as a present (hers is champaign colored in the shape of interlocking circles). They look pretty cool!!
ooh ramen is amazing! 🌸 hope that you get to have some soon! 💭
thank you! 🌸
It will be eventually.
🥰
Not bad. Staying busy. Hopefully I can find a different job soon, a little closer to home, so I don't have to spend almost 2hrs a day commuting.
Indeed!
Thanks!
Owww. Why cars gotta do us like that D:
It really is. I know it's important but man, my car is only 2 years old. I wish my car payments covered maintenance too! Lol
Lmfao. I love it. My sister bought googly eyes for hers 😂😂
Same way we bond with other inanimate objects. It’s just cute and kinda like a pet that vacuums lol.   She went on about how he just loves it and talks to it when it’s vacuuming and how it’s doing a good job then tells the cats to get over it bc they hate it.
Omg I love it lol.   I follow a group on fb called “humans with pack bond with anything”. Lots and lots of roombas and various brands of robot vacuums. It’s pretty cute lol
It was pretty good! Felt long while at work but the afternoon has been flying by! How was your day?
That is so awesome!! Lol i am so jealous!
Heck yeah! It's gonna be awesome :)
Thank you! I hope the same for you!
Haha! A friend said it to me once and it’s stuck :D
Hey you too! Hope you’re doing well :)
It was really good.
Morning, sorry went for a walk.  Bloody freezing 🥶
My kid occasionally hums theme tune to a game he likes to play on xbox lol
That’s a good place to be and sorry about the pain. I know in a few weeks I will be I have surgery :( not for sure the date yet eek!
Payday and Etsy is great
Thank you thank you!
Thank you ♥️
Thank yoooouuuuuu
Typical pain killer usually don't help me but I'll see if my body will be nice to me today. If not, why I'll just uh...give myself a lecture! YEAH! 👩🏽‍🏫  Hopefully my sister has some aleve? Wish me luck!
We played Uno Flip and Monopoly Deal.
Oh definitely since that’s my concern too! I’ve been looking at cool mist humidifiers as theyre much more recommended for people with kids and pets because of the issue of it tipping over and causing any sort of burn. Still looking though (*´ω`*)
Thank you!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Exactly! I dont have to worry about being around so many people (because of covid) and I dont have to worry about being around people (because am introvert) lol it really is great
Thanks
That's usually my worry as well, wondering how much everyone else will notice. At least the sleep is nice and bonus, no hangover!
Thank you! 🥰
Good. :)  I'm glad you took steps to make sure you were safe.
Hanging in there! Next week is surgery finally. What about you?
I did tell him if I did I would not be working second shift tomorrow so he found someone to cover for me. So at least I get some time off
What’s a zap buddy? I wanna be a zap buddy!!
S a m e!!! I have a 4 day weekend because MLK Day and I'm off Tuesday since I work next Saturday. This means the weekend after this will only be a 1 day weekend, but oh well 😵
Yayyyyy I’m so glad!!! You got this!!! I’m rootin for ya to have a smooooooth day tmw! ❤️ mine was pretty low key. After yesterday’s mental/emotional meltdown followed by u/purpleteasoul’s healing touch that made me sob so hard, I was pretty exhausted lol I still haven’t gotten any of my list of things to do done. 😪 but tmw I’m pretty determined... need to really cross 2 things off that dang list!
It is! It took a lot of mental work to get to that point. I was always so frustrated be wouldn't sleep.
Thank you for asking, he’s about 90%. His Covid test came back negative. Phew! 😅
Pls cant all three of us play!! It’d be so fun 🥰
Yes! I have both COD'S, so I can play either one. My psn name is raia_shadewing if you want to add me!
No worries! I have a mic but don't use it a whole lot. My psn name is raia_shadewing if you want to add me!
Anxiety is so irritatingly terrible! I have it too and it ruins so much for me. I hope you can find something to distract you!
You're welcome. 💚💜
That's just awful 😞 I'm sorry
It's a 1 player game! :)
I hear you there. I pretty much only play solo. Assisins Creed Valhalla is good. A good time suck as well.  I also like The Long Dark, grounded (early access, but still great if you like building), No Man's Sky, Satisfactory, Starbound, etc.  Do you have Steam? If so, there'e a recommendation engine built into Steam to recommend games.   Oh, and check out Epic Games as well. A new FREE game every Thursday. Right now it's Start Wars Battlefront 2.
Haha, no worries!
I’m glad to hear that.
Oh nooo! My niece was the same way!! Up at the crack of dawn to ask for breakfast 😂
Ouch.  That sounds awful.  Mine is very sporadic (I tend to wake up a lot during my "sleeping period"), but it's starting and ending later.  So  I'm starting to sleep at like 3 am and waking up in the afternoon.
Well, I know what I'll be baking this weekend if I can manage to get blueberries!
Yw
Ok. I guess that hasn’t been around for awhile because I’ve worked at a convenience store for nearly 3 years and it only sounds vaguely familiar. I like cherry cola. I hope it comes in a zero calorie formula.
rose flavoured~! 🌸 yay a four day weekend sounds just lovely, hoping that you enjoy that~! 💗 are you planning on anything for the weekend? 🌸
I had to get a covid test today, so I had to leave work early. I know I won't, but I'm hoping I won't get fired lmao
Yay for getting out early! At my job we consider ourselves lucky when we get to go home on time 😂 there's been a lot of mandatory overtime the last two years due to understaffing 🙄 I hope you're now relaxing yourself!
Ooooooo!
See this is why I can't shop at Aldi, I am afraid I would find awesome random stuff every time!!
Think I"ll have to make sure it happens this weekend. Just realized I've brought up ramen in conversations multiple times this week. LOL - must be my subconscious telling me something.
<3
Damn! 2 hours is a long commute!
I wish the maintenance was cheaper.
Amen to that!
thats a fantastic idea!!!!
😂🤣😅 I’m dying he yells at the cats
That is hilarious 😂
My husband and I talk to ours. His name is Buddy and he’s a good boy. 😁 Our dogs hate him. 😂
Aww, that is cute!
I'm glad you had a good day! Mine was okay!
I’m happy for you
That's adorable!
I over did it. Most the pain nerves saying I'm in pain. The lingering medical issues from a car accident
For sure! I took a really good hour nap and it’s still going strong (so imagine how bad it was earlier lol) at least it helped me relax!
If you don’t mind me asking, why do you want a CBD cream for your back? Anything in specific?
I'm sorry you ended up having to have the surgery :( Is there anything I can do to help?   I'm just trying to get by lol we're still slammed at work but we've been fortunate enough to get some time off.
Rest up!!! You deserve a nice break!!
😳😱 omg I’m so sorry..
You deserved a Lowkey day!! I hope you are feeling better and taking care of your beautiful self!
I have four kids, I definitely know the feeling. But hopefully when he's grown you'll both look back and cherish that time together ❤️
Yay, that’s awesome! Such relief for you both I’m sure. 😁
Aww yeah! That sounds good to me. I play Apex Legends and Rocket League on occasion too, so those could be fun 3-player games.
Okay sweet! I just sent you a request (same name as my username here :)
I appreciated your kind words last night.
Yeah lol doesn't matter if they were up late, they're up at 6am EVERY. DAY.
Oh I toss and turn all night too. I'm hooked up to my medical pump all night and the noise of the pump wakes me too. My family thinks I'm sleeping for 8+ hours but with all the waking up it's not a good sleep.  It's rough having random sleep times
Yay!!!
I’m hanging out with my boyfriend on Saturday but otherwise no! Which is just the way I like it lol! What about you?!
Take care of your healthy your employer will understand!! Cant have you there if you are sick anyway!!
I totally understand! It’s very rare we get out on time too! I am supposed to work 4 10 hour shifts but I usually work 4 12-14 hour shifts lol
This is feeding time! This is only half of them. The others are on the other side of the tank. 💖  https://www.dropbox.com/s/ug2koidk9ibr5u8/20201221_142434%20%281%29.jpg?dl=0
Oh seriously! I'm still kicking myself for not getting a small foam roller for $10 at Aldi. We have one, but it's HUGE! Like, as in long. I don't need one that big (I don't think) so I thought about getting the smaller one and donating the big one. Oh well. Maybe I'll find out that the big one's better for me haha!
45ish min drive each way, but I always give myself an extra 15... just in case. I would take a $2/hr cut to not  have to drive.
I get updates on all the pets. Even the roomba lol
How dare they attack his precious roomba 😂😂😂😂😂
I get to have the weirdest conversations at self checkout lol
People also really love those little moss balls that live in water in that group. But it’s wholesome and keeps all the negative stuff off out of view. All I see is cats and that group lol
Thank you! I just feel lucky we are able to right now, it sucked during the lockdown, I missed her SO much. Are you able to visit people where you are?
Not late at night when the lights are off.
Oh no that’s awful :(
Still going after a nap?  That is some strong stuff.
So my primary doctor back in like February 2020 said I was having muscle spasms in my lower back and prescribed me muscle relaxers and recommended PT. I was adjusting to carrying my daughter who was born in October 2019 and my back was just freaking out basically.   I had a physical therapy appointment but then the COVID pandemic happened and it was cancelled and never rescheduled. I’ve just had a lot of people recommend CBD cream to me to help relax the muscles! I don’t take the muscle relaxers because they make me super sleepy, especially when mixed with some of my other meds, so I wanted to try something topical.
Thank you 😍💙
It's worth the trade off, I think 😭
❤️❤️❤️ I definitely stopped spiraling so that’s a plus!! Today was a pretty decent day over all 😊 getting through tmw is going to be the tricky part. I may really need to call on you guys for some serious support, comedy, and friendship!!
I am sure we will!
Definitely!
Omg right!! Kids are WILD
That absolutely stinks. <3
aww that's so sweet, you deserve it! 💗🌸 hope that you guys have fun! 💭 hmm mostly some weekend studying and cleaning, and hopefully some more candy making! 🍬
Exactly! I hope they do!!
That is so cool!
Hmmm. I use one as my foot stool at my desk. 😂
Probably save it in gas anyways haha
😂🤣😅 bad kitties
Helps to spice up the day a bit :-)
Interesting!  I like it!  I don't use FB much anymore, but I did follow loads of meme pages.
Sadly all my besties live in other states and I don’t have any friends here on post.
😂😂 True. I think I am just more adjusted to it.
I deal cos I refuse narcotics
I think it’s because they got it from a dispensary? I think they mentioned those are stronger but I also never smoke anything or medicate so take it with a grain of salt lol.
I think every weekend should be at least a full 3 day wknd. Like Fri-Sun or Sat-Mon!
Call on me anytime!! I’ll always answer as soon as I can!! ❤️❤️ we love ya!!
Candy making???? Explain!
Omg!!! I need a foot stool at my desk!! Dang it!! That would have been perfect! ...poop.
Exactly!
It really does. Some guy stole some wings today right in front of me and I’m like eh bye then. Just wild.   Not to say I didn’t try to stop him. He scanned them then walked over to his friends machine and I’m like hey man you didn’t pay yet. Then he said nvm forgot my wallet. So I said well where are the wings... in his hand as he’s walking out the door. Cool hope he was hungry and not just taking shit to take it.
Yeah. I got tired of negativity and people arguing. So now I follow a bunch of cat groups, memes, and roombas 😂😂
Aww, that sucks! Distance friendship can be so difficult. You can always hit me up on here, I'm always looking for new friends :)
What year is it is a great thing to ask whilst asleep though lol
Awww
They are. I recently took a trip to Colorado and hit a nice dispensary. Definitely stronger
They really should be :-( Unfortunately life isn't fair
You know I will!! Love you guys right back and with more gusto!!! Lol
ooh there is sweet called tanghulu and it is super fun to make~! 🌸 all you need is some fruit, skewers, sugar, honey, and water~! 🍓 it is pretty much fruit covered in a coat of caramel and it is super good and looks beautiful and aesthetically pleasing~! 🍬 this [recipe](https://youtu.be/JrkR68iRjfU) is just.. *chef's kiss* amazing~! 💗
😂 I don't know how on earth it got into that position that I started using it, but it's amazing. I have short legs!
Yeah, thieves are definitely something I don't miss about working retail. People would load up shopping carts and then bolt through our emergency exit because it was in the back of the store and easy to escape through
Yeah, I don't blame you!! :)
Ty
Right?! You would think companies would know happy employees = loyalty and hard work, but maybe I’m wrong lol there’s always the ones who ruin it for the rest of us I suppose lol I’m glad you have a 4 day wknd!!! Really sad to hear about your 1 day wknd.. mind if I ask what you do?
Ohm sounds amazing!! Enjoy!!
Me too! I have a super long torso! So I can never find highrise pants that fit because if they sit right on the hips, they're too long on the legs! And if they fit right on the legs (usually petites), then they cut me off at a wrong spot on my torso! And mini or mini-ish skirts don't fit right either. When I have them sit on my waist, because my torso is so long, they're now too short!! Ughhh. Haha! One day I'll figure it out! I want to wear a cute crop top dang it!!!
We have people do it at self checkout when it’s busy. And it’s right by the door. Ring up a shit ton then walk out. Hasn’t Happened to me yet. Just 8 bucks worth of wings. Which man,  if you hungry I’ll buy your damn wings.
I guess the mentality is everyone is replaceable 👀 I'm a center manager at a wellness and recovery center supporting those with a mental health or substance use diagnosis
I UNDERSTAND! And trying to find shirts that go past your pants, or even halfway down your butt is almost impossible.
Right?! Like you said, I hope he actually needed them
Ooohhhh nice!! I used to be a senior counselor at one of those places!! Treating dual Dx along w the occasional substance abuse problem, too! But mine was w adolescents. I really wanted to be the program coordinator or center manager!!! Ugh so badly lol but I didn’t stay long enough.
Omg seriously!!! Hahaha! 😂 One piece bathing suits are the hardest to find!!
Like give me 15 mins till I’m on break and i got you. Granted not everyone is like that so I can see how someone would go to that extreme.  Though we get in trouble for that stuff, I didn’t this time bc it wasn’t my fault and I did catch it I’m just not allowed to pursue, but if it happens often enough one could lose their job over it.    just speak up, I’m covered in tattoos with blue hair. If that doesn’t scream bleeding heart liberal millennial who would help, idk what does😂😂
Aww sorry that didn't work out for you! What do you do now?
YES!
Some people assume that they won't get help too, or get into the mindset of not wanting to ask for help, I guess. You rock for being a helper, though 💙
No don’t be sorry! I’m glad I left actually! It wasn’t for me and it was actually my first job after undergrad!   Sigh, I don’t do jack shit. It’s depressing. SUPER depressing. So hard to find a job/career now a days especially with Covid and our economy tanking!!
I hate asking for help so I definitely get it. I could have Hollered to my manager who was right there but I waited till they were way out the door then brought it to his attention as I cleared the machine. Best I could do for him. I see him again though and they pull that, We’re going to have some words.
Oh well then I recant my sorry 😂 I'm lucky that I had the chance to be in this position considering I don't have a degree  Oh no :-( Yeah, it's a difficult time right now...I hope you're able to find something soon and that it's a job you enjoy!
It seriously sucks that you can get fired for people stealing. The job is totally not worth the risk of confrontation sometimes...some people will do stupid things because they're already putting themselves in a risky situation
That’s awesome!! 👏👏👏👏!!!! Get it guuuuuuurl!!!!! Yea!!!! More power to ya!!!   Sigh, I hope I find something soon, too. Everyone says I’m not in the position to be picky but I disagree. Why work somewhere I’ll be miserable just to work while “looking for other opportunities”. I’m the type that can only handle work in a day! Lol I come home and want to relax before going to bed but need to make breakfast and lunch for the next day, pick out my outfit, etc etc.. so I already know if I work somewhere there will be no more searching lol I guess there’s always the wknds but I imagine those days would be for errands? Life can be so freaking busy, huh!
I can see their standpoint if it’s a consistent thing like you’re actively letting it happen. They usually don’t fuss if it happens once or twice.   One lady cried the other day bc someone walked out with 300 worth of stuff and she thought she was going to get fired. The store manager was like it’s fine, you’re fine. Then openly admitted that someone should have given her the PDA so she could see what people were ringing up. She was never given that bit of training. And if you see someone ringing up a bunch of high dollar stuff to keep your eyes open
Exactly..never settle for a job that's going to decrease your life satisfaction. It's really not worth it unless you're struggling to make ends meet and just need any job you can get
Aww I'm glad she didn't get fired. And for sure, there's definitely items that people target more than others. When I still worked retail, brisket was a hot theft item at our store and was like $80. We ended up just putting a sign that said yeah we're keeping these in the back and ringing them up immediately if you want one lol
Our big one is Ox tail. Shit is expensive.
👀 I don't think I've ever seen ox tail in a store tbh
It’s so good! And I hadn’t either until I started at this place. I always had to go to the Asian market to get it.
Do you just use it to flavor like soups and stuff or can you actually eat it? What does it taste like?
There’s meat on it. But also the marrow is banging. I’ve only had it stewed. My friend from Jamaica makes it and I have no idea what they put it in but it’s similar to beef. Also I know marrow sounds gross but it’s pretty good once you get passed what it actually is 😂
Ohh, not sure if I'd be willing to try it...I'm a wimp when it comes to trying "unusual" foods 😅
I understand that. But if you’re ever in a situation to try it, Take a tiny nibble. Definitely worth the risk lol.
Only because you asked nicely 😳

I know... I have tiny feet. I had grabbed these for a friend's 10yr old... and she has much bigger feet than I do... and I don't wear pink. 🤣
Good luck. I would try eBay. They are last year's model (how I ended up with them was an inventory clearout).
Good luck! My feet are huge I could only fit into 6.5 when I was like 12 😆
😝
Those look so comfy!! How cute!!
Ok I’ll do that! Thanks for the tip :)
Thank you lol!
They are so comfy!! I love them and wear them past Christmas because, they are so cozy!
NP. 🥰 I've done it a few times to find old models when I found shoes I really loved.
Heck, I would, too!! I think I might try to find me a pair...haven't had new slippers in awhile!
Yes! They are Toms in case you want to see if they still have them. Bought them last year though
I saw that in the pic...already on Amazon lookin' 'em up!! They've got some really cute shoes! Never heard of them before...love 'em!
O.O I love Toms! They donate a pari of shoes for every pair purchased!
OMG, seriously? That's wonderful!! Now I definitely need to buy some Toms!
Yep! I think they changed a bit because of COVID but you can check it out on their webpage here! https://www.toms.com/us/impact.html

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kxedm8/intro_nobody_can_pronounce_my_name/
Hello, my name is Kellan. It has too L's so its Kel-Lan. I dunno why, but many think its Key-Lan. Lol  I'm really into gaming, cartoons, and anime. I enjoy just kicking back and relaxing. I have an awesome 2 year old son! I love chatting and debating with others online and making friends. One of my guilty pleasures is that I like to collect robot action figures, mainly Transformers. My son seems to like my hobby too lol!  My question for everyone: Do you have a name that gets mispronounced or assumed as something else? (For Example, Kate, but everyone thinks its Kaitlyn)
Welcome! People also mispronounce my name. It is spelled M I K E but people always say it as "Hey Guy Don't Do That". I guess it's a language thing.
Welcome Kellan! My name is Jenny, but everyone thinks my name is Jennifer. It's cool that you collect robot action figures. Do you have any rare ones?
I have an uncommon name that is very similar to a couple VERY common names.  When people first see mine written out they always call me the common names because they don't see the extra letters or something?!?!? People are silly.  Welcome!!!
Hey and welcome! I have a relatively common name, but my son’s name is Kieran (keer-en) and he gets all kinds of things...Keenan, Kiernan, Kirran, Ky-ran...one of my uncles still calls him by the wrong name and my son is 11 years old.
I’m a Nina (nee-nah, it is pronounced this way in literally every culture on earth that uses it as a name), but I get ny-nah all the time. (Which is only used in some parts of the US, as far as I know.) Drives me nuts.   In the meantime....HI FELLOW NERD, I LOVE YOU
I used to have a Kellan that went to my high school and remember people used to say it wrong all the time too very unique name your only the second I have encountered  to have it 🙂
Hi Kellan, welcome to the sub! I had a friends whose son was named Kellan, so it seems weird to me that people would mispronounce your name.   Additionally, my little sister just had a baby 3 months ago, and she named her Keelyn (Key-Len). Kind of a cool comparison.   I bet your son does love your collection!   My name is Toni. I'm a woman, yet People still ask if it's short for Anthony, lol. And sometimes people call me Tawny (like the girl from Even Stevens). Showing my age, there 😆
Hi Kellan! Welcome! When I first read your name, I pronounced it like Kel-an in my head. Does that make sense? And is that right? Lol anyway, I hope I’m saying it right. 😋  So, my first name is Rose and every single time I tell someone that they ask, “like in Roseanne or Rosemary?” It is so frustrating because yes, my middle name is Mary, but once somebody finds that out they automatically think that Rose is short for Rosemary and they call me Rosemary, but it’s not! My first full name is Rose. So, me hearing “Rose Mary” is the equivalent of anyone else being called by their first and middle name all the time. Different type of thing but still so annoying lol rant over 🤣

Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
My birth name is nearly impossible for people who aren't from my country to pronounce because of the soft a. So I'm glad I have an wasy chosen name.  Also welcome!!
[deleted]
Welcome
Kellan doesn’t even seem like a hard name to me!  I’m Brenda. Sometimes I get Breanna, or Brenna. The funniest one I ever got was Renee (and I have no idea how)
Hello and welcome to the sub!
I do for sure! My name is Gerri and also I'm a female. Not sure why but most say it as Gary. I correct you once and then I'm over it I'll answer to whatever variation of it people say.
It’s rare someone spells my name right (sometimes with it written right in front of them) even though it’s the original spelling. It’s annoying. Welcome!!!
Like Kellan Lutz? I would have gotten it right! (I think!)  My name is Karen so pretty much everyone knows that name by now... Urgh.  But it's funny because I live in Canada and with my accent it seems to sound completely different to North Americans. When I introduce myself people thinking I'm saying "Kary" or "Kerry" one time my Starbucks order came out with "Harrid" on it...   My non-canadian friends live to screech my name in a high pitched over exaggerated American accent "KEEEERIN!"
[deleted]
I’m Katy - I get called Kathy so much. It’s crazy!!   Welcome to the group!!
I read your name correctly before seeing it explained. :-)  Say hi to Peter!
I'm Caitlin but for some odd reason get either Caitlan or Kaylin...
kellan is easy, i don't know why people have issues with it! but then again, there was one time in school where we had a substitute teacher who had no issue pronouncing the name bridgidania correctly but he somehow fucked up my name.... christina.
My name is Misty. I get called everything from Missy, Mitsy, to Christy, and everything in between. I’d assume it’s purely a phonetic thing if people didn’t read it wrong as well *flashbacks to substitute teachers doing roll call*  And of course welcome!!!!
Heya 😊 I would have gotten your name right! I'm a Deborah ( said like Debra) I had an auntie who used to pronounce it as De-BORah and she used to spell it Deborough 😕 my daughter is Sophie-Anne but so many people skip the Anne ... it's quite funny to watch a 7 year old give some tude when she tells them to use her full name ... Gives me hope that she won't let herself be walked over if that makes sense?            Where's the top place on your list to visit at some point in your life?
Hey welcome! I'm Stephen but constantly get Stefan. But I learned to live with it, what to do.
Hi Kellan! I think I would have pronounced it right :D My name is Chris so it's kind of hard to mess up.
My last name is Haubrich. I get a lot of variation. People ignore letters. They frequently add letters that aren’t there.
I would have pronounced it correctly.   I go by Jet.   I often get called (based on my full name): Janet, Jean, Jen.   I have also been called: Jeanine, Janice, Jenny, and my personal favorite misname - Becky.    Wanna take a stab at my actual name?
Welcome Kellan! I am also really into gaming, cartoons and anime!! Hell yeah! What's your top of each category? For gaming do you mean tabletop, video games, or both??? :D My roommate used to collect Transformer figures but just shifted gears into comic book characters. He kept a couple of his favorites though. He had a collection worth a few thousand that he sold off though!   My name is Kelsey and it doesn't get mispronounced TOO often but I've gotten called Chelsea a lot. One of my sister's is named Kassy and she gets that problem CONSTANTLY where they think her name is Kathy or they spell it Cassie or think it's short for Cassandra or all of that. Nope. Just Kassy.
Well, my name is roy (pronounced as ro-e), but for most peoples I talk to internationally I just introduce myself as roy.  It's much easier than trying to make them say my name like it's being pronounced in hebrew.
Ugh my name is always messed up. It's spelled Iva, and people assume it's EYEva. NO!  Welcome! What's your favorite game?
My last name gets mispronounced call the time. It is Feret, pronounced like the animal but everyone tries to make it french or phe ret.
Welcome! Is your name Irish or from Irish decent? Lovely name! No one thinks my name has an "h" at the end, it's more old school. 🙂 I also got double whammied on my last name. Problem is, its a common every day word but people think it cant possibly be "that simple" so it gets mispelt constantly! 🙂
Funny story, I know a Klynn. Pronounced like yours! I met him online so didnt know how to say it and didnt think of asking him. So i called for the first time ans asked for Klynn (like Glenn just with a K). The lady was like no "Klenn" here. I called back and went with a "Kay Lynn"? Lmao again nope. So I gave up and had him call me lol.
Welcome Kellan!!  My name is Elizabeth, but everyone automatically shortens it to Liz, which I have never called myself once and it catches on, making it hard to correct after a while.
My sister’s name is spelled with a C and YN and pronounced the same! Welcome!
My name is always misspelled and mispronounced. It is the proper latin spelling (Terra) not that other more common spelling (Tara) or the many variations (Tarah, Tarra, Terrah, etc).  Don't call me Tah-rah, Tee-rah, Terri (my aunt gets a pass on this cuz she has always called me terri-berri as a nickname), Tea-er-ah, or tear-raw.  We pronounce it the way it is said in Spanish (the double r) and most non spanish speakers can't get the sound right. My last name is also spanish and it gets mangled; it isn't super common but it's really famous/well known.
Yes...my name is Kirsten (pronounced Kur-stin) and I always get Kristin or Kiersten.  My mom would always correct people growing up. But it doesn't really bother me. I figure if its someone random mispronounces it (coffee shop, random work call etc) I dont bother correcting them because it just takes more time
Hi! Welcome! What's your favourite fictional object?
Another member of the club. No one can do mine either. When I worked in a call center I got no less than 6 variations ON THE SAME CALL!
I jokingly pronounce Scorponok as Sporkonok when I'm talking to my boyfriend because it makes him laugh.
Haha! People always called me "Hey, stop that!"
I do actually! I used to have way more rare ones, but I started selling them when my son was born. I still hang onto a few rare ones either for nostalgia, or as a future emergency fund lol
People look for what's the most familiar to them I suppose
Oh wow, I definitely feel you there. I gave my son a common name (Zachary) and he still gets it spelled as Zack lol
Nina definitely seems like an easy name to say, but people are odd.   I RETURN YOUR LOVE FELLOW NERD :D
You never know, it could be the same one! Haha!
I remember the Even Stevens! It was my favorite sitcom as a kid. That's funny that you know the name both ways :)
Haha Text would definitely solve that at least. Its Kel-Lan, an L for each syllable :)
Aww thank you! I've had several dogs and cats in my life, but currently do not have any.  Hmmm favorite holiday is Halloween, though this is the first I didn't fully celebrate it.  My favorite part of nature is definitely the animals and creatures in it, especially sea life!
Thank you! I'm probably guilty in that department too lol
Its the same general idea. Its the same as someone giving you a nickname that isn't part of your name.
Thanks!
That's definitely an odd misunderstanding. Like you have a D in your name. Maybe that just start pronouncing it before they even finish reading it.
Thank you!
Me too. I got used to responding to Key-Lan
That is definitely odd. I've seen even common names get misspelled.
Haha accents are like that, especially if one someone is unfamiliar. That happens to my name too, especially when I was younger with a squeaky voice.
My brother is the same as Joey. His name is Jamie, but everyone assumes its James, when it isn't lol
Thank you!
Awesome, thank you!
How do they miss the "T"?
Just... how??
OMG Subs were always a fun day for odd or unique names...
Haha My 2 year old is already showing his tude, and I'm glad!  I would love to visit Japan, all of it, not just Tokyo
I can see why that happens at least. I've learned to live with it too
I bet someone would ask if its Christopher. I've seen that happen
I definitely get missing letters
Becky?? What??  Also, is your name Dutch?
I haven't done a lot of TableTop gaming, but I really want to get into it! My favorite game is a hard choice, but I'll say Kingdom Hearts II is in my top 3.  For Anime its FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood!  For cartoons, Transformers Prime
I usually just let people call me Keylan if its just for a short conversation.
Hmmm favorite game is always hard to pick. Kingdom Hearts II is definitely up there though!
I usually try to go for the obvious pronunciation or ask how its pronounced.
Haha so you have the reverse! My last name is Cashman, as in Cash-Man, exactly as it looks. But people do the same to me where they overthink it.
Huh. It kind of makes sense, but I understand why his would get mispronounced.
Awww that's so odd. I have never assumed a nickname for someone. I usually ask "Do you mind if I call you ..."
no way i'm the only that taught about this  [krirsten how i met your mother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgK4XRmG6QY)
That's cool! What's the rarest one you've ever had?
Exactly!
Hmmm 🤔
Yeah I think people tend to read the first half then assume the rest. I can’t think of any other explanation lol
It’s annoying. Like, respect me enough to make it a point to spell it right. But whatever. Lol.
Yeah I have a very subtle Irish accent, nobody thinks I'm from afar straight away. So I guess the way I say my name is a bit jarring because it's definitely an Irish pronunciation.  As a side note I have SO many Irish friends with actual Irish names that regret ever leaving our little island because nobody can ever comprehend their names. A lot of them generally go for an anglo-phone spelling of their name if they are in customer facing work etc.  Aoife, Niamh, Caoimhe, Deirbhile, Sadhbh, Aisling, Ciara are all pretty common girls names back home, but completely alien elsewhere.  Oisín, Ciarán, and Caoimhín and are only guys names I can think of that might struggle, unless they go by the Irish versions of Michael (Míchael) and Thomas (Tomás) which kinda just stress different vowels. Seán and Seamus are fairly well known so don't have as hard a time.
I knew a Jessie in high school. I think he had the same problem!
That's what I want to know!
Ha! Good point
Bahaha. Yep. Becky. And the kicker is, this was at work, where my nametag was literally at my cubicle wall st eye level.   The person who called me Becky also called me Janine. Ap, there's that, too.
I love Kingdom Hearts. In my list of favorites too for sure. Birth by Sleep is probably my favorite KH game. My other favorites are Crash Bandicoot 2, Pokemon, and Binding of Isaac Rebirth.   Tabletop gaming is great. Regular board games and d&d and other rpgs are all so much fun. I reaaaaaallly miss getting together with people to play. Didn't happen much this year because obviously.   My all time favorite anime is Trigun. FMA: Brotherhood is amazing as well! That's probably my 3rd favorite after Cowboy Bebop. And while we're at it, #4 and #5 I'd say go to Mushi-Shi and Assassination Classroom.  Oh and for cartoons my two all time ultimate favorites are Animaniacs and Steven Universe.
Ok Ca-shhha-man 😀😀
Like Flynn :)) i dont know its a name I never heard before meeting him
Hmmm that's hard to pick. The ones I've had aren't so much rare themselves, but the fact I had all their pieces still was what made them rare. It was mainly figures from toylines that nobody wanted at the time, but then years later, it had gained a fanbase who were now seeking out the old toys.
That's really cool!
Thanks! I've always been shy about it sharing it

Hello friends! I'm Sammie, I'm 22 and just graduated from college in December with a theatre arts degree (woo!).  Like the title says, I play D&D and have been missing it big time since the pandemic. :( but I'm excited to get some prep done to hold some sessions when I'm not working!  I also love music, crochet, and video games. Panic! At the Disco, dodie, and Cavetown are some of my favorite artists & I'm currently playing through BioShock on my PS4.  A hobby of mine (other than D&D) is modding/customizing controllers to replace buttons and swap shells. I've done some Xbox One controllers to use for my PC, and three sets of Joy-Cons for my Switch! Eventually I'll probably customize my DS4's and one day I'd like to cast my own buttons and shells for myself and others to use!  Fun fact: I love bullet journals but I am horrible at keeping/using them. 😅

Yesss P!ATD!!!!! I've always wanted to play D&D!      Welcome! It's so nice to meet you!
Welcome! You should try roll20 in case you still don't feel like meeting face to face for a campaign.  On that note, what is your last character you played?
Welcome! What are bullet journals?
I saw in another comment you usually DM, do you do pre-written campaigns or home brew? What’s been your favorite campaign that you’ve DM’ed for?
Me and my friends are playing Pokémon dnd and its so fun!
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁 Congratulations on your graduates in my friend   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help.

Hi and welcome!
Hi and welcome! If you had six cats what would you name them?
Welcome back!!  I miss D&D soooooo freaking much. I just can't focus with online d&d. I can do online board games just fine but not a several hours long rpg session. Plus I need to roll my dice!!!!!!!!!  Oooh have any pics of your controller mods? That sounds super cool! What do you use to make them? Nerdy crafts are the best! I make dice sets for d&d! :)
Welcome back
Welcome back!  I love to game on my PS4 and Switch! Bioshock is such a fun trilogy.
Hi! Welcome! Who is your favourite fictional character?
I'm a new D&D player! I'm in a group that does virtual sessions right now. It's super fun. Tell me about your favorite character?  What's your favorite customization you've done?  Also, tell me a little bit about bullet journals?? Do you buy them with the pages already organized or do you make them yourself? Why do you use them/ what are they helpful with?  Welcome to the sub!
Hi! Thank you so much!
It's a lot of fun! Discord + roll20 are super nice tools for playing online!  Yesss Patd! I wish i couldve gone to one of their concerts 😭
I usually use Discord -- I run a D&D community server 😊 I don't mind R20 but it's not my favorite either.  I usually DM! But I think the last character I played was a drow rogue who had a secret identity that she used as her primary identity.
They're basically custom planners/trackers in a notebook! I've never been good with planners especially as a kid so I really struggle with it 😅
I've done a mix of both but definitely more pre-written as I often have to whip up something quick.  I'd say my favorite has been some 3rd party one-shot modules I've run. The main one was Diamond Heist, but I think that's because my friends' characters were based on Archer characters.
Pokemon dnd sounds interesting! I saw some rulesets floating around for it some time ago. Are you guys playing using an already-written ruleset or is it homebrewed?
Happy new year to you too! Thank you 😊  My favorite holiday is Halloween. I love the creepy things and fall weather. The smells of fall is one of my favorite things about nature.  I have a cat, Crystal, and a dog, Hercules! And my brother is special needs. Thank you for your work. I know I couldn't do it for anyone but my brother, simply because I know I'm not cut out for it.
Hey thank you so much man!
Well I have one now, her name is Crystal. But... hmm... (in no particular order)  1. Ellie  2. Tom/Tommy  3. Penny  4. Jack  5. Sterling Archer  6. Pam  Finding six is tough! Most of these are also references to pop culture I like, now that I'm reading it back 😂 I could see naming a dog any of these too!  What about you?
I totally get that! I am very very jealous that you make dice sets for D&D! A friend of mine got a bunch of equipment during our seasonal job this summer & gave me some D20's she made, it was so sweet!  I do! [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/Dw0B8U7) a link to what pictures I have on my phone. I painted the Wii controller (did the console too but no pictures) as a Christmas gift, and the "atomic watermelon" is only partially complete in the picture but I did finish those. I have a couple more in the works and another one done that I still need to take pics of!
Thank you!
I'm super excited to jump into it! I'm partway through the first one, though I have no idea how long it actually is 😂 honestly my ps4 was my best purchase this summer
Ooo thats a tough one! Probably Ellie Williams though. Who's yours?
Welcome to D&D! I don't necessarily have a favorite character but my favorite classes are druids and rogues!  I think my favorite customization so far has got to be the Wii & Wii remote I did for my brother's christmas present.  They're basically just planners you can customize; so you usually wouldn't purchase them with already-organized pages. I try to use them but I'm horrible with planners -- thus, I don't really use them. :/  Thanks!
Oooooh I'll check them out!!  Omg I know! Me too!
We talk on discord too, but how do you actually run the game? Like, how you shoe your players the map and have them move their characters? Rolling is obvious, just wondering
That’s awesome! Have you run waterdeep: dragon heist?
Oh it’s already made! [Pokémon dnd ](https://www.pokemon5e.com) here is the link! They have character sheets, player handbooks, an app to keep track of Pokémon.
Hello there how does your dog in your cat get along?
I change this every time someone asks, but Mr. Meowgi, Bathsheba, Shiva, Batman, Cleocatra, and Pink
Oooh those xbox controllers look awesome!   Dice I would say are pretty easy to make but pretty hard to master. It's a bit spendy to start mostly because a lot of stuff needs to be bought in bulk and the molds are costly. There's some molds on Wish that people have used to learn on but they are ripoff's of Dispel's dice and not that great... [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/TzHgWPU) a [bunch](https://imgur.com/a/Ue9z4T9) of my [dice](https://imgur.com/a/DWVexdk). My most recent and best [work](https://media2.giphy.com/media/DDMkb8qO0xx4IVXjBF/giphy.gif) is one of those swirly glittery ones with the liquid core!
Rogue!
When I can run games (I typically was doing one-shots as my schedule was never really conducive to a proper weekly/biweekly game) I usually stick with theatre of the mind. I've done some with roll20 but I found it slowed my combat down even more than usual. I have used GIMP with a map to represent structures and where players are in relation to things. I just don't care for r20 as much as it feels really clunky to me.  I'm not an experienced DM by any means, I am still learning but have the basics down.
I havent run Waterdeep but I briefly played in a campaign of it! That campaign fell apart sadly :(
Oh, sweet! Thank you!
They get along alright! My cat is older but isn't violent at all. The dog is younger, just out of puppy stage & just likes to love everybody. But he's so much bigger it looks like he's gonna eat her when he licks her 😂 but they arent around each other much otherwise
Haha the pun names are everything! I love them
Ooo the liquid core are pretty! I love the pumpkin orange ones too 😍  Yeah! I have two more to complete my four-player set for my PC, just waiting on a controller & a pair of thumbsticks! All of the xbox controllers have aluminum thumbsticks (or they will).
Oh man, did it fall apart due to the campaign itself or outside stuff?
You’re welcome! We’ve had a lot of fun and somehow formed a cult around a gibble named gibby.
This was so sweet
Kinda both I think? It was a while ago so I don't remember anymore
Ahhhh okay
Yeah. But I loved Waterdeep. Actually, I think that's the campaign I played the rogue in!
oooooh nice! I want to run a Waterdeep campaign but I've never DM'ed a campaign before so I'm nervous
Thats okay! I totally understand, it looks stressful but dont forget you need to have fun too :)
That's very true! That's definitely something I need to remember

Hi, Everyone!  &#x200B;  I've been lurking for quite a while now and have finally gotten up the courage to do an intro. So, yay!  &#x200B;  My number 1 favorite thing in the world is cats. I have 2 that I adopted as kittens. They were found inside a wall in an abandoned building and were born blind, but you'd never know it aside from their cloudy eyes.  &#x200B;  I identify as queer, but my pronouns are she/her. My favorite band is Rush. My favorite food is pizza. I love plants, though I'm not too good at keeping them watered and alive. I used to have a raised bed garden a few years ago that I built and I miss it dearly, but now that I live in an apartment, I have to settle for a container garden.  &#x200B;  I'm not sure what else to say! I'm not very good at talking about myself. Does anyone out there have any questions for me?  &#x200B;  My question to you would be, what's your favorite gift you've ever received? Favorite gift ever given?  &#x200B;  Thanks for saying hi! I love this community and am glad to be a part of it!
hello and welcome to the family!!! omg, i love cats so much it's disgusting and i love rush!! what's your favorite rush song?
Welcome
Hello! What made your choose this username? :)
Hi there! I also forget to water my plants!  I find that writing down a reminder on my calendar and setting an alarm on my phone just doesn't work either. Summing up, I have one fake plant that's thriving. What did you grow in your garden?   Favorite gift received: hot mustard packets from Mcdonalds! I live in IL and the McDonalds here discontinued that sauce in like 2012 so I've been craving it for 8 years until my best friend had her family in Texas get me some. Truly the most thoughtful gift ever. <3  &#x200B;  Favorite gift given: "the grillfather" apron to my dad, he loved it and laughed for hours <3
Welcome! What do you like on your pizza?
Hello! Cats make the world go round!
Hello and welcome!!!
Hi there! Welcome to the sub :D I hope you'll enjoy it here but let me know if you have any questions, happy to help. What's your favorite type of pizza?   It's so hard to pick my favorite gifts!
Hi, welcome!  Cats are amazing. I have 3 myself. Im glad you were able to be there to rescue and love them!  My favorite gift I recieved is a ring I picked out lol. Its a tiny dainty skull with a rose on each side. I found it on Etsy. Its gorgeous and such a perfect size. It replaced all my other rings lol.
Thought you were my son until I read your pronouns! 😋 He has pretty much all your interests, down to the cats and plants. My favorite gift is my son, from my husband.  What's your favorite plant?

Yay! Let’s be friends! My favorite is either Spirit of Radio or Cygnus X1 part 1
Thank you!!
It’s a shoutout to my Dad :)
I love your answers! My favorite McDonald's sauce is the buffalo. I like to dip my fries in it. Don't think I've ever had the hot mustard.  I grew a few things: tomatoes, rosemary, dill, sage, strawberries, eggplant, marigolds, and lavender  :)
Pretty much anything. Just depends what I’m in the mood for. I’ve been on a Mellow Mushroom Great White kick lately.
They really do! Thank you!
Thank you so much!
Thank you so much! My favorite right now is the Great White at Mellow Mushroom.
Thank you! I wish I could adopt all the cats! That sounds like a lovely gift indeed!
That’s a great gift! My favorite plant would have to be any herb.
yessss, i shall be your new friend!! :) i am very, very partial to red barchetta and roll the bones.
That's so sweet!
Yumm! I love buffalo sauce but I don't think I've ever had it from mcdicks! New goal for today and an excuse to get mcd- sweeeet!   Wow, what a great variety! Did you make any delicious dishes with your crops?
Hm never heard of it!
Yay for Mickey D's!  I did! I made plenty of tomato sandwiches, and a bocconcini (sp?) with the eggplant and tomatoes.
Yay indeed man I’m so excited! And ooo I have never heard of that? Could you elaborate? Sounds delicious
Bocconcini is grilled eggplant, fresh basil, and fresh mozzarella drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Delicious!

I always want to go to bed around 9:30 but that never happens it's usually closer to 10:30. Than I have to be up at 5 for work.
Ummmm... the older I get the earlier 😂 10-11ish these days. Sigh.
When I would like to go to bed/try: 10pm  When I actually go to bed: around 12:30 - 1am
usually around 6 am, I work night shifts!
what time i lay down and what time i fall asleep are two totally different questions with very different answers lol
Around 9 pm mostly except when it's a movie night or a party. Then I don't sleep at all, lol.
I'm an old fart (28..) so I can barely stay up past 10. Usually I'm in bed by 9 hahahaha
Midnight, sometimes later. It’s a problem :/
According to the best of 2020 I don’t.
ooof it really varies. If I've done a lot that day, I can knock out by 10/11 pm. But sometimes, I fall asleep as late as 1/2 am :')
Usually between 1-2 if I'm reading I've been known to get sucked into the just one more chapter trap and have gone to bed at 4 😬
Usually around 1:00am! I spend most of my evenings watching movies until late.
It varies. I have Non 24, so my sleep-wake times shift forwards perpetually. Currently I'm going to bed in the morning and waking up late afternoon.
Lately 2am, but I’m trying to sleep earlier
I sleep early at around 8:00 pm every night then I wake up at 6 am would like to sleep till 12 pm but unfortunately can’t do that
I sleep around 9 or 9:30 and wake up around 5 or 5:30. I love to be up before the sunrise.
1 am if I'm lucky. Then I unfortunately always wake up around 5am.
around 11pm, but on unlucky days it would be 3am or even later eeep! 🌸
Depends when I'm tired! Usually, like 11, but I will go to bed before that if I feel the need to.
Typically 6:30-7:30pm. It’s sounds silly but I have to wake up at 1:00am so that’s my limit lol
My *goal* is always 11, but it’s usually 1 or 2.  Last night was 3.
3 or 4am because I can never sleep. 🤦🏼‍♀️
Usually past 3 am. I know it’s really unhealthy, but...
Hubs goes to bed between 9 - 11, depending.   Tiny Ruler is up til at least 1.   I enjoy a little quiet time after they are asleep. "Last night" I was still awake when Hubs' alarm went off for work. So... sometime shortly after 530am?   I'm sure tonight will be earlier, as I was up by 9am.
On work days, around 9 AM. Otherwise, maybe 11 PM. If I'm at home, about 9 pm. My schedule is messed up.
No usual times. Might be 10pm, might be 4am or even 8am if I work a night shift. Currently it's 1:47am and I think I'll call it a day 😅
3 am
Just depends - if I work early, or late, if I’m off the next day or if I have “shenanigans” with the boyfriend. Anywhere from 9-10p to 2-3a.
Usually around 2a. I’m better at night.
11-1 lately.   I used to be out by 10 but the last few months I’ve been up later.
I'd say it averages to about 9:30. Otherwise there's no way I'd be able to get up at 5    # 😩
between 9-10 on work nights, no later than 11 on weekends.
8 am the nightshifter! Lol!!
I’m in bed around 10ish but usually fall asleep on the couch first in the 9:00 hour
I usually fall asleep on the couch around 7:30p and then wake up and actually go to bed around 9. I have to wake up at 3am for work 😭
Usually around midnight. But I toss and turn alll night long. When my husband goes to work at 6am, I can finally get a few hours of sleep. I guess Im just a bed hog
Usually between 9 and 10 EST. We get up at 5, so it's usually a relatively early night.
Usually between 9:30pm and 10:30pm. But, on trivia nights, I'm usually up until past midnight.
10pm-1 am depending on the day ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
10:30 pm - 11:30 pm. The earlier the better, but doesn't always work out.
Lately I've been going to bed around 1am. I like to have kid free time so I end up staying up too late 🤷🏻‍♀️
11:30-12:30 usually. I used to be nocturnal, but I'm too tired from work now lol.
I work overnight so I usually go to sleep around 10 AM and wake up about 5 PM. Gives me time to enjoy the evening before work and I can relax for a bit when I get home.
Too late! Between 1-2 am and I get up at 8am 😂
6 a.m. lol
11-12pm
Usually 11-12 but sometimes I don't fall asleep until 1-2
Ahhhhhh hahahaaaa hahahaaaa Haha haaaaaa....   I try to sleep about six to eight hours before I have to be to work. However my work schedule is a crazy mix of having to be to work by five AM to working from eleven PM to nine AM, with occasional two PM shifts in the middle...   I haven't had a regular sleep schedule in years.
9 or 10 am
Depends. If I’m working not until 9am or 10am. And if it’s not a work night then I get my butt to bed at 11pm
I'm on a weird schedule rn. It varies from day to day.  Sometimes I go to bed at 8am. Sometimes 11am. Sometimes 1pm.  Annnd I usually wake up 7 hours later.
Well it’s 6:55am and I’m still up ://
Anywhere from 11pm to 2am
4am
Varies with insomnia but mostly my eyes get heavy at 10pm
3/4am! It's because I spend time with my fiancé on video call playing games because he's in America in a different time zone
I work swing shift so when on afternoons its about 2 am.  When I work days or off work, I'm in bed by 11pm.
9-10pm workdays but after 12 on weekend :)
Usually 8ish.  I get up at 4 everyday to get my hubby off to work. Make him breakfast and pack his lunch. We have coffee and watch the news before he leaves.
Nothing wrong with that. At least we are wide-awake the next day... apparently
When is your weekly off? Do you prefer sleeping on the day on your off days as well?
Oh ok. I lay down and within 15m I’m gone. Usually
Yeah I hear you! Some days I pass out while watching a show, others I can’t fall until 6 am. (I always get in bed the same time every night but insomnia doesn’t care).
9 is good. I find if I have too much sleep I feel bad the next day and have a bad head.
If you’re old god help me.  I go to bed any time around now (11pm UK) so like to post and wake up to read peoples messages.
Mate... feel for you
Wow 1 am that seems crazy is that because of your job?
And what time do you wake up
Shenanigans 😂
Do you think the pandemic has affected that. It definitely has with me as are usually get up at 6:30 but do not have to commute at the moment so I’m getting up a little later.
There seems a lot of people who have to get up at 5 am. I’m so glad I don’t have to do that. Although if I did I will probably just get used to it
It seems there are quite a lot of nightshifts on here. Who knew
I hope you have a blanket on your sofa day always make me want to fall asleep
3am?? Wow. Hats off to you. That reminds me of going to the airport when you are on holiday and you have to go up at silly o’clock and drive through the night
That seems quite sensible for getting up at 5 am. Are usually get up at 6:30 am for a working day when I have to commute so I tend to go to bed about 10:30 pm but since working at home and having no commute I’m going to bed a little later and waking up a little later
I feel I can stay up a lot later on a Friday and Saturday night psychologically even if I have to get up early. Having those weekend night seems to tell my brain I can stay up later
This I enjoy too. I put mine to bed at 915 and stay up a couple of hours on my own. I’ve even put the clocks forward to get them to bed earlier before now 😂
Sounds a plan and seems you’re getting a good sleep during those hours. What happens if you need to have an appointment somewhere? Does that mess you up a little?
Do you feel rested though
Shift worker?
Seems the average response
I can fall asleep quite quickly once I’m in bed. I want to stay awake a little but end of falling asleep
I just don’t know how you do it. I’m one that needs my 8 hours and couldn’t imagine a life where I had swapping shifts
That’s a good question. I’ve wondered this ... how quickly can the body adapt
So I work from home and the way my job works is that I don't really get a day off technically. I got Sunday mostly off to myself. But I also get plenty of hours in between like for example I only work from like 4:30 until 7 and then I work again from like 12:30 a.m. to 4 AM. So I get plenty of me time.
Wow the dream! It usually take me anywhere from 45 mins to 4 hours to actually fall asleep! It stinks!
I feel old! Hahaha
Yes :)
Yes the awesome sauce ones :)
I do! That’s might be why I always fall asleep haha
I wish I was going to the airport instead 😂
Not too much. I just adjust it a little to make sure I still get about 6-7 hours of sleep
Not Really 😂
Night shift, yeah haha
Years of gaming has already abused my sleep schedule. I honestly don't know what I would do if I were to get eight hours of sleep on a regular basis.
Unfortunately the problem is that my body adapts way too well to sleeping late. I've always been a night owl so this is fine for me but I've always struggled with having day jobs and getting up at reasonable hours it's just very difficult for me.

Ooooh my friend got me these for my birthday last year! Best surprise! I can't eat noodles without feeling like a Jedi now!
u/Bt112506 Since I can't use the Force to levitate things, these will be used for many future meals! Thank you so much!

Oh wow!! I love these!! Those would be so fun to eat with!
Those Are BITCHIN!!!
Okay I already thought they were cool before but they glow!!!! WOW
Hey! Those are really cool!! 🙂😎
Wellll these are cool af.
If I had those, if I couldn’t eat it with them, I wouldn’t be interested.
I'd somehow teach myself to use chopsticks if I had these 😅
they're so coool
Are these as cool as they look?? I’m always tempted
Very cool! I got a couple pairs of lightsaber chopsticks a few years back for Christmas that I think I still have, I should break those out again at some point!
I love your kitchen!
Those are amazing
Oh those are neeeeeat  &#x200B;  Also I love your kitchen tiles
Whoa!  Super awesome!!
Umm these are SO COOL!!!!
Whoa!!!  Now THOSE are AWESOME!!

They are so cool
oooh very nice!
Mini lightsabers.  Very cool
Awesome!!!!
These look sooo cool
Ooooo you could wear those in your hair!
You are very welcome, may the force be with you!!!
Speaking as someone who has similar chopsticks, they're pretty cool, but also kind of a pain cause obviously you have to be careful with how you wash them and stuff. Still they're definitely neat!

Confirmation number: 1915809842 for Etsy order 👀 😈  DC vs Marvel 🤔
So it's a war of DC vs Marvel between you and /u/Zeunicorn? I'm a big nerd and I have love for both. However, Marvel wins! DC has a few great characters with very few great movies. Marvel wins in both categories. Batman is awesome, but he can't carry a whole comic universe. I still love my banana bud! 🍌💚💚
u/Zeunicorn a war has been declared. And this one is fun because it can involve rainbows! 🌈   And potentially potstickers 🥟👀
This sounds like a fun war
I like this war. DC all the way!
DC hands down!
I can’t believe you just dissed Superman like that.
Thank you!! Glad to count you as one of my allies!
You’re on!!
u/Lucy_Leigh225 you are quite the warlord and we love you!
All of my wars are pretty fun, I think!   u/orcprincess32 🍌   u/JosephineIsMyHero ☕️ (there’s not a marshmallow emoji which is sad)
YES THANK YOU BATMAN IS THE BEST
We bonded over elephants only to part at comics! 😂😂
You better believe it! 😈
Because they haven't had a good Superman in a very long time. 😊
🧡🧡  I want warlord to be my nickname now.   This is the first war I’ve declared! You and u/orcprincess32 fired first lol
Oooh 3 wars?? That’s awesome.
Yup. Best comic storylines. Best games. Best movies (at least with Batman). Plus allll of the other good DC characters... You have chosen wisely.
Like we’ve got the whole JUSTICE LEAGUE. That’s so much better than the Avengers.
You want to attack somebody, attack Robert Pattinson as my man Bruce. Smh. I have a loathing for R. Patt. so I can’t even watch the movies 🦇
I’m a busy soldier
“Best movies”??? Excuse you??
Excuse you, the Avengers are way better than the Justice League 🙃
That hurt my soul to read...
I don't see him as either character as I consider Bruce Wayne and Batman as two distinct characters. I feel you and I'm sorry they did that to your fave.
Hey now, don't get me wrong, I love the MCU as much as anyone, and a lot of the modern DC movies are nothing special.   BUT  The Dark Knight trilogy, older Batman and Superman movies, and allll of the excellent animated movies out there tip the scales in DC's favor.
Thank you!!!
We saw him be a brooding rich boy type in Twilight! Edward Cullen is not Batman!
Batman, while awesome, can't carry a whole comic universe. Marvel simply does characters and movies better. DC has only a few, while Marvel has many. Those few movies you listed can not compare to what Marvel has done in the last 20 years. I loved Michael Keaton's Batman, but for every gem DC has, they have several more duds.   I haven't seen a DC vs Marvel debate in a long time. I appreciate your opinion. 😊💚
This we can agree on.
I really enjoy talking about this stuff, and love hearing your thoughts too! Well, since this may be a thing, I can expand on my opinion a bit more, and maybe it'll lead to some fun conversation 😊  If we're talking just live-action movies vs movies I'm in your camp - Marvel wins that hands down. As much as I love DC, Marvel has done something amazing on the movie front that I don't think I need to explain. We all know it and love it, and I respect them for it, particularly what they've done to make lesser known characters shine.   Outside of live-action movies, I really prefer DC. DC's animated movies are top notch (there's like over 60 in total and I think they are often overlooked), and their animated TV shows are not only more appealing to me but have been nominated for and won more Emmy's than anything Marvel has done. Batman TAS, Teen Titans, Justice League, Young Justice - even shorter lived shows like Batman Beyond and Static Shock gained a huge following.   When it comes to comics and characterization, DC's philosophy is both more appealing to me and I guess I think more valuable. Marvel's main ideology is to create very mortal and relatable characters and then give those characters powers. These characters are, in a way, reaching for Godhood while struggling with the flaws in their humanity. They are often darker, tragic, serious characters. Humanity is cruel and unforgiving (see X-Men) and the difficulty is in finding acceptance in a world that doesn't care for them.   DC's characters are primarily brighter and more idealistic than Marvel (likely a product of being created during WWII, when people were in desperate need of this). Their mainline heroes are meant to represent the innate goodness, spirit, and peace of humanity. Many of their characters are inherently closer to Godhood (or gods-come-to-earth) and are aspiring towards humanity. DC's heroes exemplar how great humanity can be when we work together towards a common goal and better future, and all of that just vibes well with me.   To top it off, I just love so many DC comic storylines, and haven't (yet) found the same love in Marvel's comics. I think DC has just been putting out better quality comics this last decade. Some of my favorite modern DC stuff include:  - Geoff Johns' Green Latern, Aquaman, and Shazam  - Scott Snyder's Batman, Swamp Thing, and Dark Knights Metal  - Both Greg Rucka's and Brian Azzarello's Wonder Woman  - Peter Tomasi's Superman and Super Sons  - Francis Manapul's The Flash  - Jeff Lemire's Animal Man and Green Arrow  - Tom Taylor's Injustice and DCeased  ...and so much other great stuff out there!   Ooph, that went on for way longer than I meant to. Anyways, some of my thoughts, but at the end of the day I support people enjoying whatever they enjoy more! Although u/Lucy_Leigh225, I'm happy to help out the cause 😄
Yes but also Aquaman... which kinda pulls the DC movies so far down it’s drowning...
Man!!! I was just going to reply that the Justice League is more than just Batman but this analysis hits the nail on the head better than I could have! Recent MCU movies are bomb (and the Spider-verse movie). Yes. Not denying that. But DC has Marvel beat in every other category of material. Also the DC live action shows are also well done.
A well thought out rebut. I wish I had more time to discuss this. I do have to add that since I am in a war with /u/Lucy_Leigh225 as well, I can not, in good conscience, side with her. Besides, I am just a die hard Marvel fan. Thanks for the nerd chat! 💚💚
How you gonna hate on [Topo the drumming octopus](https://youtu.be/A62djdsGW8A) though?? 😂
I’m just gonna say one thing “Aquaman” that’s it... now come and tell me DC had better movies 🤣
Yup yup, DC's built up a solid line-up of live-action shows. The Arrowverse stuff isn't exactly my cup of tea, but there's stuff from there I definitely enjoy and can respect.
The enemy of my enemy is my friend, banana bud!!!
I appreciate people who stands by their allegiances, and am interested in seeing where these wars might go. We'll nerd chat again some time 🤓
It’s just a natural talent I guess 🤣🤣
I’m not saying DC has better recent movies, except that the first Wonderwoman was amazing and made me happier than any other superhero movie has in a long time. I’m saying DC has better literally *everything else*
Preach
😉💚
NON 😈 I’ll give you better DC tv shows but that’s it 😁
Bro do you even read comics, cookie bud?
... nope... they’re too expensive for the limited reading time they provide 👀
Then how you gonna talk trash with that garbage take? 🗑
You can’t make me laugh like that when I’m teaching cookie bud 🤣🤣 (I’m not on Reddit while I teach, I just saw the notification). I was a late comer to Marvel (amongst other things 👀) and I never really got into the comics, I’ve read one in total (but it was a compilation of like 4 or 5)

Hello! I am sharkbait! I hope you all have been having  a lovely new year so far!  I’ve been lurking and commenting a bit for a while. Mostly about pet things and getting to know people. Covids been weird and lonely lol  My cats deff want to murder things more  Umm 🤔 interests? All the things? Now that I have so much time I go down rabbit holes of knowledge and just want to learn everything in the world from witchcraft, to rocks, to product photography, to the history of graphics to animations. But half the time I can’t get out of bed until 2 because sad.  So this place has been fun to see so many people keeping the spirit of gifts alive! I love giving presents for no reason! Me and my sister send each other stuff that don’t fit us or we can’t use anymore all the time. It’s fun to get surprised in the mail when you live in 2 diff states.  Look! A new bra and leggings! And a candle mum sent me for some reason now you can have it yay!   I hope this was an adequate intro.  Goodbye for now lovelies!

Hello and welcome
Welcome!!! I totally feel you about the knowledge rabbit holes haha. I do have a fair amount of books on witchcraft and paganism :3 What is your cat's name? I have three, and my parents have two at their house.
Welcome! Nice to meet you! I totally get not being able to get out of bed til 2 because sad. You're not alone there! This subreddit is such a happy place. Question, do you have a favorite mythological creature?
Hi and welcome to the sub!
hello and welcome to the family!! covid has been very depressing. :(
Shark bait ooh haha! Welcome.
Hello and welcome to the sub!
Hi! Welcome! What is your favourite fictional universe?
I love Halloween! Omg DONT get me stated on nature! I love the forests I used to have a big backyard full of trees and birds and grass and now I’m stuck in a apartment next to the highway. I used to be able to sit in the grass under the sh. And listen to the breeze. Or go to the pool and just sit underwater and hear nothing. I love being under water I feel so at peace in the water.   I love hiking and canoeing! I used to do an annual canoe trip with friends before I moved it was the best! And I love the desert too! Climbing mountains in the desert changes your life woah  How old is JJ? My childhood cats lived till they were 17,18 and 19! My new cats monster and gonzo are 3 and 2 now. Are your kittens super young?  I hope you have an awesome evening too!! My friend works with special needs! She love sit! I bet you love it too! Hugssss!!
Herrrrrro!!!
I have two cats Monster and Gonzo. They are rascals they have their own Instagram so my friends can cheer themselves up with their ridiculousness since I’m states away now.   Srsly gonzo just walks into an open room and squeaks for no reason every morning. Just because. Then walks out like nothing happened.
Hmm are you thinking Greek or just in general? Like Medusa? Or dragons? Bc I think those would be the two.
Thank youuu!
Yup! Thanks!
Hehe thanks!
Thanks!
Oh my goodness that's gotta be hard being in an apartment and not having the stuff that you're used to ugh. Mr. JJ is 4 years old. While you definitely treat your kitties good to have them live such a long happy lives.
I was thinking any of the above lol. Medusa and dragons equals all the yes. But, can you imagine medusa with dragons instead of snakes? Because that would be the best!
Oh nooo their wings would be hitting each other and poking each other’s eyeballs it would be a hot mess. Naw the snakes are great. Plus I’d rather just have a dragon to just chill with, and talk about the odds and ends of days. Like a big oaf of a dragooon
Oh, good point! Didn't think of that. lol. If I had a friend-dragon to chill with, I think I'd want him to be like Hagrid lol.

Hello 👋🏻
I do (so far) Thank You
Im currently playing Call of Duty a lot.
Thank You. I like it so far 😁
Thank you!
Thank you!
Im playing on pc :)
Thank you!
Hi ^^ Thank you!
Happy new year! I don’t have a favorite holiday 😄I love the fresh air outside and the green color 🌳
Thats good :) My favorite part I’ve decorated at home is my bedroom:)
My favorite games are Call of Duty, American Truck Simulator, Sims, Need for Speed  And my favorite way to relax is just to sleep
Sure
That’s awesome. I play pretty much all kinds of games.
Nice to hear. :)
At the moment its Call of Duty
Niceee which one?
Nice, me too!
Ah, I have the attention span of a teaspoon so I generally stick to very easy, low stakes games. Like Lego games!    Very bad at most games because I don't have the patience to sit and learn it and practice. I tend to button mash in games like Smash Bros or Tekin or Mortal Kombat...   I generally like games I can play locally with friends, like Mario Kart and stuff. I'm no good, so I just trash talk for daaaaaaaaays while coming last
The whole game? Wow! Lol
Black Ops 4
Thats nice ^^
I played every game you mentioned. I like Smash Bros but im too lazy to learn every button and the combos 😂
Mostly Black Ops 3
That one sounds cool is it the one with zombies?
That's exactly how I feel! And I can only play it on the switch as hand held, if I play it in the tv then I'm totally lost. I don't know why 😂
It is!
I smashed the buttons to make any attack and i broke the left stick on a joycon 😂
Ohhh I gonna see if I can pick that one up! I love zombies
Me too!

Thank you! They are hanging on in there until I’m able to get them redone

You are an alien from a galaxy far far away... you have been chosen to explain simple human things in a more *foreign* way. You are in charge of marketing earth as a planet to conquer! Your mission, if you accept it, is to comment down below and I will provide you with a human-related thing or concept. And then you must explain it in an alien way as if it's your first time seeing such a thing.  For instance, I will reply to your comment with "toothbrush" and you would say something like "This human item is inserted into their mouths! These primitive beings need to clean their teeth and have good breath, in an attempt to make themselves more acceptable".  I will also take part in it and leave a comment that you can reply to with items/concepts!  Be sure to interact with each other
Whatsit4?
Reply here with a concept or thing you'd like me to explain
Haha. I’m in!
This sounds fun!
well i am intrigued!!
Boop :)
I'll play!
Beer? Foamy and strange
What is this so called Netflix that brings humans to the brink of despair and procrastination?!
I'd like to play! 🙂
I’ll play!
This sounds like fun! 😊
Tell me about tiktok? I hear it replaced the leafy vine
I'd like to play!
I need a distraction
I'll play!
I accept this mission!
I can not accept this mission for I have already seen the mission reports from our distant cousins who attempted to invade. While the local inhabitants the hue-man-s were easy to subdue it was the planet that rebel hardiest.  Mission logs.....what survived can be found [Here](https://pin.it/3vqCI8Q)
I'll take a cue
How do you do, fellow spacelings?
Coffee!
Alarm clocks!
There is this strange "program" on the television or perhaps the telescope that hoomans enjoy watching. I believe it is called "the workplace" or no... It was "the office". Tell me about this strange thing!
Tell me about this creature called "The Bee"? Does it like jazz perhaps?
Ahhh yes, tell me about why humans enjoy this delicacy called "chocolate"
The noise one makes when touching cute animals on the nose
Alarm clocks
Pizza. What is this strange grease filled food?
Tell me about this music called "country"? I hear it has been used during criminal interrogations
What is this Valentine's day???
Ayeee! You must explain the fascination with cats and dogs? Also which one is better?
Hmmm yes indeed tell me about this Italian plumber named Mario. Apparently he likes clean pipes and strange green dinosaurs
Hmm tell me about this fascination humans have with popular singers like Elvis!
Tell me about this vegetable called asparagus that humans sometimes eat but not willingly
Tell me about this wonderful land called Italy? I hear humans eat pizza and enjoy romance there.
Tell me about why humans listen to these audio things called Podcasts? Strange as they are... Humans enjoy them?
Ayeee hello hello! Nano, nano!      Tell me about why humans flock in groups to see animals doing cute things!
Makes humans function
These are mechanically annoying objects that operate on a periodic level to wake up these less than intelligent humans. What kind of species cannot wake themselves up?! These things are despicable and useless and humans often hit the snooze button. So what is the purpose?!
The bee is a very special creature for humans. There’s many different kinds but the most important thing is that they are responsible for the sustenance that humans need to survive. The bee is a critical part of their life but is in trouble. The humans are very selfish and stupid when it comes to the bee but there’s many humans out there trying to help save the bee.
I do this to my kitten!
Really? I thought alarm clocks were more like "ERH ERH ERH ERH"
A common human foodstuff is called "Pizza" or "za" for short. (Even though it's only two syllables, humans have an obsessive need to shorten words to conserve as much energy as possible.)  This foodstuff provides much energy to humans in the form of fats and carbohydrates.  This foodstuff contains an overabundance of fats.  Many humans even remove some of the fat before eating this item using paper cloths.  (Why was the fat was added in the first place if it is simply going to be removed??  Also, how can a cloth be made of paper???)  This food item can display the boundless human creativity, or perhaps merely their pointless semantic divisions.  Any number of other foodstuffs can go into this category.  Fruits, vegetables, meats, various clumpy solutions, various base layer ingredients...  If so much can change about this "za," how does the term hold meaning???  In addition, "za" is a remarkably divisive food item.  Many humans hold strong opinions on the inclusion or exclusion of one specific fruit.  At times, they even appear on the verge of physical altercations over the inclusion or exclusion of fruit on this foodstuff.  This item seems bizarrely important to humans.
It's a unique method of melodic communication between the humans. Particularly in EYE-ER-LAND (or Ireland, official alien translations are yet to be provided) and Amurrica.  Often, it also contains this a form of squealing referred to as 'yodeling'. A strange noise made specifically by the human's throat...   Can confirm its an effective form of torture for the baddest of criminals.
Valentine's Day is a holiday that was created to honor a religious Catholic Saint and has some Roman and Pagan origins, but now means a corporate (business) holiday to sell things to people and celebrate love. Traditional gifts and activities take place on this day including: chocolate, flowers, teddy bears, greeting cards, wine, fancy dinners, candlelight and romantic acts. Over the years this has come to include love beyond romantic love. Children give small cards and candies to their teachers and classmates as an expression of fun and sharing.
Beings on earth have designated tasks. A Mario from a strange land with strange languages has tasks involving round objects with hollow centres. He likes them to be smooth and of an even colour. He also has an interest in large reptilian like beings that are green.  How did I do? XD
Humans often gather to chant rhythmically together. There usually is a leader of the chant who is charismatic enough to lead thousands of followers and is often imitated.
In order for their bodies to function, the humans have kill other organisms, grind them up in their face holes, and extract their nutrients through a complex system of tubes and chemicals. Some of these organisms are pleasurable for humans to consume, while there are others, such as this "ass peri-gus" which they find unpleasant but force themselves to consume in order to obtain certain nutrients. They especially like to force these ones on their undeveloped offspring.  Also it makes their pee smell funny.
Earth has not yet evolved as a single global community. They are in the early stages of this part of cultural evolution. For now they seperate themselves into smaller communties, with borders established as the result of geographic obstacles, religious groups or wars.  Italy is one such "country" as the humans call it. Italy is of great cultural importance to the humans. During their puny history, many important events took place in this country. Shaped like lower limb apparel, it juts out like a peninsula into a tepid sea, and is separated from other countries by a land border formed by mountains.  Italy is known for harvesting many seas creatures to add to their culinary dishes. Their expertise in human food is well known throughout various communities on Earth. As Italian people migrated, they brought some of this expertise to other lands and it is now considered elite in many places. Humans prize taste above nutritional value and the Italians have learned how to create delicate balances of carbohydrates, such as bread and pasta which are made from wheat, tomatoes which are round red fruits that can be made into sauces or pastes or eaten raw. They also grind assortments of dried leaves to create "herbs". When all combined, humans prize these foods above all else. One such example is "pizza" a round, flat bread covered tomato paste infused with herbs. Topped with old, hardened dairy produce and various other food. Many other cultures try to replicate this pizza but none surpass the Italians  Other than food, Italy is also known for art, architecture and literature. Before Italy was united under one government, they were even more primitive. City states, as they were called, were self-governing and each prioritised developments in different areas of art and technology. As a result, there is a vast selection of architectural feats found throughout the land. The Italians also held art in high regard and many paintings and sculptures were made, based in stories from their religious texts.  Religion is important to humans, and Rome, the capital of  Italy has another tiny country inside of it. This tiny country is called The Vatican City. Many artists donated works to this tiny city state, or rich patrons sponsored artists to create work for it. This was in the hopes of winking favour with the religious leader and gaining political power, along with a favourable afterlife. Many humans believe you are rewarded in the afterlife for deeds they do throughout their lifetimes.  The Italians have developed a very hospitable environment. They greet each other with physical affection and enjoy public displays of affection between humans. As such it is seen as a romantic place to visit on pilgrimages.  Due to its cultural significance in the global community, many people from around the world embark on pilgrimages to this country. Some for art, some to bask in the "vast" history, some for weather and some for romance. Depending on which area a human travels to, many activities are possible subject to seasonal conditions.  Although Italy is somewhat geographically unstable due to tectonic activity, humans are undeterred form traveling and settling here, despite discovering how destructive these geographic forces can be. Instead, they make a show of the destruction and invite tourists and scholars to view the chaos that is frozen in time by volcanic eruptions.
I got a bit into it 😅
Alright, so the thing to know about humans, and this is one of the reasons why they will ultimately be a pretty easy group to conquest, is that they are incredibly easily distracted while at the same time obsessed with acquiring knowledge that's so incredibly specific that it's almost to the point of being useless.   A podcast is a way that a human acquires said useless knowledge in such a way that they distract themselves from reality, if only for a moment.
It seems as though Homo sapiens, henceforth referred to as human animals, congregate around non-human animals performing acts described as cute specifically because said non-human animals, especially those which resemble the juvenile offspring of the human animals, evoke caretaking behaviors in the human animals. The sight of these animals, especially when they are acting in ways that the humans interpret as particularly endearing, seems to activate a dopaminergic pathway in the human animal's brain and, in doing so, elicits various positive emotions including but perhaps not limited to amusement, fondness, and/or generalized happiness. Defining these actions as "cute" is factually accurate, as the non-human animals are behaving in a way that, scientifically speaking, "inspires great adoration or delight" within the human animals.
Yes. Indeed. It is some sort of bean?!
> What kind of species cannot wake themselves up?!   ✋
Beautiful.
Oh, I thought this was your comment to reply with a concept for you to explain!
The short name of 'Za', is that a regional name for this grease slice?
Holy crap. This is beautiful. This needs to be in the national gallery for art stuffs
LOOOOOOL!!! BEAUTIFUL!  Amurrika sounds like a scary place. Perhaps we should conquer the rest of the earth except for that anarchic place! I hear they enjoy things called "deep fried mars bars"	and funnel cakes... Tsk tsk.
*claps* you are a true historian and clearly an expert on this strange land called Italy. Love that you didn't call it the boot shape but "shaped like lower limb apparel". 10 points for Ravenclaw. Which is most definitely your house!
I.....
It’s a magic bean that helps to make humans alert
Nah nah, you are ;)
😂 It was originally but someone misunderstand so I just rolled with it. I'll make one for myself now.
It is an official name for the grease slice according to the arbiters of a popular word game.  ^(It's in the Scrabble dictionary.)
Hahaha, thanks! :)
I believe if we conquer the earth without Amurrica there will be riots. We must plan our invasion strategically.   One has not heard of a funnel cake. My reports show their national cake to be a 'Twinkie'? And sources tell that the original of deep fried candied goods is 'Scortland'
Close! I'm actually a Slytherin, but with some Ravenclaw traits!
I really love Italy... Sorry 😅
Awww! :D
OK!
Ah, thank you for the explanation!   ^TIL ^there ^is ^a ^Scrabble ^dictionary!
Hmm perhaps indeed. Have you heard of the Savage lands of Kanyeda? Apparently the people apologize for everything and hail the "ye" while eating pootune or pooteene
Don't apologize at all! That's why I picked Italy for you. Saw it in your intro :)
You're welcome!
I have, and the delicacy 'pooteen' is delicious! I hear the 'Kaneydeehans' are the most apologetic sub-species. Strange they are neighboured with the Amurrica
Oh awesome! Thanks for that! It was definitely fun to try and explain it from a completely alien stand point!
Oh but they are not as strange as these Brutish people from the YouKe! They like to drip biscuits into tee. Quite strange. They even have a leader named Burrish John's son.
Ah, I've heard that dipping biscuits in tea predates history itself, a noble tradition passed from grandparents to their younglings' younglings.   Ah yes, Burrish John's Son. I believe he is level with Down Old Troomp, but less explosive...   > Burrish  ^totally ^translated ^to ^burrito ^on ^my ^phone...
LOOOOOL 😂 😂 😂 dead. Down Hill Rump is perhaps the most strange human being we have seen. He is more like an alien, and yet that is an insult to our species. Him and Burrish John's Son likely enjoy dipping biscuits in tea together.
> Down Hill Rump  You win my friend 😂 I can't top this
😂 😂 😂 We both win! Great banter

Surprise, u/starofsavannah.
Awwww  I forgot how cute Ponyo is!
ahhh omg ponyo was my favorite movie when i was growing up! my babysitter used to play it for me all the time
What?! You’re always so kind to me. Thank you!!
I watched it for the first time last night! She is adorable! Ponyo loves Sosuke!
It’s such a sweet version of the little mermaid I love it the most
It's even not my favorite Ghibli movie, but it's just so damn beautiful!
Which is your favorite?
That question is way too hard for me to answer, I'm really bad at choosing favorites... That would be a ridiculous three way tie between Howl's moving castle, Princess mononoke and Spirited away, but there are still a lot I didn't watch yet. What's yours?

Welcome to tonight's thread! If you haven't been around before, here is a quick explanation for you to enjoy!  The Daily/Nightly thread is a place for you to enjoy the company of your fellow RAOAers in one place! This thread is for many awesome things such as:  * Being super busy * Working * Tricking people to look up Urechis unicinctus * Meeting deadlines  Plus many more fun things!  So come on in, grab a blanket, and enjoy the company.  **QOTD: What's your favorite animal?**
I'm excited to announce that I just put all of my flours, opened bags of beans/noodles/grits, and grains into nice-looking, stackable, labeled containers. My shelves look so much nicer and I love them.  QOTD: cats. Or maybe birds? Definitely one of those.
Still haven't heard back from the job i had the interview for ..  I saw a job on a job website for receptionist but they've asked on the ad to email them my CV   Can anyone help compose the email so that it looks formal enough?,  Also should i do it now or wait to see if i get this job first?,
QOTD Pandas.  Continuing my learning and job search.
ELEPHANTS   also I’m sitting in the ER and it’s my birthday. What a day already 🥲😂
QOTD: I like koalas 🐨   Went to bed early for me, before Jimmy Kimmel was over.  Just got a text from Jersey Mike’s that woke me up and I am kind of tempted to go to work early (for me) today.
Good morning everyone.  I’ve been a little quiet because...life...but I have a day off work today and the kiddos are headed to their dad’s for the weekend, so it’s RAOA time for this girl!  Also murder show, junk food and nap time!   Hope you all have a great day!   QOTD: Sloths and Alpacas
Hope everyone is having a lovely day! No plans today, my daughter and I are watching Blue’s Clues in our jammies. She’s extra cuddly this morning which is such a treat. 🥰  She has her 15 month checkup tomorrow, I’m really hoping she doesn’t have to get too many vaccines. She had a pretty bad reaction last time to one of them and I hate seeing her sick. 🥺  QOTD: Cats, bees and owls. But hedgehogs and black bears are cute too. 😍
It's Thursday! And next week is a 4-day week for me! I'm pretty stoked about that.   QOTD: pigs and hedgehogs. I can't pick which. and I love a caracal - so pretty. And they're all good dogs Brent.
QOTD: one word, meow.   I'm recovering with a fractured rib and honestly I can't do much so tell me your movie recommendations.   I haven't been very active but to be honest I'm trying to get better and heal 💜    Have an awesome day only a message away if you wanna chat :)
Well my favorite animal is most definitely not a penis fish lmao, but it is easily a frog!
We just had a huge blizzard here last night. Power lines down, lots of damage, the streets are skating rinks. I'm so glad to be working from home. I'm in my jammies, with hot coffee, trying to work (Trying. I am on Reddit right now, as you can see!)  My favourite animal is a cat! But I also love rabbits and bats.
Straight chilling and burning through future money 💵
Oh, this is so funny to read peoples just saying morning and all and me seeing the sun set already...      So I thought I'll write here and then finish my university work and motivate myself to be quicker by only coming back when I'm done. Hopefully that works...    Because otherwise I'll be swamped with uni next week.      Oh, and favourite animal since forever are the elegant and wonderful giraffes!
Good morning everyone! Anyone else see this sweet new trailer for the [New Pokemon Snap](https://youtu.be/Mq8Kn6mhUxA) game? It's scheduled to come out in just a few months and I'm pretty darn excited.  QOTD: I'm a big fan of elephants. They are so unique looking. Like, if we weren't used to them we'd totally think of them as some weird alien creature.
Living room is starting to come together! We have furniture!
We just got a dog this last week and he is my favorite!!!! \[[Pupper Tax](https://imgur.com/a/OsnEjKK)\]. I had never had a dog before, and while it is more work than I was expecting, it is also far more rewarding than I was expecting too. Oliver is such a smart boy, he is well behaved, and has a great smile. He is good at matching our energy, and honestly is really helping with my anxiety, which was a nice bonus (I wasn't planning on this). I have been having trouble leaving the house lately, and just having him to focus on and work with has really helped calm me down and feel more at ease outside.
So i got a bikini today. The first one ive ever worn in my life. Its a high waist one but still, this is huge for me. It feels weird and im not used to having that much skin showing. It was a really big step and I cant believe the day has come where i could just order a regular size online and it fit and everything. Just feels so weird
Good morning! My favorite animal is the kangaroo or capybara.
I love hedgehogs. Amazing little things
My last (hopefully) doc consult is today before I can start to schedule an egg retrieval. I'm anxious as it gets closer.   QOTD: Tigers!
QOTD: Urechis Unicinctus
Good morning lovely people of RAOA!!! Today has started out a million times better than yesterday. I hope everyone else's Thursday is going good so far.  QOTD: The Capybara, I have no idea why. But they are so darn cute.
Tie between capybara and sea otter!
Good morning everyone!!!  Friday is almost here!!!! Just hang on for a little while longer.   QOTD: Eagles
We haven't had power in 36 hours which includes no heat this sucks tbh and my car is still in the shop from the accident. I'm SO freaking ready for the weekend!!
Good morning everyone!  I’ve woken up from nightmares two days in a row now, and I really hate how they affect me. Does anyone else here deal with frequent nightmares?
QOTD: I like turtles.
Qotd- i like turtles 🐢   Hope everyone has a great day!
I legit just look up  Urechis unicinctus . That is hilarious!! I am going to have to share this with people.   QOTD: an [Okapi](http://creationwiki.org/Okapi)! I think they are so Amazing!
Morning all! Today's my day off and I've loaded it with errands and stuff to do. It'll be good to get stuff done but I kinda just wanna relax all day.
QotD: off the top of my head I’m gonna say foxes. 🦊
I just started a new medication today and I’m nervous. It’s supposed to help with my daily anxiety and panic that I’m always feeling but it’s also a blood uhhhhh blood pressure medicine I think? So I took it and we’ll see what happens.
Happy Thursday!  I have a really hard time being consistent with good habits. I walked to work every day, which was a great habit, but after I got laid off and 2020 happened, well the walking stopped for a few months. So I've been going on a morning walk again and trying to rebuild my good habits. Happy to report I have over a week of a streak going!  QOTD: I invite you all to listen to the song Black Bear by Black Bear for a ballad about one of my favorite animals. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face.
Happy Thursday, friends!    I could really use a hug or a smile right about now. My friend passed away today. She was an elderly neighbor who always had me over for coffee and chats about life. She had so much wisdom and love. She even paid me money to paint (mediocre) pictures for her and told me that I was going to be famous one day. She told everyone that she had discovered me as a young artist. I'm 29, and she was in her 70s. It meant a lot to me that she went out of her way to help me and be kind to me. I feel like the world could have learned so much more from her.   If you think of anything that might cheer me up, I'd really appreciate it! <3     QOTD: My favorite animals are cats and dogs.
Qotd polar bears are my super favorite but I love all bears 🐻 🐨🐼 I love bats too... 🦇
QotD: Elephants  Hey all, hope things are going well! 💚
Happy Thursday, one and all! This week has gone by fast. Have I done anything interesting? Nope! Well...I did finish my audiobook and it was so good! Now onto the next one in the series. I haven't gifted in awhile....I wanna do a contest but I don't know what type of contest...so, we'll see what I end up doing.  Qotd: my favorite animal is really all the baby mammals. I'd say animals but octopus is included in that and I hate octopuses even if it's a baby octopus.
I'm flying to see my best friend next week. Her family paid for me to visit and she doesn't know yet! SO NO ONE SAY ANYTHING. I'm really stressed about flying alone. Also stressed that I have to fit everything into a personal item.   Anyone have any airport stories?
To tell a story related to the thread name - my brother is going to be 30 this year. When he turned 14 I bought him a rosehair tarantula. She's going to be sixteen this year and she's still going strong. Her name is precious and he loved her until he moved in with his latest girlfriend, who cannot STAND spiders of any kind so he had to rehome her... to my grandmother's house.   Now my 98 year old grandmother has this 16 year old tarantula not only in her house but in her bedroom and she loves watching Precious move around. She says they're old lady friends together.
Pssssst. You. Yeah, you! Remember you are awesome at being you. No one else in the whole world can do that like you can. I'm proud of you for getting through another day even when it is hard.  My inbox is always open if you need a friendly ear, place to vent, virtual hug, or just some silly conversation
We spent the night in our new house last night! Our stuff won't be in until this weekend, but it was just so *nice*.  QOTD: Kangaroos?
Good morning! I call on my good friends around here to help me out with something. I want to start a blog but i have NO IDEA what to name it. Does anyone have some good general ideas that i could adapt and use?
Hello everyone, I hope you are well. I’ve been through 3 covid based scares these passed two weeks. First my bf, then me and now my brother has a cough and fever. He’s around my sickly mother and my grandmother. I hate this stupid virus. I cannot wait til Biden’s team get it under control.   QOTD: cats but also jerboa
Cats are my fav hence Ginger on my profile!
QOTD: ugh, there are so many to choose from! Some are badass (honey badger), some are adorable (slow loris), some are humans in bear suits (panda).  I did exercise for the first time in forever today, not sure how I feel about it hahaha.  Edit: after the response to my comment about books yesterday, if anyone wants to add me on goodreads, I'm at https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4230779-bibliophile14.
Good morning, RAOA friends!! Today is pretty meeting heavy for me but I'm going to try to stay positive and just keep chugging along. Sending you all some happy vibes today, too!  QOTD: NOT tarantulas, that's for sure. Probably the platypus because it's so unique and interesting. I do also love sloths and quokkas!
Good morning 💜 Yesterday when I went to go to the hot tub: had to wait for the elevator for my next door neighbor's deceased body. So heartbreaking, hug your loved ones (or make a safely socially distanced/virtual connection) life is precious! 💞💞💞
Good morning, everyone!  At least everyone in the Americas, lol.   I’m sitting here, drinking coffee and trying to convince myself to get up and clean my kitchen.  So far the coffee and reddit are winning  Qotd:  sloths, sloths and more sloths, lol
I tend to give myself projects at the last minute. I don't know why I do it, but when creativity strikes....I just can't help myself. Stayed up until midnight decorating a cake for my mother in law's birthday (and it wasn't anything fancy, we just didn't get home until after 9pm). And now I have to finish the gift: a brag board that I'm using a wood burner on to write on it. It's super cute, buuuuut this is my first time using a wood burner, so it's taking me some time.   **QOTD:** Red pandas....or bunnies.
QOTD: whale sharks !! They are gorgeous and gentle giants! Cant wait to be done with work this week! I’m exhausted!!
Good morning everybody happy Thursday to you the Sun is shining🌞 it's gonna be in the fifties here on the East Coast get ready to start my day with the pledge of allegiance,and looking forward to a positive day🐭🌻   Pancakes and bacon for breakfast the outdoor kitties are fed❤ Mr. JJ is in play mode,how is your morning going🧸🌞
Good morning everyone! Early adulting time and on one cup of coffee. Well at least I will get steps! Not a good Thursday so far.   Asian ribs for dinner and cauliflower stir fry rice.   QoTD: red panda
QOTD: Elephant.  We didn't sleep much last night. Baby girl was miserable because of her teeth and the vaccines. So we cuddled a lot. She got up at 5:00 this morning wanting to eat. So we did that, too. I need some more caffeine!
Feeling anxious and depressed again today. Not sure what's wrong w me. I mean, the world is shit but that's nothing new. I need to take control of my life but I'm just having so much dount about following my dreams these days.
Today (right now) my oldest gets her wisdom teeth pulled.  She is 21 and lives in Philladelphia.  A good a kid, and still 100% my buddy.  This is the first time she has gone under that I wasn’t right there, and I sort of feel bad.  I know it’s totally ridiculous, but I’m her dad..  her room mate has my number is going to call me when she gets the kid home so I have that.
Good morning hope every is well...
Good morning everyone! I hope you all have a fantastic day! I have 4 days off work after today so I am pretty excited about that. No big plans since we can't really go anywhere or do anything.. but I always enjoy full days of just hanging out with my spouse and kids.   QOTD: dogs. They are just so loving and snuggly!
QOTD: Moose  I am the pronouncer for the spelling bee at our school. Can't wait to see what kids can do.
I've learned to not look up things like that!  Quote of the Day : humans! or unicorns if we're considering mythical animals
Told the husband I was depressed (or he heard me crying like a bitch.) [He said, did you forget you have a chocolate croissant? And he set this up for me. ](http://imgur.com/a/TMsaPDE) this is why I married him.   Also any ladies ever been diagnosed with PMDD? I think I have it.
QOTD: [Honu](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9-RM2vBtfe/?igshid=1lyuvhpu8kvs6) aka Green Sea Turtle.  I love them so much.  I once followed one while swimming off the coast of Kona and almost had to be rescued to get back to shore 😬   Hope everyone has a great day!
This year has not been kind lol. Woke up to an evacuation order due to an unknown warehouse chemical fire right down the street. Now I’m at my fiancé’s parent’s house 30mins away and he also gets to miss his first day of work lmao. Big sads rn but we’re safe at least
**QOTD:** Tiger, such a beatiful animal.     Also, i'm fairly new to using reddit, how come everybody has their amazon wishlist next to their name? Is it possible to lear this power ?     Have a nice day!
QOTD: Definitely dogs, they vary wildly so there is one for everyone. I personally like huskies.  I just started my second semester of college, still all online so we shall see how that goes.
Making strides towards finishing the great decluttering of 2021! I tried to get it all done yesterday but a migraine struck and I had to lay down instead. Just a bin and a pile on the floor, two bookcases and the vanity left! So close!!
Omg omg I got my car payment and it said the wrong amount apparently in keeping up with the payments and what not I sent an extra payment in (take that principal) and they are getting another payment for this month. Omg I will be basically 1/2 a month ahead
I’m so glad it’s Friday Eve.   I marinated chicken breast for stir fry last night and I’m excited. That’s probably the highlight of my day 😂  QoTD - elephants!
I'm always partial to otters since we had one as a pet as a kid, which isn't fair to the raccoon, skunk, flying squirrel, goat, dogs, cats, hamsters we also had.  But otters are so soft and playful and aggressive and hilarious...
I’m in lockdown. Bored, nothing to do. Trying to find new hobbies, a new game to play or series to watch
Debating if I should preorder Pokémon snap immediately or wait at least a few days 😅😂
Why does 2021 want to be such a bitch?  Power went out last and according to the utility company it won't be back on until the 17th - and it's suppose to snow tomorrow.
So frustrated. Went on a hike yesterday and as soon as I  got on the trail, the width of the path was taken up by two people not wearing masks or making any effort to share space.  So irritated as it's been reported we're up to 1 in 3 people infected out here. So tired of all this. So many friends w/ infected relatives. Another friend just lost her Mom to the virus. Another, an uncle. And another, a co-worker. All in the past couple weeks.  Sigh.
Guess who did the laundry, cleaned the shower, meditated, and got her portfolio together? This gal!
Good morning, everyone! I hope you're having a good one!  Fiance is coughing and feels like crap. I'm nervous. Please send good vibes!!!
I got laid off yesterday :(   Cats. Cats make everything better.
I like dogs because they can be so loyal and caring. Also someone look up urechis unicinctus for me. I’m curious but afraid.
Urrrrg I don’t want to go to work 😭 I usually enjoy my job but this year has been like pulling my own fingernails out one at a time. 😭😭😭  QOTD: African Elephant
I am all about at least three of these bullet points. SO busy. I really shouldn't even be on reddit right now, but I haven't said hi in a couple of days, so HI!  &#x200B;  QOTD: Hmm, gotta think about that one. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA it's cats, of course.
Good morning everyone, and happy Thursday! I hope y'all are having a magical morning ✨  I know better than to Google that third bullet point. The last time I Googled something like that I learned what blue waffle is. No thank you!  QOTD: My favorite animal is a wolf. There's just something majestic and magical about them.
I really want to bake something. But I have so much woooork to doooo. 😩  QOTD: turtles!
Just an easy going day, nothing special!  Something sweet that happened though: I ordered 200grams of chicken pieces because there was a chicken stand in the village and they gave me like 500 grams extra!  Qotd: Dogs, I really want one..
My favourite animal is a dog!! I think they're better than humans since they have unconditional love and are loyal. Who doesn't love dogs haha  Edit: I googled bullet point 3 and wow.. I learned about something new today
Turtle and flamingos   Good morning y'all!  How be you?  All is well here, doing laundry and hanging out today.  My bestie leaves Saturday so we're getting in our time together while we can.
QOTD: Cats! And I like to include all types of cats within that branch including wild cats (so like tigers, leopards, lynxes, jaguars etc) :)  Also yep was successfully tricked into googling Urechis unicinctus
Not spiders. I am unreasonably afraid of spiders. The thing is that I KNOW I act completely irrational when I see one and there is not shit I can do about it. 😂 That's a big NOPE.   FAVORITE animal? Hmmm. I have two cats and two dogs currently, but I used to have two Pomeranians and they were my babies. I absolutely LOVE Pomeranians. They are so tiny, so fluffy, and take no shit!   It has been a LONG week. Fighting with hubs who is currently in another state (and we're both wrong and both right at the same time), trying to get motivated to work more on myself, hopefully find a job from home, and then taking care of the most WONDERFUL 5 year old in the world. Rotten, but wonderful. 😁
QoTD: dogs.  Don’t think I’ll look that up. The tricking makes me suspicious.
QOTD: I have a few. I like owls, Wolves, and Octopuses. I also love bees (yes I know, technically not an animal)   Another day of working from home thanks to this stupid cold. I have to get ANOTHER covid test tomorrow despite two negatives and hardly any similar symptoms. Lol   and I am behind on my deadlines thanks to being sick for the past two plus weeks. buuutt we are making up for that today and tomorrow so there is hope. .hopefully    &#x200B;  Cant wait for the weekend though! I am going to be cleaning our entire place and getting things back to normal. Ive been too blagh to do much of that and it shows. Our place is a disaster but I will take care of that starting Saturday morning!
Good morning everyone! Today is going to be a long one. Little miss was up late so I am tired. Hopefully she'll be up for a nap when I get home.
I’m freeeeeee!! No more quarantine!! Yay!!!  Qotd: chickens and skunks
/u/nacho_cheezus at first I thought it said, looking up TO Urechis unicinctus and although I'm sure it's worthy of worship in some cultures, iiiiiiidk if I'd look up to it ;)   Also, I'm at work all day today by myself, meaning- I don't have to do ANYTHING if I don't want to ( perks of covid I guess because the public isn't allowed in my department at the library) and yea so what should I do?  I brought a book, but it's not a fiction book ( yea I know, I work in a library, there's literally THOUSANDS of books here) but I'm usually not super motivated to read. I really should though.. otherwise I have some boring things to do like make a budget and look up a new cell phone plan --- What would you do if you had 8 hours to yourself with (mostly) uninterrupted silence?
QOTD: currently, my favorite animal is the pika! They are so adorable.
QOTD: rabbits 🐰
QOTD: Dogs, or cats, or owls. Haha, it's hard to choose.
Qotd: wild horned lizards
QOTD: Pygmy Hippos!
QOTD: Hummingbirds. They’re always welcome in my backyard.
qotd: alligators!!! i was a pretty casual fan of dinos, then around 4 years ago i went to a gator zoo and fell in love. they looked just like dinos!!! now my love for gators is far more powerful than my love for dinos. it's a little obsessive. i have a gator tattoo!
My favorite animal? Hmm...  👀  I hate spiders! And insects and UGHHSH i cried cause a ladybug came into my room and I was so scared.   Hope everyone is happy !!!
Ahoy mischief makers.   [This is my favorite animal ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContagiousLaughter/comments/kx86td/waiting_for_the_luggage/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) (nsfw)
qotd: domesticated - cats. but like in all of the animal kingdom probably Giraffes   &#x200B;  Happy Thursday (even though I thought it was friday for far too long today)   I finished Bridgerton last night and decided I had to read all the books... and um my TBR for the year is vastly outgrowing my time in which I have to read.... I love reading but sometimes I wish i could just absorb a story through osmosis or something lol  also got some validation at work today that other people are frustrated by the same things as me. but not wanting to be a gossip i never talked about it. so its nice to know i'm not alone in my frustrations.
u/lilhoneybee4... I finished Uprooted. It. Was. AMAZING. Such a well written book! I can't wait to read more of her stuff. Thank you soooo much for putting it in my library!
QOTD: Ravens! They're so smart and cunning and they're really beautiful and they have that macabre quality about them, they're just amazing. I love them... out of doors. Wouldn't want one in my house honestly. For house pets it's cats all the way.
Qotd: elephants because they're smart and majestic as fuck.   I actually didn't realize it was already Thursday so this post really picked up my morning.
Well work yesterday wasn’t the absolute disaster I expected!! Yay for small surprises!   QOTD: seahorses. They’re useless but super cool looking.
Happy Thursday! I’m spending my day running errands and trying to set up a gofundme for my dad. I hope everyone had a good day today!  QOTD: wolves! Specifically the timber wolf
After today there's only one more day of virtual work for me, next week I'm in person. I'm kind of nervous but it should be okay.  Dnd was pretty good last night, we fought a Hydra and it was intense. I'm hoping to run my own campaign soon but I'm nervous  I hope everyone has a great day!  QotD: I love pandas!
Its friday jr! Hope all is well with everyone! Just watched my grandson for a little bit. I'm sad when he leaves 🥺 Hope everyone has a great day!! ❤
Good Afternoon, Mozzarellas!  Hope everyone is having an awesome day!  qotd: My felines :D
I have an irritation. I have a planner that I love. Best thing ever. One of those disc jobs. It made me Happy. So happy I got a second one for my budget crap. Now the planner has made me sad and chapped my ass. Why? I’ll tell you.  I need new innards. I do not need an entire new got damn book. I do not need a new cover or discs or pockets. I just need guts. Sure, I can buy some of  those print my own variety. Except then I need to cut them down AND punch holes in them. That fucking hole punch is ridiculous. They can lick my non-existent knob.  I have something big and, quite frankly, really scary planned for this year and I want to track shit to keep me sane. Now I have to search the world to find another got damn planner that I like. Yeah, I know, there are way worse problems, but fuck.  Hope your day doesn’t suck monkey peener. 🦥🦖💜
Hey hey, I finally got my driver's license! All I had to do was wake up at 6 and spend the whole morning there. Geez, I can't believe I used to do this everyday for school... To reward myself, I'll be having a chill evening eating a Subway cookie, you know, that new caramel brownie cookie? I need a recipe for this ASAP. It tastes so good. I think their cookies have declined in quality over the years but maybe that's just me. This new one is the bomb though. Ugh. Should've bought more than one.
Ugh, is there such a thing as a military grade Xbox one controller? My dog keeps chewing mine up. Jerk.
Morning! Workout done. Coffee gone. Cat sleeping on lap. Book in hand. Hoping today is much more productive than yesterday, plus hockey is back (for my team) today and I’m pumped to finally watch after almost a year of none.   QOTD: man I love the derpiness of the red panda
I am so sorry for being behind in my thanks posts and not as active this past week! My anxiety has been awful. I think something good is happening with my old high school sweetheart I met up with last week, but I haven’t been in a relationship in years and am so nervous. My family also isn’t really speaking to me because of it, so my nerves are just shot. ☹️  I miss you all!   QotD: opossums, bats, and cats!
I had to leave work early to get a covid test because I can't freaking taste anything. I'm literally so annoyed. We can't afford to have me not work for the next week. I'm grateful I can get a test, but ugh.      Please send hugs and good vibes. It's both myself and my fiance who are under the weather now.  &#x200B;  sigh.
🎶I should be writing, but I'm not. I should be doing lots of things, but it's okay to do nothing and rebel against the action economy.🎶
hello children, i hope you are all well! i'm just hanging out and getting some work done. i am once again trying to be more active, sigh. i used to be so good at this, i don't know what happened. my car is in the shop and i'm desperate to figure out what the hell is going on with it. last night it just stalled in the middle of the road and i couldn't get it to stay started. i hope it's nothing serious. :(
Qotd: It's so hard to pick just one! I majored in zoology and I love almost all of them. Maybe cats are #1, or dinosaurs. But I also love dogs, parrots, jumping spiders, snakes, owls, horses, grackles, and many more.
Hey all how are we all
QOTD: I'm boring. I just love cats. Especially nakey bald cats.  Right now I'm currently crocheting a toilet paper roll.
Morning! It's Friday Eve. Bless. I feel like I need a lot of coffee.   QoTD: a hippo
I get vaccinated next week!!!!!!!  QOTD: My doggy Arya.
**QOTD:** Red Fox - Well techincally any kind of animal with a Red Fox color pattern, which includes Mained Wolves and Red Pandas  Also when it comes to sea creatures, it would be Octopus or Hagfish  (When your brain is huge enough to vaugely understand what Urechis unicinctus could be) Heh
Urechis unicinctus hehe lol 😂  QOTD- I love dogs 💛
Another day, another dollar (or 75c after tax)...  2 more shifts until my weekend starts, and I can't wait.  Averaging a little over 15km of walking per shift and my legs are really starting to feel it.  QOTD:  Favourite Animal is an Eagle.  I just like how they sore so majestically up above the world.  I have a tattoo of a Bald Eagle even though we don't get them in Australia.  Our [Wedged-Tail Eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge-tailed_eagle) would probably be the closest, but I just like the colouring of the Bald Eagle better.
I am back at work today. I made tofu and rice for lunch and it was the best I’ve ever been able to make tofu before! It was so crispy I was munching on some of it as a snack while I made the rice!! I made enough for two meals so I have enough for another meal this weekend. My dinner is going to be left over tortilla soup from yesterday. The guys at work are being a bit irritating but hopefully they’ll chill out.   QOTD: cats!!!
Hey there friends! I hope y’all are well!   Qotd: otters are my fav! And dachshunds! :)
Hello!  It has been a while but I'm back!  QOTD: My favs are snow leopards, foxes, or red pandas!
Hi everyone! I hope you're all having an adequate day! Why must textbooks be so expensive, though? I bought a used one and it turns out I can't access the online program that's I'm required to have access to because used textbooks don't come with registration codes so now I am on my way to spend even more money on a textbook I'll probably use twice :):):):):)   QOTD: cows and dog!
QOTD: I mean besides my Cat, Red Pandas are my favourite animal
I hate adulting lol. Waiting for a smog check right now then off to the DMV for who knows how long.
Well everything finally arrived for my new computer desk setup. But I won't be able to get everything together until Saturday. I just hope I feel better before then. Been having a bad cough the last couple days and I REALLY hope it isn't COVID...again...   **QOTD:** I love wolves. They're just neat. Big floofy doggos of murder.
Qotd: Cephalopods! Octopuses in general, but in specific .. probably the [bobtail squid](https://oceanconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-01-at-3.31.50-PM-1200x632.png). Lookit that little thing!
Pandas are my favorite animal!  I have been learning the art of cardistry today! I'm working on the most basic move still. I get it about 40% of the time but I still have fun!
Watching My Name is Earl, enjoying the Indica, and laying in my soft, comfy bed. Try and top that! Lolol
Woke up much earlier than planned because my cat is being an asshole 😩  My favorite animals are cows and red pandas
[removed]
Oooo nice! Finally getting organized is always a fantastic feeling.
If you posted a picture I might feel inspired enough to deal with cleaning my pantry.  It’s so disorganized!!
This is my DREAM. Identical stackable orderly containers in my pantry with cute little labels! Someday...
I’m wanting to do that with my gluten-free flours
Oh that sounds so satisfying! I remember when I started to pack stuff into container, such a good feeling! Are your container clear? I love it when you get to see your food through them
That is very exciting! Excellent adulting on your part! There is something so satisfying in well organized shelves. 😊💚
How satisfying!! 🥰💜💞
Do it now. Usually if you are given a job offer, you can take a few days to decide if you want it. But, you don't want to miss out on another opportunity if this other one falls through.
I wish I could offer help in composing an email, but I am not good at that sort of thing. I usually use the internet to find various examples and use that for inspiration.  I think you should go ahead an apply. You don't want to miss an opportunity if the job you interviewed with already doesn't work out. If they both end up extending you offers, you may end up like something about the second job opportunity more than the first. I think it is a great idea to apply to multiple jobs. Good luck!
Agreed with what's been said. Apply for the new job as well - worst comes to worst you applied without needing too. Best case scenario though it ends up being the new job you take.  There's a few sites out there that can help with CV examples and formatting, [such as this](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/cv-samples-and-writing-tips-2060349). I'm no expert, but I'd also be happy to take a look at it and give you my thoughts/formatting feedback. Just PM me if so.
Go for it!  If you want I can look the thing over when your done? Just send me a PM
Do you appreciate the upturned kind? If so, hello there 🙃
oh no :( what brought you to the ER? I hope you get some cake.
Oh no! I’m sorry. 🥺 Hopefully you’re out soon with some answers!
Elephants are the best!   I'm sorry you are in the ER on your birthday! I hope you manage to have a great birthday anyway! Happy birthday! 🎂💚
Hey, if you get more money out of it then I say go!
No work AND no kids today? You are living the life girl! I mean, I'm grateful for a job and love my son, but a break like that sure sounds nice.
Good morning :) Sounds like you have a nice day/weekend ahead of you. What murder show are you watching?
Sounds great. Have a nice day!
it's so funny because they talk about Richard Ramirez like the was the only serial killer during that time in L.A. , I get that he was kind of a big deal but there was also EAR ONS which wasn't really brought up much until recently, also I guess some of his crimes weren't connected until much later but there was plenty of other crazy sh\*t happening in L.A. in the 80's ( I was born in 83' in that area) but you know, I love a good serial killer documentary.
I hope you have the best day! I'm jealous of your upcoming nap. 💛
Enjoy the day, you deserve it!
I remember those fears!  I hope all goes well tomorrow 💛
Aw, I hope you have a good day!
Aww enjoy Blue's Clues! I hope all goes well tomorrow!
Snuggles are the best!! I’m jealous!! Declan used to hate snuggles (he calls them “coodles” like cuddles) but he’s getting better about it lol. Good luck with the vaccines!! It’s no fun when they’re sad :(
Pigs make great pets I hear. Enjoy your 4 day week! 😊
I highly recommend the movie *The Prom* on Netflix. It's based on the Broadway play. It's happy, sad, funny, and a little over the top, but fantastic! I hope you heal and feel better soon!
Oh my goodness are you ok
Dang I was going to recommend my favorite movie but its a hilarious movie and thst wouldn't be such a good thing with a fracture rib :( so here's a sad one instead Dear Zachary.
Oh my friend, you have been through so much lately! I hope your rib heals quickly! I am so sorry. 💚💚  If you haven't seen it, I recommend the Peanut Butter Falcon. It is such a good movie. We all loved it here. One of my favorite movies that I go back and watch is Benny and Joon.   Take care, lovely. 😊💚💚
oh damn, that hurts. i'm sorry.  and do not watch anything funny!
Oh my gosh, I hope you get better soon!!!
Oof. Stay safe and warm!
Working from home is really the best! Hope you stay safe
Oh no! Stay safe! I'm glad you still have power.
Oh no!! Hope you are safe! I am kinda jealous though because I have not had any snow. Usually there is a ton by now but it has been very warm and the driest year ever recorded for us!
What do you study in uni?
I’m in the same boat, trying to build up that motivation to completely the glorious homework that I have to do!
Ooooohhhh I have not! I'll check it out!   I love elephants too!!! I hope you have a good day!
Yep, elephants are the BEST! 😊🐘💚
Yay for furniture!
Congrats!!!!!!
Awww! Congrats!!!!!
I'm so glad to hear you have a new fur baby!  It's crazy how much just having another being in the house can help so much.  He is such a beautiful boy!
i love your username and your pupper is an angel! please give him a kiss on behalf of me. :)
Omg that puppy smile! So precious! Congrats!
He is adorable!
So cute!! How old?  And yeah, puppers are a lot of (very rewarding) work.
Awww look at that smile! 🥰
That's amazing!!!!!!! Go you!! Congrats!
I am so excited for you!  Rock that bikini!  There is nothing wrong with a high waist if that makes you more comfortable!
good for you!!! listen, you have nothing to be ashamed of and you should enjoy your body. ♥ also, there are plenty of cover ups you can order if need be!
Good for you! I'm of the mind that all bodies are bikini bodies if there is a bikini on them, but I'm very happy you're at a place where you're comfortable with your body.   Rock that bikini my fellow goddess!
Morning! Capybaras seem just so chill and content with life I love it
Good morning! Kangaroos fascinate me. I like watching the videos of them acting like drunk frat boys all over Australia 😂
Capybaras are SO cute. They're my husband's favorite. Hope you have a great day :D
Morning
Good morning!
Good morning! Have a wonderful day! 😊
Good morning!  Hedgehogs are so cute! My friend has one and I miss petting its little belly
So cute!!
They are so cute
Good morning. My nephew use to have a hedgehog 🦔 and the are amazing
🦔💗
You got this!
Best wishes 🤗🥰
Good luck!!
Good luck!!!
So exciting!
Hope everything goes well!
I am refusing to look it up. It probably has to do with spiders and I want to sleep tonight.
Good for you my friend I'm happy to hear today is a better day
Capybara are everyone's friend
Good morning, glad to hear you are having a better day!
That's my sister's FAVORITE, the otter.
I hope that power comes back on soon! Stay warm and safe!
Oh no, that’s awful. Why is it taking so long? ☹️
Booooo.  I'm sorry to hear that. <3
I’m sorry :( When my anxiety is high I have a lot of nightmares and it’s awful.  I hope the rest of your day isn’t affected by them 💕💕
Sending hugs. I hate waking up from a nightmare. It definitely can leave you shaken. I have a short routine to bring myself back to the present and it helps.
I do! Especially when I have a lot of anxiety going on in my life
We got ourselves a little zombie boy here!
Do also like face paint?
I just commented the same thing lol, I love turtles 💗
Have a good day! 😊
+1 for okapi. They're pretty cool, and darn adorable.
Did you know that Okapi classified as giraffes? I love giraffes and always think about okapi as their odd cousin🦒
I hope you have a good day!
Have a great day, Eric 💙
If it’s propranolol I tried that for anxiety years ago and my blood pressure was the same, even though I’m hypotension normally!  Good luck!
Best of luck!! 💜
Congratulations on your streak
Yay for good habits! Great job! Thank you for sharing this song; I love it!
Hooray for the walking streak!! 🥰💜😎
Sending so much hugs and love!!!
Hugs
oh, i love your neighbor and i'm sorry she has passed away. What a gift she gave to you in encouraging your art. I love that.
I’m so sorry for your loss! Sending you good vibes!
Woo! Another one for the elephant crew!
🐘💜
My friend is a pilot and I asked for advice, He said "Find the biggest dude there and fight him. You need to establish dominance early on" .
I was flying home from Florida with my family when I was about 5 or 6, and at the time my favorite stuffed animal was a doll of Annie from the Little Einsteins, that said various phrases when you pressed a button in her hand.   When we went through security my bag got flagged because it was post 9/11 and the sound system in the doll appeared as a box with wires on the screen. Unfortunately the person who opened my bag to check it was terrified of dolls and so they opened my bag and started freaking out, and since I was a small child and didn't understand what was going on I thought that I was in trouble for something.   Luckily everything got sorted out and we were able to go on our way, with my plushie still intact.
When I flew to Chicago in October, they made the announcement in the waiting area that they don’t serve food or drink on the plane, so make sure you buy something to bring on if you think you’ll need it.   Also, when I pack clothes I roll them instead of folding. They seem to fit better that way.
When I was 10 years old I got stuck in the Chicago airport overnight by myself.
I love everything about this story!
I absolutely love this, I'm imagining your grandma and Precious in matching bonnets and robes.
I was gonna say rehome the gf, but sounds like Precious has a great home with grandma. I think that is great!
I needed this today. Thank you!
T_T Thank you angelninja, you've ninjaed your way into my heart.
Ooooohhhh congrats!!!!!
Congrats on the new house!
Congrats
Woohoo! Congratulations on the new house!
Big congrats! That's such an exciting new step in life.
congrats! what's your favorite thing about your new house?
That’s so awesome, congrats!
Congrats!
Congratulations!
Wily's Wild Wonderings ✨
Morning! What will be the subject of your blog?
Ugh that's so anxiety-inducing. Hope you all are OK! My throat has been scratchy the past few days and I'm anxious even though I know it's illogical because I've only left my house 3 times in the past 3 weeks, and each time I was masked and outdoors only!
Hello, lovely!! 💗💞💜
Good morning! I hope you all feel better soon. 🤞🏼
Yay cats!
Good morning I'm hoping that you have a terrific Thursday
Cats are my favorite too. 😻
Slow loris <3 I added you on Goodreads!
Nobody can mess with a honey badger!!   That’s great! What kind of exercise did you do today? You’ll probably feel it tomorrow, but it’s a good feeling I promise   Just added you :)
Pandas are hilarious. I love videos of them and their handlers.
Platypus are really unique but it’s always so shocking to remember they’re very dangerous.
Did you see the recent article that the platypus glows under black light?!?
Stay positive keep positive in all positive things will happen. Keep smiling my friend
Drink coffee, that used to make my meetings more bearable 👍.   Today I leaned about quite a few new animals and this one starts with the letter 'q', gonna help me next time in Scrabble.
Good morning! I hope your meetings go by fast! ☀️
What is sad scene to experience.hugs, Were you close with your neighbor? Hoping that you have a great day
Hugs to you, that’s so sad for their family. 😞
Hoping that you find some energy to work your way into the kitchen
> At least everyone in the Americas  I love it when people acknowledge that other places exist! I'm only an hour and a half away from clocking out from work haha.
Oh I forgot about red pandas! They are adorable!   I wanna see how it turns out!
Good luck with the wood burner! I have this weird image in my mind of using one after reading that but I can't recall where I would have... OH maybe in wood tech class or whatever it was called in school. Thanks for unearthing that memory haha
A few more days left!!
Oh I love whale sharks too!! Hope the rest of your work week goes fast and smoothly :)
good morning! pancakes and bacon sound delicious mmm
Good morning ☀️
Good morning! ❤️🐈
37° here! No snow, just cold!
Sounds like a great start to the day! Have a good one
Yum, that dinner sounds delicious!
Isn’t it amazing how they can be up half the night and still be balls of energy in the morning?  While, we feel like something the cat drug in.
It’s okay to have down days. Just pick yourself up when you are ready. And if you need some help doing that, your friends are here to give you a little boost. We believe in you.
I’m in the same boat, it’s not a great feeling, but it won’t be forever.
Hugs..don’t give up! This is all temporary 💕
It’s not a cure all but vitamin D may help. This time of year does the same thing to me.
Wishing her good luck!
Good luck to her! Lots of ice in socks!
No need to worry. Though she might want to text though for a bit
You’re a good dad for wanting to be there for her! I hope it goes well!
Wishing her good luck! It’ll all go fine. 😀
Kids fine, thanks all for the luck, and well wishes.  Really shows the quality of the people in this group!
I hope you are too!
Good morning! I hope you are also well :)
Morning! Hope your Thursday is a good one!
Ooooohhhh nice!!! I hope you have a good day and 4 days!!!!
good luck to the kiddos! What's the hardest word you have to pronounce for them?
But they're majestic _members_; of the animal kingdom
What a great partner, I‘ll now go and pick up a chocolate croissant for dinner 😁
😘😘😘😘😘💜💜💜 Yes, the urologist in minneapolis blamed quite a lot on my period and hormonal fluctuations regarding the disorder. I am so sorry to hear of your suffering in this way! It cam be so debilitating 🥐💗
Awww
That is super sweet.
That is awesome! I love sea turtles. They're mesmerizing to look at!
Oh no. That’s awful. Glad you are all safe! Hopefully you’re able to go back home soon.
Hey! Welcome to reddit and RAOA!  For this subreddit only are there wishlists in our flairs. The directions to put your WL in your flair are in the about section of this group under user guide. It's best to do this on a desktop. Mobile is weird.
No, sorry. You have to be born with it there.  &#x200B;  j/k This is a giving subreddit so of course you can. That's part of the point!
Dogs are up there with my favorites for sure. Maybe even #2. My Harold is amazing. https://www.instagram.com/p/CJcZ8XSBhkf/?igshid=15t1hy3g5k8ac. Do you have a dog?
Woohoo you got this!
Hooray!!
Such a good feeling!! I hate having a car payment so I’m right there with ya!
some of my highlights are  like that.
Hooray for friday eve!! 😎💞🥰
Last night I ate chicken too, but I cooked it in the air fryer. It was a bit over cooked so we are trying again tonight.
That’s how I felt about the tofu I made today. I spend all night thinking about it!
Oh my gosh, that’s a lot of pets! 😂
Jealous of your pet otter! 🦦
Can i be your sister? I need all those pets in my life!
Those are some interesting pets!  I know they’re not legal in a lot of states. Were you in Florida?  Texas?
I'm C19 positive, it's awful
I am watching You on netflix. It isnt bad.
Recently I picked up stardew valley again and I've put so many hours into it in the last week.   What types of things are you into? Maybe some of us could give recommendations?
What streaming services do you have?  My brother got HBOMax and we started watching Young Sheldon. It’s a hoot!
I really enjoyed *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power* on Netflix (it has ended, so you won't have to wait for more) and *The Owl House* on Disney+ (still going, currently between the first and second seasons).
What new hobbies are you trying? I just got back into oil painting and I haven't felt so hyped and happy in a lonnnng time.
what systems do you have or are you a pc gamer?
Immediately!
Thats horrible!! I would be building a blanket fort and hibernating until the heat came back.   On the bright side, you don't have to worry about the stuff in your fridge getting warm because you can always just put it in a box outside to keep cold!
WHAT THE HELL? that's insane!!
I hate that. Like at least show some common courtesy to others on the trail.
Anyway, QOTD, I love cats.
Congrats on your productivity
Woot!   Guess who didn't? (It was me)
Woo hoo, sounds like a productive day!
Oh no!! Good vibes incoming!
Good vibes and prayer on their way. Hope he ends up feeling better.
Aw isn’t good vibes! Hopefully it’s just a small cold and it’s over quickly! 🤞🏼
Hopefully it’s just the weather!!! I always get that way when the weather gets bad
I'm so sorry you got laid off :( Hugs.   Cats are amazing. This is my cat [Astra](https://imgur.com/gallery/oAwjfXx) Maybe she will make you smile.
oh god that's awful :(   i hope cat therapy gives you some good comfort.
Aw man. I'm so sorry to hear this. Cats do make everything better. :(
So sorry to hear about your job loss! Such a challenging and uncertain climate for employment at the moment. I am sure things will get better and at least it’s given you some experience to prepare you for your next adventure :)  Snuggles with cats make everything better! I lost my furbaby Ollie in 2019 and I miss him every day. You just can’t explain the way an animals love can help heal and support during the darkest of times!   Hope things start to look up for you lovely 💜
i am so sorry you lost your job, oof. :( at least you'll be able to get unemployment until you get back on your feet. for the record, cats do make everything better. [here's a great cat to follow on insta!!](https://www.instagram.com/friendly.noodles/)
I like dogs, too. My little guy is curled up snoring in his little bed 💖  I can't bring myself to look it up, lol.
I looked it up and I was expecting a massive spider but it's not as bad lol It's a 'penis fish' I learn a new thing every day from reddit hahah
You can do it!
Hope your day ends up being painless!
That’s how I feel every day at my job, too! 😣 good luck!
Hi hi!!!
I always have my friends do it for me lol
Happy Thursday, friend! Wolves are super cool and mystical, so I'm with you there. Hope you have a wonderful day <3
😂🤣😅
Happy Thursday hope you are having a wonderful day thus far!
💖💖💖
Bake something quick or has a lot of waiting involved and do your work then. Make sure to take breaks to not wear yourself out!
I really want a dog too, but it's impossible to find one that suits us and our lifestyle, from a reputable breeder, that doesn't cost an absolute fortune :(  What dog would you get if you could?
I want a dog too! My husband and I are hoping to get a corgi if possible whenever we buy our own house.
Good job on getting some extra goodies
I'm so scared. 😬
Good morning! Hope you have a great day with your bestie :D
I should do laundry... Eventually. LoL
Good morning! Glad you are enjoying your time together!
Yay cats! Do you have cats of your own?
I hope you and the hubs can come to an agreement that works for both of you.  Fighting sucks.  Enjoy your babies in the meantime.  Kids and pets make life worth living.
God I also hate spiders. I'm okay dealing with small ones they're more an annoyance than anything else. But big ones? No thanks. Once when I was a kid my cat was clawing at the wall inside my wardrobe and she'd never normally do such a thing so I pushed my clothes aside and there was a spider bigger than my hand on the wall. I instantly ran and got my dad and the spider moved onto the set of drawers I had in my wardrobe so my dad carried the entire set of drawers outside with the spider sitting on it. Perks of being in Australia :\\
I would absolutely drive my car off the side of the road by accident if I saw a spider in there. I hate spiders and I also totally overreact. 😱  Also lots of hugs for fighting with the hubby. My boyfriend and I aren’t married but have been together for 9 years and we for sure go through rough patches sometimes. 😒
Its a fish that looks like a pp
You got this!!
Hope you get better soon!! Im curious why do you have to get another covid test despite being tested negative?
Bees are animals! :D
I feel your pain. I have had too many blah days! I hope you get lots of stuff done!
Excellent animal choices! Hope you feel better soon <3
Morning! Sending you good vibes for your long day ahead
Amazing news!!
That’s awesome! 🎉
Set up the books to make a sort of domino line?
I would definitely read and do some writing, and probably sneak a workout in if I was wearing something comfy enough 🤣
When work is slow for me (I work at a movie theater, when it's open anyway), I'll usually read a book or get on Reddit.
I had to google what a pika was and oh my gosh I need one now
That sounds cute, are they cute?
I love hummingbirds! They’re so interesting and pretty!
🥰 and they are so magical!
I was chased by an alligator when I was in my teens. They are .... not my favorite!
😭 I wasn’t expecting that.
🥰🥰  You are welcome!!!! I LOVE her work and I am so excited you enjoyed it!!!!
Best of luck!! 💞💜
You mind me asking what's wrong with him?
Pandas are cute, but it’s amazing they are still alive.
I can’t wait to have a grand kid to babysit!
grrrrr! sounds like things to add to your WL. ;)
Uhg, early mornings suck. Congratulations on the driver's license!! Also, I agree about the cookies. I like the raspberry macadamia cookies, but I feel like they aren't as good as they used to be. I love asking the staff to throw the cookies in the oven for like 25 seconds, they taste so good warmed up.
Congrats!
congrats!!! that is so exciting, oh my goodness. are you planning to get a car?
Congrats! 🎉
Idk but there is spray that you could put on the controller that makes it taste gross to your dog
lol pretty sure the military just uses regular xbox controllers, so yours is already miliary grade.   But yeah, I think your best bet is to make it gross to the dog.
good morning! sounds like you've had a productive morning so far :)  that's the same reason i love red pandas haha i thought i was the only one who thought that
Morning!   You've got a book and a cat in your lap? That sounds like an excellent start to the day!  Oh, man, I love those derpy red pandas, too 🤣
Awesome! It's great when you can get a workout in early. Enjoy your reading and have a great day. Red pandas are super cute!
Red pandas are sweet looking! 🥰
Me too did you see the one who was throwing paws at a rock lol
That sounds like an amazing morning!
I’m sorry to hear about your anxiety :( I hope you feel better about it soon. You’re doing great, no matter what your family thinks. Just focus on you and what you want right now ❤️
Oh no, sorry to hear about your anxiety and your family's reaction to your potential new relationship! :( If you ever want to chat, feel free to reach out. <3 Sending you positive vibes, friend.
Anxiety is really difficult. Don't beat yourself up too much. If they aren't talking to you that is their loss!!
Hugs! All the hugs!!! Feel better girl! I really hope you don't have it!
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that, That happened to me on the highway once. I will keep my fingers crossed for you.
boopsie hi <3 sending DONT BREAK IN AN EXPENSIVE WAY vibes to your car
Ok you got me. What is a grackle and why is it so awesome?
Crazy as usual. 😁 You?
Feeling better than yesterday! Hope you have a good day
May i ask why you are crocheting a toilet paper roll?
I love cats too. I like the big fluffy ones but I do like the nakey bald ones too. 😂
All the coffee! So tired!
Yay! Also great dog name
That’s exciting!
Have you heard a red fox laugh? It’s the best thing

What is your secret for the perfect tofu? My partner and I are trying to figure it out but ours keeps coming out a little bit wet.
You as well! Otters are SO cute.
bleh! I have had that happen to me and it sucks. Maybe you can check their online website and see if they sell just the code separately so you don't have to pay for the book twice?
When I studied in the states I had a prof who absolutely required you buy the textbook (that he wrote) new, and part of your grade depended on it (8%).   And then we just used it for the periodic table in it.
It’s a painful lesson a student must learn
I love Red Pandas <3
what is cardistry?
I feel you on that, except it was my dog being an asshole.  Any plans for the day?
My dogs step on my mother’s bladder if she doesn’t get up fast enough.
did you by any chance give them a call to tell them that you were struggling and would get things taken care of? also, can you get a copy of the disconnection notice?
Hahaha it's not picture-worthy yet. The cans are a mess still. But I can show you my newly-done spice drawer!
Yes, they're all clear! And I put little chalkboard decals on them, so I can label them but erase if the contents change at some point.
Thank you! Now that I can see what flours I have, suddenly I want to bake!
Well hello there, hadn't seen that we had a Panda in our midst. Nice to meet you 😊
I have a nasty cough, not covid thankfully, so I’ve been here for 2 hours waiting to find out what it is and me too!
They’re doing another x ray so I’m hoping the same
I do love them dearly and thank you! I’m hoping they release me soon and I get to go home
Nope, it just means in theory I can go home earlier... If there isn’t a problem with the stuff scheduled for tonight.
It’s bittersweet. I miss the crap out of my kids when they’re gone.  But it is nice to watch something other than Disney Channel and anime.
I’m going to start watching the new Night Stalker series on Netflix!
Thank you so much! ❤️
Thank you! ☺️
Thank you! 😀
I know! She doesn’t snuggle too often so days where she’s extra cuddly I appreciate so much! She’s definitely more an independent little girl haha. Thank you! I don’t think she has as many vaccines as she had at her 1 year appointment so hopefully it’s not as bad. 🤞🏼
Thanks, you too!!!
That's a good one!  I really liked it.
I had an accident when taking an shower I am in recovery mode hurts but it will get better. Hope you are doing okay💕
I have heard of dear Zachary is it on Netflix?
I haven't seen benny and joon I shall look that one up. Peanut butter falcon is a great movie.    And thank you for the well wishes things will get better just gotta keep on chugging along in life. 💜
That's the plan!
Thanks! Ive got everything I need and live in an apartment so I don't need to worry about shovelling show or salting sidewalks! I'm staying in until the weekend when I'll run out to get some groceries.
Thanks! My power goes out far too often, so I'm kinda surprised I still have power!
I'm ok, thanks! Staying inside and working. Really just like any other day since I don't have to leave the house. We didn't have much snow either (usually have several feet this time of year). It actually rained in the afternoon yesterday! This storm came in really suddenly.
I am doing a 90 credit Sociology, 60 credit English and 30 credit sports management BA. But my official subjects are Sociology and English, the Sports Management is credits I can use for a personal profil 😅
Go and start it! I am done for today and it feels glorious!
Do it! The first pokemon snap games is a classic, I still go back and reply it sometimes.   And thank you, you too!
Thank you!
thank you!
thank you, and will do!
thank you!
Thank you! I think he knows it too lol
He is 1.5 years old and honestly still has a lot of puppy energy.
He is a very happy boy! :)
Thank you :)
Thank you :)
That is true. Thank you for your kind words :)
Aw thank you so much :) this means a lot to me
Yes! They are so cute and chonky too.
Morning
Haha I have never seen those! My local little rescue zoo had a few baby kangaroo and they were the cutest! Stole my heart then.
Lmao
They are adorable! I hope you have a great day too!
👋🏼
Hope you have a great day!
I hope you do as well!
Ohh imagine. It’s the little snuffly sound they make.
Thank you 💚
Thank you 💚
Thank you
Yea, it is! We've been waiting for a while.
Thank you! Me too.
It’s actually a weird type of fish/worm thing lol
No spiders. It looks really cool.
Thank you! Heres hoping!
They are busy I guess! 500,000 people lost it and my neighborhood is low priority
Thank you!
Thank you beautiful, I hope so too ❤️
Thank you, that’s usually what I do as well ❤️
I did. They are so cool!
It is that! Did it help?
Thank you!
🖤🖤🖤
Thank you, my friend! <3
Thank you.
Thank you for your kindness :)
Thank you!
They are awesome. 🐘💚
Okay but what if I was a very small person? Like skinny and can't lift anything without running out of breath.
How did that even happen?
I mean if it were me.... I'd have definitely rehomed the girlfriend lmfao. First come, first serve, if I had a pet before you the pet isn't going anywhere.   But he was adamant on rehoming her within the family so he could still see her so that's good at least.
Glad it helped <3
<3
Thanks!!
Thank you!
Thanks!
Thank you!!
Thanks so much! We are so excited!
Thanks! It's so hard to pick! I'm really excited to have a studio space and a good backyard for my son and dogs!
Thank you!!
Thanks!
Thanks!
Itll be my favorite subject....ME! About living with a crohnic disease and I'll be getting married soon so all about that and marriage and life as a newly wed and i have just started being medicated for depression and adhd so what that is like (and also this is an experiment cause there's an 80% chance ill lose interest like every other hobby ive ever had)
I don’t leave much either but I feel like it’s closing in haha
🥰
Yes!!!
Thanks and you to! :) :) :)
Purrfect!!
♥
Precisely! I'd like to think of myself as a honey badger :P  I did some yoga and I also have this app on my phone called 7 Minute Workout. It gives you 30 seconds of 13 different exercises, with a break between each, but it has a bit of everything so it's a full body workout. Obviously a longer workout would be better but 7 minutes is better than 0 minutes haha.  Yay!
They're so mischievous ♥
I know! Not sure I'd like to come across one in the wild but in theory I love them LOL
Yes!!! So amazing!!
Thanks!
LOL! That's exactly what I'm doing now :D
Thank you!! I hope you have a wonderful day <3
Thanks, it was not at all expected. Not close with them, just to the extent of sharing a wall and our dogs saying hello on walks. Leaving flowers today for the surviving, all the same. That should help 💐
Agreed, sadness!! 💜💜💜
It's already technically Friday for me (it's 12:20 am Friday)
Lol.  My sil travels a lot for work and uses her points to travel for fun.  I’m always getting texts from her at 5 in the morning with pictures of their lunches or the sights.  When we went to Spain, i was very careful with my texts because my girls would have been super annoyed to get an early morning wake up from me.
I will try to remember to take a picture and update! I ended up with a migraine yesterday, so I didn't finish it. It will end up being a belated gift.
We got this!!
Thank you!!
What did you have for breakfast?
Hello how are you doing today?
Hi there how was your day
Here too! For once i want snow.  Our front yard is a poop field and i need to cover that all up or scoop it, lol
Ty we do love our Asian food
It really is. When I dropped her off with my parents on my way to work, she was just giggling and smiling. I, on the other hand, was barely moving. Ha!
Thanks chick. I probably need to be medicated.
Thank you all!!
I would have to say the hardest word I just did for them was bough. I kept pronouncing it bow instead.
Thx for the help, i will try to look into it then!
Well thank you, i will investigate more on that then xD
I don't have a dog anymore, but my friend has a boxer and a rottweiler. Whenever I go over there, they spend a lot of time around me.
Thanks so much!! My cousin sent me a pizza to cheer me on and motivate me to finish!! I got through the pile and bin and one bookcase! I’m so close!
Ty
Yes it’s a good mistake lol now to keep it up
I see nothing wrong with food being the highlight of the day 🥰🥰🥰😎💞
I adore my air fryer. ❤️
That doesn't include the birds and horses. :)
He was pretty amazing.
Yes! I will send you an honorary certificate if you like.

I’m sorry. COVID was a bitch. I suggest getting a subscribtion to Disney.+ and canceling it after a month.
I’m really sorry to hear that, I wish you a speedy recover.   Keep hydrated, eat healthy and get plenty of rest! How are you coping?
Wait....what season! I’ve seen the first two and loved it. Is the third one out yet?
Oh I have that, but idk why I found it difficult to get into compared to animal crossing. It does sound really fun though, do you play solo or in a group farm?  That would be amazing - quite honestly mostly gaming these days. I can’t go to the gym or swimming and due to the weather I’ve put cycling on hold.   I like movies/tv, fantasy books and games but honestly I feel burned out on most things as that’s all I’ve done all day, everyday for a year. I’m considering trying stuff completely different - possibly painting (I suck at it and have no clue where to start) and yoga (I really need to pick up exercise of some sort). Really speaking I should be developing my knowledge of programming languages but I have 0 motivation rn   Any recommendations would be most welcome! Are there any clubs on the sub?
I have Netflix, prime and Disney+   Oh I could take a look, but is it anything like the Big Bang theory? (Don’t hate me) but I’m one of the few who couldn’t get into that show
Thank you, I’ll take a look at them as I have both Netflix and Disney+. I’m currently finishing off the queens gambit rn
Honestly I’m looking at ideas right now, I quite fancy yoga. It’s funny you should mention oil painting as somebody asked me on my intro what my fav subject was back in my school days. I love painting, though I’ve never been good at it. Any tips on resources or where to start? How do you find it?
PS5, PC & Switch :)   PS5 I am actually enjoying and have a backlog - currently playing through Ghosts of Tsushima, Demon Souls and Cyberpunk. I share it with my fiancée though and it’s in the main room, so I don’t always play it. PC I’m bored and don’t know what to play since quitting WoW, I’m considering PoE new season today. Switch I am just completely bored of and probably won’t play until MH Rise releases.
I was under all my blankets yesterday before I got a hotel - being sick just making it worse
Yeah you're telling me. And I'm sick with Covid and I feel like shit. Can't open the fridge because if the power is out for three more nights we're just kind of all around screwed.
They were even lost in their cellphones, to boot! Sigh!
Thank you!!!
Thank you!
Thank you! I'm hoping so too!
I'm hoping so too!!!!
Oh she’s so pretty! And she’s black and white like my three!   I’m okay, just disappointed. It wasn’t a dream job but it was my first science job
Thank you. I’m okay, just disappointed. It wasn’t a dream job, just my first science job.   My cats are doing a good job of cheering me up :)
I’m so sorry you lost your baby :( we lost one of ours last summer and it’s a horrible thing to go through.   Thank you for your kind words ❤️
I don’t qualify for unemployment in my country because my fiancé earns too much :(   That is a great cat!
I got two 7month old pups and an old man who snores like a train but we love them all the same.
Thank you 🙏 new knowledge has been gained without the loss of my sanity
Thank you! I just keep telling myself to get through 1 more day... every day LOL
Haha thanks, it’s virtually teaching kindergarten, with 2 half day classes, but today is a half day (for parent teacher conferences) so I have an overlap of my 2 classes for an hour. So 33 5 year olds, from 10:30-11:30 with no special/prep time today. Then parent conferences after. 🥲 I’m not too optimistic about today but at least 1 student will probably say something at some point today that makes me internally giggle, and hopefully after conferences today less children will just wander off screen or hold actual hammers while I’m teaching. 😅
We got this! *Mister Mister* from Bronze Radio Return plays in the background
Thank you! I hope that you have a wonderful day as well, my friend 💖
Thank you so much; I hope that you are as well!
I might do that tomorrow! Thanks for the encouragement!
Dogs are so expensive nowadays, but when you get one from the shelter there's still a lot of costs in like medical form!  I would like a german shepherd/ retriever mix but I'm not that sure yet, many dogs are great!  What dog would you get if you could have any?
Ooh corgis are adorable! I hope you get to get one!  My fiance and I want a german sheppard, retriever mix but we're not sure yet!
Mine is now a wrinkled mess in a basket.  Sigh.  I need to hand that stuff up immediately but it rarely happens
Yes just one! She's a ragdoll her name is Snowy (she's 14 I named her when I was a kid haha!)
We've been together almost 10 years, so it's just a lot of stress, etc... Both of us have issues we are dealing with, on top of COVID19 taking over. We'll get there, it's just frustrating.
One of the reasons I can't go to Australia. 😂
He doesn't do well with being away from home so it makes it tough.   We have spiders in our garage but thankfully they have never made it into my car. I have named one Aragog.
The most disturbing fish I ever saw was in London, had an almost human like face
<3
work. I have now gotten one every week, three weeks in a row.  *shrugs* they are trying to be overly safe I guess?
Thank you!! <3
Thank you!!!! 🥰
I appreciate it! Have a lovely day yourself!
Yessss I already left the house~!
hahahaha.. oh I'm sure the shelving supervisor would love that
That seems like so much in day, you'd be surprised at how fast it goes by when you aren't doing anything in particular..like I've been here for two hours and I've had to do maybe 45 mins of work but other than that just watching old Bon Apetit videos and potty breaks lol (the bathroom is kinda far away)
Soooooooooo cute!
that sounds pretty terrifying 😳 i appreciate them from a distance!!
Thank you 🥰
No not at all! He isn’t sick or anything. He owns a catering company and it’s getting hit really hard because of the pandemic. I wanna try to raise a little bit of money so he can keep it alive and can go back to working once large gatherings are allowed. My plan is to surprise him with this for his birthday at the end of next month
Yeah...
$54 for a hole punch!! They have lost their got damn minds.
Maybe in a year when I've saved up for a used one. It's not a priority for now since the old folks actually encourage me to use theirs (paying gas of course).
Ooh good idea!
Morning! Yup, it’s not bad :) you’re certainly not the only one they’re fantastic to watch
It’s not too bad so far, though my chest is sore from my workout haha. What’s your plan for the day?
Thank you so much! Hope you have a great day too 😃
Yes! That's one of my favorites. Or the one where he gets scared of a zookeeper
Thank you so much 😭 I really appreciate that. I needed it. 🖤🖤🖤
Thank you sooo very much. 🖤 I appreciate you!
Thank you! That’s what I’m trying to tell myself! 🖤
Thank you!
[Grackles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_grackle) are noisy, lively birds that are especially common in parking lots here in the south. They are widely hated by everyonen except me. I think they're funny and full of life.
Not too bad ! Just waiting on my new headset to arrive so I can cry at fifa and portal!
Thankyiu! Glad you are feeling better!!!
Its an amigurimi I'm making for an exchange :) its my own pattern. If you'd like I can totally link a picture. I'm almost done with it
Big fluffy cats are the absolute best cuddle partners. I'm that weirdo that loves kitty cat tuna breaths. 🤣
Yes I have ^^ Fox sounds are mixed parts hilarious and horrifying and I love it
Make sure it is dry! I pressed it between two paper towels for about 5 mins with a stock pot on top. Then I lightly pressed around it whole block. I cut it into the pieces I wanted and pressed it with towels again. If you are doing small pieces I wouldn’t press when they are small but press while cutting as much as you can. Put the oil into the pan and make sure it costs the whole thing. Put the seasoning into the oil. I did salt garlic and pepper. Put the tofu in the pan and LEAVE IT ALONE!!! The tofu will tell you when it is done. It will stick to the pan but don’t worry about that. Once it has crisped up enough it will let go. You can check it every so often by shaking the pan. Once a few have loosened you can poke the others and if they come away easily it’s time to flip them to another side. Repeat for as many sides as you want, however I usually do them only on two sides.
Dude right? That's a great idea, though. I'll definitely check that out! Thanks sm!
Cardistry is the performance art of card flourishing. Unlike card magic, cardistry is meant to be visually impressive and appear very hard to execute.

I work at 3, so just nothing til then lol
My cats do that like it’s their job lol
Apparently if I can figure out how to use their website I can get the disconnect notice there.   I did not call them because I thought I had til the 25th to pay it. I thought I was ok.   I did go ahead and call the gas company just in case they had something up their sleeve. Got payments arranged.
Oh Love that! I just use chalk marker which go off in the dishwasher without the labels since they always got lost when washing the container 😅
I'm new to the mix! Nice to meet you too 🙂
Feel better soon!
Ahhhhh. Well, that sounds good too!
I hear you, and I almost envy that stage. I'm ready for something other than CoComelon and PJ Masks lol
Isn't it great? I liked the song Zazz. It makes me happy!
Oh goodness I'm so sorry I hope you feel better soon!  I am doing ok just tired!
It used to be but not positive if it is now but it is on Amazon
It's an older movie with Johnny Depp. It's not one of is well known movies, but I love it.   💚💚
Very cool!! Do you know what you want to do after graduation yet?
AWW cutie is in his teenage stage then huh?
Aww, baby kangas are adorable 💖
Thank you!!
Thank you! I had a wonderful day with the kids. I hope your day was just as wonderful!
It's just the cutest thing 😍
YW
Weird... Learning all sorts of things this week!
Hmmm....
You're welcome!
It was a long time ago but I think it helped some!  I hope it helps you too!  I have to take benzos now after kids because my anxiety is worse.  If you ever need to talk about the things making you anxious or just anxiety, feel free to PM me.  It’s been 20 years now that I’ve been dealing so I think I’ve tried it all!
I’ve also taken propranolol for anxiety and it did help when I was younger.  I hope it provides some relief for you.    I also suffer from anxiety and a number of phobias.  DM me if you ever need to chat!
Yw
I am trying to do a meditation streak! Thanks for your inspiration. 🧘🏻‍♀️
Oh then just bribe the pilot for help. They take cigarettes, playing cards or a bag chi chi if you can make some in time.
I was flying home from visiting my grandparents and there was a storm in Chicago once we landed
We just got a house earlier last year and are still organizing and putting things together 🙈
Ohhh okay that sounds fun, I’d read the heck out of it :)  What about “My Wily Mind” or “My Wily Life and Me”?
For real lol
Thank you
Completely agree, 7 minutes is much better than none, sort of like reading something is better than nothing at all.
They are! It's like constant chaos.
Haha must admire from a distance.
Yup, coffee the drink which makes the professional workers work 👍, trusted worldwide
Are you in Australia or NZ?
Yes! Then weekend party! Social distanced of course. 😂
i usually skip breakfast and wait till lunch! but i had a cafe latte protein shake and it was pretty good
Pretty good. It has been a busy day just trying to get stuff done. Also, it was my husband’s birthday so we spent the day together and the kids made him a cake.
It was pretty good. Thank you for asking! How was your day? How’s Mr JJ?
Ugh I have GOT to clean the back yard. I keep forgetting!
Lol. I remember those days.  My girls are 25, 22 and 21 now so that was a long time ago.  Now i stay up worrying about them
I totally support the use of medication. I take something daily for my anxiety and depression. The trial-and-error phase of finding the right med(s) is a bitch, but its totally worth it if you find something that works.
I'm already confused 😅 Bow can be pronounced in a couple different ways at least
Looks like you got it figured out. Great!  And welcome!  Did you do an intro post?
I’m just learning mine. We made good zucchini last night. The chicken nuggets were good the other day. Other stuff we just have to figure out the best cooking time for.
Yes please!! 😊 Do u have pics of you with the otter? I love seeing videos of otters.... And foxes!!
Have Disney + already lol  And the power at the house is out, so wifi down
Or visit RedditBay sub :)
Crappy - power got knocked out and it's suppose to snow tomorrow.  Drinking as much water as I can, I have no appetite and my partner keeps trying to feed me fast food because we aren't opening the fridge. I'm tired of sitting on an ice cold potty.
Nope not yet! But i binged sabrina and bridgerton and am waiting for the magicians to come out with the new season!
Cool :)
Pre-pandemic, we have some great private art schools in my area that I used to attend in person. Now that everything is online, I subscribed to Schoolism and New Masters Academy. It's great if you're into entertainment art or academic painting!  I recently found Arthur Gain on YouTube who has great demos and tutorials on there and Twitch. His patience and explanations feel like any quality class I've paid for in the past. You can watch for free before diving into any subscriptions.  I decided to start oil painting again because I was afraid of it! The past year has taught me to dive in and stop doubting myself. So far this month, I've been loving what I've created even if it's not where I want to be yet.  What do you like to paint?  And I believe no one ever becomes good at something without consistency and practice. -\_\^ Even if you do start out with some talent, knowledge and practice will take you way further. Good luck!
I hear cyberpunk is a lot of fun! I want to play it once I get my new solid state drive. I highly suggest dead by daylight and phasmophobia for PC.
I'm glad you found a hotel <3 hopefully they manage to fix the problem faster than expected!
Thanks! She's definitely a spoiled fur-baby. I love her so much.   I hope another science job comes along for you soon! What field of science are you in?
It’s awful to go through as a pet owner, it’s like losing a family member :(.  Your very welcome <3.   I’ve noticed you are new on this sub and haven’t added your wishlist to your flair :). Do you need any advice/guidance? :)
🤣🤣🤣 We sure do!
Ugh yeah that sounds tough. My cousin also teaches kindergarten and is remote right now, and it doesn't sound easy at all. And LOL! I bet you see some wild things.
Thank you!! :D
Thank you
I've never owned a dog before so I'd be wary of getting a dog from a shelter because there are so many behavioural issues they might (or might not!) have. It's really hard to tell what you'll get with a shelter dog so while my heart would love to get a rescue, my head knows it's better if I wait until I have experience with dogs so I can give them a good home.  I'd really love a dachshund, but I think my boyfriend wants a slightly bigger dog haha.
I hope so too! Aw that mix sounds cute too <3 Do you have plans to get one soon or just in the future at some point?
Same. I used to be good at it but not lately!
I bet she's perfect, that's a great name lol
I know the feeling.  We are in the same boat here
I don't know how I'd survive if I lived alone here haha!
That sounds like a nightmare come to life
LOL that's a good point. In reality I'd probably end up doing like 1 of those 3 things haha
It was!  I still dislike even the sight of them.  My kiddo wanted a sarcosuchus toy for Christmas and I had such a hard time buying it because I knew I’d have to keep touching it to put toys away!  Where was the gator zoo you went to?  He’d probably really enjoy that but I think I’d have to have someone else take him!
WHO HAS THAT KIND OF MONEY TO SPEND ON A HOLE PUNCHER???
It's another teaching/tutoring/curriculum writing day for me.   Hopefully I'll have time to do dishes. It's a pretty mundane day 😂
Lol they are so funny
You're welcome!! <3
It is hard. I am not currently speaking to my biodad or step mom because of their ridiculous views on COVID19 and politics.
Ooooo which headset?!?
Oh sure! Whats an amigurimi? Ive never heard of it before.
Or their stinky toe beans. They stink so good. 😂
> Make sure it is dry! I pressed it between two paper towels for about 5 mins with a stock pot on top. Then I lightly pressed around it whole block.

No worries and happy to help! My partner had to do this for his psychology cram class this semester. Luckily they had a rent a license thing that was affordable.
Lol NEAT!
Nice! I'm working until 4, and then I have to do these doggone dishes 😂
Thank you!
Not gonna lie...I don’t miss those days so much 😂
Oh god, my daughter loves Cocomelon. I know all the songs by heart now. And also, how many variations of ‘5 little mobiles jumping on the bed’ can they make?!?! 🤦🏼‍♀️
Yeah! :D
Okays I have amazon I shall give it a watch as my first movie of the day
I love Johnny Depp he is a favourite of mine I shall check it out.
Not a clue! So, well, obviously a MA but I am not sure what’s the exact direction I’ll take then. I’ll either have a clue by then or do I’ll do something that’s a bit more generic ☺️
Must be! Honestly, sometimes the stink eye he gives me when I ask him to do something he doesn't feel like...just like a teenager. LOL
Ty honey ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I’m in the same boat as you.  I graduated from propranolol to a daily benzo and more immediate working benzo post kiddo.  I was conflicted about taking them at first but realized I don’t want to pass my anxiety onto them if I can help it! I hope you’ve found a combo that works for you.
Ty too honey ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I still haven't mastered how to meditate. Working on it!
Oh man, it's such a chore! Congrats to you too! Are you enjoying it at least?
Absolutely! There's a bit of advice I keep reading here on reddit that goes something like "anything worth doing is worth doing badly", which I've really taken to heart (probably a bit too much!).
Australia!
yes!!! im in!
Fasting?
How sweet as this I betcha he enjoyed the homemade cake years ago used to buy them in the store and pay to have them decorated 2030 $40 I can do it at home for less than $5 lol
I had another good day at work Mr. JJ is doing just fine he was very active today on zoom the children a loving him when he comes in to visit during school lol
I've always had terrible anxiety but my parents never gave a shit. I'm having a trouble taking control of it bc it feels like such a waste of money. But my husband found me a therapist so I start in a couple of weeks. But every month right before my period starts, I get suicidal. Just for a day or two. But it's like I can physically feel it happening but the day it does I still can't get myself out of it.
I did not, is it something mandatory? How is it an intro post? I have seen some on here
Chat me your address and I'll make you one. ;)    You can see [Zot the Otter](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CJeIwA_hacC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) here. I'm the girl with braids midway through but mostly this is about Zot.
Do you have to be invited to that?
Got one for last night - I slept here and the bf stayed at the house in case the power came back on. It didn't lol.
I’m biologist, so I’m in decent demand right now but it’s been hard with autism to get into work.
I just posted in the adopt a newbie thread, I am very new! I didn’t know how this sub works, I thought it would be very rude of me to come in with demands haha i will take all the guidance :)
I have seen some things I can not unsee. 🙈 I had one day where for the entire class a student licked the camera. WHY?!!!! 😭🤣
Unfortunately we can't get a dog anytime soon. We don't have enough money saved up for if anything happens, the vet bills would just be too high.
She would've been named Fluffy if I'd not suggested it (my brother's suggestion) soooo definitely love the name Snowy haha
Lots of hugs coming your way!
I could not!!
It was. A lot of aquatic life is horrific. This was at the zoo, can't recall what kind of fish it was
it was in orlando!! i think it was called gatorland. but i think there's a few like it around the south of the us
Apparently “Happy” people. Ha ha
Hey mundane days happen! Are you doing anything not mundane this weekend?
Oh boy, my extended family is that way. I feel your pain! It’s a struggle. I’m so sorry you have to deal with that :(
Just a cheap turtle beach one! Needed a new one so yeah ahah
https://imgur.com/a/hIPc1KE
Its like a little crocheted cute item or animal- it can really bring a cute life to things. I'll actually make a little album of the amigurumi I've made so you can see examples
That's awesome! I really hope I can get a similar option because I would hate to have to go buy a new book. I love your username btw!
Yeah... I think I got enough under my belt for both of us 🤣
Seriously!! Between that and "Super Simple Songs" playing on our Alexa, I'm a regular children's jukebox.
lol
Thank you! I'm enjoying being able to go at it at my own pace for sure. It's really nice to finish a room, stand back and think, "Yup, this is good. Let's keep it this way and not move for a while."
Awesome, what part? :D my sister used to live in Melbourne!
hmm unintentionally bc i don’t get hungry till 10am ish so i figure i should just wait till lunch instead
He loved it and the kids enjoyed making it! It is so much cheaper to make at home and honestly this way it is full of memories 😊💕
Aw that’s awesome! 😀 My daughter loves looking at my Mom’s cats when we FaceTime her.
I feel for you, my friend. I know what it’s like to feel suicidal (but I never noticed a correlation with my period). I see a psychiatrist for meds, and a psychologist for talk-therapy, and the combo is helpful for me.  However, the connection to your period is a red flag for an hormonal imbalance and could be a symptom of PMDD (like you mentioned in your other post). A primary care doctor or GYN would be your best bet for getting evaluated/treated.  J is the best for finding you a therapist. He is such a good husband. But you may need more than talk-therapy to address this problem.  I am here if you ever need me. 😊
I don’t think it’s mandatory, but it’s a good way to connect with others on the sub. Basically you tag it as [Intro] and write a few things you’d like to share about yourself. Like I probable wrote that I’m a musician and I like birds and dogs. Then people respond and say things like welcome, but they might also share your interests. Then you’ve found a new buddy!
😯😯😍😍😍OMG!!!! Zot is so big!!! I did not know they got that big!!!! What a sweet baby!!! 💛💛💛
Nope it’s public
I am on the spectrum as well. I understand a little bit of that struggle. What are some of your interests in biology that you like to work with?
Haha not too worry! The adopt a newbie thread will be extremely helpful I’m sure :). If you look at the about section in the sub it will have information on how to make a wishlist and how to copy this into your flair so the community can access your wishlist :) the guide is really helpful if you have a read.
LOL!!!! I would be trying very hard not to start laughing.
I completely hear that! I don't know if we've really budgeted well enough for that either to be honest.
A lot of it is also beautiful too. It’s a wonderfully terrible combination.
Not really, lol. I'm pretty boring right now. I'll just be meal prepping, reading, relaxing, and going for treadmill "walks" through different countries
It does make things a little more difficult, but I just keep saying it's their loss.
Turtle Beach is good! I usually like their products!
These are cute 😍
Oh they’re adorable! You did such a good job!
Thank you!
I'm in Queensland. I have some relatives in Melbourne!
Oh I agree with you i think the last birthday cake i spent $47 on a Blue's Clues cake for my daughter and then after that i started making them at home and they were absolutely delicious everybody loved it my daughter enjoyed helping decorated as well.
Yes definitely enough to bring you smiles right
Thank you so much! And you're totally right. I need a team lol I'll get to it eventually. Hope you're having a good week.
Well that sure seems nice, I'll look into it, I'm fairly new to using reddit, as in daily using it, so I'm still learning my way around stuff, college has me super stressed and busy, this is a way of relaxing a bit
He was cute, but he could (and did) bite too.
I couldn’t get in
I did some of my masters in biomedical science and synthetic biology, that was super fascinating! The job I just left I was doing covid testing which isn’t as fun but made me feel super useful. I like clinical stuff and I just love learning new stuff.
Thank you, I will have a read!
True, some fish are adorable, others are eldritch terrors. This is why I stay at home
It’s pretty good so far! Just need to save up for modern warfare remaster now and get teleported back to how I games when I was in  school!
Thank you!
Awesome! We drove along the coast of Queensland up to Airlie Beach when we visited :)
Absolutely! She has two stuffed cats that she loves carrying around all day. A gray one and a ginger one. Here’s a [picture!](https://imgur.com/a/KWtevyc) 😸
That sounds really awesome! Your love of science is awesome and encouraging to see!
Same safer and warmer to watch them through my phone screen lol.
I have heard that that is a really good game, though I am really bad at shooters so I usually don't play them.
Ooo nice the beaches here are really lovely
Thank you! Everyone says that, I get told my face lights up when I talk about science
I had the original on my 360 but not played cod properly for a while. I love FPS stuff but way more into fifa and RPG now
Yeah, we really enjoyed the Gold Coast, it was so beautiful there, and the Whitsundays are stunning. I wanted to go snorkeling but we flew into Australia during a cyclone, and everything had been bleached 😭
That's an awesome trait! Don't lose that!
I have been stuck on WoW!
That's such a shame about the snorkelling! My brother had a school field trip where they were meant to go snorkelling but it was cancelled for the exact same reason.
Ohh I’ve never played that!!
I absolutely love it! Been playing off and on for about 9 years.
I may have to give it a try!
I believe it is free to play to a certain level!
I will investigate !!

You're welcome!   I was torn between getting you one big thing or a bunch of small things...and I picked a bunch of small things so maybe JUST MAYBE you can have a relaxing day of treats and goodies.

AS BLACK AND BITTER AS MY SOUL.   Which entails two packets of Truvia and a good helping of hazelnut creamer.
Iced coffee with a bit of hazelnut cream 🥰
Black! Like my soul.  Hahah
In a delicious cake! 🍰 Lol. I'm not a coffee fan, personally.
I take it and give it to my hubby for I do not like coffee
Loads of sugar, a good bit of creamer, and usually room temperature (because I always sort of forget that I have coffee until after it has already cooled).
Usually with just a little milk if it's drip coffee or French press. If it's espresso then I'll do a flat white or a latte so that it feels fancy!
I want to barely taste the coffee lol. When I'm home I take it with a good amount of creamer, and when I'm out I want it to basically be a dessert. One day I'll actually like the taste of plain coffee, but today is not that day.
Any way I can get it.   &#x200B;  Home: Black or with cream. Sometimes with warm foam.  Out & about: Cappuccino on the dry side.  High-falutin':  Throw a drizzle of caramel on top the foam, but not in the coffee.
Black! ✔️
Sugar
Either black or cream with no sugar
Not a big fan of coffee. If I have it i like it light and sweet.
Black with a side of coffee. Lol. I do like lattes on occasion as well and sometimes a good cap
Extra light extra sweet 😂
3 Sugars. No cream
It depends but since I've become pregnant my husband gets me a grande decaf with 3 sugar in the raw and half and half (he works at Starbucks and just has to walk in to get it free ❤)
It depends on the day! Usually black but sometimes I like a splash of milk or cream.
Black, without coffee beans, with some added tea leaves for flavour, and then some milk
My absolute favourite is a soy peppermint mocha!  My friend sent me a bag of peppermint mocha coffee grounds so I've been able to enjoy it at home 😁 only I generally keep lactose free dairy milk instead of soy at home because it's easier to use for cooking and baking.  When I'm not treating myself to the fancy grounds I use a nice, local, medium roast and add some Almond vanilla creamer.  Basically any sweetened, lactose-free coffee will do!
Cold.  Cold brew, lots of heavy cream, usually SF vanilla, and some s&l
I love my coffee machine. Just need some posh flavours to add to my collection. I love a caramel macchiato or hazelnut latte
With powdered creamer
I can't make my own coffee I have others make it for me and like if I go to Starbucks I have to find out what they can make with the blonde roast and get Half shots of it because I like the effects of coffee but I can't stand the taste but I I also cannot do sugary sweet coffee.
Decaf.  Whatever milk alternative is available.  Two sugars. ☺️
Lots of cream, Lots of sugar like I took it as a child when my grandpa would make and fix it up for me.
I either drink mine black no sugar or get the most extravagant latte with tons of whipped cream, there is no in between
Hot, milk.
Soy milk and some carmel powdered coffee enhancer
I don't.
I like a little bit of sugar with some coffee mate creamer! Or if I’m making a latte or cappuccino with my new espresso machine (it’s so dope!) I use almond milk :)
SUPERRRRR sweet
Sugar with a bit of cream
I don’t. Thanks.
I like my coffee the same way I like my dumbbells/barbells. Strong and black.   If it’s filtered then 3 scoops.   Machine? Double espresso.  Occasionally I’ll have some stevia (natural alternative to sugar) if I’m feeling like a sweeter taste
Cream and 2 Splenda
With a splash of almond milk! I'm lactose intolerant unfortunately :')
Just black 😈
With some Italian sweet creme creamer if I have it :) if not just milk and suga
Iced Caramel Latte!!
Not at all!! Haha. Coffee is not my thing!
Lots of milk and sugar- aka iced cinnamon caramel latte! Also I can only drink decaf 🥲
International delight creamer. If I'm making cold brew, I'll do a splash of milk and a little more than a splash of creamer
Very strong, a touch of agave syrup and heavy cream whipped into it with my little electric whisk, just until a dark caramel color. Today's coffee was perfect!  I went a couple weeks without buying the cream and it was greatly missed. Today was day one of the return to creamed coffee!
Almond milk and sugar! Unless I'm getting it from somewhere, then usually hazelnut.
Cold as can be, with milk substitute!
Almond milk and vanilla creamer! Or a chocolate creamer :) with lots of ice
As an Irish Cream Freeze from Dutch Bros.
Iced with sugar free caramel syrup and almond milk
Mocha frappe. That’s pretty much the only coffee I drink.
On the rare occasion I drink coffee.. lots of sugar and lots of creamer.
I intermittent fast, so while fasting its black, when I'm not fasting I use heavy cream.
I LOVE COFFEE. Stereotypes are usually bad, but this Cubana loves her coffee.   At home, I will drink it hot with a dash of almond milk. At Christmas time I will buy a peppermint syrup and use that with some dark chocolate sauce for a "Peppermint Mocha" vibe. I usually have vanilla and hazelnut syrup as well, for when I make myself a latte. I bought myself a Nespresso a year ago and it was a great investment. I also bought a frother from Target to go with it. I like to make espressos in it, and either have just that or add it to some frothed milk for a latte.   I like to get coffees from shops or McDonalds or gas stations, but I usually just enjoy it at home. I have some form of coffee most days out of the week. I am three hours away from the nearest Starbucks, but I enjoy their hot or iced lattes.
Do you make iced coffee at home?
Aww that’s sweet!
I feel that!
I love flat whites!
I love caramel!
Any sugar?
😂
Same
Oh this sounds amazing. I must try this
In fact I’ve put it on my wish list 😀
I love this!
Ohh an espresso machine!? That sounds amazing!
Ohh when I hit up Starbucks that’s my second favorite drink!
It’s definitely an acquired taste
I just ordered the caramel macchiato international delight creamer. I’ve never had it before.
That sounds lovely!
Oh that sounds nice!
Oooh that sounds really good.  You can’t go wrong with something Irish cream flavor
I’d love a fancy coffee maker! Once I get a job it’s high on my list of things to purchase.
Yeah I do! I don't even like buying iced coffees anymore from places because I find its always like all cream and the syrup they put in lol.  I really don't do anything special to make mine though, I just make coffee like normal and then pour it over ice. It's better when the coffee isn't super hot but I still make them sometimes like that because I don't want to wait 😂 then whatever is left I usually will put in the fridge so I can use it the next day.
They're the best <3
Nope, no sugar or creamer!
I think the peppermint mocha grounds are only available seasonally as I can't find them online now... But it's one of Starbucks' festive menu items, but you can get it all year round if you ask.  Most other coffee shops also have peppermint syrup on hand too.
It’s a balance lol
Yeah! I’m not really good with it but it still tastes great!
Yasssss!!!✨
Thats a good one! My favorite is thei frosted sugar cookie. It's a holiday one. The rest of the year, I typically do the colostomy sweet cream or vanilla cannot cream
It sure tasted lovely!
It's soooo good.
I really love it. I got it on sale for somewhere around $160, so it's not cheap, and the capsules are not cheap, but having something so yummy to drink at home is worth it for me. I hope you can get a fancy coffee machine someday!
It’s because you’re sweet enough on your own.
That’s probably the best typo I’ve ever seen 😂
☺️❤️
🤣🤣🤣🤣 oops

Hello,  I have been on reddit for a while and participated in other random giving groups as both a gifter and giftee.  I tend to post in random threads regarding different topics. To be honest it's been a tough couple years. My only and younger brother passed away in August 2019 which was a total shock to us all. Most recently my beautiful loving mother passed away on Monday 1/11/21 unexpectedly in her sleep. It has been really tough and I was hoping to come here and spread some cheer since even though 2019 to present hasnt been good to me, hopefully I could brighten someone else's day.  If you have any questions feel free to ask. Maybe answering questions will help keep me occupied so I won't feel as bad as I do right now.

Hello and welcome to the sub!
Hello and welcome! I'm so sorry for your loss 💛
Hello and welcome! I'm sorry to hear about your recent losses!
Well before covid, I enjoyed going to sporting events and traveling. Have taken my parents on 15 cruises and had 2 scheduled for last year that were cancelled. I'm a huge baseball fan and am a season ticket holder for the local team for the last 12 years.  I also enjoy video games and reading. Played a lot of Animal Crossing during this pandemic. Also been big on Among Us and some other indie titles.
Sorry I haven't replied sooner but as you can imagine a lot is going on. Anyways for snacks it really depends as sometimes I'm craving something sweet or sometimes something savory or non sweet. If it's sweet I'm looking for I like to find fig newtons or some chocolate (hershey kisses or milk chocolate m&ms). If I'm looking for non sweet then red pepper hummus with soft pita bread or french onion dip.
I love traveling also! I went on my first cruise in 2018 and it was quite an experience!!
I love fig newtons! hummus and pita bread sounds really good too.   Hugs. <3

I’m fasting for 48hrs, so not much unless you count water or supplements! I have also being doing omad for a very long time. So just dinners for me anyway. I honestly can’t remember the last time I ate breakfast or lunch. Probably summer last year.
Not sure yet. 'Tis the constant eating disorder recovery and general indecisiveness/inability to cook well struggle lol. Have a job interview at 4, though, so I really should be figuring something out quick.
I did a layered casserole with lentil, eggplant, mushroom, white sauce, seasoning. I dislike eggplant, but this was like stroganoff, will try again.
It's currently dinner time for me! I have a cheese and ham  omelette. It's the first time I've cooked it myself ☺
Cajun trail mix because I don't feel like making more effort. 🤣
Does tortilla chips and dip count as a lunch?
Mmm fried sausage with onions and potatoes!
Half a can of Monster Energy.
Dumplings
Chicken nuggies and BBQ sauce... like the proper adult that I am
Brown rice and short ribs!
Cheddar and avocado quesadilla 🤤
I had a bagel w/ cream cheese and some watermelon
I believe I had "sleep" for lunch.
Leftover thicc chicken soup
Not sure! That’s part of my daily struggle, hah!
Hmmmm.  Cheese and apples.
I usually don’t eat breakfast or lunch, just dinner, sometimes I’ll eat earlier in the day, maybe today will be the day
Hot pockets
Subway from yesterday
Lunch was breakfast XD a cheese sandwich
I had a chicken salad sandwich
Chicken salad on a bed of spinach! I’m on day 14 of whole 30!
I made tuna yesterday so a tuna sandwich with cheese balls and cucumbers!
Subway sandwiches! Italian and steak!
I had a frozen pizza with a nice salad
I made salmon and roast broccoli (my favorite!!!) :)
Chicken salad sammie and some grapes.
A ham, cheese, pickle, and tomato panini on polish rye bread. Yummmm
Greek pasta salad!
Instant ramen with an egg!
Mixed lettuce, honey roasted chicken strips, carrots, and olive oil. I was a good girl.
I'm on campus, so I eat whatever's provided. Today it was a Tomato and Mozzarella Sandwich, which was briefly microwaved
No more food for me! All meals have come and gone today 😅
Sandwiches with ham and eggs. Also fruit tea.
Green salad and potato chips. Because then it's "balanced."
I think I woke up because I'm hungry.  <.<  I have food, but nothing I want to eat.
Sonic chilli cheese fritos wraps and powerade.
I had some ramen
I had pickled bologna, cheese and crackers.  Not my usual lunch, but there wasn't much in the fridge.
I just had some turkey and Swiss sliders for a late lunch. They were yum
We went to Shake Out, I got their Philly sandwich with fries. It was alright.
PB&J
How do you survive?
Did you get the flip right, first try?
Story of my life... also one of my old go tos for lazy/no time for lunch while I was teaching
Yes
Mos def
champ
Mmmmwhat kind
Hahaha. Pregnancy cravings?
How were the ribs?
Ooooh yum
Sounds good
I haven't had cheese balls in YEARS!  Gonna have to get me some now.
My mom always puts grapes in the chicken salad. I prefer pineapple in mine.
Love ramen
Good for you! I’m proud!
I like the way you think....and also I like the sound of chips BRB (as a preggo I should NEVER click on these food ones 🤣 too many ideas for snacks)
Are potato chips the new crouton?
What kind? I love Ramen
Yum
You get used to it! A 48hr fast is very easy for me. I usually go 72hrs or more, but my dad is doing his first fast so I’m doing it at the same time for moral support. The one meal a day thing is completely normal for me now. The health improvements for me are incredible. It’s not for everyone, but at the same time I believe everyone should do a 72hr fast at least once.
I'm going to say yes, but I kind of split it into two before... But both halves flipped perfectly! 🙃
Chicken and mushroom
Nuggies are anytime cravings. ❤
They were pretty good! From Trader Joe’s
They are ridiculously good! My parents always get them around Christmas time and since I couldn’t see them this year I got some myself!
they're sooo good, and truly a staple of college life!
Yup!
Just plain old chicken flavor
So good!
Does it help with losing weight at all?
Great job!!
Oh nice
lol ok. True
Mmmm Trader Joe’s!!!
Omg yes! Broke college life.
Yeah it did for me, I lost a lot after my first 72hr fast, especially as my appetite was greatly reduced after it. I could only manage half my usual sized portions for the following week.
Yep
Very yummy!
What else do you get there?
We get these Philly cheesesteak bao, chicken tiki masala, this awesome pasta with pink sauce, wheat sourdough bread
I’ve wondered about the pink sauce. What does it taste like? We just had some delicious dumplings from there this week that we hadn’t tried before.
It’s like marinara and Alfredo sauces mixed together. Ooooh what kind of dumplings?
Yummmm!!! That’s the best combo, I swear!!! I’m not even sure. If I had to guess based on taste, chicken ginger? Have you tried their jalapeño sauce?
It's sooo good! Ooooh my husband loves the chicken and ginger dumplings, I love the simple chicken soup ones. I have not tried that sauce, is it good?
I haven’t tried it either. Lol. What would I even put it on?? I’m going to resist buying it for now lol. Chicken soup dumplings? Do they come in soup?
They have soup inside them! They’re so yummy!
Whooooa. Weird!! Cool

As many people know, RAOA is a huge sub and it can be very intimidating. Many newbies have questions they may feel silly asking or are just worried they won't make any l here. This thread will hopefully change that!  &#x200B;  **How this works:**  &#x200B;  The general idea is that this will be posted and you will be adopting a newbie for a whole week. I'm not saying you have to talk to them 24/7 all week. But be there to help them out and be an awesome friend! :)  &#x200B;  **Newbies:**  &#x200B;  Make a top level comment (basically make a comment in reply to this thread) stating you're new and would like to be adopted. Maybe include a little bit about yourself for your adopter to start to get to know you! If a top level comment is a bit too intimidating, sometimes users volunteer to be adopters and you can grab one of them!  &#x200B;  **Adopters:**  &#x200B;  Reply to a newbies comment saying you'd like to adopt them for the week! If you'd like, you can also post a top level comment saying you're looking to adopt! This will help any newbies with a bit of stage fright!  &#x200B;  **Notes:**  &#x200B;  Newbies don't have to be brand new. But you should be new enough to need some guidance such as what are tags, how do I contest, what rules do we have, how do I make friends, etc! Anything you need help with. A newbie can be adopted by more than one adopter! This way they have many people to help them out! Newbies, if you missed the first day, feel free to comment and be adopted mid-week! You can even come back and be adopted next week too!  &#x200B;  **So go! Have fun! Be adopted! :)**
I'd love to adopt a newbie!
I’m always happy to adopt!
I’m a newbie :) I just got directed here from sub recommendations in secret Santa. Please adopt?
Hi I’m new and free to a good home 😃 (you know, like adopting a kitten? Never mind).
I’m open to adopt a newbie!
Hello! I'm new to this sub. I have done exchanges on r/snackexchange in the past (that's actually indirectly how I found this place!) and I am excited to get involved and learn the ropes here!
Good morning everybody I'm here to adopt a newbie if anybody needs a friend or some help around the community. I'm a little bit older than most🌸 I love nature I love all animals especially cats. I'm heading off to work but I'll be peaking in during my break today.🌻🧸

Hi. I'm new this year, and I'd like to be adopted. I still don't know a lot of people here. (Hey. That rhymed.)
I would like to adopt.
Hi!  I’m fairly new here, but I have gifted and held a contest already.    I feel confident (for the most part) but I am curious if someone can tell me what the awards specific to this sub mean?  I love to award top level comments, but wasn’t sure the history of these.    I also not opposed to being adopted, but I don’t want to take someone’s place who may need/want it more.  Force adopt me if you like 😃  Thank you!
I can adopt!! <3 This is a great idea xD Welcome new friends!
hello i’m new here! i’ve been on here since like the end of decemberish. i’m from the US! i usually come on whenever i have free time since i’m so busy with all my college homework. i’d love to be adopted and learn some things!
Hello! I've been here a few months but I'm still really confused about how the sub works and I would like to be adopted!    I few things about me: I'm a woman and my pronouns are she/her. I'm a teacher and I am a self proclaimed nerd about certain things. I really like movies, books and TV shows. I can be a bit shy but once we start talking I can be a real chatter mouth lol
Hi there! I joined some time ago but finally got around to posting my intro yesterday. I love the atmosphere of this sub and how kind everyone seems to be.

I'm new! I think I understand the basics but I would love to make some friends on here 🙂
I’m new here! I ran a contest and I believe I have the basics, but just need someone to direct me if I’m doing something wrong
Im new and i think i know the basics but extra help is appreciated. I like books, anime, fish, drawing, video games, and dogs!

Adopt me. I need a mama

I didn't know we had those!  I think they're based on mod names.
Hey there friend! I’d love to “adopt” you if you’re still looking! My name is Marissa too, lol! So when I saw that, I knew I had to reply to you! Haha. ;) Plus, after looking at your intro, I think we have some things in common and whatnot too!

Than you!!! Hello!!! Sure I Will, because i still don't understand some things!! But now I have a lot of free time and I enjoy posting!!
Hi friend!!! I would love to be adopted by you :)
Only 2 years in this sub. I’m totally a noob. Maybe we could pretend to be twins and get someone better to adopt us both!
Of course!
Hopefully I shall have many answers. :)
Heyy there
So RAOA is basically a place to hang out and sometimes share gifts.  You have your flair in your wishlist, which also is put in the Random Wishlist Generator.  That allows people to view it and gift you if they choose.  You can gift someone for basically any reason you want.  Maybe it's their birthday, or they're having a crappy day, or you have a really good conversation.  You don't have to gift anyone if you don't want to.  You also don't have to have your wishlist in your flair if you don't want to get gifts.  You can just hang out.  Every day, and twice on weekdays, there's a Hangout thread posted where you can post pretty much whatever you like (as long as it obeys the rules).  These are posted by the mods only.  There are also user-created threads, such as Thanks/Gifted (when receiving or giving a gift), Contests (when the poster wants to give a gift but hasn't decided who to yet), Discussions (where you discuss things), and Activities (where you do things).  Let me know if this is helping you or if you have more specific questions.
Sweet :) feel free to message me if you have any questions! 💕
Start with what exactly?   &#x200B;  There no set way to do anything really, people gift and post discussions and contests and activities, participate in the chats however they like to, as long as it follows the rules.
Sure! You can dm me! Also, I hope you enjoy it here!!
Of course! Happy to help!
Of course! Happy to help!
*hugs!* I am doing well! How is your day going?!
Message me with any questions or just to chat!
Awesome! I’ll send you a chat! :)
Of course 💛
I hope I can help!
Of course! Are you on the mobile app? Just click on my username and or should be an option that pops up.
I’m glad you got it to work! An Etsy registry on Wishlist? Yes! Do you have any questions? Feel free to message me if you do!
Of course! I’m happy to help.
Happy to help!
Sounds great! Have a nice night!
Sure! Message me whenever!
Of course, I’m happy to help!  Hmmm I don’t think there is a way to set notifications when a new contest is posted. I think the best way to stay up to date would be to type “contest” in the RAOA search bar and sort by new. Or just browse through the daily posts.
Of course, I’m happy to help!
Awesome! Feel free to send me a message or chat with any questions you have :)
LOL it's only been 2 months for me! Maybe I shouldn't be offering to adopt anyone. YES, finding someone willing to adopt us as twins sounds perfect.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you! You too!
Thanks I try the search
♥️
I hope it helps you!

Hi everyone! I'm ricenoddles, as some may remember me from the payday contest (\*´▽｀\*)!  I'm a 21F that is currently finishing up her bachelors in neuroscience and in the midst of applying for (& hopefully receiving from, fingers crossed!) graduate schools. Some of my hobbies include journaling, collecting stationery, reading, practicing martial arts, playing video games and just generally, learning new things!  I typically try not to watch tv shows, animes, etc. because I have a tendency to become VERY invested in it, but lately I've been getting back into it due to winter break! Some of my favorites (shows, books, etc.) include Good Omens, Cells at Work, Factfulness, All the Light We Cannot See, The Road, and many more. I love learning about so many different things ranging from about space & our galaxy (black holes are sooo interesting to me!), the brain (The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons is fascinating, to anyone who may be interested :)), history (I love historical fiction novels!), and so on.  If you have any suggestions, I'm always open to them so please don't hesitate in sharing them! I hope to get to know you all in this wholesome community!
Hello! Welcome to RAOA! 👋 I’m Lily, it’s so nice to meet you! I hope that we can be friends! Being a newbie can be pretty tricky, so if you need help with anything - or just want to chat - feel free to PM me and I will assist you to the best of my ability! ✨💛
Hi welcome to the sub!! My name is Amanda and I’m a junior in college :). What’s your favorite food?
Welcome! Collecting stationary is the BEST! What games are you into? Haha, I totally feel you about tv/anime, I also get way too invested. Good Omens was SO good, I love how they adapted it. I haven't watched those anime yet, I'll have to add them to the list! I love learning and historical fiction too!
Welcome! Hope you're having a good day!
Welcome to the sub! Neuroscience sounds super cool — what's your favorite thing about it? I also love collecting stationery and sending snail mail with it.
Neuroscience! That's so cool. I'm studying psychology but seriously considered doing a masters in neuroscience - the brain is the most fascinating part for me.   Welcome to the sub! I hope you enjoy it here. :)
Welcome! I’m glad you’re here!  Neuroscience is so interesting - I work with neurologists with my youngest child. The brain is amazing!! I’ve learned so much just from what they’ve told me explaining his case that I’ve learned more about myself and the way the brain works and I barely know anything about the subject lol
Welcome welcome! Are you involved with any research? I’m currently in undergrad too and in an Alzheimer’s research lab that seriously made me consider switching my major to neuro!
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Hello there. Rice noodles are so good.
Welcome to the gang! Did you like Good Omens?
Welcome officially!! <3 I love stationery :) I wish I knew martial arts haha
hello and welcome to the family! what are some of your favorite books?
welcome fellow scientist!
Hello and welcome! Do you have a favourite space fact?

Thank you so much for your generosity!! 😊
Hello! 👋 ooof that's a hard pick because I love food in general 😅 but I would say for nostalgic reasons, I love my mom's homemade shanghai stir fried rice cakes! What about you??
It is!!! And I love stardew valley, animal crossing, among us! Currently, im playing moonlighter (switch) and nier automata as well as maplestory 😊 and Good Omens was soooooo good, I need a second season now 😂
Thank you! I hope you have a great day as well 😊
That's amazing!! I would like to one day send snail mail :') and honestly, I love how intricate it is? Like it's beyond frustrating because it's not a simple system and difficult to learn, but because of that, it's so fascinating that this system inside our brains enable us to do so many amazing things 😁
Omg that's super cool!!! I honestly considered psychology as well but since I changed majors late and due to my school's requirements, I wasn't able to switch over :( but I would love to learn more about psych!! And thank you 😊
Isn't it?? It's so fascinating with what we do know, and we still don't even know the full complexity of the brain!!
Thank you!! And I was going to be this year, but due to covid, those plans feel through 😅 im currently applying for grad schools in neuroepidemiology so hopefully during grad school, I'll have the opportunity to partake in research! How are you liking your lab??
Hello!! It's nice to see your msg again 😊 I would say that while I do not really celebrate the holidays, I just love the general festivity between Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years 🎉   As for nature, I love green!! It's my favorite color so I love being in a forest! My favorite word is komorebi, which is a Japanese word that describes the sunlight that passes through a tree's leaves and I think that's such a beautiful description.   Thank you so much for the warm welcome 😁
Hello!! And they are!! 🤤
Thank you!! And I did!! 😁
Thank you!! 😊 and omg, it's so much fun! If you have the time and money to, a self defense class is so worth it! At the very least, you'd leave feeling empowered!
thank you!! some of my favorite books include All the Light We Cannot See (historical fiction), The Road (post-apocalyptic), The Man in the High Castle (alt? fiction), Brief Answers to the Big Questions (autobiography?), and so on. I could go on forever!! Currently, I'm reading Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker since that's been on my reading list forever! What are some of your favorites?
Thank you! 😁
Thank you 😊 I'm not sure if this is a favorite?? But the first thing I can think of is that when binary stars are in contact, basically, one "feeds off" of another in order to survive and expand ?? I thought that was pretty cool!
That sounds delicious!!! I would say my favorite food would have to be fresh mango or for a dish maybe mushroom  risotto
Ohhh, you have such good taste in games!!! I haven't played Moonlighter yet, I should get on that! YESSSS!
Well, I'm happy to send you a postcard if you'd like something to reply to!   Oh yeah that's definitely really cool. I work for a health website so we sometimes run articles about your brain and it's just fascinating (though sometimes it creeps me out LOL).
Honestly, I think you've got the better deal studying neuroscience. I had one module based on it and although it was intense and a lot of work for a 30 cred module, I really enjoyed it. It's fascinating. I wish you the best of luck in your studies. :)
Best wishes with applying to grad school!! I know, covid has been a pain when it comes to school stuff 🙄.   Working in the lab is great! I like being able to apply the things I’ve learned in my classes!
I forgot to ask, what martial art do you do?
Oooh they sound soooo good! I've never had mushroom risotto actually but based on Google images, it looks amazinggggg 🤤
Omg moonlighter has such cute graphics!!! And if you're a fan of 8-bit games, to the moon is one of my favorites as well as undertale!!
Thank you, that's a very sweet gesture! Unfortunately, due to a roommate currently being quarantined for covid, I think it'd be irresponsible to send anything from my home 😔 but I appreciate it!!  And that's super cool!! And yeah, while the brain is fascinating, it does have its creepy moments 😅
Thank you so much ☺
Thank you so much 😁 and that's amazing to hear, I'd love to experience that one day! I love hands-on stuff 😊
I actually did a lot of wushu growing up, but in college, I started taekwondo 😊
Nice! And To the Moon is a CLASSIC. Undertale is hands down one of my favorite games of all time. I almost died the night Deltarune was released.
Oh yeah better safe than sorry for sure. Hopefully your roommate is OK and you stay safe as well.
Wushu seems interesting. I'm a 2nd degree black belt in TKD. Are you a black belt?
Omg!!! Yesss the soundtrack for both undertale and Deltarune is amazing! Toby fox :'))) why do you make such bops
Thank you 😊
Yup! Black belt in Wushu, but not in TKD :') but wow that's really impressive!! I would love to start training again, I definitely miss it 🥲
RIGHT?! I could listen to the soundtrack ALL day. What are your favorite songs? I'm a fan of Hopes and Dreams, Metal Crusher, Field of Hopes and Dreams, and dying for a longer version of Don't Forget.
Same! I'm so out of shape now.  Are there a lot of forms in wushu?
Oh god I love Don't Forget!! I love Laura Shigihara's voice ☺Megalovania (even though it's a meme 🤣), Hopes and Dreams is for sure a favorite :')), and His Theme 🥺 it makes me tear up
There are!! I had a lot of trouble learning them when I was younger, but I feel like thanks to that experience, I have a (rather) decent memory 😊 I really like the forms part much more than the sparring aspect! How about you? How's TKD? You must've learned a lot of forms to be a 2nd degree black belt!!
Right?! And haha yes Megalovania is AMAZING. I won't lie, I'm on board for the memes xD His Theme makes me so sad too T_T. Toby why u gotta do this to me
Lol I barely remember them! It's a lot of memorization. I'm not the biggest fan of forms.
I never knew I could feel this much for a video game 🥺 Toby pls
that's definitely fair, it's quite frustrating to learn them 😅
Right?! Truly a transcendent experience. Do you have any Deltrarune theories? :0
Hahah, yeah.
ooof I don't personally, but I really love reading on others!! Some people have super interesting interpretations so they're really fun to read! do you have any theories??
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kxbhcf/discussion_do_any_of_you_have_kindle_unlimited_if/

I usually get it periodically.  I will always take them up on a $0.99 deal (usually its like 0.99 for 3 months, or something like that) or a free month or something. Like anytime its a 'steal deal' I'll use it (i usually keep an actual wishlist of books that are ON Kindle Unlimited so i know which ones i want to read)  &#x200B;  but I dont think its worth the full price every month. However you should be able to look through their KU catalog and see if there is enough interest for you. Definitely something good in spurts at least
I got it for my mother - she hasn't run out of things that she likes but she's very into fantasy and dragon type books. I have noticed a lot of times there will be one or two books in a series available on it then the rest aren't so she just gets hooked on something 'free' and has to pay more money.   I personally have looked through it and didn't find much that interested me so it really does come down to personal taste in what you want to read, I think.
Yes I love it lots of great books
I've had it off and on over the years. Can be great, depending on what genre you're trying to read. I'm interested in self-help books, and there's quite a few of them on there. But it's very hit or miss, I've found.
Ohh following! I saw a deal for two free months and I was considering it
I did but I found reading on my phone to be straining to my eyeballs so I switched to Audible.
It’s hit and miss depending on what you read. Personally I don’t use it anymore as it’s essentially a borrowing service. I like to own the books.
I don't really think it's worth it. There aren't a whole ton of books on there & a lot of them aren't great quality (i.e. self published and/or lots of grammatical & formatting problems). Since it's a borrowing service, you might as well use your local library.
I’ve had it for years. It kind of ran out of use for me because I was finding mostly garbage and self-published things in the genres I liked (mostly romance novels 🙃). My husband uses it all the time and absolutely loves it (fantasy and history)
I have on and off for years. Honestly, not worth it. Most of it is really trash self published books. Every now and then you'll find actual published best sellers on there but not often. I always end up cancelling because it disappoints every time.
I tried it, but really didn’t find too much that really scratched my itch for a good book.
I have it, but I don't think its worth it.  Only because I don't read steadily throughout the year.  I think about cancelling, but then I find a book to read.
Yea agreed it really does depend.  I don’t have unlimited anymore but I still get free books thru prime   and because I own a kindle I also get prime first reads which is a selection of about 5 or so books a month to choose one to have for free
I got it for free with my kindle in October for two months.  I canceled it then I saw the 3 months for 99¢ and got it again.    From my experience the books are 'meh' quality self published work or one book at the start of a series to promote the rest.  I don't ever find books that I actually have on my "want to read" list so I generally end up settling.  There's lots of trashy books too if that's your thing lol.
It depends on how much you read, I guess. It can be annoying simply due to quality - there are some books I have had to just stop because I cannot handle it anymore, which pains me to do.  If you read a lot, I think it can be great. There are more mainstream authors putting books on there now to get you hooked on their series (ie: book 1 and 2 are on there, but it's a 6 book series and the rest are pay to read)  It's awesome for me, due to the convenience of not having to go through the library system and the sheer number of books I read. I like that it has 'Reading Insights' so you can see how often you read (it does things like days/week/month streaks, you can set reading goals to read a certain # of books in a month etc).
honestly I think its worth it for free/super cheap deals. it gives you 2 months to explore and read their libraries without committing to anything. It is a borrowing service so you wont be able to continue reading books once your trial ends but definitely worth exploring for free
I'm thinking of cancelling mine, too. I never use it.

He is so cute!!
Oh man, I didn't even think of putting a puppy on my wishlist!
Obi is ADORABLE
What a good pupper ♥️
At first glance I thought this was a giant box of eyelashes 😂
u/UpturnedPanda Thank you so so much for all the goodies!! I've only tried the sour watermelon candy kittens so I can't wait to try out the eton mess flavor 😄 my lips arent going to get cracked now and most importantly Obi is going to be LOVING his life with all these treats. This was such an awesome surprise! Really made my morning and Obi will be thanking you for weeks 😂🥰🥰🥰🥰
I wanna just cuddle OBI 🥰
Hugs forever!!!! The force is strong in that one!!!
aww!
Obi looks like a love!
obi looks so sweet!❤
That is one adorable doggy!
Hi, please give Obi a cuddle from me. He is the cuuutest
Thank you🥰
I know! Best idea Ive ever had 😂😂😂
Thank you 🥺🥰🥰🥰
😂😂 I can't unsee it now!
You're so welcome! I can't believe the box is almost as big as Obi 😍  I'm glad you liked them! Hopefully the sweets are to your liking, the flavour sounds amazing 😋
He's cuddling me right [now](http://imgur.com/gallery/fC52y5g) 🥰🥰🥰
Yaaaay. I feel less weird now.
I know I thought it was so funny when I got him to stand next to them! 🥰  Just tried one and they are delicious! 😍😋
You lucky he is just so adorable
Yeah. He doesn't usually lie on your lap. He's more of a lie at your feet type dog but he's decided to give me cuddles today. 🥺😍 I've taken about 50 pictures 😂🥰🥰
Awww enjoy it for sure. How long have you had him?
For 2 months. He's only 4 months old and we've had him since he was 8/9 weeks old. He's settled right in though ☺️
he is still a puppy I love it 🥰 he is just the cutest I hope you keep posting pics I know this group loves animal pics. I have no animals so I think I love them more
Yeah I made my first contest a pet picture one! So I have a huge collection of adorable let pictures I can go back and look at 🥰

Hi guys.     I have been observing this channel for a long. I like the atmosphere you have here.     I am a psychologist. Besides the main occupation I like mixing with music, playing soccer ( football in European terms) and so on.  My soccer team has started to make really hard efforts since the beginning of the year. I like what we have, it is really funny and healthy.      Well, would be glad to meet random people on this channel.      Thanx
Welcome to the sub!
Welcome to the group. Has business increased due to the pandemic?
Welcome to the sub!! What team do you support??
Welcome! I hope you are having fun with football.  I wanted to get into it some time ago but I live in the States and they really mostly only have teams for schoolkids in my area. They don't have any for fun for around my age, and people seem to only care about basketball or American football where I am. There are a couple teams in a town I used to live in now, but that is strictly for seniors. Oh well.   What is your main occupation? I hope it's enjoyable. Work is always work, but at least some can be enjoyed.
Hello and welcome!!! What are you favorite ways to relax?
Hi welcome to the sub! Enjoy meeting all these wonderful people! What is your favorite dessert??

Welcome! What are your favorite music genres?
Welcome! I love bass boost remixes a lot of times better than the original tracks not sure what kind of remixing you do. CR7 or Messi?
Hello and welcome
Welcome! So glad you joined!
Hi there, I hope you're having a lovely day! Which soccer team is your favorite?
Hi and welcome! If you had six snakes what would you name them?
Hi! Welcome! What's your favourite animal?
thanx :)
I try to keep it in balance regardless of circumstances.
Liverpool. I like the way things go there. Especially, I like the atmosphere Clopp has created there.
I am a psychotherapist and I enjoy my job very much.    What about soccer in the States. Actually, I have experience from NJ, I have played there in an amateur team. Well, there was a pretty well organized 8x8 tournament by some township associations.
interesting question... sport, meditation (guided included), yoga, playing an instrument, and so on... what about you?
and more interestingly they have a lot of challenging questions ) Probably brownies, I am not sure. What is your favorite one?
Happy New Year... hope the number 1 changes things for to better )     I don't have a favorite holiday :) And I like anything related to nature...      Kitties' story perfectly matches my friend's everyday routine. He also cares for some kitties outdoor, I like that part. He gave them names.      Hugs  🤗
hey :)
thanx :)
thanx )
That would be great, thanx :)
thanx Serine :)
Wish Reddit was with me when I was teenager :) would have another life :)
thanx :)
indie mostly... vibes that alt-j creates :)
by mixing I meant original content. CR7 or Messi? Jurgen Clopp :)
hey :)
Ahh fair enough I can live with that. I used to live in Liverpool !! I’m a Tottenham fan myself!
That's awesome! Not in my state though haha
I like to relax with a book, blanket and something hot to drink, or by playing a fun video game!
Mine is a pineapple upside down cake!!
Same here!! 😩 we’re here now though at least 😊
Ooh I love listening to new music. I'll check them out.   What style do you mix yourself?
😂
Great... I have started to observe Tottenham much since Mourinho took the wheel.
What was your last book and video game? I enjoy hot chocolate much...
Hopefully we can bring us a trophy. But after yesterday I’m not too sure
The last book I read was Malice by Heather Walter. I will be reading Practical Magic next! Video game, I JUST created a character in Code Vein. I just got the game the other day!!! Ive heard great things about the game so I am really excited to get to play it!   Hot cocoa is amazing! My favorite is either Raspberry hot cocoa  or salted caramel hot cocoa!
Hope you enjoy the game. I played my last game several years ago... I mean besides random PS soccer duels that we have with friends sometimes.

There's so much to learn from and teach to others, that's what motivates me.  There are the days and then,there are the weeks when it's hard to stay motivated. What I've found that helps me on those days is to immerse myself only on one activity on that day and celebrate at the end of the day that I persisted with the activity. Some days I just let myself go and I find that the next day I feel very fresh. Over the years this has been perfected to suit me and now it's like a routine.
I'm very strongly motivated by learning. I love to learn new things from others and also about myself. Learning new skills make me happy, and learning to be happy with what I have also makes me happy. I guess I just feel like life is an eternal classroom.
I’m motivated by completion so when I’m avoiding a task I break it down, then schedule it in my calendar.
Coffee... and, coffee. :)
I’m motivated by what I want my future to be for me and my wife. What keeps me motivated is my medication and money. 🤣
I reward myself for good behavior with healthy rewards. If I get my chores done, I get to work out and get my shower, then I can watch a movie while I work on a task around the house. Helps to feel like I’m always accomplishing something positive, even if it’s small.
The need to be better. I have a hard time getting and staying motivated, but I try very hard. Its not easy and sometimes I have bad days, but I try!
My stuffed dog he’s so cute and cuddly
Caffeine. In Red Bull. And more caffeine. And I guess my kids.
Taking enough breaks and planning ahead!
Avoiding burnout by balancing work and play and setting small, achievable goals to get to the larger ones. Also, the most important thing I learned about motivation is to never wait for it. Action precedes motivation, not the other way around. It's basically fake it til you make it. Say you have a dirty ass house. If you force yourself to complete just one little task, say, wash three dishes, once you do that, the motivation to keep cleaning will likely follow. You're already up, doing things, so you keep going. Apply that to whatever it is you need or want to do. Motivation does not precede action. Action precedes motivation.
I’m a huge list person and the feeling of accomplishment when I am able to complete the list motivates me.  I have a daily and weekly list.
I have ADHD and my med helps me stay motivated, else I’m useless. Also, my kids. Always wanting to give them the best and make them happy.
A better future is what motivates me.  :)  I am very goal-oriented, and I love working toward goals.  Having something planned for the future is what motivates me.  I have to have something to look forward to, or I will lose my motivation.
I’m trying to go to school to become a therapist and actually help people. That goal in itself motivates me to push past anything negative and help myself so that I can help others even more in the future
I am motivated to make the second half of life what I thought the first half would be :) better!  I stay motivated with physical representations, whether a clean kitchen, homemade food, making new art, to giving away things I make that people like (it’s good to make others lives better too)!
A goal of how I want my future to look! 😊 caffeine and my meds also help me 😂
I like your username. I'm not a gamer, but my brother taught me that expression and I love it. <3
I find that keeping myself motivated is quite hard. I've read and heard that being disciplined is better to achieve your goals. Motivations sometimes is fleeting and inconstant. Sometimes you need to do something you don't feel like doing and being disciplined and having routines make it easier.
Hello friend! That's a good strategy! How have you been?
Lifelong learner, that's one way to be satisfied with what we have
Yes that's a good method to trick your brain into getting started, I am a fan of time blocking.. One of the methods that's worked well for me
💯 that's a no brainer.. For me .. Java keeps me moving
Respect to your motivation 👍
Hey there 👋.  Currently using that same strategy to cope, not liking it but I believe in sunshine even through the rain.. It's one of my mantras.
♥️
Sending you some positive thoughts!
Thanks my dear friend, greatly appreciated

edit: check comments for short version  So I was just browsing around RAOA and came across a particular post by u/gammonbrat84 . I didn’t know the post was for gifting people. She noticed I didn’t have an amazon wishlist and asked for it to gift me. I let her know I’m currently homeless and wished to help her pick someone else instead—and said yes! That’s all I was happy about, but then she asked if I had a venmo. Gave her the details and quickly got a $25 notification. My eyes watered up as I thought about a nice hot meal of won ton soup. Before going to get food I needed a way to get there. I realized I could replace the broken chain to my [work bike](https://imgur.com/a/pUkBUaZ) , so I pocketed the chain and ran my bike to the shop.   The owners were at the door and I greeted myself. Apparently they’ve seen me on a daily basis. I guess they figured that I’m homeless. I then asked if I could quickly buy a new chain before they locked up. The gentleman asked what size so I showed him the broken chain. He walked back in to check for one. His wife excused herself and went in to talk to him. They came back to the door with a package as I grabbed for my wallet. The woman politely gestured to put my wallet away as the gentleman said, “let’s put this sucker on, shall we?”  As he was finishing up,he asked if I worked at all. I told em I use the bike for DoorDash. He then noticed I didn’t have any reflectors and frowned a bit. As he got up to walk to the back, he asked how I got around at night. Told em I don’t work after sundown since the area is known for speeders and muggings. He came back and tossed me another package and said, “see how those look.” It was a brand new headlight/taillight kit! The labor, chain, and kit would’ve been almost $150... I thanked em a few hundred times as they told me to hurry and go grab my food before it got cold lol.   On the way to the restaurant, I noticed two people digging in the mcdonald’s trash nearby. I instantly went towards them and asked if they were hungry. One of em said they were fine as they ate the burger from the trash.. asked what they wanted. Went in and placed the order for two meals and some sweets. Came back and the joy on their faces from seeing the huge bag and two drinks felt amazing. I then went to get my soup, ate, kicked back to some music and my god... I felt normal for once. Thought about the user who gifted the money and broke down... but I was happy. Just knowing there’s people out there willing to help just pushes me to do the same.  Her kindness helped me get several steps ahead with my plan to get my dream job. Now I can actually work longer DoorDash shifts to save up for an electric bike—to get better paying orders, to then save for a car to sleep in as I attend classes for the other job. Once I get where I should be, i’m dedicating all my free time to help people until the day I die. You never know what one small thing could turn into. It’s a great feeling to know others care when you feel alone. So huge thanks to u/gammonbrat84 and the entire RAOA community for the motivation to spread that same positive energy 🖤.
huge thanks to u/gammonbrat84 for the help with fixing my bike to work again + a hot meal! (currently homeless)the night ended much better than expected.
I love everything about this <3. Not only did you receive some random acts, but you paid them forward :)
This is the absolute best thing I’ve seen all night - from the kind gesture you received to the joy you felt sharing it with others.  Bravo!
It's moments like this that bring a smile to my face, and make me forget about the crummy stuff happening elsewhere. This entire subreddit......it's like that little place where you know people are pure and giving and thankful. I look forward to following your journey. \^\_\^
This subreddit gets used so much I didn’t think there’d be any dust around here but here I am.. 😭😭😭  This is amazing and I am elated for you and so happy that there’s so much compassion in this story 🥰🥰
what a great post! I hope you get everything you are working so hard for
Seemingly small acts of kindness can create massive changes in peoples lives. 💝
Such a beautiful post! I’m so glad you shared this!!
That is such an amazing story, this is a great community and reading stuff like this has made cutting onions ninjas apper at my desk.
This makes me so happy! I was homeless in 2020. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever been through and I’m so sorry you’re experiencing it, too. But the kindness of strangers changed my life and I see it’s changing yours, too. ❤️  Take care of yourself. It gets better.
Wowwww you’re so amazing! Not only did you first just seek to help someone else, but you continued to help others! Love your inner spirit and heart!! You deserve so much and it’s coming, my friend, it’s coming! ❤️❤️
What a beautiful story  u/gammonbrat84 was sent to you today to bless you which set off the series of events for you to be further blessed and for you to bless others.
Awwwwwww you just made my morning!! I’m so glad a small act of kindness and such large effects for so many people. Good luck on your journey and don’t be afraid to keep me updated! We are all in this together!!
I was daydreaming all day about different ways to help people. Especially for peoples mental health. Oh and youth programs to help the kids who are born into gang lifestyles. I know I can’t save the world. But positive influence is infinite.
This motivated me to work a 12hr shift! I feel like by the end of this year i’ll be in a much greater position. So i’ll definitely be back to this subreddit to update people.
Trust me I’ll make sure to update everyone. Especially you! Thank you again. I can’t wait lol I just wanna work and sleep to pass time.

u/NnNoodle88 this is my favourite of the Disney princesses so I'm beyond excited to share this with my daughter. Thank you so, so much! 🥰
These Twisted Tale books look so good!
I love these twisted tales! They’re so great!
You're so very welcome ❤ I hope you both enjoy it 😊
What are twisted tales? I'm intrigued!
Twisted tales are new, edgier takes on classic Disney stories.  I really liked As old as Time- the Beauty and the Beast one!
Ooooh I may look into these! They sound good!

Well done u/UpturnedPanda for guessing the letter E! The book was Time For Mercy by John Grisham. Sorry for giving away the end of the book. Some great book suggestions from everyone and I will go through them and see what tickles my fancy.
OMG yeyyy! Thank you so much. ☺ And more importantly, I hope you enjoyed your book!
Really did, thank you!

u/jaws You deserve a random act of amazon for all of the awesomeness that is you!  I'm not a huge fan of donuts, but I will inhale a chocolate cake doughnut, lol.

THIS IS GORGEOUS! I didn’t know you could send a flower bouquet on Amazon!
u/late_to_join_reddit \- you've brought so much joy to so many people, here's a little bit of joy for YOU my sweet dear friend <3 take care and enjoy :)
Wow - what a beautiful gesture 💕💗💓
This is really really cool. Getting ideas for my wife...
Wake up and smell the roses! How beautiful is this gesture annnnd the real deal. So delicate.
This!!  This is perfect!!!! Thank you for doing this for her!!!
This is really sweet 💕
This is so fucking wholesome 🌻💛
💕
Wow this is such a sweet gesture!
How pretty!! I didn’t know you could get flowers
How sweet! I had no idea you could send flowers through Amazon!
This is amazing!!!!!
:) I didn't know either but she had it on her list and someone recently sent me flowers and I knew it was the perfect thing for me to pay forward for this lovely soul who brings so much joy to all of us :)
😭😭😭😭 oh my holy f*&king sh*t!! 😭😭😭😭😭 I really am crying right now like full on ugly cry sobbing!! 😭😭😭 you have no idea, just NOOOOO IDEA how much this means to me!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ you are the sweetest!  When I was a that verbally abusive toxic guy, being used and treated like absolute sh*t, he used to berate me about how he’s NEVER getting me flowers so just get that out of my head! I mean he would SCREAM at me about it. Then he’d flaunt to me how he’s sent this one particular ex who actually sabotaged our “relationship” 90% of the flowers he’s ever sent in his life. You don’t know how much flowers mean to me; hell I don’t even know why flowers mean so much to me, but they do! Anyways, this happened to also be the same ex who I found out later he was still involved with and they both had feelings for each other still!! They would sext, he’d tell her I’m nothing and I’m so annoying, she’s harass me and he wouldn’t care! She could do no wrong in his eyes and all the blame was on me!! EVERYTHING was my fault!! Things I weren’t even involved me somehow became my fault!!  So yes, THIS is the most precious gift EVER at the perfect timing and I just can’t stop sobbing so hard!!! 😭😭😭Thank you u/purpleteasoul !!! I can’t thank you enough!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ 😭😭😭   I just... omg... just THANK YOU!   You guys are the ones who bring me joy not the other way around! Remember that! ❤️
It is!! It’s the most beautiful gesture 😭😭 thank you u/purpleteasoul!!
😊💜
A+ 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Ooooo yes!!!!
Yesssss!! Flowers are ALWAYS a fantastic surprise!!
I can’t stop sobbing over this!! I’m so unbelievably touched and feel an over abundance of love!
💜💜💜
IT REALLY IS isn't it?! Of course :) It's really from all of us for all the joy she has spread to us :)
😭😭😭 it really is the perfect gift 😭😭😭 I’m sobbing so hard right now it’s crazy!! 😭😭😭
😊
😊💜 just paying it forward from a lovely person who showed me kindness when I really needed it 💜
That is so sweet! Fresh flowers make a room feel so magical and bright. 🌸
😭😭😭 I can’t express enough how much this means to me 😭😭😭 oh God, I just love you so much!!! YOU bring me joy! You all bring me joy!!
I’m glad you’re in a different place right now and that you can reflect on how messed up that situation is and that you aren’t in it anymore! And that you have this group to redirect all that energy!!   You’re so very welcome. In just a short time I’ve seen how much joy you’ve spread around here and I just wanted to pay it forward 💜 it’s okay to cry 💜💜💜 just enjoy the nice gestures that people want to do for you because YOU put out that energy!!!   Sleep well lovely. 💜💜💜
You so deserve this sweet friend! I’m so happy for you! I asked you just yesterday what we could do to make this day good. Turns out u/purpleteasoul has it covered.
You’re welcome 💜😊💜😊💜
😊
You’re so appreciated ❤️❤️❤️
😭😭😭 purpleteasoul, I don’t know what joy I spread to anyone! You are the ones who spread the joy!! 😭😭😭 this is so incredibly thoughtful and precious of you! 😭😭😭 Jesus, I’m gonna stop crying eventually!! 😭😭😭 just not right now lol
They really do!!!
💜😊😊😊 this is us just reciprocating the energy you put out into the world babe! 💜

Yes, u/purpleteasoul really really got me good. I don’t even know how to ever thank her
😊💜
❤️❤️😭😭😭❤️❤️
Awww thanks :) So are you :)
💜😂😊 enjoy the moment honey. 💜💜
I don’t know about that! Feels like you guys give me energy! ❤️❤️❤️
You’ve thanked me enough dear 💜💜💜
😭😭😭😭😭
I absolutely have not. Not even in the slightest. I was having such a meltdown & this just... it means so much to me for so many reasons.
It brings me joy to bring you joy 💜💜💜 so please, your happiness is sufficient 😊💜 I’m so happy I could turn your day around with the gesture and when they arrive it’ll be even better 😊💜 you could even dry them so they last longer 😎🌸
Well it brings me joy that it brings you joy to bring me joy! 🤣🤣 jk   In all seriousness, I really can’t thank you enough and you already know I’ll be drying those babies!! They’re going on my wall! ❤️ you are so fucking amazing!
😂 it’s the perpetual joy cycle 😂 but seriously - I did it because it looked like you needed it and I fully believe that our guides are looking out for us and this time they let me know, late_to_join_reddit needs some lovin and I happily answered the call 😊💜 that’s what we’re all here for! To spread joy!
It just amazes me that of all things on my wl, you chose THE ONE that actually had something to do with part of what’s going on. I mean, seriously, what are the chances of that happening?? My guide failed me last year, but clearly it called in for reinforcements and brought you and all our other friends to me! ❤️ thank you. Thank you a million times over.
That’s how you know it wasn’t just me, it was also from the universe because I really had no idea but it makes me happy that it really struck a chord with you 💜 remember that you matter and that you deserve nice things. 💜🌸💜
I will always try to remember and when I can’t, I’ll have cards and now dried flowers to remind me 🙂
💜 yes! I love saving cards and coming back to them and receiving all the love in them again 😊
Omg, exactly!! It’s the best feeling!!

You don't have to know what you're talking about at all, just don't be \*too\* vague.

I really like [The Veiled Virgin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Veiled_Virgin) because the dude made marble look like a veil! Hyper realistic art just blows my mind.
I love handmade stained glass pieces like [this. ](https://www.etsy.com/listing/892325786/robin-stained-glass-window-hangings?gpla=1&gao=1&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_us_christmas_Art_and_Collectibles&utm_custom1=_k_Cj0KCQiA9P__BRC0ARIsAEZ6irilFthiv2rrXO-fDfKaYvF4nboAjGX-kVFznrFUAt2fXdNW1ZJxSV4aAtiwEALw_wcB_k_&utm_content=go_1707294373_69268676289_331635229866_pla-314954651933_m__892325786_120473252&utm_custom2=1707294373&gclid=Cj0KCQiA9P__BRC0ARIsAEZ6irilFthiv2rrXO-fDfKaYvF4nboAjGX-kVFznrFUAt2fXdNW1ZJxSV4aAtiwEALw_wcB) The sun shines through them so beautifully and this one is so delicate and simple with the little bird. It’s absolutely stunning. It would brighten any room and bring smiles.
Ooh this is a cool contest.   [A Sunday on La Grande Jatte](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437658)  This is my favourite piece of artwork. It’s something I have seen used many times in popular culture. But I love that it’s all made up of thousands of dots. And it’s not until you get close to it that you realise the amount of dots that go into creating this painting. I was lucky enough to visit it at the Met in New York 3 years ago and it was absolutely wonderful to see in person. There is also a musical called Sunday in the Park with George based on this painting.
This [painting ](https://www.instagram.com/p/B4ioy-SF0Yw/?igshid=jozocl97ud9k) by vanessa stockard. The cat is just so ridiculously small and cute. It makes me happy.
Caravaggio's The Taking of Christ.  Caravaggio fascinates me as a person, not just an artist. The guy was absolutely mental! But he was brilliant and what he did and really made use of chiaroscuro throughout his work.  He also inserted him self into his art. In The Taking of Christ he can be seen holding a lamp, casting light on the events taking place. I think this is really cool because he's literally shining light on the subject in the painting. It's almost like a painting pun.  After being excommunicated for using prostitutes and dead bodies as models for religious figures and killing soke one over a game of tennis, Caravaggio went on the run across Europe, leaving a trail of paintings I'm his wake.   One such painting was discovered in a Parish priest's house in Ireland, further darkened and blackened by smoke from the fireplace it hung above.   It now hangs, restored, in the National Gallery of Ireland and it's a massive, imposing piece. It was the first piece of high Renaissance Art I had seen in person and it just blew me away.  It's based on the Garden of Gethsemane, where Judas kissed Jesus to make him a known to the Roman Soldiers who arrested him before the crucifixion. The painting itself is full of action and the attention to detail, despite the dark surrounding, it's amazing. Caravaggio is presumed to be the guy in the top right corner.  https://www.nationalgallery.ie/art-and-artists/highlights-collection/taking-christ-michelangelo-merisi-da-caravaggio
I like [Starry Night](https://imgur.com/a/HtmtQSK) because Van Goghs style is very unique and I think that one in particular is both haunting and calming. I like his story too. He had depression and I read that his meds made him see more yellow than normal.
I love art even though I don't know much about it. I don't think we had a single piece of original art in my home growing up, but I've bought work from local artists and friends through the years. I can't pick a favorite, but here are a couple I love  [The Girl and the Goat by Nils Lou](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuPLDVNn6_v/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)  It's about 3.5' by 6' and takes up space. I love the bright bold strokes and that she is larger than life, too brash, too much and just right.  [Sculptures from Lloyd Ziemer](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9mWExShsVb/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)  He worked in clay, stone, wood and paper for over sixty years. I love the way he refused to treat his art as precious, storing it outside in the weather, displaying it with natural artifacts.  These items are lifesize for the birds they portray.  [This friend Stephen O'Donnell d](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5gNR7MhIhc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)oes stunning work. I like the gender fluidity and rich costuming in his work. Also, he works on very tiny to very large canvases.
[Almond Blossom](https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0176V1962) by Van Gogh. I love it because the blue color is so lovely. The bark of the tree looks really nice, too. The flowers are really well done. Plus, I'm just a sucker for trees in general, especially flowery ones! I've gotten a poster of this painting before (unfortunately the poster got ruined) and I got a case for my old kindle fire with this painting on it as well. I really love it!
I have to pick a favorite?!? I love many famous pieces, but I want to mention something less famous.   [that which I should have done i did not do](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/83905/that-which-i-should-have-done-i-did-not-do-the-door)  I liked it at when I first saw it because it appealed to my goth side. The Victorian door, the thick black paint, the grim feel of it. As I grew older the title nagged at me, it really is a memento mori. If you get to see it in person, get a closer look. It isn't all black but lots of colors layered on as well.
https://imgur.com/a/tbZV033  My favorite painting is the goldfish they Henri Matisse. I love the bright cheerful colors as they draw you right in and instantly cheer you up. I swear if I look at it long enough the fish start swimming!
Is this open worldwide?   My favourite artwork is [Starry Night by Van Gogh](https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/default/greeting-card/images/artworkimages/medium/1/van-gogh-starry-night-vincent-van-gogh.jpg?&targetx=0&targety=-29&imagewidth=700&imageheight=558&modelwidth=700&modelheight=500&backgroundcolor=4E91E1&orientation=0) The colours are really beautiful and I like how the yellows bring some warmth contrasting with the dark blue sky.
I love Van Gogh's [Starry Night Over The Rhone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starry_Night_Over_the_Rhône) because of the calming colours and because of how whimsical it is. I sometimes find myself awake at night, and this reminded me of some of my walks - maybe not by the Rhone, but by water, and seeing the twinkling lights. I feel like this painting is warm and optimistic though, which makes me happy.
Starry night by Van Gogh. I see hope in the middle of disspair. I notice something about the piece the longer I stare at it. The broad brushstrokes in time with violent brushstrokes. It’s like actually seeing inside his mind as he was creating such a beautiful masterpiece.
My favorite artist is M.C. Escher. And my favorite work of his is probably [Three Worlds](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/85/Three_Worlds.jpg), which shows the air, the surface, and the underwater worlds in one piece. I love his illusions and tessellations too.
I think mine is Van goughs Starry Night - [https://www.vangoghgallery.com/painting/starry-night.html](https://www.vangoghgallery.com/painting/starry-night.html)  I love the way he's made his brushstrokes look like light radiating from the stars and moon, but also the swirls of the cloud in the middle while the town belwo is still and silent. Thought its a close second to Monet's Waterlillies series, particularly the  water lilly pond. This is the picture I always think of when I think of drawing the waterlillies at my local contry park lake. Its a fantastic example of combinations of light and shade, little flowers and the larger ones as you come closer. [https://blog.singulart.com/en/2019/10/18/the-water-lily-pond-of-claude-monet/](https://blog.singulart.com/en/2019/10/18/the-water-lily-pond-of-claude-monet/)
Really anything that Esao Andrews does is amazing but I am particularly fond of Yellow Flush https://esao.net/#/2018/  He has this way of painting texture but also make everything look like it's simultaneously melting and bursting with color.
Hmm so my sister is my favorite artist, and not just cause she's my sister, but because she is truly a magnificent artist. She doesn't really post her work anywhere or do commissions despite the fact that she would totally make a killing. She is amazing in traditional and digital art. She only piece of hers I have to share is this [Baby Yoda](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZuyPQa933MBiaBZT6) she did in pencil. It was a Christmas gift for me 2 years ago. It's one of my favorite pieces because well for one he's cute, and because it's just so well drawn, and the shading is amazing.   It's hung so it can be seen from the most places in the house haha.   &#x200B;  But also  [Angelarium: The Encyclopedia of Angels](https://www.angelarium.net/) is amazing too. I love how the artist uses colors to give a glow, and the creations are gorgeous. Somehow he manages to include the scale of these beings in a still image and that's amazing.
I love Takashi Murakami. His [art](https://www.crfashionbook.com/mens/a32405824/takashi-murakami-art-superflat-louis-vuitton/) is so iconic and is full of simple shapes and happy colors.
This would be mine [meow wolf](https://meowwolf.com/)  The experience in its own is AMAZING it is whimsical and creepy but the best thing of all is the story behind how it started and how it keeps on going. I hope to go visit it again once Covid allows. My son has been but my daughter hasn’t so I’m excited for her to go thru the maze and figure out the story. It really takes you to another place that is why I love it so much.
My favourite art was the banana stuck to a wall. [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=banana+stuck+to+wall+art&rlz=1CDGOYI_enCA894CA894&hl=en-US&prmd=sivn&sxsrf=ALeKk03ZnavA8Mc-9FHIGDj66ix4DZYxow:1610637166865&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi1lcWB25vuAhXdIDQIHYA_Dh8Q_AUoAnoECAMQAg&biw=414&bih=622#imgrc=_Bin8xPBlOfdzM) I liked it because it was honestly a simple art that a two year old could had done. This just proves that art now is pretty much could be anything as long as someone’s willing to pay for it you struck gold.
My favourite piece of art is [The Haywain](https://imgur.com/a/SHrzCoJ), by John Constable!   He was an artist who painted scenes in the area around where I live!  I love all of his art as it remind me of home, with the big beautiful skies and lots of nature!  This piece in particular really means something to me because, I used to visit this actual pond as a child! I always remember comparing the painting to how it looks today! It's definitely changed a lot, but you can still tell that this was where Constable painted this image all the way back in 1821!
This is so hard for me, because I love so many artists in so many different styles.  But here is a newer artist I am digging:   https://pin.it/38IM3w8  I love the facial expressions, the multicolored fabrics and textures, and the old world feel.  Plus the fellow on the left is looking straight into frame as if sharing a secret.  It makes me feel like they will be dealing me into the next hand of cards😄
Hey friend! Thank you for the contest !  So my husband is an artist and I never thought I'd learn TOO much about art in my life, but to be honest, I know way more than I probably should just by being around him. Not that it's bad, I just learned via osmosis or something. Anyway, so we used to live in Detroit and they have a beautiful art museum there that was one of our favorite places to go. They have quite a few of my favorites but here are a couple that I truly miss and admire so much:  [This](https://www.dia.org/art/collection/object/orange-brown-59912) Rothko painting is HUGE, like 7 feet tall and 5 feet wide, it's on the wall in the museum and when you walk past it , it hits you like a ton of bricks. Abstract art isn't everyone's cup of tea and I get that but there is SO much that can be said when inferring the meaning of it that it almost makes you feel what the artist was trying to convey. I felt very sad and almost melancholy at the site of this because it seems so intrusive and almost accusatory. I wanted to understand it, but it seemed like it understood me. Rothko has a very "in your face" way of exposing color to the viewer that makes you associate to them in an anthropomorphic way. He's telling us a story while inciting our own experiences in his discursive use of color.   [This](https://www.dia.org/art/collection/object/officer-hussars-98007) Kehinde Wiley piece, "Officer of the Hussars, 2007" is another "in your face" work that is so expressive and exemplific of "traditional" themes in art vs. modern day oppressive structures of society. What Wiley does as you can read on the link but i'll summarize, he picks someone off the street that he finds interesting and takes them to his studio where they pick a traditional painting that would probably depict a white person doing things like in this case ride a horse off into battle, and replaces that person with the person he's selected who usually is a POC. In that way, he's able to include those typically excluded from these paintings in their own version of them in a way that shows how oppressive the art world is and what stories haven't been told through art.   Those are just a couple of the ones that I really enjoy at the DIA but I have obviously had the privilege of being surrounded by art work every day and it's been such an honor to interact with art and artists everywhere I go.   Anyway friend, thank you for the contest and for giving me the opportunity to write about my experience with art. I really appreciate it!
My favorite piece of artwork is [Lady Lilith](https://images.app.goo.gl/4aidgKcLap2TdeF49) by Dante Rossetti. I had the good fortune of seeing this piece in-person when I went to Wilmington, Delaware. I like pre-Raphaelite art because of its jewel tones and texture. I also respect the story of Lilith the character, and I look up to her.
Does having a favored artist count. I love monet. The idea that so much can be made of tiny little dots amazes me. Makes me think of all the little bits that make up the big picture.
So, art is subjective and this may not be what you're looking for, but, this has always been my favorite art piece. I've told myself this countless times in my life, and honestly, if we all remembered how inportant our true friends are, we would all be better off. ❤ I just love it and wanted to share. 🙂  https://images.app.goo.gl/KisEV6nwhQMKSkw2A
my favorite painting is [Venus Rising From The Waves](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/venus-rising-from-the-waves/IwG9l6rVPZLkHw?avm=4)  I just think the colours are so beautiful, I fell in love with it when I saw it in person. To me its inexplainable how stunning it was to me when I first looked at it.   I especially love the clouds and the general pose/form of her body.
The Winged Nike of Samothrace. The Hellanistic style of the sculpture (can you tell I took two years of classics in high school?) is really powerful, and just kinda sits in my head. The fact it is marble and could look like that... what more can I say? There's a whole bunch of other meaning, that I can't remember, but it's cool nonetheless.  Also the dancing scene from Ex Machina which is it's own unique piece of art.
The Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_Hunt_of_Ashurbanipal  A series of truly stunning reliefs currently housef in the British Museum. I was awed when I saw them in person- I had no context for something so exquisitely beautiful. The detail of the lions and of the people- the individual curls of their beards, the individual pieces of armor- it's all gorgeous. So much work went into the reliefs. It's stunning.
Someone else already said it, but of course my favorite doesn't change: [starry night](https://i.imgur.com/ha0xOnp.jpg) by Vincent van Gogh! In highschool art class we had to make a copy of an impressionist painting and of course I chose this piece. The textures of the paint swirls in this painting are so wonderful. I love how you can tell there's just remainders of other colors on the brush as he dips and goes back in, because the individual brush strokes have flecks and lines of the others in it. Impressionism is all about painting light, and it's so cool how he chose to paint starlight, which is very subtle and doesn't reflect off anything... so he chose to really emphasize it by overdramatizing their glow. You can get a similar effect if you wear glasses and you look up at lights when they fog up in the cold. There is a super cool travelling [projection project](https://www.atelier-lumieres.com/en/van-gogh-starry-night) where they project parts of the same painting on the walls of a room so you can feel like you're walking in it and I'm super excited to go. I also sewed a book [sleeve](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfporH2nLxC/?igshid=1f1g1fwx8fgbz)  As for why I love it, I'm a night owl who loves space and my favorite color is dark blue.  Wishlist [here](https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/J6YQ2QLFH5F1?ref_=wl_share) because I can't remember how to change my flair on mobile and that link isn't the right one anymore
definitely [bouquet of flowers by edouard manet](https://www.wikiart.org/en/edouard-manet/bouquet-of-flowers-1882)~! 🌸  the way the water is drawn in the vase is so so pretty and gentle looking, especially with the loose yellow petals that are floating around inside of it, it's quite simple yet beautiful 💗 also love how it is kind of mysterious since the flowers seen in the vase are clearly pink and red but where did the floating yellow petals come from? it just gives off a lovely but cryptic vibe 🌸
I saw [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/29Okvrn) exhibit at a local museum in Salem, MA that I loved! There’s more information about it [here](https://www.pem.org/exhibitions/all-the-flowers-are-for-me-2). Essentially it was a big box in a big white room with intricate designs cut out and a light inside. It made amazing shapes and shadows on the walls. When people would walk through the room, their shadows would also show on the walls. I just loved the design of it, it was stunning. And the whole room made you feel warm and comfortable.  Thank you for hosting! 🖼
"The Rape of Prosperina" by Bernini  [is my ](https://mymodernmet.com/bernini-the-rape-of-proserpina/)favourite..  For one thing, the rape of persephone is one of my favourite greek myths, but also the sculpture is exceptional. The veins on Hades hands, the way the skin on Persephones things dimples under Hades's touch, the realism of that statue is unbelievable and it screams with emotion.
My favorite piece of art is called "The spirit of Christmas". [https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fa/fb/6f/fafb6f97925e4d02f84d312e513fcd41.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fa/fb/6f/fafb6f97925e4d02f84d312e513fcd41.jpg)  Christmas has always been special to me and growing up we had this on our wall all through the year. It is just magical!
https://images.app.goo.gl/Aq6UdQuGPmmtBhudA  I love the sunflowers painting by Van Gogh! Besides the pretty colours, it tells a story. I don't remember it that well but it says that he stood his ground as a painter.
Definitely [The Milkmaid](https://www.sothebys.com/en/videos/johannes-vermeers-the-milkmaid-a-mona-lisa-for-the-dutch-golden-age) by Vermeer. When I first read *Girl with a Pearl Earring* by Tracy Chevalier, I was so enchanted by it that I looked up all his paintings and even bought one of those huge books with full colour prints of his art. I love the way he focuses on light and colour. *The Milkmaid* is my favourite because it juxtaposes the simplicity of daily domestic life with the purity of light and simplistic beauty.   As a bonus, my husband’s favourite painting is also a Dutch one. [Saenredam, by Jensz ](https://artuk.org/discover/artists/saenredam-pieter-jansz-15971665). It’s hanging in a gallery in Edinburgh. When we were dating, my husband took me to see it on my birthday, and he told me he loved me for the first time in front of that painting. We kissed, and it was just like a movie!! Thanks so much for the contest. xx
I love this [Rainbow Soul Tree](https://www.iamfy.co/product/rainbow-soul-tree-art-print?country=GB&utm_source=google_fy&utm_medium=pla_fy&utm_campaign=uk_en_pla_shopping_wall-art&gclid=Cj0KCQiA9P__BRC0ARIsAEZ6irgIYeLcqG01pS57PBaXqB1JWcANs1H7L54nMfmQGJFI6Ml-3kL5KpAaAoPPEALw_wcB)  \- the single dark tree reminds of a lonely person but the rainbow colours in the leaves makes me think that this person is starting to flourish.  I imagine these trees with lots of children under looking for nature and being happy.
For me, the snail by Matisse  My first trip to the Tate in London this was the one piece i saw that left a mark on me. So much so as soon as I got home I got a copy ordered. I love the semi abstract nature of it with so much going on on the canvas unravelling in front of us
Congrats on your first contest! What an interesting idea.   [This](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/2/1-inverary-pier-loch-fyne-morning-joseph-mallord-william-turner.jpg) is one of my favorite pieces of art: Inverary Pier Loch Fyne Morning by JMW Turner  I like it because of the way Turner plays with light and dark to invoke a rising sun. You get the impression of the pier without actually seeing the pier, and I love that it makes you use your imagination to really see it. It's also possible that the painting is unfinished, which makes it sort of a mystery, and you can wonder what else Turner would have possibly added. Plus the colors are so cheerful!
I like [this piece](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ed/9c/fe/ed9cfec24e3c9795f553bee2d0bd08a0.jpg)  by Terence Cuneo, I remember it hanging on the wall of our dining room as a kid and often studied it. I find it really evocative of a bygone era. A family friend came over one day and pointed out that in almost all of his paintings, the artist included a tiny mouse. Sure enough, the mouse is there!
[The Rape of Proserpina](https://images.app.goo.gl/sCQSMQpyAWMSwWqZA) has always amazed me in how the sculptor was able to so realistically capture lifelike flesh in hard marble.
I know it’s a little cliched, but I love the Great Wave off the coast of Kanagawa ( https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-great-wave-off-the-coast-of-kanagawa/fAFp7yddSAtcTQ?hl=en&avm=2)  My 11th grade English teacher was amazing- I was in the IB program so in 11th grade you do world lit and in her class we studied Japanese literature. One of the books we read was the sound of waves which had this painting on the cover. In that class I developed a love of Japanese writing- it was so different than what I was used to- and because of it went on to study an aspect of Japanese culture (the evolution of the Japanese Tea Ceremony) for my Extended Essay- an International Baccalaureate requirement. Every time I see that painting it reminds me of High school and the joy of learning and discovering new things!
I see so many things as art! I'm lucky enough to get sample sizes of art that I'll never have the opportunity to see at museums! - OR even - I can see a virtual tour to see some architecture that I'd never get to see because I can't travel! OR how about I can watch videos so I can experience concerts that I missed!  But recently I was gifted my favorite piece of art! I couldn't have been happier! Its a postcard and it's beautiful!  https://www.dropbox.com/s/nmu39bzfl7yqlei/20210114_072629.jpg?dl=0 he paints Mary and baby Jesus with, I believe the wise men. But I can't read Germany 🤗  It's "Die Anbetung der könige" by von Albrecht Altdorfer, and it is in the Sammlung des Städel Museums. The picture brings me joy! His other pieces aren't as pleasant in my opinion,  lol. I haven't been fortunate enough to see the real thing, but I can imagine it would bring tears to my eyes! Even if this isn't eligible for the contest please check out the art, it's incredible ☺  I hope you enjoy this art, as well! Thanks for hosting!
Starry starry night by van gogh why because it's absolutely beautiful And reminds me of the sky in oklahoma where I'm from.
[Edward Hopper's "Nighthawks"](https://images.app.goo.gl/P1Lq5WXnBFJysoPZ7)  It was painted in 1942 and sort of nails the feelings of anxiety and unease from that era, when nearly all the men in the country had signed up or were drafted to fight in WW2.  Even outside of context you still can look at it and feel the loneliness in it.
I love just about everything by Kehinde Wiley. (He did [Barrack Obama](https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/kehinde-wiley-judy-chicago-included-2018-time-100-list-10166/)’s portrait) He did one of [Judith and Holofernes](https://ncartmuseum.org/art/detail/judith_and_holofernes) (trigger warning: a little violent) that I saw in person and it knocked my socks off. It's based on the classic story, and a powerful interpretation. Every painting of his that I’ve stood before has been: enormous in scale, hyper realistic, of powerful people of color, has turned portraiture on it’s head, and has made people question social norms and ideas of beauty and masculinity. I love his work.
While my favorite artist is Klimt, my favorite piece of art is Dali's [The Hallucinogenic Toreador] (https://www.wikiart.org/en/salvador-dali/hallucinogenic-toreador-1970). I saw it for the first time when I was fifteen and I remember just being in complete awe of its size and the amazing imagery and hidden details. It was love at first sight.
I don't have examples at the second, but literally anything my best friends make! They are all so talented, and knowing they made it just makes me feel so very happy :) I have three best friends, two do art professionally, and the other does it on the side while doing her grad school to be a doctor (!). Hoping to practice and join the best friend art group hahaha
I have always loved [the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Adele_Bloch-Bauer_I)by Gustav Klimt. His use of colour makes her dress seem so extravagant, while at the same time blending it into the background to make her flawless skin stand out... it’s breathtaking.
I feel like my favorite piece of art changes weekly. Searching out (and even commissioning) smaller artists I like brings me so much joy.   My latest favorite is this artist's Protector series - the [snow fox](https://www.etsy.com/listing/902088873/winter-fox-watercolor-painting-8x10-fine?ref=shop_home_active_10) and the [sea otter](https://www.etsy.com/listing/927157906/the-protector-series-the-otter?ref=shop_home_active_1&crt=1) and no I cannot pick between them. It's just the perfect blend of nature and humanity and the pieces just exude calm and peace.
One of my favorite artist's Paul Cadden it won't let me link an individual piece but this is his link to his prints. His medium is pencil on paper! They are so detailed they look like b&w photos!! Some even say how many days it took to sketch they are amazing!
I’ve always loved [Starry Night](https://www.vangoghgallery.com/painting/starry-night.html) by Van Gogh. The way the color of the lights pop over a dark city has always been breathtaking to me. I find Van Gogh very interesting. He was suffering so many mental illnesses, and yet was able to create such beautiful pieces. It’s unfortunate that his art wasn’t truly appreciated until long after his death. Even he himself described Starry Night as basically being garbage, not knowing it’d end up being his most popular and valuable painting.  Thank you for the contest!
anything with this [style](https://www.deviantart.com/acapulc0/art/Albion-Online-The-Old-World-587453930) I find appealing. the atmospheric perspective as well as the stylistic simplicity allows me to easily imagine myself in the game world.  I also enjoy the architecture as its very geometric with crisp lines.
Is it trite to say Starry Night by Van Gogh? I love the colors, the brush strokes, the intent shown in the finished painting. It makes me feel calm and that's something that I don't feel very often anymore! One day, I'll be able to purchase a huge replica canvas and put it over my bed and I can't wait, lol. I'll include a link to the painting and the story behind it. It's a neat little story and I hope someone else develops a love for it, as well!  [Starry Night, the painting and the story](https://www.vangoghgallery.com/painting/starry-night.html)  Edited to add that it's also so inspiring that he actually painted this while in a asylum! No matter where you are in life, you can do amazing things.
[The Arnolfini Marriage ](https://imgur.com/a/xaQHcLL) by Jan Van Eyck has always been a favorite of mine.  I love everything about it: the cold and stern look on the groom’s face; his rich yet somber furs; the bride’s verdant dress representing fertility; the little dog at their feet symbolizing fidelity; their tiny reflections in the mirror on the back wall; the richness of the colors and details. It captivates and calls to me. It’s beautiful, eye-catching, and an amazing work of art.
I like the Great Wave Off Kanagawa. The colors are nice shades of blue and is very calming to look it. It is also one of the most famous Asian Paintings.
I don't have a favorite piece of art but [This](https://www.gallerynucleus.com/detail/1057) is one I always go back to.  I love how simple and innocent it is. A small girl dancing with her robot friend. It just makes me happy inside and gives me hope.   Someday, I will own a copy of it.
I've always loved Degas' paintings, especially the ballerinas, but it's this sculpture [Little Dancer Aged Fourteen](https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.66460.html) that is my favorite. I love the mixed media - wax, clay, hair, the clothing. It just is so interesting to look at. (Great info from the National Gallery of Art can be found [here](https://www.nga.gov/collection/highlights/degas-little-dancer-aged-fourteen.html#:~:text=Most%20of%20these%20original%20sculptures,be%20found%20around%20the%20world).)  If you're interested in Degas and all the ballerinas I just read a super interesting article just last week titled [The sordid truth behind Degas' ballet dancers](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/edgar-degas-ballet-dancers-artsy/index.html) . Very good read!
I don't know if [this ](https://www.deviantart.com/wildspiritwolf/art/Dragon-Tiger-Wolf-Trio-Commish-93081877) but it's a piece a had commissioned and I love it because of how beautiful it captures the image in my head as well as the fact that this artist did it purely base off a text description and no reference photos.
I love [Claude Monet’s water lilies](https://www.musee-orangerie.fr/en/article/water-lilies-virtual-visit)! I have grown up around Art my entire life (my moms an art teacher and she taught me to paint when I was super young) and have always been drawn to the beauty, serenity, and calmness of this series of paintings. I was almost drawn to tears when I was finally able to visit Paris 5 years ago and see them in person 😊
John William Waterhouse is one of my favorite artists from the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood movement. His [Lady of Shalott](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/waterhouse-the-lady-of-shalott-n01543) is one of my favorite pieces of his. [Also one of my favorite poems.](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45359/the-lady-of-shalott-1832) He depicts the tragedy of the beautiful woman so well. The lady has a look of fear and sadness at her fate that befalls her now as she sets off in her boat to her death. I love the darkness of the colors he painted with. He did the poem justice in his painting.  (There is also the song "Lady of Shalott" by Loreena McKennitt which is tragically beautiful. And there's [a scene from Anne of Green Gables](https://youtu.be/rlfCYKTBXXk) where Anne acts out the poem.)
I absolutely love this John Singer Sargent painting of gators: [https://www.worcesterart.org/collection/American/1917.86.html](https://www.worcesterart.org/collection/American/1917.86.html)  &#x200B;  For a while I couldn't understand why working on watercolor in art class was worth it. I thought all the paints were too muted and disappointing. In art history class, my teacher introduced us to Sargent watercolors, and they were so vibrant and full of life. Now I've been able to practice watercolors with this painting as my first motivation :)
Hope this counts - it's call God's Own Junkyard a huge neon light exhibition in London. I've visited and it's mind blowing. The lights, the colour, the imagery and the random bits all brings a smile to my face!   [Google pic ](https://www.google.com/search?q=gods+junkyard&safe=strict&client=ms-android-huawei-rev1&prmd=imsvn&sxsrf=ALeKk01GGJSqiZkILoZPZ8Bfmnm3sMAvLQ:1610649231086&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZ65r6h5zuAhXIX8AKHQ9zASkQ_AUoAXoECBIQAQ&biw=360&bih=647&dpr=3#imgrc=Lj9Y-tt2jxIjoM)
Starry night cause I feel like the strokes make the sky look so fluid. Like it shows the movement in the world and also the colors are so bright, despite being of a night sky
I really like [this painting ](https://doagahehoc242.cloudfront.net/uploads/artists/2123/f4802b22_schermata-2020-02-06-alle-143622.png) by Rene Magritte. No idea why. Maybe because of the apple and I'm a teacher? Another painting by him called the [The Treachery of Images ](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg) is a close second because I interpret it as the best type of sarcasm and it makes me smile.
I have always found the work of [Boris Vallejo](https://www.borisjulie.com/product/atlas/) to be beautiful. Likely because he was always one of my mom's favorite artists. I have always been a lover of fantasy and that is his focus, that and the beautiful human bodies.
( https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/artists/jan-davidsz-de-heem )  I have a tapestry of this painting, it’s honestly something I cannot stop staring at it. Everyday I look at it and find new little details I would have never thought to add (snail, spiders, etc) that make it beautiful with a bit of a creepy vibe to me.
I actually really like Frida Kahlo’s work. It’s just all so emotional and in your face. I like the “weirdness” of a lot of them, and they all envoke a lot of feeling in the viewer. Well, at least for me they do, lol. And I like that too. It feels like you’re simultaneously seeing a little piece of her life and her soul, but also it’s like it speaks to your own soul as well. It can bring up feelings both for her and feelings of what it makes you think of in your own life. I hope that makes sense, lol. (Warning, slightly graphic? NSFW? Idk?) [“Without Hope”](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/without-hope/rgHBxF7ESC2qmQ?utm_source=google&utm_medium=kp&hl=en&avm=2) and [“Tree of Hope, Remain Strong](https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/magdalena-carmen-frieda-kahlo-y-calder%C3%B3n-de-rivera/tree-of-hope-remain-strong-1946.jpg) are really speaking to me today, but it’s hard to pick a favorite!  Love this!! Thanks for hosting! I’m excited to see what some other people posted too! :)
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Street;_Rainy_Day  So many comments... not sure if someone picked the same paining.  I was surprised at how much more vivid and how large the painting is. Have never seen it with people standing around it. Also reminds me of when I’ve spent a rainy day in Paris. And all the other art I saw the same day... don’t get me started haha
Congratulations on my first contest! ✨🎉  I love [pendulum art](https://ibb.co/QCP7HGb) because the process of creation is sooo satisfying and the end result is beautiful. I love the different colors incorporated in pendulum art, too.  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
The way the sculptors make rock look light and airy is really amazing!
Stunning.
That's such a cute bird
This is the painting that introduced me to pointillism. I love this choice!
omg his little neck ruffle, this is so joy inducing
Oh my god this is my fave too  It's an amazing painting, we have good taste
That last one, This Friend Stephen O'Donnell is awesome. I totally cracked a smile. I love works like that.
Nice choice ;) See what I put!
**[Starry Night Over the Rhône](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starry Night Over the Rhône)**  Starry Night  (September 1888, French: La Nuit étoilée), commonly known as Starry Night Over the Rhône, is one of Vincent van Gogh's paintings of Arles at night. It was painted on the bank of the Rhône that was only a one or two-minute walk from the Yellow House on the Place Lamartine, which Van Gogh was renting at the time. The night sky and the effects of light at night provided the subject for some of van Gogh's more famous paintings, including Café Terrace at Night (painted earlier the same month) and the June, 1889, canvas from Saint-Remy, The Starry Night. A sketch of the painting is included in a letter van Gogh sent to his friend Eugène Boch on 2 October, 1888.Starry Night, which is now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, was first exhibited in 1889 at Paris' annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants.

This ones really nice too!
I did this as a pint by numbers and LOVE it!
Wowwwwww.... I've never seen this artist's work. Amazing!
Your sister is an AMAZING artist!
My personal opinion--many collectors are terrified of missing the next genius artist and many artists are using the "anti-art" movement to be lazy and cash in on the collectors' fear.   It does all prompt interesting conversations, though :P
Yes! Another Kehinde Wiley fan! I love his work so much. This contest is really unique and I love a discussion about art.
the DIA? loooveeeee the DIA! My son's favorite piece there is[The Nightmare](https://www.dia.org/art/collection/object/nightmare-45573) . Boys are weird.
**[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal)**  The royal Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal is shown on a famous group of Assyrian palace reliefs from the North Palace of Nineveh that are now displayed in room 10a of the British Museum. They are widely regarded as "the supreme masterpieces of Assyrian art". They show a formalized ritual "hunt" by King Ashurbanipal (reigned 668 – c. 631/627 BC) in an arena, where captured Asian lions were released from cages for the king to slaughter with arrows, spears, or his sword.

That's really unique! I love exhibits like that. We saw this last year, and images do it no justice. This whole exhibit was so immersive [Immersed in Light](https://mintmuseum.org/immersed-in-light-studio-drift-at-the-mint/)
I feel like the right light can make even the most boring scenes fascinating. But also that bread looks real good haha
The renaissance sculptors were truly masters in depicting flesh, and veils/fabric too.
Bernini's work is amazing. I've seen several in person, an it's amazing how he brought life into marble and made it look like flesh and fabric. And hair!
It's a classic for a reason! Van Gogh is my favourite :)
I always loved that you could see van Eyck in the mirror, painting the scene
I just read that article about Degas a few days ago! Very interesting.
u/josephineismyhero, don't you just love that scene from AoGG? That's where I fell in love with the poem first.
Wow! That's crazy, and so fun!
Yeah she does famous paintings but hides her cat in them and it’s just really cute and funny.
We sure do!
She is 😍 And like many artists she still thinks she sucks 😂
YAAAASS have you heard of Mark Bradford? or Nick Cave ( not the singer) ? My husband really loves Mark Bradford's work and he focuses on the POC's urban experience and his work repurposes signs that you'd find on the street , like the "houses for sale" " cash for test strips" things like that. [Here's](https://art21.org/watch/art-in-the-twenty-first-century/s4/mark-bradford-in-paradox-segment/) his Art21 video, he's a really interesting person. Nick Cave actually went to the same grad school that my husband did, we've met him, he's a really nice guy! When my husband worked at a college here that had a big budget for visiting artists, he was able to get Nick Cave to come and do a talk. [Here](https://publicdelivery.org/nick-cave-soundsuits/) is a video of his installation using his soundsuits as a performative piece, it's really beautiful!
Oh wow, those look awesome! 🤩
Yes! I am always astounded when I see sculptures with folds of draping cloth. [The Veiled Virgin](https://images.app.goo.gl/PfBdaniqFAbeBa83A) is an amazing example of this.
I had been spending too much time on the cnn website that last couple weeks 😂 but yeah what a surprise (to me). I had no idea that's what ballet was then. I have been loving Degas for years...there was even a Degas ballerina painting in my son's Olivia book (a kids series). Now I'm like 😮😱😨
Yes, I did love when Anne referenced it and Waterhouse is one of my fav Pre-Raphaelite artists (it is also my favorite period of art, such genius and they hung out together and shared ideas and also shared models sometimes .Just the coolest thing)
Thats amazing. I have to check out more of her stuff. There's another artist that puts her cat in her work https://fatcatart.com/category/shedevry/?lang=en
I've seen some of those Nick Cave Sound Suits in person they are wild! I will check out that Mark Bradford video. Thank you so much sharing!
It really is. Thats why they were called masters I guess!
Yea, I think that's true with the origins of a lot of art. I do believe Michelangelo made most of his females from male models, because it was considered tawdry or immoral (maybe even illegal?) to use female models. I was still sad/surprised to read that about Degas, but it certainly makes me look at his paintings in a new light!
The editing is beautiful thank you for this information lol.
wow, I didn't know that but makes perfect sense for the time!
Glad I could be of service 😂

u/NnNoodle43 - this is my first of hopefully many gifts, hope you like it!
Wait... I think I used the wrong user name... I just saw u/NnNoodle88 and now I'm confused. 88, If you're amazon name is similar with 43 in it, then this is for you! I'm on mobile today so can't check your wishlist right now to confirm
Haha I am the same person, I have no idea why I'd put 43 at the end of my reddit name on my amazon. It's probably because a lot of my online names end in 43 so I'm guessing it was from force of habit. I've changed it now to 88. 😅  ANYWAY! Thank you so much for gifting me, I'm really looking forward to reading that book, especially given how recent times with the rona have definitely affected my little guy. I'm sure it will be a great help. ❤
Yeah I can't imagine how the change of routines must be upsetting him! Hopefully this gives you ideas on how to help him cope ☺️

I love regular tap or fridge filter water over ice!! I am still searching for a perfect big cup (not too big but not small) that is open lid or easy lid - I like my reusable straws!!

Im too addicted to the internet lol.  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/17C5K0MS4JWO1
ok, well my FAVORITE is mango flavored bubbly.. BUT I just figured out that if you mix sugar free vanilla bean torani with the plain La Croix, it tastes JUST LIKE cream soda!   I like to build a good rapport with my friends on here and you seem like someone I can be friends with! ;)
I prefer caffeinated water. Avitae and other brands somehow mask the bitterness.   Hiball is a carbonated water with caffeine and is simply the best. Lol.   rapport  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1BNDIR3E7SEEV?ref_=wl_share

rapport  Honestly I like regular tap water the most. Cold but not ICE cold. I pretty much never buy bottled regular water unless I'm out and about and THIRSTY!!! I do also enjoy some sparkling waters more lately as a way to cut back on soda. I like the sweeter ones like sparkling ice and not so much the ones like Bubbly or LaCroix that taste like TV static with a picture of the fruit it's supposed to be barely coming in on the screen.
Mine is tap water!!! I love my city water it’s so good lmao rapport  [wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2Y59YGF7YB3WC?ref_=wl_share)

My very favorite is flavored sparkling water and WATERLOO is the best I’ve ever found. It’s made in Austin, TX and tastes so good, not like fake or chemical flavors. Grapefruit and Watermelon are my two favorites. I love saying the word rapport!  https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1JQ5GQE8RQ69E?ref_=wl_share
Oh I love water!!  It's pretty much the only thing I drink, besides an occasional orange juice or hot chocolate! We stock up on this water from Aldi called ph 9.5 or something like that. It tastes amazing and it's alkaline, so it's supposed to be really good for you.   Rapport! Thanks for hosting!
Mine is straight from the tap. The water here is delicious (Scottish highlands), and this time of year it comes out ice cold. I have a great rapport with it!  [Wishlist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/30YMLQO00I9WA?ref_=wl_share)

My grandma used to put plain tapster in this old jug and leave it in the fridge, so it was always super super cold. I called it "ice water" and I loved it as a kid. I'd say that SmartWater is probably my favourite bottled water, but I love Fiji water, too. Basically any nice cold still water is good with me, though.

rapport  I really love topo chico or la croix with food, but I have grown accustom to buying the 1.5 liter bottles of smartwater and then refilling them with my purified filter after I drink them to make sure I drink more water and that I don't make bottles single use. Then of course I recycle them.
I like tap water. In scotland the tap water is 😘 brilliant. If I do get bottled water though I get smart water. Mainly because I like the shape of their bottles and I like the bit you drink out of (the cap?) Idk heo to explain exactly what I mean 😂🤦‍♀️  Rapport  https://www.amazon.co.uk/hz/wishlist/ls/4Q0C2RNFDQDW?ref_=wl_share
If I could choose any type of water, it would be fresh mountain spring water, like drinking from a clean stream.

Thank you!
Water bro!!! Artesian well water 😂
I am enjoying getting caught up on reddit and FB!!! I hope they kept your card safe.
Hahah!! Oddly I suddenly had the urge to drink some water after I entered 😂😂😂
You know it!!
Hahaha the power of suggestion, right?! Hehehe
I'm not utterly overwhelmed at the moment. Earlier I was having issues.
You know it!! Get used to it!! 🙂🤗❤️
😂 I’ve tried to give it a few chances but it’s just not for me. I really miss Clearly Canadian!! Doesn’t count as sparkling water but I used to get away w bringing it to classes bc it looked like water 😂😂😂
Never seen it! I’ve seen other stuff of his like when he was really young until now when he is the dad in Atypical. Also, his cat videos are ridiculously funny. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤣
Ooh, fancy water! I love it 💙🌊💦
💜
Sayyyyy whaaaat? Ok I’m messaging you pronto!
I will always appreciate it!
Were you not allowed to bring sparkling water to class??
He has a couple  episodes on friends. He was in one of my fave fave movies The Heat. And I don’t know what else. But anyone who guest stars on Earl is a badass to me
I’m bougie
Well, we were only allowed to bring water to class, but clearly Canadian was more than sparkling water, wasn’t it? Totally a sparkling juice! Lol my favorite was mountain blackberry!
I'm a baller on a budget 🤣🤣🤣
Do they not sell them anymore??
Lucky for me, I can’t do math so no budgets!!
Not over here, at least not the ones I used to drink! Definitely not mountain blackberry!
🤣🤣🤣  Like I always say, if you can't calculate risk, it doesn't exist!
I had this black cherry v8 sparkling drink today and it was so good! But I imagine that’s how the clearly Canadian tastes
Precisely, water bro!!   But no there was an artesian well near me in a public area so like you could just go there and get water lol
Whoa blCk cherry V8?! What’s that taste like?? Whenever I think V8, I pretty much think tomato juice LOL
That is so cool!
It was soo good! It’s like eating a carbonated cherry in liquid form!
Ooo I might have to check that out!!!

lies  everyone knows those are for spare buttons   and you cant convince me otherwise
What a great sewing kit 🤣
I love how many of these you’ve been gifted!! Sewing tins (and cookies)for life!😄😄
Congrats on your new sewing kit! 🧵
u/dumbportagee Thank you so much for fueling my addiction! Haha. But really, I love these things! I’m so excited to have enough here to last a minute! Thank you!! :)
I love those! My favorite one is the pretzel shaped ones!
These are soooo delicious!!
Yummy!!
Pretzel shaped is the only ones I like lmao.
These are the best cookies and the best sewing kits!
Wait, these actually come with cookies and not thread, extra buttons, and sewing needles?!?
These cookies seem to be doing the rounds on the sub and thank god as they are amazing!
I have never seen those cookies you are talking about, I only know about the needles and threads that comes in those boxes
My grandma used to give me these... never knew where she got them but man... I was never mad when she whipped these out!!! Absolutely delicious!!
Haha. XD Well, It’s a two step process.  Step 1: inhale cookies faster than humanly possible.  Step 2: insert buttons, thread, and sewing needles. Or other random doodads, as needed.  Hehe.
Haha thank you! ;)
I am literally obsessed with them! Haha. There can never be too many! XD I can’t even save the tins anymore, cuz I have too many! Lol. I did just get two of the big ones in a row recently, which is just epic because I won’t run out in a few days like usual! Normally I try to like be somewhat sparing, try to make them last, but today I definitely enjoyed them a couple extra times. ;) The tins do really come in handy though too! Haha
Haha thaaaanks! ;)
You're welcome! I haven't had one of those in 30 years and it makes me smile every single time I see one on here lol
Right?! They are my favs! Lol. My fav is the coconut one and then the swirly one, but the pretzel ones are my partners fav too! :) They are all awesome though!
Yes! I love them!! Haha
😍😊
Haha, those are good! They are my partners favs too, but I love the coconut ones so much! ;)
Aw, so sweet! They are soo yummy! ;)
i have never ever seen one of these with cookies  ONLY sewing supplies
Usually I eat like half the box before realizing I ate too much 😂
My favorite was always the sugar pretzel!!! 🤤🤤🤤
Wait... They have diff flavors?! I assumed they were all the same flavor... Lmao. Kinda like how the blue m&ms taste better...
When I was about 10 I got so sick of falling for the sewing kit trap that I found a permanent marker and wrote all over the tin. I've never trusted a tin of cookies since.
That’s my partners fav too! I like the coconut one the best! :)
Mannnnn I haven’t had one of those in a LONG time!!! Enjoy an extra one for me please!! 🙂

Enjoy!!!
mind helping me with making a thank you post? not sure how to add the photo with the flare + text
You're welcome!
Ofc! If you use the brackets [thanks] it should automatically flair it as a thank you post! I'm using the boost mobile app right now for reddit (so it might be different on computer or another app). I went on the RAOA subreddit and clicked create post -> text to make this post where I have a title along with a body paragraoh for the texts. I usually create an image post (where I only have a title and picture) when thanking someone, but I had multiple gifters I wanted to thank. I cannot for the life of me create a post where I have multiple images in the post even while using the reddit app 😅
so for me your image is at the very top. then the text and details are below. did you choose the post an image option? or the text option?  sorry if i’m confusing lol i’m a bit tired  edit: thanks a ton for the help
oh wait so you put the body paragraph into the title?
I chose the text option - so if you choose text option and you link a picture in the text, it shows a thumnail of the pic on the post (which is what you see). However if you choose to post an image option, you are only allowed a title with the picture (and no body paragraph)  Not sure if I'm explaining it right 😭 lmk if uou need more help
I think I get it now! So do I put the link on the body paragraph section? Or do I tap the add link option?
It looks neater if you do the add link option becuase it lets you customize the words (like how in my post the words "the silent patient" is blue for people to click on the link), instead of one whole URL link. But posting the link is fine as well
Okay I’m sure I get it now. Thanks a ton for taking the time to explain! 🖤
No problem, I'm glad I made sense lol!

[closed]I've been snacking for as long as I can remember. It started at a very early age and has just continued. Savory, sweet, spicy, sour, crunchy, chewy, soft, fruity, chocolaty it doesn't matter. I've snacked in public. I've snacked alone. I've snacked happy, mad, and sad.   I like the thought of food connecting people and I ran a similar contest before and I loved it. Tell me a snack we both can enjoy up to $10 usd. The last time the winner was a Korean bbq pork jerky and I swear it's the best jerky I've ever had.   US only unless you can find the snack on both our sites for under $10 usd  I'm not in the mood for any crackers at this time, I'm also frugal and love a bargain. Use snackaholic for the randomizer if I can't find a snack to share.  Flash contest ends at bedtime about 11pm est

Snackaholic  &#x200B;  I see some Albanese gummies in our future. They are delicious and gluten free :)
I have an over one pound jar of delicious looking honey roasted nuts for $9.99 on my list! Snackaholic
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CVQ44HX/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glc_fabc_Aq8.Fb7R3TT9G   These look interesting 🤔...? Lol
Snackaholic sounds like me!  Korean bbq pork jerky is life. I love it so much 😍  But, I think you should try Blue Diamond Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds.
Snackaholic  Hi-Chew Sweet and Sour candy  Best candy IMO, a fave snack of mine.
u/shesagoodfella u/starofsavannah
snackaholic 🌸  you can never go wrong with some dried tart apple or peach slices~! they are so so good and are an alternative to chips and a perfect snack if you want something naturally sweet and tart~! 🍎
I love peach rings so much and found some for about that much xD If you've never tried one before, I'm 100% certain having one will win you over. Thanks for the contest Dario!  Snackaholic haha
Hey there fellow Snackaholic! I’ve got some Little Pepi’s Pizzelle Waffle Cookies on my 10$ and under list that looks so good!
snackaholic  How about some Lindt milk chocolate truffles? Those are my favorite! 🤤   Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
snackaholic   I've heard Pocky sticks are really good, especially the strawberry cream ones :D
Not entering because I'm limited in what snacks I can eat right now, but I wanted to drop in to say hi because we haven't talked in a minute 👀
I got some sweet ginger chews on my list. They are pretty good! Cheap too. Individually wrapped goodness.  Snackaholic
I’m a recovering Snackaholic but I could never give up delicious dark chocolate!
I have some cherry sours on list. They are a little crunchy, a little chewy, and a balance of sweet and sour. Yum!
Snackaholic   I love Cella's chocolate covered cherries. They are like the Ticonderoga of chocolate-related-snacks.
Hi Dario, I’m Hannah and I’m also a snackaholic. I’ve been snack free for 5 hours and that’s 5 hours too long.   I have pancake mix on my list. Yes a pancake is a perfectly good snack.
You can never go wrong with [rice crispy treats](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2ID1ZRHXYTHRR?ref_=wl_share)!  I too am a snackaholic.  I wish I could find the Russel Stover S’mores.  Those are so good!   If you haven’t tried them, I highly recommend!
I have some Nature Valley Biscuits with Peanut Butter on my snacks list. I got them for my boyfriend's birthday as a snack for our picnic and they were soooooo good!  Snackaholic!
Im a snackalicious fella too. If you love caramel, I higggghhhhlyyy recommend the following. I get them at TJ Maxx/Marshalls much cheaper, but lawdddd they are incredible. I eat the whole bag. From one snackaholic to the next, I present you with Heaven...   https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HQ4DPLR/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_awdb_imm_t1_uX7.Fb5Y3QWKJ?_encoding=UTF8
I would recommend Philippine Brand Dried Mangoes. I like that particular brand because there’s added sugar which makes them extra yummy.  snackaholic
Have you tried the Truffle Almonds? You can check them out [here](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1S58ACXE1Q17Y?ref_=wl_share)  Yummy for the tummy!!  You can buy 2/$10 too, one for each of us.   Snackaholic
I have a plethora of snacks scattered about my lists and on my actual snack list. Why!?! Because snacks are everything! They provide sustenance and joy!   Ever had senbei or arare? Different types of rice crackers... these are not to be confused with rice cakes (eww! So bland!) Senbei and Arare are quite tasty... they can be sweet, salty, or umami. Crunchy, delicious, and fun! Arare is great with buttered popcorn for even more yummy. If you’ve never tried, you really should!  Edit for Snackaholic! 🤭☺️🎉🤣 also, i know you said no crackers... but they aren’t really like common crackers.
I love snacks, too! My hips don’t, but that’s a tale for another day.   I’m going to go with cinnamon gummy bears. Have you had them? They are one of my favorite treats. I also really, really love caramel cheddar popcorn mix!   Snackaholic!
Love this! I am most definitely a snackaholic too, lol. All the snacks!! ;)  Well my favorite snack is those Royal Dansk Danish butter cookies! Sooooo good! Haha. I’ve also got a snack variety pack thing on my list that looks good! Has sweet things and salty things too, like those delicious Grandmas cookies. Haha. My partner is obsessed with those Big Texas Cinnamon Rolls. We haven’t had them in yeaaaars, but they are soo good! So those are on there too!   Thanks for hosting! :)
My kid and I recently tried the "popin cookin DIY candy" and it was surprisingly delicious and very cute, if a lot of work.  [https://www.amazon.com/Kracie-Popin-Cookin-Candy-Sushi/dp/B01MT4BETI/ref=sr\_1\_6?dchild=1&keywords=sushi+candy&qid=1610598308&sr=8-6](https://www.amazon.com/Kracie-Popin-Cookin-Candy-Sushi/dp/B01MT4BETI/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=sushi+candy&qid=1610598308&sr=8-6)
I am so excited for this!! I am a snackaholic too. We even get snack crate every month and it’s like a family ordeal. I share about the country from the insert and the rule is everyone absolutely has to take 1 bite of everything! We’ve had 5 so far and Japan has been my favorite! There’s a chocolate DIY kit - Meiji Tezukuri Apollo Chocolate DIY kit and it’s so good! And fun!! The kids had a blast making it and I had an even better time eating it.   This is it - Meiji DIY Strawberry Chocolate https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PG7F7AK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glc_fabc_hH8.FbQ2RVASN?psc=1  SO GOOD
Tteokbokki. I am always craving it.
I can get these at the asian market for about half the price, but these are easily THE BEST sunflower seeds I've ever had. Bigs, Frito Lay, and David don't stand a chance imo.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006RNDVDW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_qz-.FbS928J03?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

If I had to make healthy choices for health reasons I know I would still be snacking but healthier!!

Perfect time to add some. I search snacks under $5
🍿🍿🍿
Thanks so much!! I read the post twice but somehow missed that! You rock!!
Lol!!! Awesome!!! I’m so excited bc I FREAKING LOVE REESES!!!! Glow in the dark is not necessary, I suppose. I don’t know. You pick!! Thank you!!!
And of course here I was thinking the candy was glow in the dark 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
For sure! I'm definitely going to try some of the snacks that others have mentioned!
Not evil at all! That sounds amazzzzzzinggg 😋
Oh no, I have no self-will or diet restrictions...I just can't eat many snacks right now because I got all of my wisdom teeth removed last Thursday 😭 I'm sorry my lack of snacks makes you sad....for future reference I wouldn't be upset if you forced your snacks on me haha
They’re super yummy, and hard to find locally here but I because smitten with them out east!
Lol. I had an elementary school teacher who made a big deal out of Ticonderoga pencils. He always said they were the gold-standard best pencils ever. And he would take trade-ins of cool erasers and colorful gel pens in exchange for a chance to use of of his Ticonderoga pencils. It's funny, but it always stuck with me.
I try to not snack at night either especially because that’s when I want to smack the most after my daughter is in bed and I am relaxing.   It makes great waffles too 😉😂
The minis are **super** dangerous because they are so easy to gobble up!  But, they’re so cute!!
Oh, and I don’t think there can be too many, right 🤣
They were a bit dry but my boyfriend and I liked them! They were about as dry as Nature Valley snacks usually are (but didn't fall apart like the granola bars do)
So chewy and rich almost like soft toffee in flavor. The pecans add such dynamic. Wooo, I may go shopping and hope to find some haha.
My bad!
Of course! Copy away.
Hmmm I don’t know what a good snack would be! That’s a tough one!!
Yasss! 🙌
No problemo!! :) always happy to help
I'm about to place the order I hope you want 3x the candy? Or do you have another snack in mind?
🤕 hope you're not in too much pain!!!
A late night drive thru might be an exception every now and then 😁
I eat peanut butter everyday, I'm not sure why I never tried these
Np
Gummies. Jerky. Cereal. Cookies.
3x the Reese’s sounds like  HEAVENNNNNNN
Thankfully I'm not, just craving all the things I can't eat :-(   P.S I really like your name!
Even if I don't win this, you should still give them a try! My boyfriend also eats a bunchhh of peanut butter. He likes to put them on graham crackers. That's why I thought these would be good for his birthday picnic! And they were good!
Lol what does it rhyme with?
Wario 😈
Very good! People prounonce it like dairy oh and I'm like how do you pronounce Super Mario? Then they say oh!
The "dairy oh" pronunciation would never work out for Portuguese people trying to say it lol   My middle name is Brasil, people think that's weird apparently
I love it because it's with the s
Aww thanks :-)

When covid is over you’ll have to take your daughter out for a night on the town and wear those earrings and your best party dress!!
Yes! I will be seeing my girls soon for the "meet the dress" date for my future daughter in law. I will definitely wear them that day for our girls afternoon!
Perfect!! Sounds like quite the adventure!!

Hello there.  I’ve been on Reddit for a hot minute, but I just found this sub and I had to join! Y’all seem like a fun and positive group of people here; that is not always the case on Reddit lol.   My name is Mallory and I live in Nevada, USA. I have three dogs at home, I work at a high school with special needs students and I have just this past year taken up the bass. I’m not that skilled quite yet, but I’m learning all of my favorites. The hardest part is coordination and patience.  I love music, Disneyland, film and television. Anything that will rot my teeth and my mind, now that I think about it. I mostly listen to classic rock, 80’s pop, swing jazz, various Latin genres and others in between. My favorite group since I was young is Queen. I also love Prince, Jennifer Lopez, Stevie Nicks, Coldplay, David Bowie and many more. As for movies, I watch just about everything, though I’m not much into horror. I’ve seen the original Carrie, and that’s enough for me lol. I don’t think I could compile a list of my favorite movies without upsetting those films that didn’t make the list, so I will just let you know if it has been nominated for an award, I probably love it!   I hope to make some acquaintances and possibly some friendships here, and of course to gift some of you! I don’t make much money, but I hope to brighten some peoples’ days here every now and again.  Thank you for reading!   PS: I love the Star Wars prequels.  PPS: I know “they suck”.  PPPS: I don’t think they suck.  PPPPS: I have a dog named Cardi B.

Hello and welcome Mallory! I also love Disneyland and Queen. What kinds of dogs do you have?   I hope you love it here.

Hello and welcome! You sound awesome! What’s your fav color? I hope you enjoy the community! :)
What movie are you referencing through your username? Lmao!   Music is such a wonderful thang! Wish i had the skill to create my own. Im ace at hot cross buns in the recorder tho.  Hope you enjoy your stay as much as I do.
I love that your dog is Cardi B.
Aloha and Welcome to RAOA! 🌈☺️  I like your style! I think we could hang 😉🙌☺️  I love movies and shows too!!! Do you dislike all manner of horror including zombies, monsters, and supernatural films/shows? What would you say is your favorite or go-to genre?  What kind of dogs do you have?
Welcome to RAOA! ✨  May we see pictures of your doggos?
GENERAL KENOBI!  Hi hi! Also new here and a prequel lover. And movie lover in general so I welcome the references!

Hi there.
Lol hi there! How are you?
HEYYYYY YOUUUUU GUYSSSSS. Im gonna rewatch that today. Welcome to the crew. The Star Wars prequels are the bomb. And your dogs name is even better.
Hello and welcome to the sub! How’s your Thursday starting out?
Hello! Welcome to RAOA! 👋 I’m Lily, it’s so nice to meet you! I hope that we can be friends! Being a newbie can be pretty tricky, so if you need help with anything - or just want to chat - feel free to PM me and I will assist you to the best of my ability! ✨💛
l like Spring the most. Its still chilly, but plants are coming back to life, the daylight lasts longer, and of course, the school semester is almost over lol.   What's yours?
Do you have any recommendations or favorite horror movies?
Thanks :)
Hello! And welcome to you too :)
I have a teacup chihuahua, a dachshund mix and a pyrenees mix! Have you got any pets?
I would be a bird so I could fly far, far away from here.  Forrest Gump reference :)  But for reals, being a bird might be nice. How about you?
You are correct, I am awesome. I love blue! What about your favorite?
I once won a candy bar in the fifth grade because I was the fastest at playing the Looney Tunes theme song on recorder lol.  As for my username, it's like telling people to kiss my ass, but in a lady way lol. Tell yo friends. If it catches on, I will put that shit on a t-shirt.
My neighbors laugh, but their dogs can't rap like mine.
Hello! I haven’t seen enough supernatural shows/film to rule it out, I just get a lil freaked out lol. I loved the show The Vampire Diaries, so there’s that. I know I would enjoy The Originals, but I haven’t seen the show yet. I don’t think I’ve seen any zombie or monster movies other than that. Do you like those movies?   I’m most drawn to dramas, comedies and thrillers/action. I love Tarantino movies, but I wouldn’t consider them scary. I also love animation. Occasionally a rom-com is nice too.  I have a teacup chihuahua, a dachshund mix and a Pyrenees mix :)
Of course! I just have to figure out how to do that lol
You are a bold one!  I was waiting for someone to see what I did there lol. What’s the most recent movie you watched?
Happy New Year to you too! New Years' Eve is my favorite holiday. I've always celebrated it, and the only obligations it requires are snacks lol. I enjoy the changes in weather the most. Where I live, I get to experience all four seasons, so I am so happy about that. I wish there was more rain and snow, but its fun to see the changes as the year goes by.   Do you have any plans for the weekend?
:)
Hi! I am doing alright, how are you?
Hello! My Thursday was alright, glad it's the weekend. How about you?
Hi Lily! Thank you so much, I can be an idiot sometimes so I may need help lol. How was your Wednesday?
Fall is probably my favourite. I love the overall vibe around Halloween and the weather is pretty warm and breezy for a little while. Definitely enjoy all the caramel apple seasonal stuff too.
Wow all different sizes! I have a pug husky mix and a boarder collie mix. And a hamster.
I would choose a hawk! Similar reasons! lol I would be able to fly wherever I want!
Well kiss my clitoris! The looney toons theme... You got me outranked. I took pride too :/ lmao
Oh! Well, of course they range in spookiness, so it seems you don’t mind the mild stuff. 👍 yeah, i like the spooky stuff... always have, but i appreciate almost every genre of film and music. 😉  Nice! Can’t beat a good comedy, they never get old!!! Dramas and action/thrillers are great too! ☺️ Tarantino movies are more action/thriller i would think... kinda gorey though, but they are good! Every now and then i enjoy a good rom-com too 🤗  Must be interesting to have two little dogs living with a larger one. 😉🤣
I actually watched Pieces of a Woman last night. Very haunting movie. You kinda have to be emotionally prepared to watch it.  But other than that I haven't actually watched a full movie recently. I've got Hunt for the Wildepeople on my "continue watching". If you haven't seen that yet, I'd definitely recommend it.
Well hello my friend you're like me when I was a little girl we had Winter Spring summer fall and every Winter Spring summer full of that's exactly what happens in the Winter we always look forward to snow in the summer war was always hot..   now it seems like here on the East Coast we only have maybe 2 seasons😫😳 and it's just very crazy so I'm definitely a firm believer of climate change.   This weekend is relaxing doing some cleaning and taking care of my indoor houseplants. Hoping that you have a wonderful day and you're enjoying your stay with us hugs to you my friend🐭🧸❤
It was ok! I’m just a little tired and looking forward to a nap.
Oh I love the spooky season lol. What's your favorite Halloween movie?
Is that a pugsky or a hug?
It was only a funsize so don't be too jelly. lol
You would think that the big dog is the boss, but the smallest one is. She’s the oldest, so she’s the rightful queen lol. Have you got any animals at home?   What spooky movies could you recommend me?  So far I’m going to see Happy Death Day. Maybe my 2021 goal can be to not be a scaredy cat lol.
Hmm...as far as like to watch for Halloween and not actual horror...I'd say probably Sleepy Hollow or Beetlejuice. Do you have a favourite one?
I’ve heard the mic called both. His name is Chug so I think he is a hug. Plus he’s a cuddler.
Im not jelly bout the candy... its the sheer recorder talent :))))). And here I go to buy a recorder to strengthen my recorder status.
Haha! Dog queens are so sassy! i usually find that the little dogs take charge and the big dogs are just chill, in general😉🤣  I don’t think i mentioned... two of my three kids are on the spectrum. Sleep is a myth in my house, so running on fumes, so forgive my lack of recall 🤦🏻‍♀️ (i can totally make more/better suggestions when i feel less like a zombie 😉🤣)  Zombie-type Movies: 28 Days Later, Zombieland, Train to Busan, I an Legend, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Shawn of the Dead  Vampire-type Movies: Interview with a Vampire, 30 Days of Night, From Dusk Til Dawn, Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Underworld, Fright Night, What We ado in the Shadows  Monster-type Movies: Monster Squad, Little Shop of Horrors, PuppetMaster, Gremlins, Arachnophobia, The Blob  Ghost-type Movies: The Frighteners, Poltergeist, The Ring, The Grudge, Ghostbusters, Evil Dead, Army of Darkness  Alien-Type Movies: Alien (4 movies), Predator, Fire in the Sky, Critters, Killer Clowns
Either Beetlejuice or The Rocky Horror Picture Show for me. I love Johnny Depp, but I've never seen Sleepy Hollow. I do like Sweeney Todd though!
That's awesome. Where did the name Chug come from?
Lol. One day, I will see you in person, and we shall duel. A mashup of Hot Cross Buns and the Looney Tunes theme song. Only one will prevail. Winner gets a FULL SIZE candy. Now excuse me, I must go to the dollar store and purchase a purple glitter recorder that sounds like a dying animal.
Hi. You just mentioned *Dracula* by Bram Stoker.  I've found an audiobook of that novel on YouTube. You can listen to it here:  [YouTube | DRACULA by Bram Stoker | FULL AUDIOBOOK Part 1 of 3 | Classic English Lit.

I love Sleepy Hollow, I remember watching it as a kid. I still have yet to watch RHPS. We were supposed to this year but were just a bit too busy to do much for Halloween.
I didn’t name him, I believe his previous owners young son did. The son was allergic so I got him. ♥️
How spooky is Sleepy Hollow? On a scale from Charlie Brown to Freddy Krueger lol.   RHPS is great, Tim Curry is the best, so I recommend the OG lol. I enjoyed the new one as well.
Aww poor little guy, at least you've got him now. Chug is sorta badass anyway, that kid new what he was doing lol
As a child, there was only one scene that scared me and it's a jump scare. The CGI for the part is so outdated though it does look silly and gave me a laugh last time I watched it. Not to say the rest of the movie looks bad, it's just that one split second scene in particular.
He’s a great dog. I love him and my other so much! [Here](https://imgur.com/a/S3NKXz9) they are in case you are curious!
Oh that’s not to bad. Older gore effects are very obvious, so someday I might watch more of them. Whenever I see previews for new horror movies I have to close my eyes, they are too realistic.
They are so cute! Thanks for sharing!
Oh, it's not even gore in this one. Come to think of it...I'm not sure there was much, if any at all. I love horror movies though :)
Of course!
Which ones would you recommend to a scaredy cat?
Hmmm...I'm really not quite sure. Maybe Annihilation since it's grouped in with horror but more of a sci-fi. But it also has one scene that really put people on edge...it was unique and interesting but wasn't really all that scary imo. So make what you will of that. But also maybe just dark comedies might be up your alley or good to start with.   Try The Babysitter or Happy Death Day!
Maybe I will try Happy Death Day because seeing the ad for the movie Freaky looked good. Haven’t seen The Babysitter, but it must have been good enough because I seen they made a sequel. It will be baby steps lol.

That lamp is life! So darn cute
u/VexedKitten94 EeeeeEee! I love both of these things SO MUCH. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Mwah!
Woah how gorgeous!!!!
Holy crap this is awesome! I adore you both
Pretty. I almost want to build an Aladdin shrine.
That’s so pretty!
Wow! That’s cool. Congrsts! 🎉
Okay why aren’t the images showing up 🥺 Reddit gon make me cry.
By chance... when the genie came out.. did he look like will smith?
Isn’t it though? I might have to start collecting genie lamps after seeing this up close.
You are so welcome!!! I love the little genie lamp, it’s so cute! And the beads are so pretty! I’m glad you love them. 💕😊
I see them on my end
Multiple lamps x 3 wishes per lamp...sound investment
Thanks! I see them now. Whew.
No worries! The app was doing that to me a few days ago too

u/nacho_cheezus. Thanks for the rad decal!
Peace is great but I’m here to applaud you for the Nuka Cola girl. Hahahahahahhahahahah. Maybe Im just obsessed while I’m putting together a costume.   Did you hear Amazon is supposed to release a Fallout show? It might be a real entertaining shitshow.

Hi redditors, I love the idea of this sub and can’t wait to get started. I hope I did all the newbie stuff correctly. I work in Special Education with young children on the autism spectrum. I am transitioning from remote learning to in person next week! I’m nervous but excited to see the kids. I live in the PNW, love cats, music, netflix and junk TV, hockey and football. AMA, happy to be here

Hi! Welcome! What's your favourite animal?
Hi and welcome! I'm new too and they're all nice and sweet on this sub! It's a breath of fresh air!
Welcome! What are some of your fav shows to watch on Netflix? 📺
Hi, my daughter is autistic and has SPD.  My daughters thing is dogs.  Have you got any kids obsessed with something who you work with?
Welcome to the sub!!
Welcome
Hey there! Any favourite hockey teams?
Hi there and welcome!
Hello and welcome!
Thanks for the welcome!
Thank you.  I like to snack on dark chocolate, cashews and fruit mostly.  I like to relax (pre-covid) hanging out with friends, going to see live music, visiting wineries and breweries or just listening to music.  My favorite artists are Ryan Bingham, Jason Isbell and the like!
Anything dark chocolate, bonus if it has salted caramel and nuts
Hi, I think I found RAOA as a Trending SubReddit when I was scrolling on the app.  My top 3 shows on Netflix right now are: Alone, Call the Midwife and Queen's Gambit
Hi, I would say my favorite holiday is Thanksgiving because I like to eat (not cook) all the good food and watch football on TV with family.  My favorite thing about nature is all the different scenery in the northwest: water, trees, snowcapped mountains, etc  Maybe you can tell me what I am doing wrong when I add flair?
Thank you, I'm still figuring it out.  I never use Reddit on my desktop, always mobile.
Horses!! but my favorite pet would be a kitten
Thanks and I agree. I wanted to join this sub as an easy way to spread some kindness
Hello, I answered that earlier. Right now I am mostly watching Alone and Call the Midwife
oh sure, many over the years! planets, dinosaurs, numbers, alphabet, car washes and RV’s were 2 of the funniest ones to me!
hey, thanks!
Thank you!
oh yes, I’ve always been a Predators fan but now that my city is getting an NHL franchise I am Kraken obsessed!
Hello, I’m not used to such an active sub. I’m trying to reply to everyone
Thanks for the welcome! wow, this sub is friendly
oooo agree entirely on all the snacks and wineries and breweries are so much fun to go to!
I LOVE Call the Midwife!  Do you have a favorite resident of Nonnatus House?
Hello there I bring nature in everyday I open my windows I listened to the birds singing I look at the different trees and the colors. It looks like you have your flair set up properly if you have any more questions please let me know
Omg I am excited for Seattle! I am a Canucks fan so not sure how my friends will feel when they see that I’m a Seattle fan too
You're doing a good job!
haha, my daughter and I have just finished the 1st season.  So far, I would say Chummy just because she is so silly and endearing!
it’s gonna be so fun, we actually have a ton of hockey fans down here

u/Effective_Cupcake_24 Congrats on having the closest guess. The power was out for over 17 hours.
Woohoo! 🎉 glad you got your power restored!!! ☺️ congrats to the winner! 🎉
Glad to hear your power is back on! We never stop to appreciate what we have until its gone.
Thank you. Sorry you were without power for so long. Hope the rest of your week goes well.
Thank you!  True...I especially feel that about all the food I had to throw away. 😭
No problem, and thank you. It was annoying, but it could have been much worse.
Hey, fyi, you can file a claim with your renters/homeowners. They will replace it ALL, and its a "natural event" so most companies wont increase premiums...worth a call to check on it. 🙂
Ooh, I didn't even think of that! I will call and check on that!

Hello all,  I've been checking things out in this community for a bit and have decided to finally introduce myself.   I'm from Canada, I'm a mom to a soon to be 3 year old and 8 year old. I'm also mom to a dog aptly named Jabba the pug and a rescued cat named Nibs.   We love being outdoors especially in winter but this year the snow has decided not to stay.  I've always loved sewing, baking and all things crafty. I love making creative messes with my kids. My husband has recently got into the 3D printing world and has been collecting all of the Star Wars LEGO he can get his hands on. (Send help - kidding of course.)  Anyways, I can't wait to spend some more time in here.

Hello and welcome to you and Jabba the pug!
Welcome fellow crafty Canadian!
Welcome!
Hey there welcome 😃
Hi and welcome!  I hope you enjoy it here!
Welcome, people on here will look after you well I am sure.  Tell me your favourite thing to bake.
Hiya!  How are you doing? Welcome!
Hello and welcome! I also love baking. What’s the last think you baked? For me it was banana bread and I’m going to make some snickerdoodles soon for my daughter.
Welcome! 🇨🇦
hello, welcome! can we see jabba the pug? what crafty thing is your favourite?
Hello and welcome! What's your favourite thing to bake?
Welcome welcome!  How funny, I have a guinea pig named Nibs (well, Nibbles) 🐹
Thanks!
Thanks!
My husband is always tinkering with his. It's a learning curve for sure. My husband has the right amount of patients for it, I'm not that techy of a person.  My favourite way to relax is to go for a walk without the kids or a nice hot bubble bath.
Pugs are a pretty laid back breed.
Thanks!
I don't have a favourite holiday, time with my family with not a thing to do is pretty much a holiday in my mind.   The thing I most enjoy about nature is that it makes me feel grounded even on the roughest of days.
Thanks! He's snoring away. Haha.
Thanks!
Thanks!
Hello
Thanks!
I love to bake cheesecake.
Hello, I am doing good. I hope you're doing well.
Too funny, the last thing I made was banana crumble muffins. I have yet to make snickerdoodles.
Thanks! :)
Hello. Here he is Jabba https://imgur.com/gallery/Z99cjhC My favourite crafty thing to do would be scrapbooking.
Cute! I have yet to own a guinea pig in my lifetime.
Ooo awesome choices!    My husband works with one a lot at work so I'm going to be making him teach me the ropes lol
Yes maam they are. We had them growing up. I miss em.
I agree with you I bring nature indoors all the time I open up my windows I look at the trees and the breeze I listen to the birds singing it's definitely been very helpful in my life
Nice! There is a cute little girl pug at my shelter that I’m hoping gets adopted tomorrow fingers crossed 🤞🏽
Those sound delicious!
Jabba is beautiful. does he like boat rides? (im asuming youre on a boat in the picture?)
Haha. Mine has far too many hobbies, he's in his element with this one that's for sure. Keeps him out of trouble!
Awe, I hope she gets adopted too. Their faces are hard to resist!
Yes he was in a boat in the picture. He loves to come fishing with us when it's not too hot out.
Sooo cute and she sounds like a little gremlin when she makes noise [cutie pie](https://ibb.co/cgPW13K)
My boy (a jug) likes fishing too. But he will dive off the boat to try and help (but he won’t go in the water any other time).
Well now I have puppy fever. Totally cute!
Too funny. Jabba doesn't like the water. He used to try and jump in the tub with me as a pup but he's a fussy old man now.
Isn’t she? The vet put “very tubby” in her file. I LOVE pugs 🙃
Mine hates the water. Just really likes fish.

ooo yes. .yes indeed. lol I agree with this.  &#x200B;  Congrats!

My stepkids mother just tested positive for COVID, so we are going to be quarantining with the kids for the next 2 weeks. I am going to take Friday and lock myself in my room with the mask and the book, while wearing the shirt and going to get some self care in! Thanks again u/omgitsmoki 🥰
Ahhh the cutest shirt ever!! 🥰
I have that shirt in yellow it’s soo nice and soft!
That shirt
Excellent goodies!!
Absolutely love the shirt!!!
Oh no! I hope you and the kids are gonna be okay for 2 weeks. I'm glad the stuff arrived in time for you to have a nice relaxing day <3
Sorry to hear that:( recover quickly
They really got the flatness of the cat just right! Lol. I can't wait to wear it.
That's awesome!  I actually bought one for my daughter for Christmas so now we can wear it together and be twins! Lol
Right!?
It's a pretty awesome shirt!!  And it looks just like my cat when she can't cat. 😂
Thank you!  We have instacart and doordash! We are going to hopefully get a family therapy session in asap as well.
Thank you.  We are hoping for a quick recovery for her so the kids can see their mom again soon! 🤞🏼
How cute

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kwypik/discussion_what_fantasyscifi_world_would_you_want/

World of Warcraft. 100%
Post-voldemort Wizarding World -or- Pokemon Kanto...it's a toss-up!
Hogwarts!!!!
Middle Earth in LOTR or whenever Star Trek TNG takes place.
I vote Middle Earth
Something modern with magic, like Hogwarts. I loveeee wizards.
Hmmm..LOtR all the way
I've always kind of wanted to be part of the *Digimon* universe.
I would like to live in the world of Sabrina
One where I can be a cottage witch and left alone
I have dreamed of living in hundreds of worlds, but I always return to the world of my favorite novel series. Xanth! Everyone is born with a single special talent/power. Some simple, some almost godlike. I don't know what my power would be, but I always hope that if would be something I can use to explore the world! See all the mysterious creatures and places of the world of Xanth novels!!
Dragon Lance, Harry potter, or Wonderland!! Although I will be rather upset if this transports me to Harry potter world and I am just stuck as a muggle or a non-witch  lmao \*gets teleported and is suddenly a blast end skrewt or some other sort of horrid nonsense\*
Not true fantasy, but fantasy of mine... Candy land.
City of atlantis
Oh, to live in the Animal Crossing world...
Can’t choose 😱🤦🏻‍♀️🤣
Pokemon all the way. Basically a world with more pets, and usefull animals, either that or digimon (more pets, but darker vibes)
Doctor who   Animal crossing
Avatar the Last Airbender 100%
There are a lot I’d go for - but the Blade Runner world appeals to me. Especially the 2049 version.
The Fever Series! KarenMarieMoning
The hunger games universe
Kushiel Legacy by Jacqueline Carey
WoT by Robert Jordan late 3rd age(as it's called by some)
One Piece
Harry Potter honestly seems like the best universe you could live in. Magic makes everything so convenient and it's similar enough to our world that it would be the least painful to adjust to.
I'm not sure which one, I just want to be able to turn into a mermaid.
Haha, what would you be? I play a druid..but I honestly would love to be a mage. Especially after watching the Warcraft movie I absolutely want to be a mage in that world!!
Oh that's a good one, as long as it's not suuupper realistic. I couldn't handle the Western Plaguelands, or Noxxramas, or Duskwood...
Nice one!
+1 for Pokemon! Everyone in that world seems decently happy, plus everyone has great universal healthcare 😅
Ooh very nice! What starter pokemon?
What house??
YES a trek fan!!!
What would you want to be tho...>.> *cough DWARF cough*
But where? I'm partial to Rivendell, though now that so many have left it, perhaps Lothlorien is the place to be?
Oh hell yeah!!!
Oh my same hereeee
Yes!
That sounds really interesting!  Is it a single book?  a series?  How many of them are there?
Rofl idk.. being one of the amazing creatures that Newt Scamander takes care of and utilizes wouldn't be so bad!
Gets to go to Hogwarts...finds out that it's as a flobberworm.  womp womp.
Oh? Do tell!!
Oh nice one!!
Yes! Either a druid or a mage. Gosh, I miss that game so much!!!
True, very very very true.
I love everything water, so it's gotta be Squirtle!  Who would you choose?
I consider myself a “Slytherclaw”! 😂
Probably eorling and be a master of horsemanship. It always sounded adventurous
Ohhh good question. Maybe go and explore Rhûn and the Eastlands becoming a hero and partaking in adventures that will be sung by many bards upon my death.
As of January 19th this year, there will be 44 books with 3 more still to come!
Hmm maybe. All im saying is that Hagrid has shown us that there are a ton of creatures i wouldn't want to be 🤣🤣
🤣🤣
I mean come on.   You slip and fall... Boing soft marshmallow to break the fall.   The delicious rocky road is Sno-Capped in the winter time.    Chocolate waterfalls.   April rainbow sprinkle showers bring May lollipop flowers.   Edible bird poop... No longer afraid of the Dove(s) flying over yiu.  Twizzler jump ropes.   Just the sweetest, pure (sugar) place to be.
I just logged off of it about 20 minutes ago funny enough lol.
Bulbasaur! Those vines can be used in so many ways!!
ROFL
Hell yeah!!
We don't know a ton about the Eastlands- now that it's back under Gondor's control, perhaps you could sort and share some of the details of what's there!  What's your favorite Tolkien text?
Rofl yeah
My teeth are crying but everything else says YES lol
I'm jealous!!!
My favorite Tolkien text is his translation of Sir Gwain and the Green Knight. When I was at Oxford I had to read it for a tutorial and being super nerdy I went to The Eagle and Child to read just to say I did.
Sorry =P

u/DebStone Thank you so much for the awesome card!! The card and the envelope are both SO cute and so unique! I love them!! I am a bit torn between folding the bottom bit to make him sit, and trying to reuse it! Haha. Getting it in the mail today definitely made me smile! Thank you! :)  P.S. And yes y’all, the panda has another little place to fold and a little note saying you can fold it to make him sit! So stinking cute!!
How cool is that card!!
He looks like he needs a big ol bear hug. How cute. Id die inside lol
I know it was supposed to be a postcard but since you had panda, I couldn't pass up the chance to send the card. Glad you like it.
Right?! I agree! So cool. :)
Haha yes! I was so happy to see him when I opened the envelope! :)
I don’t blame you, it’s such an amazing card! Haha. But yes, I love it! :)

Snape is my favorite character- I appreciate his shades of grey!  Who is yours?  I also identify as a Ravenclaw- what about you?  I love so many books!  AJ Jacobs is probably my favorite nonfiction writer but I can't say I have a definite favorite fiction writer!  I love HP and LotRof course, but I also love tons of less popular things as well.  I recently read Mr Penumbra's 24 hour bookstore and loved that!  It was an easy, but fun and exciting read.  I love trying new recipes!  I am currently doing a Whole 30 which has meant stretching and changing a lot of my go-tos which has been a fun challenge.  For Chrismas I received a sous vide and the steaks that I've made using it have been excellent. I also love baking and have been most proud of a strawberry hazelnut pavlova, chocolate croissants, and peanut butter cup macarons.
I love using the Chi Squared test!  It's comforting to be able to clearly state whether or not there's a relationship.  In research I largely prefer quantitative data over qualitative.
I am most definitely a ravenclaw!  What about you?
Family Life Education is a relatively new field- it's sort of like an applied branch of family science.  So family life educators teach all kinds of life and social skills- parenting class, pre-marital education, co-parenting, training familial caretakers of the elderly, teaching personal finance classes, the list is pretty broad.  Many Family Life Educators work for non-profits that serve specific segments of the population (recently divorced families, adoptive families, the elderly, etc). Some also work as or with social workers, for churches, and for government parental education efforts.  Some also work as lobbyists on behalf of families- for example, lobbying for better maternity leave practices.
That's so kind, thank you so much!  I saw that somebody else had sent out birthday gifts- is there a master list somewhere, or was that information they just collected on their own?  If I send a gift, do I have to make a gifted post? I am still working my way through the FAQ, so it might be answered there....
Thanks!
I'm excited to be here!
I love a good pavlova!  I also really like an ice cream sundae with extra hot fudge! What's your favorite?
Why thank you!  And a happy new year to you too!  My favorite holiday is Christmas.  Gifts are my primary love language and I love picking out the right things for all of the people on my list!  I usually begin intentionally  looking for gifts in June, so Christmas really stretches to about 6 months for me!  My family loves to hike!  We don't go on long hikes as my kids are still quite young, but we love to get outside.  My personal favorite thing in nature are large bodies of water.  I grew up near the ocean in FL and have always felt calmed and centered when near the water.   I also think water sports are the best sports- I love swimming and kayaking and I've always wanted to try stand-up paddleboarding!  What about you?  What do you love most about nature?
My mind immediately jumped to Hermione's beaded bag with the undetectable extension charm on it- I think that'd be really handy to carry around!
I don’t think I have a favorite? I love memoirs, some fantasy, adventure, and some historical fiction- I’m pretty all over the place and will try anything but horror- I internalize horror and get nightmares
I am all in on Ravenclaw!
I named a current child Penelope so that her nickname could be Poppy after Poppy Pomfrey, the only responsible adult at Hogwarts. We were originally considering Luna, so I think I’d revisit that if we were to have another child.
Thanks!
OO Hello fellow Ravenclaw! My favorite character is Luna! I love how bright and fun she is! Snape was fantastic though and Alan Rickman did a fantastic job breathing life into the character!  My personal favorite author is Naomi Novik. Uprooted was amazing and I have loved everything of hers I have read so far! A.G. Howard is a fantastic YA Fantasy writer that does a wonderful Wonderland series called Splintered! and if you like horror, John Saul's Second Child is fantastic.   OOOO yes! We got a sous vide recently. Its such a game changer! and OMG macarons. Yum!
I'm going to pretend I know what those are LOOOOL
Same, 100%! Welcome to the sub, fellow Ravenclaw!
Fascinating... So many people could benefit from this.
You can always send a surprise/anonymous gift, no one’s stopping you, but it’s customary that you make a gifted post when you gift somebody! As for your other question, there is a birthday calendar in the user tools section of the subreddit information. Hope I could help! If you have any more questions, don’t be afraid to ask!
Ooo it’s so hard for me to pick! I love swedish fish but I love pineapple upside cake!
I've never read anything by Naomi Novik, but one of my goals this year is to read at least 30 books that are recommended to me!  So, would you like to recommend one of hers to start with?  Is Uprooted a good place to start?
haha, I just like to analyze numbers rather than words.
I totally agree with you!  It's just a matter of convincing people that it's worth spending money on.
Awesome, thank you so much!  I also found that random list generator- that was helpful too!
Uprooted is the first of hers I read! Its a great Fantasy read about a dragon (thats not a dragon), magic, war, and a dark forest.   Spinning Silver is also a fantastic book that is fantasy based!   I would also recommend Stain by Ag howard
numbers are fun esp when im researching betting odds
Awesome!  I will add them to my to-read list!
If you get around to reading any of them, let me know what you think!! Also, we have r/raoa_bookclub too   there are several different groups in it for different genres and they do new books all the time in each one!
Well, I just hopped over and joined that sub!  I will definitely let you know- I keep track of recommendations in my bullet journal so that I can circle back to the people who made the suggestions!
ooo thats a fantastic Idea. I really need to start doing that lol

I was having a moment today on my way home from work and this song came on and I just had to belt out the lyrics!   SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME, THE WORLD IS GOING TO ROLL ME   I AIN'T THE SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED .....
I’mmmm, comin up, so you better get this party started!!!!🎶  First song that popped into my head!
Just a small town girl living in a lonely world
I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away   Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing.   Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion   Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
Up on melancholy hill  there’s a plastic tree  Are you here with me Just looking out on the day Of another dream
‘Left a good job in the city Working for the man ev'ry night and day Then I never lost a minute of sleep When worrying bout the way that things might have been’  Big wheels keep on turning Proud Mary keeps on burning Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river  Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis Pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans But I never saw the good side of the city Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen  Big wheels keep on turning Proud Mary keeps on burning Rolling, rolling, rolling on the river’...  This song will always get me up dancing 💃.  Thank you for the contest <3
When I was 13, I had my first love There was nobody that compared to my baby And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above She had me going crazy Oh, I was starstruck She woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend She knows she's got me dazing, cause she was so amazing And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying  👶🏻
Oh don’t you dare look back, just keep your eyes on me, I said you’re holding back, She said SHUT UP AND DANCE WITH ME  That was our first dance. Love that song.
I hate that stupid old pickup truck   You never let me drive   You're a redneck heartbreak   Who's really bad at lying   So watch me strike a match   On all my wasted time   As far as I'm concerned   You're just another picture to burn!
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you ... it’s better when it’s not there birthday

"M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-EEEEEEEEEE"      Yes, I know. Just love me.
*Do you mind if I wild out a little?*  *Cause I’m just a little drunk and I wanna come party with you a little*  *Can I look into your eyes?*  *I can tell that you’re high too*
People are strange  When you’re a stranger  Faces look ugly  When you’re alone
And I said, ooh, I’m blinded by the lights,   No I can’t sleep until I feel your touch.   I said, ooh, I’m drowning in the night,   Oh when I’m like this, you’re the one I trust.
All I know is that to me   You look like your lots of fun   Open up your lovin arms   Watch out here I come   You spin me right round baby   Right round like a record baby   Round round round round   :D I love that song and it gets stuck in my head so often
Then like a sinner, before the gates of heaven
As I watch you move, across the moonlit room There's so much tenderness in your loving Tomorrow I must leave, the dawn knows no reprieve God give me strength when I am leaving... So raise your hands to heaven and pray That we'll be back together someday Tonight, I need your sweet caress Hold me in the darkness Tonight, you calm my restlessness You relieve my sadness As we move to embrace, tears run down your face I whisper words of love, so softly I can't believe this pain, it's driving me insane Without your touch, life will be lonely   u/noimnotsally what lyrics do you have???
"Like a comet pulled from orbit   As it passes the sun   Like a stream that meets a boulder   Halfway through the wood   Who can say if I've been changed for the better   But because I knew you   I have been changed for good"     u/space_noodlers
These have LONG been my favorite lyrics:  Terrified of telephones /  And shopping malls and knives / We're drowning in the pools of other lives   / Rely a bit too heavily  / On alcohol and irony  / Get clobbered on by courtesy / In love with love and lousy poetry  And I'm leaning on this broken fence / Between past and present tense /And I'm losing all those stupid games / That I swore I'd never play / But it almost feels okay  -from "Aside," by The Weakerthans
I remember that time you told me You said, "Love is touching souls." Surely you touched mine. 'Cause part of you pours out of me In these lines from time to time.  💜
Come with me I'll show you how to be a metal man When the gears are turning and the fires are burning When the world ticks around you, Voices tocking all the time And you live for sleep you've never slept Because you cannot sleep
This is how it works   You're young until you're not   You love until you don't   You try until you can't   You laugh until you cry   You cry until you laugh   And everyone must breathe   Until their dying breath  No, this is how it works   You peer inside yourself   You take the things you like   And try to love the things you took   And then you take that love you made   And stick it into some   Someone else's heart   Pumping someone else's blood   And walking arm in arm   You hope it don't get harmed   But even if it does   You'll just do it all again
Here comes the sun do, do, do  Here comes the sun  And I say it's all right
I know there's California, Oklahoma  And all of the places I ain't ever been to but  Down in the valley with  Whiskey rivers  These are the places you will find me hidin'  These are the places I will always go  These are the places I will always go
I don’t know   What all of this means   If you are not here with me   And I am lost   When we are apart   There’s a hole in my heart   That light passes through   And the pattern it creates   Is the shape of   The absence of you.  u/SJRDSJRD you just have something cheesy for this, surely...
I can’t live without your love and affection   I can’t face another night on my own  I’d give up my pride  To save me from being alone   Cause I can’t live without your love
I can't stop burning bridges   I'll win you over, make you my own   And then we'll both feel different   You can't possibly give what I want from you   I know I said you were perfect   I made the rules that you didn't know   All of these expectations   You can't possibly give what I want from you  Expectations - Wild Child <3
I love me!  Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else  (Hey)  Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else  I love me!  Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else
Like a force to be reckoned with  A mighty ocean or a gentle kiss  I will love you without any strings attached  And what a privilege it is to love  A great honor to hold you up  Two. Sleeping At Last
Why don’t we do it in the road?  Why don’t we do it in the road?  Why don’t we do it in the rooo-oad!  Why don’t we do it in the road?

I saw her today at the reception.   She had a glass of wine in her hand.   She said, "well, now I have to go meet my connection."   At her feet was a footloose man.  I heard her say,   "You can't always get what you want.   You can't always get what you want.   You can't always get what you want,   But if you try sometimes, you just may find,   Surely you will find you get what you need.

Love this!! I’m going to go with this classic, singing at the top of your lungs, volume all the way up in the driveway, neighbors think you’re crazy, song.. XD  “Conversation got heavyyy! She had me feeling like she’s ready to blow! (Watch out!) oh! A watch out! She’s saying come get mee! So I got up and followed her to the floor. She said baby let go. That’s when I told her, I said - Yeah!! “  Also, not typing it, but I just love ludacris’ part! Haha.   Thanks for hosting!

*Hold it now and watch the hoodwink*   *As I make you stop, think*   *You'll think you're looking at Aquaman*   *I summon fish to the dish*   *Although I like the Chalet Swiss*   *I like the sushi*   *'Cause it's never touched a frying pan*  My fave song for like 20 years XD
🎵 Stop right now, thank you very much 🎶  Yup, still stuck in my head from last night haha 🤪  Edit: Also... This week has been quite a YEAR, hasn't it?! My husband said something about it being Tuesday this morning and I was like....  Whhhhhhhhat?!?! Now we're going backwards?!?! Nooooooo.
I made this half pony half monkey monster to please you But I get the feeling that you don't like it What's with all the screaming?  You like monkeys, you like ponies Maybe you don't like monsters so much? Maybe I used too many monkeys. Isn't it enough to know that I ruined a pony making a gift for you?
"Stranded in the open  Dried out tears of sorrow  Lacking all emotion  Staring down the barrel waiting for the  Final gates to open  To a new tomorrow  Moving with the motion  Following the light that sets me free"   As a total side note, what do you think this song is about?
“De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da” :)
When she calls me baby  I just reach for the light  I'll hold her like a lady  Thank God she's all mine  With her arms around me  I can leave the world behind  When she calls me baby  I know what's on her mind
Let 'em say we're crazy! Dont care about that! Put your hand in my hand baby dont ever look baaaaaaccckkkk!!!! Let the world around us, just fall apaaaarrrtttt. Baby we can make it if we're HEART TO HEARRRRRRRT!!!!! And we can build this dream together, standing strong forever....NOTHINGS gonna stop us nowwwwwwww!!!!  Best. Song. Ever!!! 😍😍😍😍
Out of the darkness and into the sun I won't forget all the ones that I love..
You’re the reason that I feel so strong, The reason that I’m hanging on. You know you have me all that time, Did I give you enough of mine?
I’d sit alone and watch your light  My only friend through teenage nights  And everything I had to know I heard it on my radio You gave them all those old-time stars The wars of worlds, invaded by Mars You made ‘em laugh, you made ‘em cry You made us feel like we would fly
You're a star the way you are   You know you're not fooling anyone   No you've got the eyes of an angel   Don't try to change em   Everybody's got their scars   No matter what they tell ya   You're beautiful the way you are   One of my favorite feel-good songs :)
Fav running song  Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time I feel alive And the world I'll turn it inside out, yeah I'm floating around in ecstasy So.... 😊

Ahhhhhhhh OH!   LIVIN ON A PRAYER!!!   honestly that is my hype song haha back in high school my friend was in ASB and got to choose the songs during football halftime. Guess who was incessantly requesting this song during every halftime?  (She did it like 50% of the time I asked)
Old but I’m not that old Young but I’m not that bold And I don’t think this world is sold On just doing what we’re told
Said woman take it slow and it'll work itself out fine  All we need is just a little patience  Said sugar make it slow and we'll come together fine  All we need is just a little patience   This song is my happy place. The melody just soothes my soul 🎶🎶🎶
Let me give you the lyrics to a nice Vivian Girls song...  No, no-no-no, no-no-no, no, no  No, no-no-no, no-no-no, no, no  No, no-no, no-no-no  No, no-no-no, no-no-no, no, no  No, no-no-no, no-no-no, no, no, no
My favourite line from any song is still the song I discovered my first summer away from home (Montréal) working at a summer camp in Malibu.     Souls for Sale by Mad Caddies  From the hills of California to the streets of Berlin To the clubs in London town Tell me where our souls have gone and where can they be found All the way to Venezuela down to Sao Paulo Then back up to Montreal Tell me where have our souls gone and where they can be found
stanbul was Constantinople   Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople   Been a long time gone, Constantinople   Now it's Turkish delight on a moonlit night  Every gal in Constantinople   Lives in Istanbul, not Constantinople   So if you've a date in Constantinople   She'll be waiting in Istanbul  Even old New York was once New Amsterdam   Why they changed it I can't say   People just liked it better that way
Darling, you got to let me know  Should I stay or should I go?  If you say that you are mine  I'll be here 'till the end of time  So you got to let me know  Should I stay or should I go?
Ah ha!! My FAVORITE song...  "Any time I need to see your face I just close my eyes and I am taken to a place Where your crystal mind and magenta feelings taken shelter In the base of my spine, sweet like a chica cherry cola"
This one always picks me up!  Come now, come dry your eyes  You know you a star, you can touch the sky  I know that it's hard but you have to try  If you need advice, let me simplify
There's no combination of words I could put on the back of a postcard.           No song that I could sing, but I can try for your heart.           Our dreams, and they are made out of real things.          Like a shoe box of photographs with sepia-toned loving.             Love is the answer, at least for most of the questions in my heart.            Like why are we here? And where do we go? And how come it's so hard?              It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving.             I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together.              We didn't have the traditional wedding first dance but this is part of our song.
And doesn't that sound familiar?  Doesn't that hit too close to home? Doesn't that make you shiver; the way things could've gone? And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more? And so that I do remember to never go that far, Could you leave me with a scar?
Hey kids, shake it loose together The spotlight's hitting something That's been known to change the weather We'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around You're gonna hear electric music Solid walls of sound
My sweet midnight surprise, staple down my eyes   Stars I cannot see, take me galaxy
Currently in my ears, and doing a bang up job of relaxing me.   We were reaching in the dark  That summer in New York  And it was so far to fall  But it didn't hurt at all  You let it wash away, wash away.  -Florence + The Machine; The End of Love.
Whoomp there  it is!
Possessions never meant anything to me  (I’m not crazy)  Well that’s not true I’ve got a bed  And a guitar  And a dog named Dog who pisses on my floor  (That’s right I’ve got a floor)  So what? So what?
'And I was livin' like you'd live forever And it took losin' you to learn to love better'  ~~ Loved Me That Way by Lauren Duski
I did it all, I owned every second that this world could give. I saw so many places, the things that I did, yeah, with every broken bone, I swear I lived.   Honestly, that entire song has gotten me through a *lot*. If anyone's struggling, it's a great reminder of how we can live through anything. If you don't know it from the lyrics, it's I Lived - One Republic. I recommend you check it out!! A close second is Rolling Girl - Wowaka, if you like vocaloid!

The moments when you’re in so deep  It feels easier to just swim down  ETA — doesn’t do much hyping, but gets me in some kind of mood...
🎶Tomorrow will be kinder. It's true, I've seen it before. A brighter day is comin' my way. Yes tomorrow will be kinder.🎶
I hope, I wish alone and sit, you sit, but this is where we end it  It's crazy to me how the truth is often most offensive  Battle tested, learned my lesson to forgive, but not forget  I spilled my heart, opened my chest  Irrelevant, you are to me, but part to me, honestly  Thought I should address, life often makes this mess  I've come to give you more while everybody gives you less
Shackle and chained My soul feels stained I cant explain got an itch on my brain Lately my whole aim is to maintain And regain control of my mainframe My bloods boiling its beatin' out propaine My train of thoughts more like a runaway train I'm in a fast car drivin' in a fast lane In the rain and I'm might just hydroplaine   I don't fear none of my enemies And I don't fear bullets from oozies I've been dealing with something thats worse than these That'll make you fall to your knees and thats the   The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry Paranoias brought me to my knees Lord please please please Take away my anxiety
Hear the black tires grinding there   As she screeches out of the cemetary   My baby says I'm crazy but I think its a curse   Cause I'm in love with my 1960 cadillac hearse!
🎶 Build my fear of what's out there.. Cannot breathe the open air.. Whisper things into my brain, Assuring me that I'm insane. They think our heads are in their hands, But violent use brings violent plans.. Keep him tied, it makes him well, He's getting better, can't you tell?🎶
Children behave, that's what they say when we're together And watch how you play They don't understand And so we're Running just as fast as we can, holding on to one another hands Trying to get away into the night and then you put your arms around me And we tumble to the ground and then you say I think we're alone now, There doesn't seem to be anyone around I think we're alone now, The beating of our hearts is the only sound Look at the way we gotta hide what we're doin' 'Cause what would they say If they ever knew And so we're Running just as fast as we can, holding on to one another hands Trying to get away into the night and then you put your arms around me And we tumble to the ground and then you say I think we're alone now, There doesn't seem to be anyone around I think we're alone now, The beating of our hearts is the only sound I think we're alone now, There doesn't seem to be anyone around I think we're alone now, The beating of our hearts is the only sound Running just as fast as we can, holding on to one another hands Trying to get away into the night and then you put your arms around me And we tumble to the ground and then you say I think we're alone now, There doesn't seem to be anyone around I think we're alone now, The beating of our hearts is the only sound (repeat times three getting quieter)  Love 😍 this song
Go ahead, get trampled by a rhino  Go ahead, get mugged and left for dead  Me, I'm just your mother, what do I know?  I only bathed and changed and nursed you  Go ahead and leave me, I deserve it  Let me die alone here, be my guest  When it's too late, you'll see, just wait  Mother knows best
"Starfish and coffee,  Maple syrup and jam,  A butterscotch cloud,  A tangerine, a side order of Ham  If you get your mind straight, baby,  Maybe you'll understand.  Starfish and coffee,  Maple syrup and jam
"here i go! it's coming for me through the trees help me, someone help me, please  take my shoes off and throw them in the lake and I'll be two steps on the water"
What would you do if I sang out of tune?
Well, did she make you cry Make you break down Shatter your illusions of love? And is it over now, do you know how? Pick up the pieces and go home  Rock on, ancient queen Follow those who pale in your shadow Rulers make bad lovers You better put your kingdom up for sale Up for sale Well, did she make you cry Make you break down Shatter your illusions of love? And is it over now, do you know how? Pick up the pieces and go home  /u/bratmomjad come join the fun
I listened to Good Vibrations on my way home. It always gets me pumped. Sooo lyrics I got the hook for you...  It's such a good vibration It's such a sweet sensation It's such a good vibration It's such a sweet sensationnnnnnn!  Or uhhh Short Dick Man:  Don't want no short dick man Don't want no short dick man Don't want no short dick man  Don't want no short dick man Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't Don't, don't, don't, don't  Don't want, don't want, don't want, don't want Don't want no short dick man Don't want no short dick man Eeny weeny, teeny weeny  Hahaha seriously these get me so hyped lol
I know it might seem silly, but I so love 90's boyband music.    "Here we go, one more time, everybody's feeling fine, here we go now!" never fails to pump me up and "I knew I loved you before I met you, I think I dreamed you into life" always relaxes me, despite the fact that they're pretty creepy lyrics.
Thanks for the contest!  Lately it’s been Luke Combs song ‘Better Together’. Love how it has very little instruments and is mostly just his voice. Just gives me a warm calm glow when it plays.  A stanza of lyrics:  Some things just go better together  And probably always will  Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise  Sunday drives and time to kill  What's the point of this old guitar  If it ain't got no strings  Or pouring your heart into a song  That you ain't gonna sing?  It's a match made up in heaven  Like good ole boys and beer  And me, as long as you're right here
# 69!!!!  &#x200B;  :::gotta be song lyrics somewhere:::

Baby, baby, baby oooohhhhh  Like baby, baby, baby nooooooo
Aaaahhhh, I haven't heard this song in ages!! I don't really listen to country anymore, but Taylor's old albums really hold a place in my heart.
🎂
Open my eyes, look up to the skies and seeeeeee
This sounds so familiar but I just can't remember it!
👶🏻 🦈 doo doo doo doo
🤣🤣🤣🤣  You know. I somehow got by for a rather long time after that song came out without hearing it. And then. . on the way to Florida for vacation circa 2019, my kids started singing it and I was lost as to what it was. Then we get to our condo. . and the kids turn the tv on. .and the damned song is playing. 🤣 and I heard it like ten more times that vacation alone.
🦈
bwhahahha best one!!!
It’s the Mickey Mouse, Clubhouse!
MICKEY MOUSE (Donald Duck!)
to be fair. . I read it the way its sang. hahahaha
But are we going with old school "whos the leader of the club thats made for you and me? M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E" or the new fangled club house?
When you’re strange, no one remembers your name.

It’s all I want to say to you
Radio Ga Ga! What a song that is...
So, (don't stop me now) (Don't stop me) 'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time 🎶
IiIiIi feel something so right, doing the wrong thing. And IiIiIi feel something so wrong, doing the right thing. I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie, everything that kills me makes me feel alive.
I love the Chris Cornell version!
i love mad caddies 🙌 dirty rice is my favourite album
Did you know that TMBG actually covered that song? 🎵
I don't need to try and explain, I just hold on tight And if it happens again, I might move so slightly To the arms and the lips and the face and the human cannonball I need to, I want to   I love that there's a resurgence of that song because of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure 🤣
Jack Johnson!!! LOOOOOOOOOVE his music!!!
It’s the good advice that you just didn’t take  And who would’ve thought — it figures
I love this!

Hey hey always on the run

Thanks for letting me know! I need to listen to it. I’ve heard a few of their songs in passing, but that’s it.
Oh yeah! Three Libras?! You're talking about my main High School playlists.  Also Mudvayne.
Anywhere the wind blows, doesn’t really matter
Oh yes!
🤣🤣

Is it a new group or a new singer?

Yes, it’s quite romantic!
Give me a signnnnnnn
Aww yah!! BIG LIKE LEANNE RIMES!!!! Now I kinda remember hahaha something something snickers?? 😂😂
Gotta slow it down baby gotta have some fun
Haha, it wouldn't win by a loooonnng shot. Still one of my favorite songs :D
There actually might be to videos of me singing if you look months passed in my history you can see me singing lol
Oh yes!!
Me too!!! They made it sound like one of the girls died and it’s driving me nuts bc I don’t think all the girls were interviewed, right? Or was I just not paying attention?
...I think its.. I'm your operator you can call any time....
She took the midnight train going annnnnnywhereeee
YES!! I used it I watch Ghost ship on repeat just for the betting when the guys jamming to them.   White/rob zombie?
Mama, just killed a man Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
I loooove it
Faces come out of the rain
That's awesome! Do you live near the city? I was so happy to see it on Broadway when I lived in NJ.
Hit me baby one more time!
because I'm all about value!  (I don't think there is anything about snickers, but I wouldn't be surprised either LOL) There is always that one part I just bop to and make random sounds because I don't quite know what they're saying HAHAHAHA
Re-Post it!!! We’d all love to watch it!!!!
Wooot wooot!!
Send me a message in chat please so we can discuss all the things. I don’t want to spoil anything for anyone.

Yeah I live right outside NYC and used to work in the city :)
Snickers all about value??? Speakers all about value???? Its totally there! I think....😂😂😂
Got it!!
Smells of wine and cheap perfume
Omg can we be friends lmao. I love his movies but no one else I know does!! I’m a house of 1000 courses FANATIC, I taught myself how to laugh like baby when I was a teenager.   Dimmu Borgir?
Mama, ooooooooOOOOOOOooooooOOOOOOO
@Hotelsarah1234 You are awesome!
That's awesome! Have you seen lots of Broadway shows then?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 it’s for sure “because I’m all about value” but I like your version better   I wish I could upvote that like 10 times! Basically describes the whole song. So fast you can’t understand so you just sing whatever sounds right!
Saw them in concert! Cant remember if it was with Cradle of Filth or Cannibal Corpse  Hashtag Besties!
Didn’t mean to make you cry
Aww thanks! 😀 you are too! We just had an 8 mile-esque battle! 😀
Not a TON but a decent number! Didn't get to see Hamilton on Broadway unfortunately but wish I had. My favorite was the revival of HAIR. I also loved an off-Broadway show called Once on This Island.
😂😂😂😂😂😂 I am laughing SO freaking hard I have tears in my eyes....lmao, I thought "because" was "snickers" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Im still TOTALLY convinced snickers is in there somewhere because I KNOW I've spent my entire life singing it with that word SOMEWHERE!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 holy crap, I'm dying laughing!
Yesssss!! What country are you in?? I’m in the states and those bands rarely come around BUT I saw cradle live I. 2019 Ginger opened for them and she’s amazing. I have tickets to see Ramstine this September!
It was great!
That's awesome! I love Hair. It's a great show. I've never seen Once on This Island, but I like the soundtrack. And, my local community theatre is doing a virtual performance of Once on This Island in February as their big reopening since they closed when covid shut everything down. I have tickets to see Hamilton on tour in October in Jacksonville, FL near me. I can't wait!
I mean I think that is the genius of this song though! 90% of the words I sang the first half of my life were totally made up! One year my mom printed out the lyrics for me and I was like "no, mom this can not be the same song..." 🤣🤣🤣
I'm in New Jersey! I saw Cradle of Filth in like 05. Cannibal Corpse was maybe 08?  I would love to see Rammstein
Oh that's so cool that they're doing a virtual performance of Once on This Island! The off-Broadway theatre where I saw it was a round theatre and the "stage" was in the center and was actually lower than the seats, so it was super interesting.   Oh fun!! That'll be awesome.
😂 totally get it. I still sing my snickers and made up lyrics though! 🤣🤣🤣 You totally do the same, I know it!!!
I was 9 in 05’  and 12 in 08’ lol. I’m pretty sure that they’re doing a show in jersey idk what part tho. It was supposed to be last year but rona lushed it back to this year.  Are you a mosh pit person? I wanted to be in the pot for Rammstein but my husband said fuck no lmao. I go so hard I come put bruises tf up and I’m small 5’2 140LBS but I take on the biggest mother fuckers I can find
Ooh, that stage sounds cool!   Yeah, I can't wait to see Hamilton! It was supposed to be the week after covid happened. So, I've been waiting a while. But I watched it on Disney Plus and loved it.
I mean HE SINGS SO FAST! I couldn’t sing that fast if my life depended on it so I instead put words I can say in its place 🤣 now i just want to listen to random people singing this song to hear what words they think are what. 🤣
Oh wow yeah I was born in 1990. I was at Hellfest 2003 in Elizabeth NJ when Bad Luck 13 Riot Extravaganza well...rioted.   I used to love Mosh Pits. Im 5'3" and 180, but i was lighter way back when. My boyfriend isnt really into the music scene so i havent been to a concert in years. =/
Oh man. It'll be so nice when you can finally go. I saw it on Disney+ too and then became obsessed with the soundtrack LOL.
K! I am not gonna lie, I scrolled through this entire thread to comment on another song here....I figured you'd appreciate it! SEMI CHARMED LIFE by Third Eye Blind...K....I have NO idea what 90% of the song says! BUT I SING IT ANYWAY!!!!! 😀😀😀😀😀
I love the Hamilton soundtrack!
YESSSSSS Great song!
Right?! So good!

😊 it’s one of my favorite songs and it describes things so well
My husband is a pretty big fan of them. He listens to their stuff a lot but I have actually never heard this one. I was going through and trying to listen to all the songs people put down and I was like Oh  I had no idea this was Black Eyed Peas! lol
I didn’t know this existed until a friend showed it to me. Totally a thing those songs who don’t end up on the radio
Yes!! There are so many bands that are not some of my favorites that are practically never on the radio or on teh stations I listen to lol

Thank you, u/Bekki37! My bags of chips shall always be safe and guarded by the small creatures. This year has been such a roller coaster I'm glad to still be remembered occasionally.   I am doing better than this time last year.... small improvements.
❤️  ❤️  ❤️
There’s my sweet Rose!! ❤️❤️

It's an easy care hair cut. 🥰

Thanks. Your's too. 🥰
❤️❤️ Of course!! lol I love seeing your crafts too!
A couple isn't a bad loss. The one you sent me is still alive!  I hope you are able to take some time for yourself. I know its a crazy time but never forget yourself <3
🥰
I'm trying. The business took a small start, so I am doing a lot for that in my downtime, but I enjoy soaping and painting, and I'm trying to not fill all my extra waking hours with it. 🥰
Well congrats on that. That's exciting! Are you enjoying the buisness?   I am thinking of taking my embroidery and seeingnif O can make abbiosness of it somehow.  (I started during the begining of the pandemic cause I lost my job and it didbhelp keep me sane through a lot of axiety from that and other things). Mainly to cover costs of fabric for sewing lol.  No idea how to start yey but I have more practice to do anyway.
Thanks. Yeah. I'm hoping it will get to the point I can do it full time by the end of the year.  Ooooo You could definitely do it. There is an app, PlanCraft, that helps you keep track of supplies and figure out how much you should be charging for your items. Also for practice that still brings compensation, r/craftexchange is a great spot. I've done a few trades.
These are great resources thank you! My main concern is the whole set up though. Like, do I premake, make to order? Do I have to have multiple things to list etc. Due to work I have limited time to stitch so I don't really have a way to relatively quickly build up a bunch of listings etc etc.
You could do either or both. Find things that may be popular, flowers, critters, plants, bees, etc. If you have time offer some custom slots, 1-2/month maybe....
Maybe that would work. A smaller piece I could do in about 2 weeks. hmmm. How do you mark a custom slot?
On etsy you would do a listing stating it's for a custom piece, it has "made to order" as an option. Put pictures of examples and give details for limits, size options, etc.
Oh cool!  That's pretty neat.  They thought of everything!
Yep, so much of handmade is also custom.

Hello Everyone.  I was recommended this group by a friend and cant get over how great of an idea this is.  The thought of doing something good for someone else, just because you can. Love it.   A little about me:   I'm 34, married, and a father of 2 boys.  Am totally infatuated with anything mechanical, and am currently stuck out of work and on bedrest awaiting back surgery.  I really dont know how to talk about myself, so please feel free to ask any qustions you have.   I look forward to getting to know you all.  EDIT: As u/rhubes pointed out, this is more of a reintroduction.  I had an account some months ago, was able to chat and gift a few times before I lost access to it and the account was deleted.  I apologise for not clarifying that.  I'm not trying to be deceitful in any way, just didn't think to mention it.

Hello and welcome! Do you have any hobbies?
Hello and welcome! What are some of your favorite ways to relax?       🥰
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Welcome! That sucks about your back, I hope you get into surgery soon! My dad is also off from work due to a medical issue, he gets so restless he misses working a lot. I hope you have some hobbies to pass the time? Do you have any pets?
Welcome! It's nice to meet you! I really hope your surgery goes well and you start feeling better soon!! What are your top two favorite movies?
Sorry to hear about your back! Wishing you a speedy recovery from your upcoming surgery. Welcome to the sub!

Hi and welcome! If you had six penguins what would you name them?
Hello and welcome
Welcome!!
Ive had one a while back, and lost access to it and it was deleted after a very short time and after gifting a few times.  I haven't been on reddit in a while, and was reminded of it by a friend. So i rejoined with my account I can actually use.  Not trying to be deceitful or anything, actually looking forward to getting involved with everything again.
thank you.  From what ive seen and read, i think it is a great place with great people.  I look forward to getting involved with everything.
Thank you.  I am really trying to get into some new hobbies to pass the time.  Im down now waiting for surgery, and am looking at quite a long recovery time afterwards.  The only thing i really did before getting injured was customize my vehicles.  Ive been looking at a variety of things on amazon to try,  like wood burning, soldering kits, and model cars, but havent decided what to get into yet.   Any suggestions?
Thank you for that welcome.   The most relaxing thing to me is to sit and listen to a good thunderstorm.  Sitting and having a cup of coffee and listen to the rain on the roof is great.  Otherwise, just a long drive does it for me too.
Thank you.  Happy new year to you as well, and im glad to be here.   My favorite holiday has always been Halloween.  I really enjoy a good thunderstorm.  Its kind of a relaxing chaos.  I dont have any pets, but there is a cat that comes around that my boys keep trying to persuade me to keep.  Thank you for the offer of helping me,  I may have to take you up on it.  I am still trying to figure out how everything works here.
i completely understand what hes going through.  I am going insane sitting here doing nothing all the time.  My only real hobby was customizing my vehicles, and i cant do that anymore for a while.  I have been building Lego with my boys a lot. LOL.   I havent pulled the trigger yet, but ive looked at various hobby kits on amazon.  Soldering kits, wood burning, model cars, etc...   im just kind of indecisive on things.  I actually dont have any pets.
hey thanks,  good to meet you too.  I like all kinds of movies, but my top ones are Twister and Christine.   I am always open for suggestions though.  Any recommendations, new or old?
Thank you for the welcome and the well wishes.  Hopefully it wont be as long as theyre saying.  But we'll see.
Thank you, and that sounds great.  I am Ken.  I really dont know how much works on here, so i may have to do that.
Thank you.   Id have to go with Ian, Jeremy, Chris, Jason, Zoltan and Petey McPenguinface.
Thank you.  I like your username.  I already like boba fett and bobaflex.  And who doesn't like cake? Lol.
Thank you.
Wood burning is pretty neat, I never got it down but my husband didn’t do too bad.
Ooo all of the above but I add a book and a blanket in there too! Lol. I listen to thunderstorm white to sleep as well!
Hello there yes I enjoy a good thunderstorm myself though when I was younger I didn't and now that I have a cat sometimes he gets a little spooked out. If you still have any questions don't be shy we're here to help , have a great evening
I don't know the movie Christine. I'll have to look that one up. One of my favorite movies is Harvey. Have you seen that one?
Thanks. 😆 Boba cake is a real thing. It's good.
I've done a few small things when I was bored at work a while back, and it seems to be interesting.  I was doing it with my usual soldering iron, so I thought it be a much better result with the actual wood burning tips and all
I've tried it, but I can't fall asleep with that.  Normally I have to have music or an audiobook playing to fall asleep.
Christine is a movie based on a Stephen King book.   Its about a possessed 1957 Plymouth Fury.  Its a good, old, cheesy movie. LOL      No, i havent heard of Harvey.  What is it about?
ooooh I think you'd do wonderfully with actual wood burning tips!
Ah yeah, ive tried both of those and I end up staying up listening! Lol

I think just little succulents. I’m not a plant expert but I think they can do well in small planters.
These could make cute pencil or food as holders too!

💖💖💖 I have been looking for my path, and I think I've found it in water witchcraft. I've felt called to the water ever since I was a child. It's the only place I'm at peace 💙🌊  Maybe I was a fish or even a naiad in another life
Daww that’s so sweet! I’m lucky to have been burrito’d by our dear friend u/QuBoudica so I’m pulling out my reverse uno card and nominating you!!!!! u/limeprobably should be burrito’d for being so thoughtful of Mochi and I! Only a true friend would remember a girl and her cat who loves love and cuddles!

💖💖💖 Thank you my friend. You're pretty wonderful yourself ✨
I send my hubby out for click and collect so can't look around at all the yummies 😭 it's his birthday this weekend tho so I know there's going to be a Domino's coming followed by home made carrot cake ... This weekend is looking up 🤣
❤️🥰
🖤✨🖤✨
As you should be😄
No you :P x
I like it!! Woobies!! 😂 I love the name!!! Sounds great!! Thanks for the opportunity!! ❤️❤️
Thats a fabulous idea!!!
Burrito me!
Whoops! 🤦🏻‍♀️ thanks!
Burrito burrito burrito!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣 its now my go to reading blanket. I tell my husband burrito me!! And he hands it to me every time hahahaha
🥺🥺
Sometimes I wrap my cats in blankets and I call them little purritos. 😂 Random true fact for you.
💖🤗🥰
We have to keep tabs now, I am super interested to know how long the mail will take.  Last month I sent something to the UK on the same day my work sent something to me.  The UK letter got there first. 😐
don’t say that😭😭😂 thank you sweetie! 💖
Awwwww whattttt soo lucky.   I miss dominos. They used to do a pizza legend deal where i could create my pizza and it would be £11 but they dont do it now so its £18.99 for one pizza with stuffed crust  Also save me some of that carrot cake 😋😋😋😋
Awwwww 😭🥺❤️
Hahah trust me that’s nothing! You should ask u/neongreenpurple how many times I’ve made mistakes 🤣🤣🤣
I now want a burrito
YESSSSS I love that so so so much!
I will definitely let you know once I’ve received it! I’d certainly be impressed if it got here quicker than your workplace sends you out something lolz.
This is why you need to be burritoed 🤣
I have concentration issues and apparently in the time it takes to literally think of a name & type it... 🌬 ^gone   😂😂😂
I don't keep track. 😝 I was going to say, "I lost count," but that implies that I kept a count for a while and the number was too high. There was never a count.
I always want the burrito.
Omg same here!!! It's so hard to remember all the usernames and then I feel bad if I left someone out when summoning!
Hahaha you can’t keep count bc there’s just so many!! LOL thanks for always having my back!!
Truths
Same!
Lol! You're welcome!

I thought of this but I’m not sure how it will pan out but want to try?  Let’s go to google earth or even photos you have a place or building that you love and share them! That way we can virtually go around the world without getting up!   Plus we can try to guess each other’s - you’re more than welcome to list the place you post or you can do a top comment and ask others to guess where that picture is located!   I’ll start to help try to explain what I mean (I feel like I’m not doing this idea any justice lol)
This is so cool!! Love seeing everyone’s adventures!!
Where is this?   https://imgur.com/a/noXAk1Z  >!Fiji!<
Here’s a smattering of some of the places I have been in the last few years   [https://imgur.com/a/7zkt6Go](https://imgur.com/a/7zkt6Go)  [https://imgur.com/a/27LxOl4](https://imgur.com/a/27LxOl4)  [https://imgur.com/a/kEoHLV9](https://imgur.com/a/kEoHLV9)  [https://imgur.com/a/BsDhxf1](https://imgur.com/a/BsDhxf1)  [https://imgur.com/a/GzKt3ti](https://imgur.com/a/GzKt3ti)
[Where's this?](https://ibb.co/n79tVYJ)
[on my bucket list, someday 🤞](http://imgur.com/a/4tCDT6A)
[Here's the view](https://imgur.com/a/F4uxUCf) from Sümeg Castle in Hungary!
It's beautiful, Scotland?
Gorgeous. New Zealand?
Ireland
England?
Your traveling journey looks beautiful!!
Just a little jelly
I have no clue but it looks cool!!
Looks like a soccer stadium?
I want to too!! It’s like a 2 day drive for me so one day I hope to go!
It’s incredible! You need to experience it!  You can’t even fathom how big and beautiful it is until you see it in person!
That looks so cool!
Nope!
We’ve seen some pretty awesome places! Those are just a few...we try to travel at least 3-4 times a year...y’know...when there’s not a pandemic haha
[here’s dumb niagara for you ](https://imgur.com/a/wbtmxKO)
Sorry not sorry ;)
Thanks! It's the FNB stadium (AKA Soccer City or The Calabash)
It is! The FNB Stadium. It was upgraded to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup
I think it's far from anything? Like I fly in and still have to drive hours and hours but it looks beautiful
I just want to walk on the glass bridge 😂😂😂
Thank you!
Haha glass floors give me anxiety so I stayed away, but either way the canyon is amazing :)
I want to go and put hotdogs and beans in my 🔦,  What's cooler the canyon or Niagra?
Niagara is lame! I honestly don’t know why people love it so much.  Maybe it’s because I live by it so it doesn’t really have a lot of appeal...I dunno...but I don’t think it’s anything special.  And Niagara Falls is a dirty, run down city.
Probably the size, I have tiny waterfalls where I live and they're pretty loud and powerful and only like 5-6 ft lol
Niagara is a testament to how size doesn’t matter.  It’s big but I’m still not impressed.

CAT SIZED, IT SORTA COUNTS.
I am a sucker for tuxedos with black noses!!! also good call but alas no!

STILL ACCEPTABLE AND ADORABLE. how have you been?
OH MY GOODNESS, WHAT A PRETTY GIRL!!! that nose is ADORABLE. and timothy was correct but sadly someone already guessed it. :(
Thanks!!! Gosh this one is tough!
HONESTLY, and he is just getting better with age!
he's a whole damn MEAL. i need to watch his episodes, actually! also sadly while that was correct, someone guessed it first.
LOOK AT THAT SMOL ANGEL, BLESS. timothy olyphant is correct, sadly someone guessed it first!!!
🤣🤣🤣
hey love, how are you doing?! happy new year!!! i'm just working and sorta living. my car just died on the way home from the pharmacy so i am salty.

hi love, how are you?! how's the lil bun in the oven and tiny hooman?!
missed you!! how are you doing honey?
hi love! you are correct!!!
😍😍😍 Thank you so much!!!  I've been obsessed with that man since I saw him in Scream Ii 💖
😻😻😻
Haha he has a lovely jaw structure!  Very handsome!
He was so sexy in Justified. I can't even
Panty dropper level 1000
WHAT CUTIES. i love that sweet boxer!
He was the first to come to mind when you said sherif daddy 😜
He is the best. I think he is my favorite in What's Your Number
Okay but you literally picked my man crush of all time so I'm not judging you!
His name is Topol! Aww man, I thought for sure it was Andrew lol.
LOOOOOOL. Added bonus, he doesn't shed, he's hypoallergenic, and cuddles. Also he enjoys being indoors these days 😂
Ah well, I tried...  And, I love my kitty's little black heart-shaped nose too!
Maple! Unfortunately we did not and I miss her everyday. 😭💔
Eh, I’ve been better. Been having a lot of pain for the past 4 weeks or so. Started PT last week. Last night I had some sort of weird episode. I feel like I’m drugged right now. Idk why.
That’s okay. Yep, she’s a doll ❤️
I’m probably wrong. But oh well. Doesn’t hurt to try
IKR?!?! I LOVED him in Justified and Santa Clarita Diet!!!
Well I’m still glad I guessed correctly!  She is so small. Verrrrry smol with a chonky puppy tummy
Thank you! Oh no...what's wrong with it? Ide be bummed too...u have family to help u fix it?   How u feeling? Hugs
I'm ok. The babies are good and crazy. Hows you?
You wouldn’t like her if you knew she shows like an excited pig https://imgur.com/gallery/ctVzMrS
I'm good! Tired from moving, but good. Baby girl is ridiculously active, as is her big brother, lol. He loves all the space at our new house though!   How about you?
Doing pretty good now! :)
Yass!!! 🙌 A worthy celeb crush ☺️
yeeee! i'm so glad you picked up on my scream 2 clue as well! :D I've always loved him but i am full on obsessed now, i'm actually in the process of finishing justified! just a few more episodes to go, sigh.
That’s my moms favorite show. Sherlock Holmes with Benedict being the second. I tried to start it the other night but I wasn’t in the mood for something I super needed to pay attention to. I’ll try again.
the minute i saw your response i was like WHY YES, HE IS A SHERIFF DADDY.
that's my favorite too! although i am a massive marvel fan, so civil war and winter soldier are my all time favorite chris movies as well. :)
SOB, she was such an absolute cutie. that's okay, i assume you kept mama and hopefully spayed her?
Absolutely!! 😊
HE WAS SO FUNNY IN SANTA CLARITA. justified is so excellent, i love his dry sense of humor in it. also him cuddling willa omg.
oh i got AAA to tow it and i have some money in the bank so i can get it fixed. ♥ i'm feeling well! i am 6 days away from gallbladder surgery which is terrifying.
ha, they wouldn't be babies otherwise! i'm hanging in there, working a lot. living sort of. i have gallbladder removal surgery next thursday, oof.
fljwerlkewrlkwe this is the cutest thing i have seen all night.
i bet he has been having quite the field day!! i'm so happy for you honey, so glad that things are going well. ♥ how much longer until baby girl arrives?
Yeah, you definitely have to be in the right kind of mood for it. I really enjoyed it.
She got spayed but sadly I didn’t keep any. I’m moving across country soon so that’s why I chose to foster instead. 😭
I loooooove his voice and just oof everything about him!! He has swag! Hahah I can’t believe I used that word hahah
Omg. U seem so calm...how long u in for week? I will pray for you my dear. Hugs🙏❤
He definitely has! It's so much easier for him to hide from us and get into mischief in the new house though 😂   7 weeks or less! It's coming up so fast!
I’ve seen parts, looks really good. Kinda gives me the ozark vibe. Am I off?
ohhh okay, BUT GOOD ON YOU FOR FOSTERING. where are you moving to?!
EH, i am internally freaking out. but i am trying to put on a brave front. it's an in and out procedure actually! so long as they don't have to actually cut me open, i go home the same way.
I've never seen ozark. Is it good?
Not sure yet! Somewhere out west though. It all depends where my husband matches with a residency for med school. 😬
I prayed for you last night. How are you feeling today? Oh well yes in n out..so less room for problems,so you will be fine. Hugs hun🐭🧸
Yes. It’s got that kinda dark underbelly of a town.
oof, hopefully somewhere decent and not terribly boring! where do you guys live now if i may be so nosy?
awww you are so sweet! i'm feeling well, honestly. i even got out of the house and saw a movie tonight, it made me feel normal.
Ooh, sounds interesting. I'll have to check that out!
I’m in NC now. It may be Wyoming but I wouldn’t mind. Probably the most boring state ever  haha
Good morning to you happy Saturday well good for you I'm happy that you were getting up and out what movie did you say?
You totally shoukd. Idk if you’ve seen good girls, but it’s the darker version of that
yes but their covid cases are soooo low, it's worth it lol. and wyoming pays you to live there!
top o the mornin to ya! i saw monster hunter it was.. it was not good lmfao.

Welcome to tonight's thread! If you haven't been around before, here is a quick explanation for you to enjoy!  The Daily/Nightly thread is a place for you to enjoy the company of your fellow RAOAers in one place! This thread is for many awesome things such as:  * Happy houring * Being busy * Always wanting tacos * Staying busy  Plus many more fun things!  So come on in, grab a blanket, and enjoy the company.  **QOTD: What is your favorite creature of folklore?**
Guys, I’m having a HORRIBLE week! Things just keep progressing worse daily. This sucks! I’m trying to keep an upbeat attitude but it’s so hard! 😞
Far exceeded my steps goal! Had a eulogy for the coffee frother that I love and died in the middle duty. He served so well and will be hard to replace. He died a diligent solider who’s time came to soon. Farewell you brave coffee frother and you dwell in the house of mocha forever!  Oh man do I have an imagination but I mean those hallowed words.  Tomorrow I make Asian ribs for dinner mmmmm
Omg I'm so exhausted and happy to be home 😵
Hey there friends! Don’t forget that you are awesome! :)
A siren, maybe. They call people to their death and sing, so sounds good to me.
Yay! 1 user(s) grew one year older today! Happy Birthday to:  * /u/gimmiesugar  Since their last birthday, 50,583 threads and 1,531,516 comments were posted on RAOA!  Make sure you have your own birthday correctly entered [here](https://raoa.tech/settings).
QOTD I've always been fond of Johnny Appleseed and that he spread all the seeds and grew all the apple trees p.s. I like apples
I bought myself my favorite treat (peanut butter oreos) for the first time in forever and I'm just so dang happy about it!
Got tested today, hopefully I'll get results quick! Made some cauliflower kale soup and focaccia bread today, nothing else too exciting.   I hope everyone else had a great day! 💜
I had today off so I stayed home all day except to get my dad and I lunch. He was working from home and couldn’t leave.   QOTD: probably dragons or Phoenix
Today absolutely wiped me out. But it was a good day. I left nothing undone at work - except for one thing that showed up in my email right as I was leaving. Nothing urgent.  I got to talk to my sponsor today and I get to see her (safely) on Friday.  Baby girl just lit up when I got home today. It's my favorite thing. I just love her so much.
Happy cake day u/cj1990!!
Happy Cake Day u/cj1990  If you had known it was your cake day, would you have done the thread differently?  The Hockey is back! Less than 3hrs until the puck drops for the Avs this season, now for the hard bit of being an Aussie and finding a way to watch it.   Qotd: Favourite Creature in folklore? A Child that does what they are asked first time... Or a Dragon, Dragons are cool too.
Currently totally paying attention in a 7pm zoom meeting. 🙄  Qotd: I have so many and from very different cultures.  Krampus, a southern German counterpart to St. Nick. If you're a bad kid, instead of gifts you get smacked in the head by a big stick (or eaten).   Will o the Wisp, with many other names throughout Great Britain, are glowing floating lights that either signal danger, or intentionally lure people into danger  Wendigo, a few First Nation tribes have a version of it but its basically an emaciated looking cannabilistic monster with (usually) giant antlers.  I just like how sinister they all seem.
Everyone’s dinner plans sound much tastier & more ambitious than my pb& j 😂
Hey all!! How are we tonight? I’m angry that Tottenham didn’t win but apart from that good! What are we all up to?!
I hope everyone is having a good night!!!
Good afternoon/evening!  I hope everyone is having a good day so far!  Not sure what to eat for dinner but I’ll figure something out. This week hasn’t been bad but I’m excited for the weekend.  I’m very tired so I’ll probably take a small nap.  Have a great evening!
I love Phoenix(es?).  &#x200B;  What are you currently reading or the last book youve read? <3
We've got people who wanted to come in from another state to make a heap ton of cash and so we have way too many people and the lines won't run. Woke up to a text message from our manager asking if we wanted the day off! So yay! I've been off!   Gotta make up for that lost exercise though so gotta get some jump roping in again. We're gonna have bbq baked potatoes for dinner!
Hello everybody happy Wednesday to you. It was a beautiful Sunny🌞 day here on the East Coast had another wonderful day at work the children are learning so much and it's really making me happy to see their progress.    Busy day after work I did some vacuum and some dusting I cooked a dinner I took a shower shaved put away some laundry did some organizing and then I did a couple hours of lesson plans. So here I am coming to see if anybody needs a hug 🧸or needs a friend. Hope you have a wonderful evening🌞💗
Halfway through my work week!!! Just two more days!! Miss you all!!
Anyone here into stationary and stickers? And know of a good subreddit to talk stationary?   And I like wendigo because I think they look super fucking cool but I also love anything with horns and animal skulls.
I like nagas cause they’re like mermaids but snakes.
3 good things today:  1. The wonderful /u/ughhhfine gifted me for my birthday!  2. I found a good place to get Kandi/pony beads online!!  3. I'm now down 12.5 lbs.   ACCOMPLISHMENT: dishes and cooking   VALUE PROVIDED: cooking and encouraging my dad (he's been depressed)
Happy cake day u/cj1990! 🎂
not having the best or most productive day today unfortunately but persisted through it, hoping that the rest of the night will be better~! 🌸 time to just try to take a few more notes and maybe do some meditation before sleeping zz.. 💭 hope that you all have a lovely rest of the night, don't forget to stay hydrated! 🌸
Goodnight everyone! I hope you all had a  happy hump day!
good evening y'all!!   so glad to have found and now be a part of this community
Happy cake day, u/cj1990 !
Falcore  Hi y'all!  How are you?  I had a very very unproductive day...  Here's hoping tomorrow is better!!!
Qotd: yeti  I don’t feel right. Been feeling weird since last night. It kind of let up for about an hour today and I ran errands. Idk what’s up. Maybe tomorrow will be better.   https://www.instagram.com/p/CKAixuYB1fd/?igshid=1fj4ohy5f37qm
I'm having a "meh" kind of day so I skipped a workout and good dinner in favour of baking bread for the sole purpose of having a chicken sandwich. I forsee a mug brownie in my future too.  But I have to clean the cat box first. Then I can reward myself with coffee and chocolate.
Hey peeps.  We had a plumber come today to do a bunch of different things.  Tonight I'm just relaxing.
I worked all day today, then stopped over to visit my 90 year old grandma.  It was nice to see her for awhile!  After that picked up my daughters boyfriend from work and took him home.  QOTD: I can’t say which is my favorite, but I can say I used to be terrified of the Yips from Sesame Street.
What's everyone up to tonight? I'm making banana chips and watching gamers on YouTube
I have had to stop three movies tonight because of the way the male characters talk unnecessarily about the female characters. Ugh.
Today has consisted of making a run to the store as well as laying in bed most of the day watching the queens gambit. It’s pretty enjoyable!
I’ve kind of gotten obsessed with an author lately and I’ve read three different series of hers just since the first of the year. It’s the first time I’ve been able to stick with this genre in years, I’m so glad I am able to stomach thrillers again
I worked, I started a new job-and I’m a manager now. It’s a strange adjustment for me because I’m used to jumping in and doing tasks on my own, but now I have to delegate things I would normally do. It’s an odd feeling, I almost feel like I just sit in meetings all day-thats about it.   Beyond working I am currently laying in bed trying to fall asleep-and failing.   ****QOTD**** Ummmm...probably werewolves, they always fascinated me.
Good evening peeps!  I just got home from running errands for me and mom. Bonus daddy had tacos ready for me when I got there! Yay tacos!  I am currently watching season 11 episode 1 of Shameless. I love this show. It is based in Chicago under current episode, current circumstances and since that is so close to home I feel like they are neighbors and friends. :P
I love dragons. One of my first tattoos was a really gorgeous blue dragon.
Hey everyone. Sorry I've been MIA. Im sick so am laying in bed, which gave me time to come back and say hi. Had a covid test and a strep test today. Feel like I've been chewed up and spit out. How has everyone been? Whats new?
I’m feeling kinda down today. Not sure why. I hope you all had a great day ❤️
Hiii I hope everyone had a great day! :D  I woke up from a much needed nap with my hubby, now I'm making some mac and cheese🤤   qotd: Dragons are pretty awesome 🐉
Hey guys! I just found out 16s friend may have the virus. They ate lunch together Monday. Great.   Hopefully we don’t get it but who knows. I’ve been worried about 17m getting it because of his birth trauma (we don’t really know much except he had 2 strokes due to oxygen deprivation) but he’s overall healthy so I’m hoping it won’t be severe for him if it was to hit the house.   Besides that I ordered in some hibachi for a late bday dinner since we couldn’t do it last night and now I’m ready to go to bed!!   Also - dragons kick ass.
Hope everyone's day was great. Mine started out horribly bad. But turned around and had a fantastic evening.
Eating a fresh mango. It’s delicious. Decided to get one of those like fresh produce delivery boxes (if anyone is interested, talk to me. I apparently love talking about produce) and this is so good 😊
Hey there happy Hump day evening! I really want some fresh fruit for some reason. Last year about this time all I want to eat were cuties , mandarin oranges.  Have a lovely evening and rest well. Don't forget to hydrate. 💦
Happy cake day u/cj1990!
I have been in bed for an hour reading. Going to read a little longer and then get to bed at a decent hour. Today was long.   Hope everyone has a wonderful night!
Happy Cake Day, /u/cj1990!  I worked on unpacking some boxes this evening and clean up some of the kitchen... Dishes can wait for tomorrow. :) I think my plan for tomorrow is to start unpacking things from the garage. :)  Hope everyone has a wonderful night. ❤️  **QOTD**: Unicorn. Or as Arya says it, "ooh-cone". 🤣
Taking another day off work and then, I have to remote in because they don’t want to chance my test being wrong. So I am going to stay up and play Minecraft some more tonight.   Well u/MisterMagellan we had breakfast for dinner and it was delicious! Thank you for the wonderful idea!   QOTD: dragons. For sure!
Cheesecake update: welp, i somehow failed. Got the texture right but the taste is off. It wasnt sweet enough and also just tasted buttery and baked? Idk how to exactly describe it but it wasnt right. So im bummed about that.  But i ended up getting chipotle in the end!
A bit of a mixed day, some good and some bad.   I really like dragons,mermaids, and fairies.
Today was a stressful day!  My step kids mother tested positive for COVID and the kids took it hard. There's a chance that the kids were infected too so we are quarantining as well.  Plus it's my 5th straight day with a headache so that didn't help.   Other than that, I got some goodies in the mail and it was such a nice surprise. 🥰 It really made my evening.
Now I want wings for dinner.
After three months of lower back pain, I finally talked my chiropractor into scheduling an MRI, so I go into the tube tomorrow. I am not claustrophobic, so it shouldn't be a big deal, but I'm nervous anyway. I'm a little worried that they won't find anything wrong, because I can't even get out of bed without crying lately.
I don't know what I did but my right side spasmed and has been hurting all day. I used BenGay, a heating pad (later), did gentle stretching throughout the day, and tried to breathe and rub it out. Then my heartburn kicked in tonight. A stomach muscle hurts. And I'm cranky. I felt so good yesterday. Well, this crap needs to go away tonight. Ya know?!  QotD - Big Foot and Lochness spotted with Elvis.
QOTD: Too many to list!
QOTD: shadow hunters
My chair has been saved! I don't think this set of wheels will last me much longer than the last set did, though. My dad and I both noticed that it's because of the placement of the base, that the chair sits tilted forward, putting extra weight on the wheels in front.  But it is saved for now!
Hey guys, newbie here! What's up? Looking for a little escape right now from being hooked on the (US) news right now. Also not my best week because I just had to get my bumper replaced after hitting two raccoons on the highway. Never are you more aware of your car's speed than when you have a fraction of a second to recognize what's in your headlights, assess whether and how you can safely avoid it, and take action. Those poor furballs never had a chance, unfortunately.  QOTD....hmm, maybe gryphons?
u/cj1990 happy cake day!!
I love dragons and Pegasus, I love Greek mythology
I’m sending you hugs we love you!!!
Ugh I’m sorry your week is so crappy. ☹️ Hugs to you!
**giving you some more hugs!** i know it’s hard but everything will play itself out! that’s what i always think about when i’m enduring a bad week. i hope you get to treat yo self soon! 💜
I hope things get better soon.
u/purpleteasoul thank you for the hug award! 😭😭😭 yup, still sobbing!! 😭😭😭 you are truly one of the best humans!! I’m so blessed to have met you! ❤️😭❤️😭❤️😭
I’m sorry to hear that, I hope the rest of the week turns out better ❤️
R.I.p., old frother fren’
Tonight chicken adobo and rice!  Yay to your steps!  Boo to the untimely demise of your coffee frother. Anything like an espresso machine??  You can send some of them ribs this away!! 💕
Lol omg you crack me up
Yay for exceeding step goal! Are you gonna get a new coffee frother?
How are you healing up?   And I feel it! I left my house at noon, didn't get home until 6. Had to have two vaccines and a blood draw. Sooo ready for bed.
I'm almost home! I'm ready to knock out some stuff I've gotta do and eat some dinner!
Welcome home, friend, welcome home!
Hey there! You are the awesome one around here 😎
You're more awesome!
Hello my friend how are you doing these days
Hello awesome person! How are you today?
🧡
I like the versions where they call you with what you desire instead of exclusively a lust thing. Like, call me to my death with a promise of mac and cheese why don't ya.
Wooooohooo PARTY HAT ENGAGED!!!
happy birthday! 🌸🎂
Happy birthday!
Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday 🎉💥💃

Happy birthday u/gimmiesugar hope it was filled with happiness and making awesome memories!
He was a real person
My son loves those and I now have a huge craving!
Oh those sound great!
I have never tried them, but they sound amazing!
Those sound awesome!
Omg I’ve never seen those, but I used to dip Oreos in peanut butter
ohhhh can you explain what this soup is alll about??
I too want to hear about this soup!
Yum, that sounds delicious. Hope your test goes okay. 🤞🏼
Dragons are pretty great. Do you prefer Western or Eastern styles?
That sounds like a nice day.
I'm so glad you had a good day!!!! This made my heart happy ❤️
Yay for good days! 💛
Awesome that you had a good day AND got so much done!
Oh snap! Didn't even know. Thanks! :D
Dragons seem more likely
Thank you!!!! Probably not. I wouldn't know what to say about it.
Is it one of those, "There didn't even need to be a meeting," meetings?
I’m skipping dinner. Your pb&j sounds fantastic!
PB and J is pretty good! Try adding some marshmallow cream next time haha
I don’t know... pb&j sounds like something right up my alley!!! Do you like creamy or crunchy PB?
I am absolutely falling asleep in the bathtub... is that bad?
hope that you are having a good night too! 🌸
im ordering pizza because painand chronic fatigue won today. so easy meal today and for a few days.   naps are amazing! enjoy your nappies
Currently Court of Thorns and Roses. Late to the show, I know.   Recently finished the last book in the Enola Holmes series. It was so good!
I'm reading The Sword by Deborah Chester. It's really good. Also American Gods for bookclub. How about you?
Discworld series!! 💕
Ohhhhh I used to work in a job where we could randomly get low-censused if there wasn’t enough business on a given day. It was like a snow-day for adults and it was the best.thing.ever. I miss it so much 🥺  Drooling over your dinner plans!
I can't wait for my knee to get better so I can start jump rope being myself
I will never say no to taking a day off work, even if it means I don’t get paid for that day.
Wow you had a productive day!  Although I got some stuff done, I’ve done a lot of laying in bed.
What grade do you teach? I'm a teacher too lol.
Happy Wednesday! It's chilly here and overcast but still enjoyable weather to me. Hope you have a lovely night!
💙💙💙💙
We've got this
Ooh, I don't but that sounds super cool
You know, I want to say there is a subgroup bc I saw it in passing once but I don’t remember the name of it! But there should be one!!
Oh man, I would like to add "losing 12.5 pounds" to my Amazon wishlist...nice job!
Thank you!
you got this!
I hope you had a wonderful evening my friend 💕💕 missed you!! Take care of yourself! You deserve the world!!
We’re glad to have ya here! 🙂
Thank you! <3
My day is hardly over, so hopefully I'll be a bit productive. Hope you got plenty of rest today!
Like physically or emotionally? I hope you feel better soon, either way.
Still good to do what you need to relieve stress and treat yourself! Hope you have a better day tomorrow!
You should Definitely treat yourself
Mmmm mug brownie.
That's how porn videos start out!
Enjoy your relaxing night!
I’m sooo relaxing too lol
Mmm banana chips!
Sleeeeeeeep!! lol long awaited!! It’s still early here but I don’t care! Lol  banana chips sound delicious!
Writing in my journal and watching stationary haul videos on YouTube haha whats your favorite type of game to watch for streams ?
Yikes...what movies?
What’s the queen’s gambit about? I hear the name so much but have no idea what it’s about!
Oo may I ask who's the author?
Good luck with your new job
Soft tacos or ~~taco ingredients sandwiched between tortilla chips to fall out and make a mess everywhere~~ hard tacos?
Sorry to hear you’re feeling sick. Hope you feel better soon!
That covid test is really unpleasant. Hope you are feeling better soon.  What's new? Me! Hi, I'm gonzo_rulz (would've just gone Gonzo, but username was already taken) from Australia.
oh no. feel better soon! Are you okay otherwise? Do you have enough food/need someone to check in with you daily virtually?
hoping that you feel better soon! 🌸
What a bummer that you’re ill. I hope both of your tests come back negative. Neither Covid nor strep throat are pleasant. Feel better soon!
HUGS
I hope you are taking some time for self care today 💖
giving you a hug! 🌸
Sending you 🍮&🍪 because caffeine and chocolatey carbs might help... xo
Enjoy your yummy mac and cheese!
mac and cheese is awesome, hope that you enjoy! 🌸
Fingers crossed everyone is good! And happy belated bday!
Oh no! Fingers crossed that everyone stays healthy ❤️❤️
I’m glad to hear things turned around for you!
I'm glad it turned around for ya!
I’m so happy that things turned around for you!
I'm happy that you were able to take a good day and turn it around
Yayyyyyy I’m glad it turned out fantastic!!! 👏👏👏
I wish I wasn't so weird with textures. I love fruit flavours and juices but don't eat most because the texture weirds me out!
Mangoes are so good. I didn't have one in awhile.
That sounds so good right now
Ooooo mangos!!! Yummmmmm!!! Do you like the unripened ones or ripened ones? I personally LOVE the ripe ones!! At one of my old jobs, my coworkers would flock to the fruit stand guy and get unripened mangos w chili pepper, salt, and I don’t know what else!
Have a great evening! 💜
ooohhh fresh fruit sounds amazing!!!      I hope you're having a lovely evening as well!
My husband just shot juice from a cutie in my eye lol
Hi there I had some cut up fresh fruit the last week and a 1/2 and I didn't pick it up this week I definitely enjoyed it
When I'm dehydrated, I really crave fruit juice haha like pineapple juice particularly.
Thank you!!!!
Whatcha reading?
Oh, I got a new book today too! I might read some tonight buuuuut I have a wreath to finish and some jump roping to do after my dinner has digested haha
Dishes can always wait until tomorrow...and the next day, and the next day, and the day after that...👀
Thank youuuuu
Oh yay! I'm so glad you guys picked the best dinner! What was on the menu?
Cheesecake is super hard to master
Do it!!
I hope they figure it out and can get you fixed up asap!
Oh no! I hope they figure out what is paining you!  Good luck tomorrow
Best wishes to you! 💜
Hopefully they can figure out what is wrong and help you reach a comfortable solution
Good luck and best wishes!! Think positive! Which is sorta odd in this sense bc positive thinking is kinda wishing for damage in your lower back 🥴 I totally get it though! I had excruciating hip and leg pains for almost a year before they finally caught it! So have faith!! May they find what is causing your ailments ❤️❤️❤️
I was never claustrophobic but I had a panic attack the first time I had a mri. I now have to get one once a year unfortunately. Still hate them but now I take anxiety meds before I go in.
Hopefully you get some answers and everything goes smoothly tomorrow! Sending you good luck. 🍀
Hopefully it will! Your answer to qotd sounds familiar haha
Hopefully you feel a bit better tomorrow! 🤞🏼
That's awesome. Glad it was saved
Welcome Capatain!  I agree about needing a break from the news. Man, my aunts and uncles are constantly updating the family group about all the details.   Those poor bandits. I hate when that happens.   Welcome to the distraction zone!
Also a semi newbie! Things are crazy, I get that.
I’m taking them all!! Grabbing as many as I can!! Thank you friend! 😭😭😭 thank you!
Collecting all hugs!!! All of them!!! But I will say, u/purpleteasoul just blew me away right now w a surprise and now I can’t stop crying lol so many emotions!!
😭😭😭 this was supposed to be my good week bc last week was so painful but this week only got worse!! 😭😭😭   **Gathering all the hugs you’re sending**   Thank you, friend!! I’m going to try to sleep this day off! I hope you have a good night!
Thank you ButterClaw, I truly hope so, too! I don’t know how much more I can take!
😊 likewise honey 💜💜💜🥰🤗
Thank you so much. With the help of all you wonderful friends here, I’m sure it’s possible!
Indeed
No it was just a simple handheld frother
Well we all know now I can write an epic eulogy
I think we are going to either tomorrow or this weekend. Walmart and target were no go’s
Jaw is super stiff and still unable to chew much, but not a lot of pain  I left my house at 8 and got home at 6 😭😭 I collapsed in bed immediately
What's for dinner? :-)
Best place ever 💙
Aw well thank you friend! :)
Dawe thanks! ;)
Hey there! I’m good! Watching some scary movies and snuggling with the pup right now! How about you? :)
I’m pretty good! How are you? :)
❤️❤️
Haha, fair enough. I’d be far more susceptible to something like that.
When I was little he was a guy with a pan on his head dropping seeds as he roamed the land, not a businessman planting seeds to take land rights and make alcoholic beverages with his crabapples 😂 let me have some childhood memories!!! (Filled with lies)
Really? It's one of their standard flavors.
It's pretty simple! Here's the  [recipe](https://www.noracooks.com/super-creamy-cauliflower-kale-soup/) for it. I just swapped the cashews for a little coconut milk, then I added some spices and lemon juice.
Here's the [link](https://www.noracooks.com/super-creamy-cauliflower-kale-soup/) to the recipe! It was pretty easy. I  swapped the cashews for coconut milk, added some spices, and a little lemon juice. It turned out really tasty!
I like both!!
❤️❤️❤️
You’re welcome! ☺️
Ahh, I see that you also you have children.
No, we only meet once a month and no one remembers to submit their topics to be put on the agenda, so we waste a lot of time on new information and resolve nothing. I WISH there didn't need to be a meeting.
It did the trick!
Ooooh sounds delightful 😍
Creamy all the way!
I do that quite often to be honest I put a podcast in and just relaxxxxxx
I'm okay! Still feeling a bit crappy but hockey is back!
I just got that on kindle when they went on sale for $4. Do u like it???    Oooo i didnt know was a book series
Oo what Genre is that?  Im relieving my teenage years and reading Midnight Sun by Stephanie Meyer. Makes me want my twilight books dearly again.
Whats that about?
Whenever I've been low censused I make sure I'm not on call (important to know) then take a shot every two hours. It's not enough to get me drunk but it's enough to say, oh hey I wasn't on call so I've been drinking....... Works every time! 💕
Yesss, that's what it feels like! I love it and it was one of the best things I could have woken up to haha
Hello there my friend were you not feeling well today?
Hello there what grade do you teach? Though I'd been working with children for 20 years I started as a 2 hour lunch aid and then I went to after care and have been working as a para teaching special needs children ever since .I'm presently working teaching high school children but they are on a second grade level. And I absolutely love my job.
Yes I enjoy my Sunny days and I know that my plants do as well I can't believe it's going to be in the fifties the next couple days crazy.
Super cool website to check out for stuff is https://stationerypal.com/  Watching stationary haul videos make me so happy.. haha
Yeah I've been looking around but I might not trying to hard haha   Welp.. I discovered why.. I was spelling it wrong. 🙃
Hahaha!! Thanks!
HAPPY 🍰 DAY!!
thank you! 🌸💗
thank you aww, missed you too! 💗💗💗 hoping that you are doing well, sending you a hug! 🌸
Like physically. Neurologically.  I feel slightly tipsy. Or like I’ve taken some benzodiazepines. But I haven’t. We’ll see what tomorrow brings.
I added a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was perfect.
Hahaha!  It did not play out that way.
BWAHAHAHAH!!!! omholyshit!! That was HILARIOUS!!! Hahahahahah!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thanks!
Nice!!
I haven't made them before so I hope they turn out good
Superbad (I didn't get to watch it when it was first released, and it sucks because I love Michael Cera), Grease (I see so much more now that I'm older), and Taxi Driver.  Edit: I get what Taxi Driver is trying to say, but even in its context, it's excessive.
It’s basically about a girl who’s is an orphan and she becomes this prodigy chess player. The first episode was a bit slow but after if you stick with it it’s great!
Such a good show it sounds super boring but promise you.. it gets good!
Melinda Leigh
Thank you!!! ❤️
Hard and messy!!   Let’s be real, I love nachos and taco salad. 😝
Thanks! We should know tomorrow if her friend tested positive but it’s looking like she is sick
Thank you!
Thank you!!!
Thank you!!!
Thank you!!!
That’s fair. Mangoes are pretty slimy
It was so great!
I loved it
Both! I’m pretty non discriminating. This one was on the cusp of being ripe
Thanks!!
Thanks I hope you are having a great evening. You know even a smoothie sounds good.
Oh no! That's gotta hurt! Was he trying to hit your mouth.
Don't judge me 🤣 I just started the Bridgerton series after binging the Netflix show.
We had scrambled eggs, bacon, cinnamon rolls, and waffles. It is my son and I plus our bubble family for quarantine.
I definitely understand why its expensive lol
I really hope so. Thank you.
Thank you! I hope so too.
Thank you!
Thank you, I sure hope so.
It does seem sort of backward. But it's positive in that I am hoping for a fixable issue. Thank you for the kind thoughts!
I thought I should probably do that, just to be safe. High stress situations are so much worse with all of the social distancing and masking concerns.
I'm sure it was a line from a TV show or maybe the headline in a tabloid I saw at a grocery store.
Take care of yourself friend!!!! 💕🤗❤️🥰
I saw, u/PurpleTeaSoul is so thoughtful! ☺️
💜💜💜 sometimes things show up right when you need them most
Ooooooh neato I'm sorry it died.
About anything coffee related this is true
Our Walmarts are out of everything lately!
Thats good!  Shouldn't be too much longer that you're back to normal.   Oh my! Yeah, that is a long day!!!
I had my usual bowl of peas and green beans but we had baked potatoes with bbq chicken, cheese and I put sour cream on mine! Very good dinner!
Yup! Home is where the heart is, right? Glad you can now relaxxxxxxxxx
I think the last scary movie I saw was nightmare and elm street many years ago lol I don't have a good heart and I'm a big baby I used to watch a lot of shows and turn the volume down when the scary parts came lol I'm having a great day at work I'm hoping that you're having a wonderful day as well
Not too bad today! :)
Well what you posted isn’t completely true so you have that and he did make cider not sure if it had alcohol in but I would guess it did
Honestly I usually go for the regular flavor or the occasion holiday like red velvet so I just may not have paid enough attention. I’m gonna have to look and grab some now
that sounds like it’s going to be on my menu now hahaha. thank you! some spices like red pepper flakes and lemon sounds yummy for that soup!
That looks really good!
I do not, but for this reason. Lol
Yaaaaasssssss creamy for the win!!!!
I think the Enola Holmes series is maybe childrens books? They're pretty short. But I listened to the audiobooks and I really liked them. I saw the Netflix movie first, so it was fun to have a face to the characters.
I do like it. They have a different mythology around faries than what I've read before which is interesting. It's not just seelie/unseelie courts, but there are 7 courts slowly being introduced.   I was told it has some... erotic themes, but I'm about 65% in and it isn't so bad?.
It's fantasy. I love a good fantasy read.  Oh gosh, I had those so many years ago. College I think?
See. There is a world help up by four elephants. That ride on the back of a space turtle.
The water flows off the edge. The magical field keeps it all together.
Yassssss that’s the way to do it! The worst was being low-censused but on call — getting paid like $2 an hour so the dirty buggars could call you in at any time.  In fact I bet they did it just so we couldn’t drink. Fun suckers.
No, not really. Something happened last night. I thought it was a drug interaction. I felt drunk. But the thing is, it didn’t really go away. I totally passed out last night, but I’ve felt funny all day. I don’t like it. I just hope I wake up feeling normal tomorrow
I'm a sped teacher lol. I appreciate my paras so much. I'm mostly 6 and 7th science this year with a block of math and ela Setts.
Hmm prodigy chess player? Is it sorta based on the story of the kid who was a prodigy chess player? I forget his name already!
Is this on Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime? I must know now!!
Awesome, will check her out
Come to think of it, I love nachos and taco salad too. So I'm not sure why I dislike hard tacos so much. They are harder to eat, though.
Yumm
Ooohhh yes!
No he was trying to hit his
Never heard of it 👀
So flippen good. Just the thought of cinnamon rolls makes me drool - that's the big thing we missed out on yesterday.
Absolutely!! Let me know how it turns out!!
You’re right! I think I may need a few days without electronics and just try to find some peace. But I always miss chatting w you guys too much lol
I’ll say!! 😭😭❤️❤️ I’m in so much awe!! 😭😭
Yeah he was such a brilliant gadget
😂🤣😅
Oh yes I’m noticing this a lot
I hope so!
Yum!! Peas are so delicious 😋
Not looking forward to sleepy time in half an hour tho 👀 Well I am because I love sleep, but it always goes by too fast and I don't want to go back to work tomorrow
😞 QOTD Kraken!!
Definitely. I mean it isn't the same as dipping them in peanut butter since it's pb flavored cream but they are just so dang good. Especially drowned in milk.
SAME. ill look at that book now! i need fantasy  RIGHT! I miss them. i had to leave them when we moved across country (bad situation. had to leave most of our items). they were such an 'easy' read. and midnight sun is so good. i love hearing edwards pov. i highly suggest it
If they tried to tell me I would be on call I would decline. I'm either working or not. Period. One boss tried to force it. She did not win. As I decided to have that shot Anyhoo. Lol she was not happy but I knew for a flipping fact that somebody who was only on call had asked for hours!!
Oh my goodness did you call your doctor what did your doctor say? Have you been making sure that you're eating and you're definitely hydrated with water? Is there anybody there with you to help you out? I'm so sorry to hear this my friend I will say a prayer for you this evening and hopefully tomorrow is a better day for you. Hugs🧸💗
O how very nice. I take it you are face-to-face? We started out face-to-face but stopped in November we were supposed to go back next week but our cases are so high and at such a mass that it's just not safe so we're expected to go back for March 1st
Netflix! :)
I do like fresh soft corn shells best. That’s what I order when at an authentic restaurant. My stepfather is very Irish so they are not too authentic. : D
😂
It's like Gossip Girl meets Downton Abbey. It's a little historical fluff.
Cinnamon rolls are the best!
Take the time you need to yourself!! Hang out with Loved ones! We will be here!
You'll never see his like again.......
Ooo I half know what you mean!!! I’m not working currently but yes, I LOVE sleep however it does always go by wayyyy too fast!!! I’m so frustrated right now bc I really want to sleep but I can’t!
Oh the kraken is awesome
Have you read any Jacqueline Carey? Her Terre D'Ange books (9 of them) are my favorite fantasy series by FAR. It starts off with Kushiel's Dart.  Hmmm, I think a friend of mine is just finishing up Midnight Sun, so I'll ask if I can borrow it for a day when she's done. Preferably a weekend day because I like to read those straight through in one sitting 😂
Hahaha!
My friend Greg helped me a lot this morning. Took care of feeding me and my pets. Ted came over and watched TV with me. I’ll call the doctor if I still feel bad tomorrow.
I was in person, currently working from home. Right now pre-k -5 has to go in person. Middle school and high school aren't back yet. There's no estimated date on when we are going back.
Ooo good to know!! Another reason to re-subscribe!!
Every since my wife got tested for gluten allergy they haven't been the same. Still, sometimes when she's out of town... I splurge 😋
I don’t have loved ones & im so afraid I’ll be forgotten here 😞 I know that’s stupid but it’s true.
There’s so much truth in that statement
Aw I'm sorry, I hope you were able to get some
I havent yet! it sounds AMAZING!  i generally read indie/self published authors.   For sure! its ttaken me afew days to read this because i got out of the habit of reading in late 2019 (i had 3 surgeries in 60 days that left me in chronic pain and brain fog). So while i used to read 35 books a month, this is only my 2nd book in a year. but im so excited to read again. its why im starting with books like twilight/ones i know i love already.
Oh good,I'm glad u have support when needed. Hugs🙏🧸
I do understand that most schools did not have a high infection rate ,but the world is not going to end if the kids miss out on being in person ...right now we have to worry about saving lives and I understand a lot of politics are involved and to me I just think it's morally wrong. Hoping that you have a wonderful evening my friend
How awful for your wife! I wouldn’t know what to do with myself.
You could never be forgotten!! You are such a positive and wonderful light in this community! I would not have the same experience without you and I know I speak for many others when I say that too!!
It took a while but I think I did ok!
Oh my gosh, you've been through quite an ordeal! I hope that things are starting to get better ❤️
Totally agree! Some parents are treating us as free baby sitters. Everyone should focus on being safe. You too!
It's definitely an adjustment. Thankfully a lot of stores are offering gluten-free alternatives to standard foods these days.
That’s so sweet!!! ❤️❤️❤️ come here you!!! Gimme that big long hug!!! 🤗🤗🤗 I don’t think I’m a positive & wonderful light in this subgroup! I just like chatting people up and making sure everyone has a chance to enter contests!! Who’d wanna miss out on those, ya know? I don’t think that makes me any special but I really thank you for the sweetest words!! ❤️❤️❤️
I was telling our Union representative that I almost felt like we were being discriminated against because the special needs workers were the only ones that were in the schools? And he was babbling about their i.e. P's I understand some kids need extra help in some might be suffering but that's when the parents have to step in and do what they have to do at home. Our kids were literally sitting in there all day watching spongebob videos?
I had a student once that discovered they had a gluten allergy and it changed their lives for the better once they got him straightened out.  Hope it was the same for your wife.
You are so incredibly special to me and don’t you ever forget it!!
Wow! That's totally unfair and is discriminatory towards sped teachers. Some parents, do not want to parent or don't know how to.
Thank you, I think she's already been feeling better since cutting it out. The eczema she had is practically gone now!
😭😭😭 you... you are sooo 😭😭😭 sooo incredibly <blows snot out while sniffling up the tears> 😭😭😭 so incredibly special to me and sooo many!! 😭😭😭😭
With that said, I think I’m going to log off for tonight! Thank you for sticking by me during my crap times! I appreciate you soooo much you don’t even know!! ❤️❤️ sleep well, friend, sweet dreams!
I know and that's why each child that I've run across for 20 years I treat them with love and respect as if they were my own
I’m always here!! Take care of yourself and get a good nights rest!! Drink some water and sleep tight!!
That's so sweet.
I can’t sleep!! Aaaaahhhhhhh I really fucking hate this day and this week!!! 😭😭😭 thank you for always being here!! 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️

That's a lovely name 💗

Aw thank you so much u/Cooked_Bread! Thank you for hosting. I hope everything goes well with the birth of the baby, so exciting! 🥰 I loved these books when I was younger so I’m so excited to add them to my daughter’s library.
Thank you for the tag. ❤️😉
I loved these books when I was younger, I remember getting them at a book fair at school haha! I’m so excited to add them to my daughter’s library. I completely forgot about them until I saw someone else here get gifted them and I immediately added them to my list. 😀
Thank you and you’re welcome, I hope you and your daughter enjoy them
Yvw!! Enjoy

I think he specializes is spiritology, but he's really fun to talk to. He's been doing it for a really long time and has a proverbial treasure trove of knowledge to share. He actually messaged me when I mentioned him here! XD

It’s me! There was supposed to be a note — whoops!
The year of arts!
Yesss!!! I absolutely love doing them, I first found out about them back in October, and haven't stopped doing them since! I think I've done 3 so far, and I've nearly finished a huge 60cm by 45cm design of a Fox in a flower meadow! I need to try and decide which design to do next, there's so many out there to choose from! I love just getting into a zone with netflix or youtube on in the background, it really helps me to relax!
I haven't  completed one yet, but this is one I am currently working on Current project https://imgur.com/a/z3GYkWA

May I ask what type of items do u mix with that?

Whatever you would use the regular beater for but it also scrapes the sides acting as a wooden spoon/spatula combo!!
Ohhhhhh that’s so convenient!

[CLOSED]  Hello !!!  I finished writing my first crochet pattern and want to give a copy away to a crochet friend here! You can see the mushroom [here](https://ibb.co/5h5p693). Ill chose a winner when im done with classes on Friday.  Rules:  Must be willing to send me an email address so I can send you the pattern  Be able to crochet  Have an intro  Give me an idea or two on what nature item I should write a pattern for next.  Tell me what you've crocheted recently (bonus for photo)  Thats all!!! Good luck!!!
Oh oh. I am currently getting ready to start crocheting animals and fairies and gnomes for a fairy garden so I recommend you make a gnome one. 😆 no pictures of the last thing I crocheted unfortunately. It was given as a gift

I'd love this pattern you should do a fox next
I love this (and your Etsy)!! I think you should crochet a cute mandrake or cactus! Recently I crocheted [this dumpster fire. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/crochet/comments/koiuj8/happy_new_year_made_a_dumpster_fire_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 😀
I can't crochet so I can't enter but this is adorable!
SO TODAY  I taught myself a new stitch, I’ve been meaning to learn c2c and since I was on a plane I was like “might as well” so I have a nice little start to a blanket. My most recent COMPLETE project was a hat, but I’ve been doing those for....18 years, what’s currently on my hook is way more noteworthy to me. I pulled my hook out and [laid it on top ](https://imgur.com/gallery/MOO1poA) for scale.  For your next nature project, I’m a huge fan of crocheted flowers that can be added to items.    And finally: if I’m not picked, I’d like to buy the pattern from you all the same. My oldest niece is currently decorating her room with mushrooms and butterflies.
I can’t crochet to save my life but these are so cute!!
Yay
love that idea!
thanks!
Congrats!!! The randomized chose you! I’ll send a message so I can get your email to send the pattern to 🍄
Omg that’s adorable!!!
That’s fantastic
omg I’ve been holding off on c2c because it looks so intimidating! I love the colors you chose!
Thank you!
You have an Etsy? What’s the Etsy. Message the Etsy pls
Thanks!!
Here’s the thing, IT’S NOT!! I thought the same thing, but it’s literally a little square made up of double crochets and then you make more little squares made up of double crochets. Hold on....[here](https://makeanddocrew.com/how-to-corner-to-corner-crochet-c2c-for-beginners/) is the guide I used. Note that when they tell you “repeat steps 4-8,” you’ll only chain six on what will be the edges of your piece. The rest will all be the chain threes.   Also, you ready for a surprise? You know that really shitty-looking multicolor from Red Heart Super Saver? THIS IS IT. Work it up in this stitch and it goes from ugly to gorgeous. It’s called Mexicana, if you wanna steal.  EDIT: as a sidenote, I am finding that it’s not working up in a square. The sides are going a bit wonky, so I’m correcting as I go by deliberately skipping a stitch here and there. Just so you know!
Messaged 🥰
Omg that looks so simple! You should look up “red heart Mexicans pooling”. It looks like you can get a super cool pattern with specific stitch counting!!!
Thank you
I’m gonna do that!! Every time I look at this colorway I’m like “.....this has so much wasted potential.” I literally started this on the plane to keep busy, and I am GOBSMACKED by how gorgeous it’s turning out. It’s like looking at a whole different yarn.

I always love your gifted posts! So creative!
u/huntfishcamp i hope to see the full face beat you do with this lipstick! It sure is beautiful.
This is the cutest dang gifted picture ever!! How?! Where?! I’m jealous! I want my little snoo to wear a little earthy outfit! Haha. Love it! I didn’t realize manic panic made makeup too! Enjoy hunfishcamp!
Yesssssssss
Oh that is so cool!!
Thanks!
😍😍😍  Thank you so much!!!  I'll go all out, I promise 💖
I really wanted to put a dress on her but that didn’t work out 😂 I’ll have to try with different poses another time I guess because this one is real GRIZZLY ADAMS.
I agree. You were the clear winner.
Can't wait! Will you match the hair to it?😄
Hahah, well I love it!!
Thank you 💖💖💖
Not this time. Drunk Laci bought some neon hair dye, so I'm going to honor my own wishes 😂
You’re welcome. Thanks for helping to make the game fun
Oooooh neon,  cool!!!
I think it'll look super cool contrasted with my darker makeup shades 😍 I've got a look in mind for when this comes
That will be very striking,  keep us posted!!
Will do 💖

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kwr9ob/activity_ill_cheer_you_up_by_describing_your_life/
I've been noticing a lot of people have been quite down recently. I'd like to do something to cheer you up. This has been quite a hectic week for me with the start of a new semester, but I've been trying to stay positive and spread positivity where I am. So, here's what I can do for you :)   I can distract you and maybe cheer you up through describing your alternate life in a universe where you are an animal or insect! I can talk about your place in the animal kingdom, perhaps the tyranny you faced, how you possibly met your end, maybe you were Mufasa? Who knows. Well I do :P so just leave a comment down below. It can be about you or about anything random
Oooh! Pick me! Pick me!
Cool! To help you out, I’m perpetually hungry and sleepy, my hair changes colour often, and I have piercings in odd places. Do your worst 🤣
I'd love to hear what Alternate Reality Animal Me is up to
Can I be a red panda? My hubby has been obsessed with them recently! If not, an otter, or a kangaroo would be good!
You're the best, John! You always know the perfect activity to make us all feel better! Keep it up 😁
I could use a pick me up today! Thanks for the activity! Happy semester starting!
I hope you’re having a great first week, even though it’s hectic!!
This sounds like something I want to hear! I wish to know about my life as an animal/insect please! 😂
oh how fun~! 🌸
I’m feeling pretty low today, so I’d love to know my alternate bug/animal reality.
Please make me an animal! I do not like insects at all. 😬
I would love to see what animal I am 😂
That’d be an interesting thing to hear! I love ants and tarantulas, please make me one in a story
Oooh, oooh, oooh! Pick me, pick me! Come on, what am I? Huh? HUH? What am I??
MEEEE PICK MEEEE (caps, I'm joking)
Aww this is so sweet!   I definitely need some cheering up so I'd love this!
I wonder what I am?
i’d love to know about my life as an animal/insect haha :3
I love the way you think :)
New semester? You've got this!  I'm so curious... am I Mufasa? Scar?? RAFIKI???
Alright, John. Let's hear it!
🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️ me me me!! I’d like a story please!!
sounds so cute (*⁰▿⁰*)
As I am terrified of insects, I feel insect me would have a hard time lol.
I'd love to hear what I am
I'm also going to start my next sem first day of February. Please lift up my spirits!
“I mean, he was like a glow stick”
You are a Japanese sika deer or spotted deer. You are quick, graceful and poised in the way you act. People may see you as a "deer in the headlights" but that's because you're dreaming about things. You enjoy being in the forest and seeing all the smaller animals that are around. You are quite weary and jumpy around coyotes and wolves!
Haha very very interesting!  You are an artic fox that loves to change the colour of its fur. You loveeeeee to eat and sleep. Particularly in the winter! It brings out this sort of primal instinct within you. You have battle scars from when you've had to battle other animals over food. Rabbits fear you and tend to avoid you if they can! You easily intimidate them
Animal reality you: Is a golden tiger that enjoys running wild and causing chaos! You have few threats and enemies except for yourself. You tend to overestimate your ability to get out of trouble and that has often caused unintended consequences. For instance... you once broke into a movie theatre to watch the life of pi and ended up detained. Quite a sad day but you said it was worth it!
Ahhhh you are clearly a psychic! For indeed, you are a red panda named Pogo! Your husband is actually a kangaroo in this universe and both of you met during a chance zoo encounter. You soon realized you couldn't live without each other. That's when he had the ingenious idea to smuggle you into his habitat before he would be released back into the wild. He would smuggle you by snuggling you! Yes, he placed you in his pouch where he kept you safe from those pesky zookeepers. Once he was released into the wild, you two would continue to go on adventures in Australia where you really got to know each other.
Thank you my friend!!!   In the jungles of Sri Lanka, you were a Purple-faced leaf monkey! You enjoyed the lavish life of tricking monkeys with lesser intelligence into doing work for you. In fact, you started the first illegal banana trade empire. You even sell banana leaves for other monkeys to use for... "medicinal purposes"
Awww, well hopefully this helps!   You are a polar bear living in the Arctic circle. You enjoy a solitary lifestyle and have had to endure many challenges. You are strong, brave, and able to withstand anything. The power of survival and your instincts have been honed by your virtuous nature. The other polar bears admire you for this. And so do some of the other animals!
Thank you! It has been interesting haha.   You are a Lemur from Madagascar! You are incredibly sociable once animals get to know you and are hard to say no to. Your charm and alluring ways instantly make you a hit all around the island. You were recently praised for your new fashion style of using leaves as a comfy oversized hoodie to keep warm during the night!
Ayeee awesome!   Like your username suggests... you are indeed a panda! Not just any panda though.. you are the Chinese red panda. You are part of an endangered species. Your habitat and society has been turned upside down during the last few centuries. You must now fight for every scrap of food and shelter you can find. This has made you into a hardened individual! You take no crap from anyone but have a soft spot for cats for some reason!
You are a racoon! You like to scavenge for food in the night. You specifically like to scavenge around cake factories and places where people may leave sweets. You are an absolute fiend for sugar and will fight to the death (with a stick) for it.
I'm quite sad to hear that. I hope this can cheer you up a bit.   You are a Hoatzin. This is the bird that people most certainly based the phoenix on. You are strong, and rise up to soar above the rest of the animals. You have an usual fear of water but when you're determined, even it cannot stop you.
You are a centipede... JKKKK you're a Penguin! You absolutely love feeling cozy and although you wish you could fly, you're happy with keeping your feet on the ground. You are protective of the people and things that you love.
You are a bull! But not just any bull... yes you are THE Chicago bull! You take great pride in your love of basketball and videogames. Which makes 0 sense since you're an animal, but hey people love you. Unlike your fellow bulls, you have had to face adversity and challenges at every step of the way. Your success and goals have only been quenched temporarily as you often try to reach higher and higher!
Your name is Arnold the Tarantula and your best friend is a fire ant named Tony. Or well you call him that for short since his name is actually Antony. Your friendship began as a quite eventful and strange experience. You were out, casting a beautiful web when out of nowhere a tarantula hawk wasp grabbed you and began to try to eat you up! All of a sudden you see this fire ant spit out a concoction of acid that burns the wasp! This provides you with the perfect opportunity to run away. But the wasp fights back the acid and grabs a hold of the fire ant. You can choose to run or potentially die while rescuing this new fire ant. You choose the latter option. You jump to help the fire ant and use your fangs to subdue the wasp. The wasp is shaken but not stirred. It tries again to attack you but you fade away and let the wasp fall into a pit with a snake. The wasp most likely did not survive. You went to help up this new fire ant friend and found out his name was Antony. You didn't like that. You said "from this day on, we are no longer ant or tarantula. We are friends. I am Arnold and you are Tony. I will protect you and be by your side".
I... am so intimidated by this false intimidation.... which could only mean one thing... you my friend are a Pitbull! People and other animals fear you but you've got an incredibly soft side. You love cuddling and being absolutely spoiled.
WELL WHAT YOU ARE IS... oh wait sorry I had my voice set to max volume. Let me just decrease it a bit... ...... woops too quiet.... Ahhh there we go.  &#x200B;  What you are is: An armadillo. You are stubborn, headstrong and always trying to do things your own way. Yet you are soft under all that armor and it is clear that you just want to feel loved and accepted. You try to stick up for others and protect them even at your own cost.
I hope to cheer you up :)  You are a cat. Not just any cat, but you are a black cat. You have an affinity for supernatural and occult things. You have even been known to dabble in fortune telling and seeing the future. People notice you are quite an inquisitive and curious cat that gets into trouble. Your fur is almost as beautiful as obsidian.
You are a capybara! People are often confused about who and what you are. The truth is, who you are is a courageous and tough animal, and what you are is absolutely adorable! You make people smile wherever you are, and they are sure to take tons of pictures of you! But you don't particularly enjoy that haha. You love your privacy.
You're really sweet! I appreciate your words a lot.   &#x200B;  You would be an Atlantic Puffin! You have a short attention span but love to create art with your beak and feet. You have a sweet tooth but also enjoy sour/savory things! You enjoy nature and observing the beauty of the world. The way you look at things is unique and special. If more people got to know you, they'd realize that you're a priceless individual who contributes precious treasures to this world just by wanting to be there for others.
You're MU-SCA-FIKI! Lmao, nah nah you are the tough but cute animal of the wild! The silverback gorilla! Yes, indeed, you are the cousin of the legendary Harambe. In fact, you both grew up in the same zoo. He would often look out for you and on that fateful day, he protected you and the rest of the gorillas. He sacrificed himself as a distraction so that you and the other gorillas could escape. You are now teaching all the gorillas English literature and math! Soon the gorillas will rise up and take over the world!!!!
You are a Violet-backed starling! Your enchanting purple feathers stun everyone in sight. You are used to being on the run and flying from home to home. However, you have recently met someone who may be your forever birb. It really looks like you two have been hitting it off and you enjoy getting to know them! They seem to have bird-brain but you still find the rest of their qualities endearing
Yessss of course! You are a flamingo. Not just any flamingo. You are THE flamingo. You are a stealth operative for the FBI: Flamingo Bureau of Investigations. You are often found in disguise on people's front lawns. You like to scope out any potential threats and take them out with your dual weapons: thing 1 and thing 2. Aka leg 1 and leg 2. You are deadly....
You are a Koala named Marnee. People love to get close to you and cuddle with you! You love eucalyptus leaves and are practically addicted to them. They are your existence, and you love them. You have this symbiotic relationship with them. When you look into those soft chlorophyll leaves, you see beauty, love, and acceptance... Okay so you might be a little insane but hey that's fine
Well actually the insect version of you hates insects so much that it acts like it isn't one! You are the hummingbird moth. You prefer to act and be like a hummingbird rather than anything insect related. You prefer to do things on your own but would love the company of others who make you happy. Your biggest fear is centipedes!
Haha! I've always wanted to be a cat, so good for alternate reality me
Hahaha this is amazing! His pet name for me is actually Roo so this is so cute! And he does snuggle me a lot.   I think *YOU* are the psychic! I just read him the brief and we both got a lovely chuckle. Thank you!
Hell yeah! And purple is even my favourite colour!
Awww haha i was teaching about polar bears today! What a coincidence
Ouuu! I love my leaf hoodie!!!
This is incredible! Thank you for taking the time for this activity 🙂 I love that you also included a note about cats - I definitely have a soft spot for them!
pfff, yay for the best cake bandit! 🌸🍰
This made me tear up. I love when you do these threads. Thank you ❤️
Thank goodness, I literally gasped when I saw the word centipede lol. I love penguins! And I also love feeling cozy!
I really LOVE this!! Time to fire up NBA 2K and play as the Bulls!
Ooo, I'm vicious: https://imgur.com/t/funny/sibkp
Thank you!! This is super cool!  I totally love cats, so this would be me perfectly as an animal, and I'm fascinated by psychics too! I'm also wayyyy too curious, and curiosity killed the cat! It's like you're psychic yourself with this spot on description XD ;)  This made me smile.
Sounds about right. Thank you.
This is very accurate 😂 did you think of all this on your own or did you get a look at my wishlist? Either way... very insightful 😜
MU-SCA-FIKI for life!!!!!  Ooh, I do like gorillas. Nice choice! I am the leader of the intellectual revolution that brings and the planet of the apes. I did it.
Wow. Spot-on, as usual. You should really consider opening up a psychic shack.
Oooohhhhh I LOVE it!!! 👏👏👏🏅🏅🏅
Oh no “insane” 😭😭 you’re not wrong. But a koala named Marnee!! HOW CUTEEEE
😂 So so glad to hear that!!!
Glad to hear that :)
Haha no problemo! I can usually tell things about people like that :) glad I could make you smile
Aww <3 no problem my friend. I am so so so happy you are a part of our community and I hope to remind you of that with every activity I make
Awww :) thank you. That makes me really happy to hear. And pfttt I am most definitely *not* a psychic but I'll take that as a compliment!
Haha no problem!
What's a wishlist? Never heard of it 😂  Some off it may have been off of your wishlist? :p maybe? Haha. The rest was just my own interpretation. I'm glad it was insightful because you do seem quite interesting
You've doomed us all... 😂
Hahaha omg I'll look into that!
Awesomeeee!!! <3
You certainly have 🙂 I hope you have an enjoyable semester!
Ahaha I’m honored and impressed 😂
Hey, at least I'm not the RAGE monkey from 28 days later 😂😂😂
Have I killed anyone? Or have I done some serious ass kicking w my deadly feet? Legs?
Well that's really good to know actually :) I think I've seen you around on my other activities before but never got the chance to really talk to you. I'd definitely be down for that if you'd like
Jheez.... Yes... Let's count our blessings lmao
You certainly have... there was this snake named Herold. King Herold as they called him (for he was a King Cobra). He was causing problems in the neighbourhood. Trying to prey on bird eggs like some sick creep! You took him out in the battle of your lifetime. Two swift kicks to the head and he was done for. You strike first, strike hard, and show no mercy.
Yassss absolutely 🥳
OoOoO I’m daaaaaangeroussssss!!! Heck yea!!! Enemies beware!!

Very cool! I have an instant pot pressure cooker as well but I have never used it, you’ll have to tell me a good recipe or two.
u/huntfishcamp SO MANY RECIPES!!! Thank you!!!
My hubs uses ours for meal prep and he adores it!
Awesome! Enjoy 🎉
Did you get it for Christmas? I’ll test them out and report back
I use mine to make rice more than anything.
My legally excellent water bro needs to stay fed 💙🌊💦
It’s so nifty!
I actually got it as a wedding present:) let me know!
🧡😘  I really do though. I’ve made two things so far and it’s come in handy so much already!! And now I have recipes on hand! It’ll make meal prepping this year a cinch!
I'm so happy you like it and that it's useful 💖
🥰🥰🥰  You know I’m a fan of those practical things

Les Miserables

The eagle
I was also going to guess The Impossible but someone already got it. Good job!
Congrats 😭 that was difficult
winner
Yay congrats!
Good job!
Way to go that was super hard! haha
Nice job! I still gotta see this one.
you got it!
Darn it! That was my guess.
Same, I've been trying to figure out another guess for like 10 minutes LOL
Haha thanks!! I was going through movies I’d watched as well and that one fit! :D
Woooooooo! Thanks so much for hosting!
Thanks!!! :D
Thank you!!! :)
Haha thanks!! :D
I enjoyed it! It’s different from most movies Ive watched and I really liked that
It's pretty good and I have a new respect for Robert Pattinson
Ahhhhh! Yay!! I just watched the a few weeks ago!!! :D
It seems I’m wrong though !! Imma keep guessing 😭
Yeah I’m struggling with this contest 😅
Me too lol!!
Excellent. I want to do a binge of all of the good Robert Pattinson movies before Batman comes out. The Lighthouse, Good Time, Tenet, possibly High Life.
Right? He has so much more to offer than Twilight
Darn I finally found one but it doesn’t fit with the new clues!!! 😭
Nice! Good Time was a fun watch but I haven’t watched the others yet :D
Have you heard of Kanopy? It's a streaming service that let's you rent movies through your library card. I feel like you would really enjoy it - that's how I ended up watching Midsommar.
I’ve not heard of that! That’s really awesome! I’ll definitely be checking it out. Thanks for letting me know :D
No problem!

So a bit of back story. I've been in the hotel management industry for over a decade. This video is one of THE funniest things I've seen, relating to the industry. 😂😂😂 It's mainly so funny because it's OH SO ACCURATE!!!!!! Whenever someone on my staff was having a bad day and just over working in the industry, I'd sit them down and watch this with them. Really gave us all a good laugh and so far, 100% success rate. 😁 I hope you enjoy!  https://youtu.be/WCqm4H3m3Ew

Also, [this is a sweet video if you like birbs](https://youtu.be/bTQknxH425E)  And finally, one of my all time favourites for a pick-me-up - [2001: A Space Sh-Odyssey](https://youtu.be/zTL4T_NVGhY)  (Oh, and an honourable mention should go to [this channel](https://youtube.com/channel/UCHMmLi8z1HbyhTEvfBgXpyg) (it has a naughty word in the channel name so idk if this is allowed, if not sorry!))
OMG thank you for this contest! No seriously, it made me remember [a video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Awf45u6zrP0) I used to watch every time I was in a bad mood to cheer me up!

It's been a rough few months! BUT I will tell you something that just happened to us last night...   We have this really awesome suction attachment in the shower that holds the shower head down lower so my 5 year old can use it like a shower his size. USUALLY when we are done letting him shower we move it back up to it's original location. Sometimes it falls out if you don't, or the cat knocks it down. It's about 10pm and my sister is not feeling all that hot so she goes to the bathroom. It's quiet in the house because it's late. All of a sudden I hear a *bang* and "Ahhhhhhhhh!" She's just chilling there on the toilet watching her phone... And it fell down. I go see what's going on and she's yelling "If I wasn't shitting myself I would have shit myself!!!!!!" I laughed so hard I almost couldn't stand up. Guess I forgot to put it back up top...
I don’t know if it will make you laugh but [this](https://youtu.be/1i5DEipIWh4) always make me smile!   Hope everything starts going better for you 😊
I am so sorry you're having a shitty week man! I know what that's like, so many ups and downs I swear and I haven't left the house in a week! for real! I bet you are going to have the best week ever starting next week because I want to believe that we both will!!! I'm going to share the wonderful musings of Tony Baker with you. This is a compilation but he's just so funny and  I love his sense of humor, especially because a lot of it involves animals ! [Tony Baker Compilation](https://youtu.be/3fFqVRH-_wM)  I really hope this makes you laugh and that things start to get better! Thank you for the contest friend!
I hope this will cheer you up! Cute animals and funny things always cheer me up! I'm sorry to hear you're having a tough year, sending lots of hugs your way!

Okay, so this isn’t funny per se, but this cheers me up exponentially every time I see it! [Mini Mall] (https://youtu.be/FJ3oHpup-pk)
This is one of the most amusing videos ever - toddler hurdles. But you have to watch the video over and watch a different kid each time. It's gold. Let me know which kid most sums you up!

https://youtu.be/QyU2p4l5iUA?list=PLDB35B01135F40D27&t=155  a weird take on American south crime movies.
Two of my favorite YouTube videos that never fail to make me laugh are [this one](https://youtu.be/-dxIq8KxaL8) and [this one.](https://youtu.be/7T2oje4cYxw) The first one makes me outright laugh more, but the second is one I can FOR SURE see my fiancé doing if I can ever get him into an Ikea. (He really loves puns, especially terrible ones.)  Hope you're doing better!
I will never not link this video for something like this! It is absolutely hilarious!  [Video](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJcbMDCM/)
Sorry things aren't going well. Each new day brings new possibilities.   I can always rely on episodes of [Whose Line is it Anyway?](https://youtu.be/-U1kSWr-LJI) to make me laugh. Here's a compilation of Ryan and Colin clips sure to make you snicker.
I love this video: https://youtu.be/4duZFTrHwhw
Personally I love [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZSfPPJ4Fk8&ab_channel=GMakin) one.
https://youtu.be/stqG2ihMvP0  This is my go to and has been for years.  Sending hugs and hopefully a well-deserved chuckle
I really like [this](https://youtu.be/e2zJA7eBSdY) video but I feel like it may only be funny if you've played the game 😓
It's been a rough year all around, and I feel you on that.   So with that, here's my favorite laugh so hard I almost pee video.   "[My cat loves licking me but can't stand when I do it back.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6DMefwDhTQ&ab_channel=ColtonCarlyle)"  The best part of this is that the cat is already prepared and ready to move and like OH NO NOT THIS AGAIN before he even starts. AND NOW I AM LAUGHING TOO HARD.
[this one](https://youtu.be/y8Kyi0WNg40) Is so simple but I love it so much  I hope you feel better soon
I’m sorry you are having a rough time. I hope it gets better for you soon.   I love this [video! ](https://youtu.be/W6DmHGYy_xk)

I'm sorry you're going through a rough time! My husband showed me [this](https://youtu.be/oNqY5w6dVAE) video yesterday and we both thought it was super funny. It definitely depends on your sense of humor but I thought I'd share 😊

This video was quite [funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDEIwdnNWa0&ab_channel=BantaristicGaming). I hope you feel better soon. I was going through a very rough day yesterday and spent the whole day feeling down but after I watched some funny tiktok videos I felt much better!

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kww92i/discussion_what_do_you_do_for_anxiety/

Generally talking to someone, even if it's just sending some messages on RAOA. Its how I reconnect with "safety."  When it gets real bad I have to strain my muscles somehow.   Spotting all the red items in the room helps ground me.
I have a few coping techniques.   First is trying to ground myself by focusing on counting ... the number of tiles on the floor, or pages in a book.   I have a coloring app that also really helps when I am out and experiencing anxiety.  When it is really bad and I am at home, I like to try a really hot shower and then lay under my weighted blanket. I have have cbd oil in a vape which helps at times.
Stare at my fish, read, do puzzles, anything to not think about it.
I do exposure therapy and I talk myself through it. So, for example, since I am afraid of going outside (I have agoraphobia) I make myself go on a walk. I push myself to keep going until my anxiety starts to peak a little. It should be enough to make me a little anxious, but not enough for a full blown panic attack (this is because you don't want to be too comfortable, but you don't want to make it worse by scaring yourself too badly). I talk myself through it by addressing the irrationality of my fears. For example, I often feel I can't breathe when I walk too far away from the house. So I tell myself "There is no reason you couldn't be able to breathe when you are 5 minutes away from the house, when you can breathe perfectly fine standing right outside the house for like an hour." This helps me realize that I am actually fine, and that my fear is my head messing with me. Another thing that helps me is my support group, because they understand my struggles and can help me reason with my fears because they have been through the same thing.
I haven't found anything that helps yet, but my fiance can usually calm me down when needed.
If I get anxious at a store, I focus HEAVILY on whatever I'm looking for, while also trying to take deep breathes. I'll remind myself that I'll be in my car soon and okay. If I'm panicking about something at home, I try to distract myself with some kind of game or craft.
i’m having a lot of anxiety today and i can’t stop thinking about something that i want to stop thinking about, ugh. what do you do when that happens?
I try to distract myself with a movie or tv show! Especially something I’ve seen before, as it’s familiar and comforting.   Hope you’re ok ❤️
Count to refocus. Like I’m in an isle I will count blue items, then red, then yellow etc till I’m calm enough to accomplish what needs to be done
I find Coloring, playing mindless games like solitaire, taking a bath. and reading a book help me when I am anxious. Pets are also grade for this.
I put on some music that soothes me
Honestly it depends on what kind of anxiety. If it’s a small anxiety I can distract myself with creating things or a happy conversation with someone. If it is a medium anxiety I might write it down in a journal and then do some self care. If it is a large anxiety (I have PTSD) than I usually go with the motto “the only way through is through” and I talk to someone out loud about my anxiety/allow myself to really feel the fear and anxiety/panic then use grounding techniques to regain myself. So listing/identifying the things around me, meditate, engaging the 5 senses etc. Please reach out or DM me if you want to talk about anything or if there is any way I can help.
When I have anxiety (which has been super bad the past two nights for some reason) I have to do things that remind me that I’m fine, that I’m here and everything is okay. So I smell candles or my favorite perfume, I go for a ride, I listen to music, taste my favorite snack. I have to sort of overwhelm my senses to get my mind off things.
a lot of colouring and eft tapping, as well as closing your eyes and affirming things like 'everything is okay, you can do it' 🌸💗
it depends on the type, i rotate through a lot of  different coping mechanisms depending on what the context of it is. but lately, i've been making use of a fidget... decahedron i have, but smelling something nice will ALWAYS ground me enough to at least figure out what's up
I remember to breath. Recognize when it starts and then start to concentrate on knowing when I’m breaths in and out.
Some days it's a struggle. But the first thing I do is acknowledge my anxiety. Then I close my eyes, and put my hand on my heart and breath. I try to notice if there was a trigger, because then I can maybe do something about it. Then I ask myself what I need? Sometimes it's a warm bath, or a nap, or silence. I hope you feel better!
I read or play games to distract me. Ive found it helps a lot to just take my mind off of things
Distract myself with a book or Reddit.
Ugh, suffer! lol I take deep breathes and try to get through it. If it’s really really bad I’ll take some meds but they never seem to kick in fast enough in my opinion lol
Depends on what’s giving me anxiety. I get it a lot at work (I work in a pharmacy/grocery store) so I usually have to back away from whatever is giving me anxiety and go in the back to breathe, talk to someone, or just sit for a minute. If it’s unrelated to work, I usually try to look at things that make me happy like cute animals and calm down. I try to see the positive outcome from whatever is giving me anxiety because normally I think of the negatives so if I focus on the positive it helps a bit. I have horrible social anxiety so anytime I have to go shopping alone (which is all the time) I just bring headphones and ignore everyone
Most of the time I put headphones 🎧 on and just drown myself in music! 🎶 it relaxes me. If there are a lot of people around this doesn't always work for me.
I practice Thought-Stopping and Thought-Substitution
I take medication for it. Not the best way but it works.
I get social anxiety and I also get extreme anxiety when driving in cities.  When around lots of people, I will just get the heck outta there. Problem solved. When I'm in the middle of a highway, I can't just walk away, so all I can do is focus on breathing and listen to music. I am better about it if I am the one driving, but if someone else is driving, its very nerve-wrecking and I get very fearful for my life. Good thing I live in a small and rural town, so there not much traffic in my day-to-day life.  I sometimes smoke CBD, but it is more for instant relief, rather than an everyday medication.
I hug my little blanket clown, it helps calms me down
Write. I write it all out then walk away

Edit: Contest is closed. The power came on at 8:55pm, so the closest guess goes to u/Effective_Cupcake_24 with 9:01. I will gift in the morning since I am very cold and sleepy.   Hey all. There was a storm last night that knocked out the power at about 3:30AM. It is now just past 1PM and the power is still out. I am now accepting guesses as to when it will come back on.  The rules:  1. Guess when you think the power will be back on. Post your guess in Pacific time including a date if you don't think it will be today.   2. Have something on your list approximately $10 or under.   3. Post a link to your wish list.   4. Include the raffle phrase "It's electric!" just in case.   Contest ends whenever the power comes back on, but I will put a hard limit of Friday at 7pm and gift randomly if it isn't on by then.  Good luck, to you and me!
Yikes!! That sucks!! I hope you guys get power soon than later!!! Fingers crossed for you guys!!  My guess is that it’ll be on by today 4:30pm pacific time?

North of Seattle, I'm in Snohomish County and we had outages all over the county. A lot of people still don't have it back.
We are all safe, thank you for asking! I am currently mourning the fridge full of food that I lost, but it could have been worse and we are fortunate enough to be able to replace it.
Thank you, we are all safe! We lost the food in the fridge since the power didn't come on until nearly 9pm, but it could have been worse.

Thanks for the tag! 😊
Thanks for the summon!
It would be cheating, have a friend with this issue in the west side of the country!! 💕
Thank you!!
Sorry! I was without power most of the day due to storms as well. I didn't get it back until a few hours ago and didn't think to come on reddit.
I still don't! 36 hours and counting
UGH I've had that happened!!!! Our fridge died a few years ago and my landlord wasn't super quick about replacing it. I was so pissed! Also because I low key always have a full fridge even though there's only two of us in the house (we actually also have another smaller fridge, tl/dr- the newer fridge is a POS too, lol) -- well I'm glad that things are hopefully back to normal!!!
Dang that sucks, I was hoping it would be sooner for y’all. We recently had to replace all of our fridge/freezer food due to a hurricane so I know how obnoxious it is having to do that. Really glad everyone is safe otherwise though ✨
Yayyyy!!
Wait wait!! Go to View All then write your comment under the actual post!! Your entry will just get lost if it’s under my reply!!
You got it!! ❤️
❤️❤️❤️
You know it!!
👀👀👀
Absolutely!! You’re stuck w me now!! Be ready to be summoned all the time!!
Glad to have you back!! Glad you have your power back!! Yikes, storms must be crazy!
Oof, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
I was hoping it would be too, but at least it came back on. Fortunately the food in the freezer survived this time, so we at least have food to eat until we go shopping later.
Whoops 😂😂😂 thanks!!
<3
Awwwwww I really appreciate this and you!
It was a really bad wind storm, we haven't had one that bad in a fair few years. It sucked having no power, I got sleepier and sleepier because of how dark it was. By the time the power got back on I felt exhausted and it was only shortly after 9 PM.
I am! I'm ready to have power back!!
Small wins! lol
😁👍
Not having any power is really rough! We have outages in summer all the time bc everyone is running their ACs! Granted we only have to go a few hours to 5hrs at most but it feels like hell to us! I can’t imagine what it’s like to go all day without it! Glad to have you back!! And yes, it’s exhausting- it really is!

Welcome to the sub, MrsGreen89.
Welcome! where are you from?What do you enjoy doing with your kids? What kinds of books do you like? I hope you enjoy this page. It is very positive and uplifting.
Hi welcome to the sub! Beach glass is so pretty!! What do you do with the beach glass you've found?
Welcome! Do you do anything with the sea glass?
Hi there and welcome!
Welcome
Hi! Welcome! What's your favourite animal?
It’s so relaxing and thrilling to hunt for different colors!  Where do you like to search?
Hi and thank you so much for the warm welcome! Everyone seems really great here so far!   My favorite holiday has always been the 4th of July! My birthday is the 5th so some of my favorite memories growing up would be watching the fireworks on the 4th, camping out in the backyard with a big bon fire and waking up to it being my birthday! My family and I love to camp and go for hikes so I’d have to say those are probably my favorite things in nature— or working in my gardens, I find it very peaceful and relaxing!   You sound like you have a beautiful and rewarding life! Cats, kids and nature! Perfect! Thanks so much for welcoming me in!
Awe thanks so much!
Thank you! 🙂
Thanks! I’m from Western NY, we live right on the shore of Lake Erie so we spend a lot of time down by the water collecting beach glass, rocks/fossils and of course swimming and playing at the beach in the summer. My oldest is in 1st grade and her school is currently virtual so we have been spending our days navigating through her school work and trying to make it fun while occupying and trying to include her 2 year old brother. I truly enjoy most genres of books, I find myself lost in mysteries a lot of the time! I’m currently reading the Harry Potter series with my daughter, we are almost done with The Chamber of Secrets! So far from what I’ve lurked it seems very positive and happy on this page so I’m all for it! Thanks for welcoming me!
Hi! Thanks so much! I mostly just have it stored in different jars but I have been practicing wrapping pieces into pendants for jewelry! I mostly enjoy the “treasure” hunt!
Thanks! I mostly just sort it into different jars but have been practicing wrapping some of the pieces to make jewelry pendants and such. I mostly just enjoy the “treasure” hunt!
Hi! And thanks!
Thank you!
Thank you! Elephants! I have them all over my home! Do you have a favorite?
We’re near Lake Superior so it’s not technical sea glass, but - close enough! How about you?
Out of animals that don't belong to the feline family, I'd say alligators haha
Oh awesome! We are right on the shore of Lake Erie!

Thank you so much u/Almostdevine for BOTH of these items!!! I didnt scroll through the pictures you'd posted so the UK chocolates were truly a pleasant surprise 🥰 thank you so much for making my week ❤ and for gifting me these necessities to get thru my college semester! You're too sweet!! 😊
Yum! I used to be in an international swap and I absolutely loved the candy. I especially remember clotted cream and ripple bars. Yum. Im jealous! Enjoy them slowllly :)!   Also, for those of you who love eggs & own a air fryer. You can throw em in the basket on 250 for 17ish mins. This is the only way I was able to successfully make hardboiled eggs. Go figure lol. Unfortunately, I dont make them enough to warrant its own appliance :))
What lovely gifts!
I love my egg cooker so much. Enjoy that gadget.
My eyes missed the healthy egg cooker and jumped straight to the chocolates
I have that egg cooker... It's really handy!  If you have an Aldi near you, pick up some Everything Bagel Seasoning, it's delicious on boiled eggs!!!
Omg those sound amazing!! I will try to! (Though I'm veryyyyy tempted 😂)
Thank you!! I'm very appreciative of Almostdevine for her kindness!
Thank you, I will!! ☺
LOL that's fair, the chocolates are very enticing!
Oh my God that's a brilliant idea!! Thank you 🥺 let's just say, my cooking skills are not the most developed 😂

That's all so cool! Whenever I look for interesting perler bead patterns, I've found that cross stitch ones work really well! The earrings are so cool looking. They remind me of a skull that came with my Diablo 3 special edition box. Those chopsticks look gorgeous, too!
soooo those chopsticks are the truth. you can throw them in the dishwasher if you want and they won’t show any wear. i use them daily!
You’re welcome! 😊
These chopsticks are awesome. I’m using them right now on some twice cooked pork. I normally use cross stitch patterns or something I find on Etsy.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/kws6z0/discussion_whats_a_cleaning_hack_you_wish_you/

Put a dish of water with a few drops of lemon juice in the microwave, set for 1 minute.. when you remove the bowl, grab a cloth and wipe out the microwave.. any gross sticky bits will wipe right off!
if you're cleaning up a room, grab a laundry basket and dump everything that doesn't belong in it and carry that around to the various places things need to go once you're done, then you aren't wandering off each time you find an item to put away
Throw your dish sponge in the microwave or dishwasher to clean it instead of just throwing it away.   I stopped using paper towels to cut back on waste and just use washcloths.   Vinegar is a fantastic cleaner - for sooo many things. Coffee pot, dishwasher, washing machine, glass, mirrors.
I rub dryer sheets on microfiber furniture to make them smell good after I’ve cleaned them, also tuck them under the cushions.
I get reallyyyy overwhelmed cleaning. I go in with good intent and get so overwhelmed i stop quickly. My cleaning tip i learned is to focus on one area of the room/one item in the room. Like focus only on the kitchen table or start with all the cloths on the floor. Focusing on just one thing has really helped me overcome the anxiety a messy room gives me and i clean so much faster. Not the best hack but maybe itll help someone!
Use vinegar to clean mirrors and windows with no streaks, to make fabric softener/color brightener, to clean mildew from toilets and sinks, remove hard water stains, mix with baking soda to clear a drain, etc.  Cut slits in Mr. Clean Magic Erasers to fit in your window frames so you can rub it easily back and forth and clean all the accumulated dirt. Oh I think vinegar works at removing the dirt too rofl.  I'm starting to use rags to clean to cut down on paper towel use. My boyfriend got some from his job but any old cut up tshirt will do. I was thinking instead of throwing out old socks to put them over a Swiffer duster and use that to dust to save on the duster refills.  Honestly I thought of cutting sponges in half to make the package last longer.
Ohh interested to see other peoples’ cleaning hacks!  I don’t have any good ones myself :( I just clean the old fashioned way, I think!
Vinegar is basically gold. It's my go to cleaner with a little essential oil so it doesn't smell like vinegar LOL.
First: This is just a pest one, but it's so helpful and I wish someone would have told me when I was younger:  If you get ants (and you don't mind killing them).. just shoot them with bleach and the trail they most likely took to get there. Less than 5 minutes and they'll be gone until the following year at minimum.   Second: Not really a cleaning hack, but a brain hack. If I want to clean, but can't find the motivation... I watch YouTube videos of others deep cleaning. It gets my brain ready to go tackle the chores.   Third: I accidentally probably have too many, but another pest hack...  If you ever treat your house for fleas, throw a flea collar in the vacuum. If you don't, any live ones you sweep up during treatment will just jump right back out.
It's not a cleaning hack as such but I wish I'd learned the burrito method for changing bedding earlier - Its soooo much easier!
You do not need specialized cleaners. Get a general cleaner, and clean everything with it. That's what they do for hotel rooms, and it works great!  (obviously this may not apply to things like wood furniture, or whatever)
Buy the robotic vacuum.
Water, vinegar, and a toothpick in a microwave safe dish. Microwave it for 5 minutes, let it sit in the microwave for 5 minutes. Clean said microwave with ease and NO vinegar smell!
Using a power tool w brush attachments for bathroom tiles
Instead of buying the refills for a Swiffer mop, just attach a microfiber cloth into the holes. Works just as well and can be reused.
Do a little cleaning every day, it seriously helps to avoid a big deep clean day when everything is so messy.
Vinegar, then salt, then lemon or lime juice, cleans a stinky drain better than almost anything else. (Works amazingly for bar sinks/drains)  Scrub daddies are 100% worth it for tough stuff
[Martha Stewart's method for folding fitted sheets](https://www.marthastewart.com/269141/how-to-fold-a-fitted-sheet) is a game changer.  My husband thinks it's witchcraft.
Buying 2 fabric shower curtain liners. As soon as I take off the nasty one for the laundry, I put the clean one on, and the one getting washed just gets folded into the linen closet until the next swap.  Also, I’ve recently become obsessed with GoCleanCo, and a believer in the water, bleach, and powdered Tide mixture for mopping/wiping/cleaning everything
Oven cleaner can get discoloration out of a shower.
Vinegar.
Just do one thing. That's my hack honestly. I have ADHD and executive dysfunction is the worst. I feel like I have to do everything at once and I get so overwhelmed. Even just doing the dishes can get really overwhelming sometimes because there's so many of them and they're in the sink but I need a clean sink to wash the dishes but the dishes have to be clean before I get them out of the sink but I don't want to touch dirty dishes or get my hands wet....and so on. I've found that if I just make myself do ONE thing it makes a big difference. So if I have to do the dishes I will take one item out of the dishwasher and put it away. Sometimes that's enough to break my executive dysfunction and I'm able to continue and actually do all of the dishes. Sometimes it's not and I try not to be too hard on myself. I take a break and then come back and do one more thing. If I start thinking negatively like "what's even the point of doing this one thing, there's so much more to do it doesn't make a difference" I remind myself that it's better than not doing anything.   This might make no sense to some of you but that's okay, its just what works for me :)
Top to bottom. ALWAYS. lol.
I'm a slob. And I found [A Slob Comes Clean](https://www.aslobcomesclean.com/) a few weeks ago. Finally, somebody understands my brain. With my ADHD it is just so hard for me to clean and my house is in total disarray all the time that I'm overwhelmed everyday. This woman has opened up a whole new world for me on how to clean my house. So, if you're a slob and have a really, really, really hard time cleaning, definitely check out the website and read her book!  Also, I wish I had gotten into audiobooks earlier. I clean so much more and more thoroughly when I'm listening to a really great audiobook.
This will come in handy!!  I have two housemates (husband and I child) who never cover their food when they reheat it!
I was about to post a microwave cleaning one! Although I use vinegar with some tea tree oil in it instead.
This probably would have saved me so much time and energy last weekend, I scrubbed the microwave inside HARD to get the crust out.
This is a great idea!
Excellent idea 💡
I’ve seen those new reusable paper towel type things on Etsy.  They even snap together and roll up.  I’ve been wanting to try them to cut down on our paper use.
sometimes there are things I will not wash out of a cloth and paper towels are so worth it in my life at that point, saves water, saves soap, saves time and saves my sanity
I’m going to try this for sure.  Sometimes I feel like my couches smell *more* like dog after I vacuum them.  Thanks for sharing!
This is how I am currently feeling - overwhelmed. Since my husband and child are both remote (and have been since MARCH), I feel like I am constantly cleaning.  And they both leave little piles in every room, all the time.  Thank you!
Oh man same. Once I disassembled a bed and cleaned every nook and cranny cuz it had been sitting unused for three years and got so overwhelmed I just sat in the middle of the pile of timber and wept.
I have so many windows!  I’m going to try your vinegar trick.  I am terrible at cleaning them.  Maybe this will help 💛  I use old socks over my hands to dust the tops of all my doors and door frames.  It  is so much easier and I feel like they really grab the dust!  Highly recommend.
I was lucky enough to receive some much needed magic erasers. They practically can clean anything with just a little water💪🏻
I’ve been doing it the old way too, and I feel like I could be working smarter, not harder!  Plus, I feel like I spend too much time cleaning.  I’d like to cut my time down to enjoy more of my life 🤣
If I use essential oil in it can I still use it on wood?  I have so. much. wood.
Thank you!  These are all great!
Ooohhh I’ve never heard of this.  Googling!
?
We have one!  I do love it.
what's the toothpick for?
Smart!
Thanks for sharing this idea.
Oh, really?  I have stains on my tub I cannot get rid of.  I have no idea what they are (from previous owners) and no matter how hard I scrub, they won’t budge.  I’m going to try this.  Thank you!
I use Lysol toilet bowl cleaner with bleach for this!
That’s an awesome you found someone who can speak to you in a way that makes sense!    I am really into podcasts and never thought to throw one on while I’m cleaning.  Great idea.
I'm coveting these!
I get it. I still keep some on hand for certain messes.
It really helps with the dog smell. I have two Jack Russells and it helps with the dog hair too!
You’re welcome!
I am too, I'm saving my next window cleaning for spring.   Thanks for the tip, I always forget to clean the tops of doors and the frames.
Those things are great, I even rip those in half to make them last. 😸
hmm I'm not sure, I only use it on surfaces I want to disinfect that aren't porous. Things like tile, plastic, counters, etc.
So I googled it and some essential oils are good for wood actually! Depends on which ones you use. :)
I think you’d want to do that with a wood safe carrier oil, not vinegar or water.
The ulimate cleaning channel is [clean my space!](https://youtu.be/cP3f6_9_oh8) I've been following her for years now, she's a professional cleaner/YouTuber now for half a dozen years with hundreds of videos on how to clean, how to motivate to clean, and cool cleaning products.
It prevents the water to boil over, at least that's what the online DIY told me!
You’re welcome! 🙂
Test it beforehand to be sure it's safe to use! There are tons of how-to guides on the Internet.
Awesome!  Thank you!
We have the original windows too :(  so everyone one of my 53 windows has at least 12 panes 😬   It’s painful to clean them.
Yes, cutting them into two, turn 20 into 40.  Great tip!
Thank you!  Glad I asked!!
Someone in r/frugal said vinegar is good for cleaning but not adequate for disinfecting.
*heads to google*
I will stick to the Murphy’s oil.  Thank you!
Oh awesome!  Thanks so much.  I will check it out.
interesting, I'll have to try that
Will do!
omg
Depends on how you do it, and which kind you use. I don't use it on anything I'm worried about things like covid/the flu on. But I use it for wiping down counters, etc. [Here](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a31264367/is-vinegar-a-disinfectant/) is an article that can help you understand it more. I use a 50% water 50% vinegar with 2-3 drops of essential oil mixture. Also certain oils have disinfectant properties too. Like tea tree oil.
Ahh that explains it thank you.

/u/MandalorBMF Thank you for the surprise dice!! NEVER ENOUGH!! Much to my fiancé's mild chagrin.
I'm also a big dice gobbo lol
I have gone far enough that I make my own dice with resin. Of course that doesn't mean I don't still want other kinds of dice!! 😍
I keep trying, but I also keep screwing it up. I really need a pressure pot.
It is very worth the investment honestly. Like it's $100 but honestly you waste so much less resin....   Otherwise make sure you're carefully slowly mixing your resin and pouring slowly into your molds. Then run a lighter over top real quick to get rid of the surface bubbles.
My issue is the heat from the kick. I live in a hot area, so when it spikes it's crazy. So yeah, I really need to invest. I'm thinking tax time lol

u/STaylor0415 thank you so so much for the new CAH expansion! I was laughing like a fool just flipping through them 😂
I have had this game for a year and still haven’t played it! I originally bought it for the teens but found out it’s an adult game lol. Do you play often?
Haha those are awesome!
I absolutely love this game!
I love this game! Enjoy 😊
Looooove CAH! So fun!
Hahaha! That looks so fun!
Cards Against Humanity!! What a game!! Hope you enjoy it!!
That’s awesome!! I’m soooo glad you’re enjoying them.
I feel like I go through waves of playing. When the right people can get together, we'll play it a lot, like 4-5 times over the course of a couple of weeks, and then it'll go back on the shelf for 6-12 months. Having lots of cards is the best because it lets you a bunch of times in a row without feeling stale. It's definitely a game you gotta be with the right crowd (and mood) for though
Thank you! One of my favorites too.
It's one of my favorite things with friends! There have been so many tears from laughter around this game 🤣
Thank you so much! Always always a favorite :)
I can't wait to get a big crowd of people together again to show them all off :)
I bet lmao!!! 🤣

Hey,  I just turned 30 this year! O.O I've been on reddit since high school, and this group seems like an awesome way to pay it forward!  I'm a sound designer for live entertainment. I used to cut all the tracks for Disney on Ice, Monster Jam, Jurassic World Live, and Marvel Universe Live, but 2020 wasn't kind to arena / stadium show. So I'm freelancing on some awesome passion projects, and working at Trader Joe's (and it's a great company). Both me and my partner are Non-Binary and living in Florida with plans to move out west in the next year or so. We have 2 dogs, a cat, and a handful of fish. Love video games (PC, Switch, PS4...), DnD, 3d printing, board games, and music. <3

Welcome!  30 is young :)
So fun! Your zoo sounds a lot like mine! Good luck on your move when you decide to do it! My hubby and I are planning a long distance move eventually too! What are your preferred pronouns? So I make sure to use the right one! :)

Welcome!😁
Hello and welcome
welcome! I hope you enjoy it here (:
Hi and welcome! If you had six flamingos what would you name them?
Welcome! I also play a lot of games on those same platforms and more, I don’t really play pc much anymore though... what games do you play? And what’s the most recent thing you’ve 3D printed
Hi and welcome.  What kind of fish do you have?
Welcome! I just turned 30 this year too! ...or, well, I did at the tail end of 2020. Guess I should say last year now!  I think you’ll love it here, everyone is so kind :)   Your previous job sounds like so much fun (not that your current situation can’t be fun!). Are you hoping to get back to that when the pandemic ends?
Your former job sounds awesome! And I love Trader Joe’s! Welcome to the sub!
oo sounds like an awesome job!    I love gaming!! What are some of your favorite video games and board game?
Welcome! Sound designers don't get the love they deserve.
Welcome!!
Wow! That’s very cool work experience. What’s your favorite thing to have “cut”?
Well hello there my friend happy New Year💥 to you and thank you for joining us.😁   Can you tell us maybe what your favorite holiday is, And maybe your favorite thing that you enjoy most about nature?🌴🐢🦉🦅    I have a cat Mr. JJ🐈I have 3 kitties outdoor who come to visit me every day for food,I've also been working with special needs children for 20 years, and I love everything about nature.🐦    Hoping that you enjoy your stay with us if you have any questions don't be shy I am here to help. Hope that you have a wonderful evening looking forward to chatting with you soon. Hugs🤗
Hello! What’s your go to race and class for dnd?
Hello and Welcome.  How do you handle technical issues in a live situation?
Hiiii hello! Welcome to the 30's club (oh, RAOA too)! ✨  That sounds like a really cool job, not gonna lie. I absolutely love Disney on Ice.. super bummed we had to miss it this past year bc of the virus & all.  What are some of your fav video games? Or, what are you currently playing? 🖥️🎮
Sweet thanks! <3
Thanks!!! They/them please!   I’m pretty excited to both move and take the cross country trip.
Completely possible!
My partner says: Petyr, Punchinello, Marzipan, Flim-Flam “no dash”, Debbie, Venus
I’m currently playing fire emblem and hades on the switch. If you like roguelikes you need to play Hades. It’s awesome.   I just printed a Wraith, but the resin I have is too brittle for it, it’s broken a few times so I need to experiment with a few things. I’ll post a picture sometime when I’m happy with it (:
A lot! My partner is the real fish caretaker, but I picked out the freshwater angelfish. I know we have a really cuddley loach, and some tiny cat fishes, and a bunch of other fish I don’t really know the names to lol.
Guess I turned 30 last year then. Great lol.  I don’t know what my future holds, I’m working on this pretty huge project, and once it wraps in mid April I’m going to start thinking about where to go from there. Maybe? Probably! But not likely in Florida haha. I just have no idea what to expect for the future.
Thanks! Trader Joe’s is great (: I really love the community it brings. Both the crew and the customers are pretty awesome.
I have been playing over watch since the beta, and still play today. The sound design is really well done blizzard is pretty good for that.   Currently playing through fire emblem on switch. It took me a minute to get into it, it’s a very ambitious game, and I kinda miss the older fire emblems. Hades is really good. Like really good. Board games - betrayal in the house on the hill is exceptional, I’ve been playing magic the gathering since grade school, catan is a standard, I recently have been playing a lot of ticket to ride, hex hex, there’s a lot lol.   Any recommendations?
I know! Lol. But then sometimes they steal the show (;
Jurassic World Live was a whole lot of fun! Really challenging, but extremely rewarding. Also a lot of fun to be working with nearly life size animatronic dinosaurs.
Favorite holiday has to be New Years - our tradition is to go camping and pack a bottle of champagne (:  Favorite thing about nature is the sight sound and isolation. One day soon I’d like to hike the PCT. and if all goes according to plan bring a good mic to record ambience along the way. There’s something magical about the sounds of nature.
Im currently playing a tortle protection cleric. I’m on the fence about playing cleric, but having an awesome time with the campaign. Our DM is really cool and open to players playing what they like. I really enjoyed playing my tabaxi blood hunter, and my swindling dwarf Rogue was also really awesome. My partner and I rehearsed a song as a part of our backstory playing homage to Sweeney Todd - Pierelli’s Magical Elixer.  How about you?
Thanks!  I don’t really handle a lot of technical issues in live situations, but I do plan procedures for them if they were to happen! We had some tracks where if a performer wasn’t able to do a trick, like if an Aerialist missed the web the technician could trigger a “no fly” that would play an alternate (and shorter) track.  Or if something goes really wrong, you could pause the show and start it again. Like once during opening the grid caught fire from a pyro hit, and the performance director paused the show in front of an audience. But things like that are rare. I just had my fingers crossed I programmed everything ok so when the technician went to play it would all work.
Yeah that sounds really fun! Always wanted to take a road trip!
I think I’ll end up trying the hades game someday, maybe when the ones I’m currently playing expire lol what is rougelikes?   That’d be awesome! I’d love a picture!!
It’s so hard with so many things up in the air. But at least you have a big project to work on. Sounds exciting!
yeah I do like a lot of the things that Blizzard makes. They need to hurry up with Diablo 4 though lol  Betrayal is a fantastic game! My favorite board games are Tainted Grail: Fall of avalon, Kingdom death, Cthuhlu death may die and Talisman!  We tend to buy a lot of board games that are also 1 player and up that way if we dont both have time or we cant pull off a game night, we can still play if we want to without the other.
I bet!
Magical is a wonderful word and so many people are missing out on just looking outside their front door and their  Back door
Wow! Those all sound really cool and fun to play! I’m in my first campaign right now and I’m an air genasi paladin. I’m having a lot of fun so far
a rougelike is a game where the maps are procedurally generated so each time you play it it's different. Generally it's really challenging, but gets easier the longer you play. Good examples are The Binding of Issac, Hades, Children of Morta, Wizard of Legend. Some games give you powerups as you play so the longer you play literally the easier it gets, some you just have to get used to the timing.  Lot's of fun (:
That's not a bad idea! I have a few 1 player games. We have a good group of 6 or so that come over for board games, so we always struggle finding games that can fit that number of folx.   Also I haven't heard of any of those board games, but I was just looking at them, and they all look amazing. I'd love to play them. Have you ever played gloomhaven? It's been on my list of games to play for a minute.
Oh awesome! I haven't encountered a genasi yet in DnD but I've always wanted to play one!
That sounds really cool! I’ll have to check it out! I’ve been hearing really good things about hades so I might bite the bullet and buy it once I pay for my preorders 😬
I have!! We bought it about a year ago and got through a couple of campaigns! Its a lot of fun and I like the secret unlocking mechanics of it! It makes it feel like you are achieving goals throughout game play!
Yeah! The voice acting is amazing too. I think Matt Mercer and a bunch of people from critical role are in it. It was just on sale for new years.

\[Intro\] Hello all, I'm new here, I am a single mom to an 11 year old daughter. I currently am a LPN (low paid nurse) in a Covid swab clinic in Oklahoma.  I just turned 40 on Christmas Eve. I am going back to school this semester to finally finish my last two classes to FINALLY get my associates degree, then I will be applying to an LPN to BSN program in order to fulfill my life dream to become an RN/BSN.  I finally decided to get my life together at 40, lol.  I am an animal lover, especially dogs, I have three that I consider my children *almost* as much as the one I birthed.  I am a semi-retired raver (at least until my kid is old enough for me to come out of raver-retirement, lol), I love drum and bass and reggae music.  In the summer, spring and fall I love to camp and float the river.  In the winter I love to count the days until spring so I can go camping and float the river, lol.  That is me in a nut shell.  AMA, I am an open book.
Welcome :) What's your favorite food?
Hiya and welcome!  I'm from oklahoma!  I miss it so much!
Hello! You have a favourite song?
Hello and welcome!  What are your doggos names?  I’m a dog lover too 🐕🐩🐕‍🦺🦮

Hey! Fellow Oklahoman here. What lake do you float? I wish you well on your journey to becoming an RN/BSN!
omg my mom has her LPN and calls it a low paid nurse too!  I always thought it was something she made up haha.  I'm glad you're here :) welcome!
Welcome!!
Hello and welcome
Welcome!! I actually went to nursing school and realized in my final semester (of a bachelors no less) that it wasn’t the career for me. Would have been a lot cheaper to realize that well before that point, but it is what it is.   We’re happy to have you!
Hello and welcome to the group!  Thank you for all that you do!  I'd love to see pics of your dogs! I'm a huge dog lover myself!
oo Congrats on going back to finish your degree!!  What are some of your favorite bands?  &#x200B;  Also, hello and welcome!

Hi, welcome and Happy Belated Birthday!  Once you become an RN/BSN (which by the way I didn't know were slightly different. My partner would be classified as a BSN, but still just says she's an RN), do you plan on entering a specific field of nursing?

Welcome to RAOA!
Birria or street tacos, or sushi.  but i will go into debt over birria tacos lol
where are you now? i lived in seattle for a while, I miss that so much! i love my hometown though, i hated oklahoma most of my life but around 35 years old i realized it was pretty cool after all
drum and bass favorite is "Just one second" by london elektricity  reggae favorite is all songs by the artist Koffee
Zydis, Africa, and Tricky.   Zydis was named after an antipsychotic medication we gave a lot at my first job as a nurse, he was crazy so it seemed fitting.   Tricky got her name because I had the run DMC song "it's tricky" stuck in my head   Africa was named after weezer redid the song Africa and it was playing on the radio all the time and stuck in my head constantly, lol.   what are your dogs names?
Thank you!
I drive to Tahlequah and float the Illinois River. SO much fun!
I've done the same before!   I actually got my A&P license (airplane mechanic) back in early 2001, graduated, got a couple jobs in the field, did it for a  year or two before I realized it just wasn't for me. Wasted 18 months of school and tens of thousands of dollars in student loans that I lived on while going to school for it. I basically enrolled in the school on some weird whim.....I didn't even know what an A&P mechanic was when I enrolled,  a recruiter talked me into it as a stepping stone to becoming a pilot.  should have just went straight to pilot school, that might have been fun, being a mechanic just wasn't for me though.
That might take me a minute, I’ve never posted a picture in a comment before. I’ve only been on Reddit less than a year and just never figured out the whole Imgur and posting pictures in comments, only ever done it on the main post with the image link. I will see if I can figure it out a little later today when I have a break cause I love showing of my cute babies lol
https://i.imgur.com/2VRsabR.jpg
Dirty heads, stick figure, iration, rebelution are just a few of my favorite bands. My favorite artist right now is a girl that goes by “koffee”
I love 4th of July, I love the fireworks!  And thanksgiving just because it a holiday centered around food, definitely don’t love the reason we have thanksgiving though.  And my favorite thing about being out doors  is just the escape from my house (I’m in it to much other than when camping) I have lived in tiny spaces for way to long (lived in a stationary rv for 3 years, and now share a one bedroom apartment with my 11 year old and my 3 dogs for the past 3 years)  so when I’m camping it doesn’t feel so confined and cluttered, just wide open clean spaces and that feeling is amazing to me.
Some states require you to have your BSN to even work as an RN, my state is not one of them, but someday I’d like to become a travel nurse, and possibly get my masters in nursing as well so becoming a BSN was the more logical choice for me. I work with pediatric patients now and honestly can’t imagine doing anything else, I love kids....so maybe on the pediatric floor, the clinic I work in is more like an urgent care and is super busy and fast paced and I absolutely love that and have thrived in that type of environment, So was thinking I might wanna try ER also (we have a very nice Peds ER in my town also). When I originally got into nursing my only goal was labor and delivery and eventually becoming a nurse midwife, so that’s still an option I think I would love but have started to lean more towards wanting to stay with pediatric patients instead of pregnant women.  Once I bridge from LPN to RN to opportunities multiple tenfold though so I just never really know until I get out there and start clinical and see for sure which one feels like “home”
Thank you!
That sounds nice I’m gonna check those out!
Those are all great names!  We currently have two dogs named Chunk and Coconut.  Coconut is named appropriately because she is cocoa colored and also a nut.  Chunk is....well a chunky monkey!
Ahhh okay. My friend does that, too.
Awww 🥰
I agree with you I don't like things being cluttered especially my living space and hoping that you're able to get some peace and some more relaxation outdoors
Thank you for explaining. I forgot to mention that I'm based in Australia, so to be an RN here you must have completed a Bachelor's degree in nursing. I know here we  have AIN (Assistant in Nursing), EN (Enrolled Nurse), RN (Registered Nurse), and probably a couple of others, but I'd need to talk to my partner to find out more details about each classification.
if you've never done it you should try it and go with your friend! it is so much fun
Ah, yes in the US we have the lowest level of nursing is an LPN (licensed practical nurse, or some states call it a LVN for licensed vocational nurse), it’s just an 18 month nursing school certification, no degree. Then RN which is an associates level, then BSN for bachelors level, you can still just work as an RN with slightly higher pay or it also opens the door for more managerial type positions. Then there many different types of masters degrees in nursing depending on your specialty.
It sounds fun. I just can’t do it. I suffer from chronic pain and fatigue. What’s relaxing to you is a miserable day for me.
Aww, I’m sorry, that sucks!  Have you ever heard of kratom? It’s a plant in the coffee family that comes from Southeast Asia and has been used for hundreds of years as an herbal supplement. i have some autoimmune issues, super low thyroid so have fatigue from than and just general body aches from autoimmune issues, not as bad as yours obviously because it isn’t bad enough to prevent me from doing things like that, but without my kratom it can be kind of rough on me as well. Kratom gives you a slight pain relief, works on your reactors similar to how opiates do, without the addictive qualities, and also give you some energy.
Ive heard of it but Ive always been a little scared to try it. I’ve heard some mixed reviews, but they always say it helps. I’m not even sure where to get it. I know this vape shop had some before mmj became legal.
I buy mine online at laughing lion herbs
Ooh okay. I’ll save that. Thanks.

I went to take a package to my neighbor that the postman misdelivered and to my delight the neighbor had a package for me too! So I'm not sure what day these arrived but I have them now and oh my god i LOVE THESE cookies so much. Thank you u/grindelwalds_bitch!!
Yum!
What’s on the inside. Marshmallow
You’re very welcome, enjoy! ❤️
It's a little more like oreo cream than marshmallow - there's not too much of it so it doesn't overwhelm. It's really a perfect blend of chocolate cookie, an actual piece of (really good) chocolate for the star, and the cream!
Cool I need this then

It is CLOSED   Hello everyone its my first ever contest and I am excited to gift you special people.

I want to cheer you guys up!   &#x200B;  **Rules**  1 - Only open to UK residents (sorry international folks)  2- Include the word Chester in your post  3-  Give me your favourite family recipe that all of the family enjoy. (link if possible)  4 - Contest will close at 10pm tonight 14/1/21  5-  Has a gift up to £10 on their wish list  &#x200B;  Good luck, i hope the lucky winner likes my gift.
Thanks for the entries. I’ve definitely got some recipes to try.   I will order the winners gift tomorrow. I hope you enjoy it whoever you may be
Stay safe, hopefully your lockdown gets lifted soooon!!!
Happy half birthday! I've never been to Chester   My favourite family recipe to make actually came from a Hello Fresh box and is a vegetarian taco with harissa beans and roasted peppers and courgettes. It has fresh feta on top as well and is utterly delicious. I can't link it as I only have the paper recipe but if there's enough interest I'll write it up here!   Hope you have a great half birthday, how are you celebrating?   Thanks for the contest!
Sorry things are tough.   Not UK, not entering. Just solidarity for tough times.
Ahhh we have the same birthday!  Today is my half birthday as well! It is also my grandma's birthday. If she was still alive, today would make her 100y/o  Not entering due to being in the US.
Here's my fav recipe - it's a crowd favourite as it's vegan. Here it is in my [recipe book ] (http://imgur.com/a/zCi3Tgp)  Chester
Mongolian beef is a firm favourite in our house at the moment, even better that it cooks in the slow cooker. It's a little bit  like black bean sauce (but nicer) and I serve it with rice. [recipe ](https://www.thechunkychef.com/easy-slow-cooker-mongolian-beef-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-12437)  Chester
Happy half birthday! One of favourite places to visit is Chester Zoo! I will have to make do with the live cams and virtual tours for now :(   Beef casserole is always a good choice for these cold miserable nights. You will need a slow cooker for this one. Add a box of chopped mushrooms, a chopped/diced onion, 3 chopped carrots and some diced lean beef into the slow cooker. Add 2 packets of Coleman’s beef casserole mix (minus 50ml of water that has been recommended). Add it in the cooker. Sprinkle an oxo cube and switch to on low (from in the morning). Stir occasionally before adding some comptons gravy salt and plain flour to a mixing jug. Add some water until you get a nice smooth consistency (not too watery but not too thick). Add this to the casserole and stir. Allow to cook all day. Serve with mashed potato (made with milk and butter). Delicious! 😋  Hope you get the chance to try it :)  Thank you for the contest <3
Shame I missed this!   If you edit the original post you made and put the word CLOSED somewhere it'll close the contest automagically for you :)
Thank you. Looking like match but who knows
You should go it’s lovely there. I will definitely look up this recipe
Thanks friend. We will get there
Happy half birthday fellow cancerian
Sounds delish
Whoa. Sounds great. Will be trying this
I’m a lover of a casserole especially with dumplings. I hope others try your recipe
Taco recipe incoming! Because its from a Hello Fresh box I'll give rough amounts (they send everything out with just the right amount)   You'll need  * Aubergine (1) * Red Pepper (1) * Ground cumin (1 ish teaspoon) * Potatoes (around 450g)  * Mixed beans/kidney beans (1 400g tin)  * Mint (optional)  * Garlic clove (1) * Tomato puree (1 teaspoon)  * Veg stock powder (1 cube)  * Harissa paste (1-2 teaspoon, spicier the more you put - you can get this in Tesco)  * Natural yoghurt (2 ish tbsp)  * Feta cheese (half a standard block)  * Soft shell tacos (I use the mini ones from Tesco)   &#x200B;  Steps:   1) Preheat oven to 200C (180 if fan). Trim the **aubergine** and cut into cubes around 2cm. Slice the **red pepper** into thin strips/chunks (we like chunks). Pop these on a baking tray and drizzle with some oil and the **ground cumin.**  2) Chop the **potatoes** into 2cm wide wedges, drizzle with oil and season with salt and pepper and then bake for around 25-30 mins with the vegetables  3) Drain and rinse the **beans** and put half in a bowl and mash with a fork until broken up. Peel and grate the **garlic** or use a garlic press. Pick the **mint leaves** from their stalks and chop roughly if using.  4) Heat a drizzle of oil in a frying pan on medium-high heat. Add the **tomato puree** and the **garlic** and fry until fragrant, 1 minute. Pour in the **water** (100ml), **veg stock powder, mixed beans (whole and crushed, and the harissa paste.** Season and bring to the boil and simmer until thickened   5) Pop the **yoghurt** in a bowl and add the **mint.** Season with salt and pepper and stir together and set aside. Crumble the **feta** into small pieces. Pop the **tacos** in the oven to warm through for the last 2 mins of wedge cooking time.  6) Assemble! Put a dollop of the **yoghurt mix** on the base of each **taco** and spread it out. Then top with the **harissa beans**, a handful of the **roasted veg** and finish with the **feta**. Serve the wedges alongside.

Ooo I’ve never actually tried making it with dumplings before! I might have to try that :).

Shush, I like them :).  We are our own worst critics.

Bubble is a great word. Thank you for this one. I love showing off Chester, he is a brown ball of fluff, like a teddy/chewbacca and is so michievious. Today he has been to the groomer so loving his new look.    Check him out here [Chesters pic](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJrDmcoJkDg/)  he will always make you smile.

Oh, my goodness.  I am so sleep deprived I thought the instructions said to include A word bubble not THE word bubble and for a moment I wondered, how do I do that?  lol   [my cats](https://imgur.com/gallery/GBTFQcb)
I have 2 dogs, Remus and Chug. I have had them both for 5 years and both are rescues! Remus (a border collie mix) is my little shadow. He loves attention and follows me around everywhere. I accidentally step on him all the time because he is always under my feet. He is such a sweet and obedient dog. Chug (a pug husky mix) is my lazy cuddler. He loves my bed and would lie on it all day if he could. He also sucks on blankets and chases laser pens. He is a quirky dog and my buddy.   In August I started fostering this beautiful cat. My 4 year old named her Pumpkin. She was very shy at first but is slowly got braver. She loves getting pets and scratches. SURPRISE! Pumpkin was pregnant and had four kittens. We had no idea she was pregnant until the day before she gave birth. Fostering them was such a blessing in my life. They made 2020 a positive year that I will never forget. They found their forever homes recently so they aren’t under my care anymore but they are too cute not to mention. I miss them so much 😭  And we have a hamster named Honey. He is such a sweet little dude. So calm and happy. He loves fresh green beans and sugar snap peas and running on his wheel all night long.   [Pet Tax](https://imgur.com/a/SBKDLXF) Thanks for the fun contest! I love talking about my pets and bubble. ♥️

My cats love [bubbles](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5uVVxM7jRiJ5xEM57). I have a photo of both of them playing with bubbles. I think one of them (the grey one, Tito) is focused on hunting a particular bubble.)  &#x200B;  Here's an extra of [Tito,](https://photos.app.goo.gl/M1FVM1kH1uc9uLvz5) and an extra of [Kona](https://photos.app.goo.gl/M1FVM1kH1uc9uLvz5) cause I just love them so much. Kona is at the vet today. Nothing bad just a (nescessary) teeth cleaning, but he's gonna be so unhappy till he comes home, poor beb.

[This](https://imgur.com/62oTgJR) is Dodger. He is a chihuahua-terrier mix my husband and I rescued from the shelter before he was about to be euthanized. He is very loving and kind, loves to give kisses, and belly rubs are his favorite thing in the whole world.  [This](https://imgur.com/9ciSHmj) is Daisy (also a rescue) and we think she is part beagle, part dachshund. She is intelligent, loveable, and extremely energetic. She enjoys snuggles, playing with squeaky toys that she eventually destroys, and long walks in the park. She demands to be between my husband and I at all times.  Bubble is a favorite word of mine too. It's just so cute and fun!  Thank you for the contest!
[https://imgur.com/a/tkwxSSj](https://imgur.com/a/tkwxSSj)  These are my chickens Barry and Chive!  I'm not  sure they are bubble fans, I but I love bubble tea!   Its lovely to see someone else from the UK on the sub!
Yay, I love pet contests!!! Here is [our fam](https://imgur.com/gallery/czavuw5) 💕 none of them are big bubble fans, unfortunately lol
Celebrating our Akita Inus Birthday!  https://imgur.com/a/5EvXyXM  Her name is Aki (would've been funny if her name was bubble, right?)  5/7 Creativity
[Here's my Australian Shepherd x Border Collie, Shadow!](http://imgur.com/a/y7JVivi)  Bubble !!! Thanks for the great contest I love seeing pets!!
Jespar wanting to come on a trip with me, he's probably 13yrs old now. https://imgur.com/gallery/b2GNZLO  Do you know what always rises to the top? People who are strong, committed, with great ambition and focus... Oh and Bubbles.
Here is my bubble butt pitbull [Zeus](http://imgur.com/a/q9o9lGR)
This is my [Astra-Kitty](https://imgur.com/gallery/oAwjfXx). I love her cute little heart-nose.  The word "bubble" makes me think of the fish who liked the bubbles in the treasure chest in Finding Nemo! I love it!
Not entering because don't have any pets but it's so nice to see others pets.
Bubble! Thanks for hosting! 😄  Here are my babies [Perrie and Mimi ](https://imgur.com/a/Rphs8lH)! Mimi the poodle mix is my first dog ever (because my parents didn’t allow pets in the house) and we adopted her 5 years ago. For a senior at the age of 12, she has so much more energy than her adopted 5 year old chihuahua sister Perrie! These two have seriously brightened my life, and they are so spoiled!

My two cats and dog   Pets https://imgur.com/gallery/0RGtJ3i  They are bubble butts  ETA: the last cat is my daughter's but also lives at our house (my daughter is 12)
[this](https://imgur.com/a/ctWKjVx) is Fatboi Jaden! He’s a goblin with a permanent head tilt, four teeth and an extreme love of dirty socks. He meows like a computer shutting down and I can honestly say he’s never boring.
bubble is a fun word!!!  These are my pasta cats: Fettucine, Spaghetti and the little fluff monster is Penne.    [https://i.imgur.com/bnLlopI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bnLlopI.jpg)

Thank you for all the pictures!! Both of them are such cuties
His little tongue out is so cutee!!!
Thank you! Hopefully I can do one in future where everyone can join in 💕
😍😍😍 what's his/her name?
They're so cute!!! I'm dyslexic so I muddle up words all the time and it always brings funny outcomes!
I showed my mum the pictures. We're both gushing over how adorable all your pets are!!🥰 The kittens are just so cute!!! Remus sounds just like my puppy. He's always right behind or infront of us and is constantly making sure we're still there which leads to a lot of paws being almost stepped on.
Aww I have a Hazel too! Except she is a floofy dog
😍😍 Hazel is such a nice name. Very pretty kitty
This isn’t the video I was looking for, but it’s arguably the same caliber [bubble kitten goodness](https://imgur.com/gallery/UzrRY4i)
It's like whack a mole! Apart from no one would dare do the whacking. I love the little box tunnel. She is so adorable! And yes she does make me want to squeal inside 🥺🥰

Dodger sounds so fun! I love getting kisses from my pup and he loves getting kisses. We've accidentally trained him to give kisses when you make kissy noises, oops! Daisy is such a cute name! I love it :D  Very good choice of favorite word! I like it because even if you say it in an angry voice it sounds hilarious.
I think these are the first chickens that have been posted on this contest and I'm very happy about it lol. My auntie has chickens which we looked after for a week and it was very fun. Your chickens are cute! :D

She’s my widdle baaaaaby ♥️♥️
Why thank you thank you!
Thank you!! His face has done the same to me!! Whenever he does something naughty like dig through the trash he gives me his best 🥺 and I’m such a sucker!!! hahah!!
Thank you! She’s the best 💕
He's called Prince, but we call him P. He's 9 this year, he's a really good character and i love him lots
Thank You. He's such a big part of my life now, couldn't be without him
Thankyou! He's a good horse, acts like a big dog
Here's another picture that better shows off how pretty she is! [pretty kitty ](https://imgur.com/a/hr1syCy)
Aww thank you so much! 💖
Thank you 😁
The rabbits are more of my step-daughters responsibility. So that helps a bit lol.
Thank you! Maddie is mine and Daisy belongs to my fiancé’s parents :)
Ohhh if you want scheming you'll have to witness [this lewk](https://imgur.com/a/iaZdL3k) 💀👀
She was feral and is newly tamed. Sweet but fast with her claws.
He definitely tries to be a looker 😄
Thank you! It's fun that him and I have somewhat similar eyes haha
Thank you! I’ll make sure to tell them 🥰 And yesss! Cats eyes are so cool!
Ohhh thank you I’ll go find your kitty xoxo
Thank you! He is my catson lol 😸
Her name is [Sissi ](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/702882309619056683/797487746993225738/image0.jpg), a fluffy [tiger ](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/702882309619056683/799198014925307924/image0.jpg) 💕💕
Her name is Kitty!!!
The prettiest! And he knows it, too. You should see him preen when he realises he’s getting attention. He loves getting attention lol.   And Lily is absolutely a whole mood. We joke that she’s actually an ancient, alien commander who was sent down on earth to enact total social and economic reform, but there was a malfunction in her transporter and she ended up a cat instead. So she patrols around our house keeping everyone safe (burying coffee cups on the floor, inspecting doors), super grumpy because she’s supposed to be taking over the planet.
She has! Ever since we brought her home that chair has been her spot! She likes to bird watch :)
He loves the snuggles 🥰
Glad you enjoyed! My cat is a little scared of my dog but she likes to mock/tease her at times. Like if my dog is outside waiting to come in and my cat sees she'll come over and roll around in front of the door.
Haha thanks! Honestly sometimes I want more 😬 Almost impulse got a tarantula the other day but my husband said we can’t impulse buy that one. LOL we also have 27 plants. And are hopeful adoptive parents! Sometimes idk how we do it but most of the time I’m like GIVE ME ALL THE PETS 🤣
his tongue is always out.  Honestly such a character, talks to pigeons, pretends to be a cat and generally makes our life 100% better.
His name is Gijs 😁
Thank you! What kind of puppy do you have? I always feel so bad when I step on him. 🙈
Thanks! I was trying to think of a name when I got her and thought "her eyes are hazel..  oh hey!" The little orange spot on her forehead was the thing that sold me on her :)
😍 Very cute!  I want a bubble machine now 😂
i'm definitely biased but i think he's the handsomest pup i've ever seen 🥰
Sir poofington, toast, ham, I also have a bean but she doesnt like her picture taken. She is a cat with an attitude!!
Roxy was just a name that popped in my head when I picked her out. She just looked like a Roxy to me I guess! Dumptruck was mostly my husband. We were trying to come up with random ridiculous names before we’d even picked him out, and he came up with Dumptruck and I couldn’t stop laughing so we went with it!
He's gonna get some for sure. I mean he always gets them anyway, but extra tonight.
Thank you! If I can figure out how to upload it, she taught him to play dead, like "bang, you're dead." It's so cute! I'll see if I can figure it out.
She’s such a good doggo
Same though 😂
Skittles! She's my lil forever pup 💜
Thank you. They are all their own special characters, lol.
So many cute furry things! 💚💚
Oh that’s so awesome !!! Do you live IN Scotland ? I want to go visit one day - I thought I was primarily Irish btw which is hilarious because somehow my whole family screwed that up , haha !! - And yes , MooMoo is a great model lol
Haha thanks! That’s my little old man, Romeo :)
So, the first one is Gerry. He's our resident fat cat lazy bum.   Zazu is the second... And yes, he's named after the bird in The Lion King.   And the last is Ludavic. He's the sweet but shy outdoor cat that we adopted!
Awww thank you! I love chickens, admittedly they aren't the most cuddly of pets, but I still love them nonetheless!
Aw thanks! The dog is our girl Moo, the black cat is Poe and the other beauty is Baby Kitty, the gray and white rabbit is Elliott and the tan one is Skamps, and last but not least our scaly dog Yara (the beardie lol)
Oops
Thank you! I named Zeus and Athena myself.
Haha ikr, and you just feel so bad moving them so you let them sit there and don't get work done 😂
Two are shorthairs! But they’re all very soft.
The tiger one is Riley, the dog is Bruiser, the black and white cat is Silverado and the calico is Dingus (my fiance named her)
Just felt like sharing my lil gremlin :)
Haha! She is sooooo fluffy. Seriously like a Swiffer on our hardwood floors - she collects everything! But she is just so damn cute. And thanks, the names make for interesting conversation at dinner time.
You can hardly see Cotton in the back but he's the greedy one of the two. If Peppa isn't hungry then we have to hide her bowl. Cotton will eat it all up without a care in the world!  Thank you! Her name was Pepper when we brought her home from the shelter but it didn't feel right.  I'll still hear the kids call her that from time to time but she doesn't respond to it as much as she does Peppa! 😊
Thank you! She’s ma baby! I love her so much! 💜
Also edit your original comment so it includes the word bubble at the end! Don't want you to miss out :) 💕💖
We bought a former lesson Welsh pony named Prince, a gorgeous buckskin. The first time my son took him to 4H riding group and cued him to canter, Prince stopped walking and laid down while my son was on his back. Prince didn’t want a boy bossing him around but eventually the boy won.
Awh 🥺😍
She really is such a pretty kitty!
Yeah. For me more than 2 pets would be like a losing game of twister 😂
Wouldn't want to get on her bad side then.
Well he's succeeded! My heart wants to burstttt. Please give him a head scritch from me 🥺
Awh 🥰
Sissi is a cute name! A fluffy tiger indeed but the cutest fluffy tiger I've ever seen 🥺😍🥰
Ohhhh 🤦‍♀️ that makes a lot more sense now. Oops! Well kitty is the cutest pup I ever seen ☺️
I would be giving him so much attention. Animals are just so adorable 🥺 and I love that story! 😂
Awh that's adorable! I love that :)
Oh wow!! I had 3 plants (still have them) but they're all dead. I always forget to water them and it's not like I have a load of responsibilities either so I honestly don't know how I'll cope when I move out 😂. Good on you though!
Awhh!
That's an awesome name! There are so many creative and new names for pets that I've never heard before that I'm learning from all these comments ☺️
I have a mini schnauzer so he blends in to the carpet in our hall which makes it even easier to accidentally step on him and he's also just small and fast so he is just an accident waiting to happen 😬😂
The orange spot is very unique I don't think I've ever seen another kitty with one like that. It would've sold me too!
I can't argue with you there!
Kitty with an attitude! Sounds like my aunties cat. Love the names!
I love that!!! Dumptruck is a funny yet cute name ☺️ and I love the name roxy there's a dog that lives near me with the same name :)
Yay I'm sure he'll be happy ☺️
Awh! I need to teach my pup how to do that. Sounds so fun
🥰
Awhh! That's the cutest name ever! 🥰😍
Yes, I live in scotland :D  We're pretty sure we have some sort of french heritage (if thats the correct word) because of our last name, it's very unique so if you were to search my first & last name on facebook I'm pretty sure I'm the only one that comes up with the correct spelling. Makes me feel kinda cool with how odd my last name is tbh lol
I love it! I love disney so I absolutely adore the name Zazu :D All their names are cute and Gerry sounds like he's living the good life. :)
All those names are awesome! I feel like my family have been so uncreative with names after learning all these new one lol :D All my familys pets have basic names like max, april, sampson, tom. My cousin actually named one of their ducks ducktape which is probably the best name ever for a duck lol.
The names are cute! 🥰
That's fine too! ☺️☺️
There's always a greedy one! 😂 And that's really sweet :)
You are so kind! I wasn’t going to enter, but I changed it :)
Haha what a boy! He sounds awesome
Done and done :) here's a [bonus pic](http://imgur.com/a/1yjhYtA) of him being a sleepy kitty!
It's silly, I know!!!
Thank you!! 😂 And yes animals are the best; I honestly don’t trust people who actively dislike animals.
Thank you, she’s the best!! Do you have any pets?
Thank you, she’s the best!! Do you have any pets?
Haha you’ll do great when you move out! You’ll learn a lot really quickly! I was the same way. 4 years ago I killed every plant I looked at and only had 1 dog. You will probably be excited and that excitement will help motivate you for the things you will learn! 😊
Ooh I didn't even realise that, Imma look at some cool names in the comments!
All I love schnauzers. My in-laws always have a schnauzers or minis.
Yeah but my wallet wont, I just got the estimate 😱  But that's something I knew was a possibility getting the bois so I will do what I must.
My daughter can teach a dog to do anything! She has a magic touch! She needs to teach him to stop eating the couch, lol! I think he's being a rotten boy, but helping me get a new couch at the same time, so yay!
Thank you! 😊
He's definitely living the good life!
lol ducktape! That’s fantastic! All but Moo are rescues so most came with those names. Only Skamps and Moo were named by us actually. And Moo was part of a litter where we were NOT keeping any puppies, so we just gave them all temp names based on how they looked. And 12 years later we still have Moo Cow 😆   I’m a huge fan of people names for animals, it always cracks me up! Plus I love how casual you can be in conversation, like my friend used to talk about how aggravating Kevin is, turns out Kevin was her cat 😆
AAAAA what a beautiful babyyyy. He's certainly made my day, thank you ❤
Yes! [This](http://imgur.com/gallery/sLFnxVB) is Obi ☺️
Thanks for the reassurance that I won't die due to lack of adulting 😂 But really thank you that puts my mind at rest
This is [Obi](http://imgur.com/gallery/jG0BbZp) 🥰🥰
Well you still picked good names! Moo is an adorable name ☺️ and yeah it's so easy to talk casually about pets and confuse people. I've done that a few times on purpose 😂
You're too kind! Anytime ☺️
Omg the snow on his little nose!!! I love him!
Haha no worries! I literally didn’t even know how to cook when I moved out! Try not to stress! And if you need any help or tips you can always reach out to me whenever that time comes!
He is the cutest little thing! I just saw your thank you. Adorable! 🐶
lol I don’t blame you, I’d do it all the time to mess with people
He was sniffling about in the snow and kept ending up with snowflakes on his nose we all thought it was adorable and snapped so many pictures haha!
Thank you so much! 💕💕
🥰🥰
How could you not snap a million pics, look at that little face! Super adorbs 😍

u/stopitlaura OH my goodness.... HOW bright and cheery! I'm going to use one today: in the hot tub, and the bath… Maybe even sitting just next to my chair! 🥰🦩💞  Mostly, I'm not even sure that I know what to do with this level of friendship. Your emotional support absolutely is incredible. I'm not sure that I deserve it or to be friends with someone as incredibly thoughtful as you. Thanks so much, and don't ever stop. 💞💞💞
W-why so many ??
🥰🥰🥰🦩🦩🦩💞💞
Well I didn’t know I was going to be crying today. But here we are. Thank you for putting up with me, and my absences when I’m crazy busy and or just feeling overwhelmed. I appreciate you and you are my own personal cheery flamingo lol. I’m so glad they arrived safely, and they’re making you smile.   I’m so so so proud of you for getting through the classes, I KNEW you could do it. You’re a rockstar and you should know that.
Why not so many though? 😂
I'm not crying... you're crying!! 🙈💞💞💞🦩

The drunk guy at the end of the bar just attempted to sit between my legs! Then when I declined this offer he sat behind me licking himself!!
That [drunk guy ](https://i.imgur.com/IGWAQNO.jpg) at the end of the bar is wearing a cone of shame
That drunk guy at the end of the bar pooped himself at some point last night and my husband had to clean it up this morning 🤭🤣 He is currently sleeping it off in the basement where it is cool and quiet.  He is about 82 in drunk guy years so none of these things are surprising.  The other drunk guy sleeps all day and I haven't seen him around yet today.
That drunk guy at the end of the bar insists on be on my lap but also doesn't want any one using the notebook that are near by.
That drink guy at the end of the bar keeps on kicking me because I'm in the spot where he wants to stretch out and sleep
That drunk guy at the end of the bar keeps swinging around some stuffed animal in his mouth grumbling about something and occasionally tossing it my way!
That drink guy at the end of the bar is licking the shower curtain...again. Third time today too. just can’t get enough of that shower water
That drunk guy at the end of the bar is sleeping and licking his paws
That drunk guy at the end of the bar has been outside for a wee 3 times now and he's still not settling down.   Ah, jaysus, now he's licking his own penis! Will these atrocities never end? Now he's trying to lick my face! Somebody call him a cab home!
The drunk guy at the end of the bar is scratching at my door after hobbling up my staircase
😂
Oh nooo! Cone of shame! How long does the drunk guy need to keep wearing it for?
lol! How's your husband liking it?
Ooooh! I'd love to see pictures!
😂
Rude! 😂
😂😂😂
Drunk naps are the best
😂😂😂
👀👀👀
Only, the last time I ignored him because he'd already been outside 3 times, the drunk guy peed in my bed... So...
He seems annoyed haha
Here we go! I couldn’t get imjur to work for a while!  https://imgur.com/a/MvS84rs
Will do! It’s one of the easy fan ones
For real, I wouldn't mind one at the moment
😂
That looks so cool!!
It makes it so much easier. I mean I’m definitely the fort queen when it comes to building but this is just easy to put together AND clean up!
I will definitely keep this idea in mind for if I ever have kids!

Thank you so very much for these cards u/iamtraveler0027. I want for little, and these cards help me be present in the moment. I am a little behind in my gratitude, and the very first card about time has been a wonderful reminder. 🙏

Huge thank you to u/dumbportagee for supplying me with some new reading material! I can’t wait to start reading these! ✨💛
How little are the mass paperbacks, someone told me the difference and I was scared to order them for myself? Are they decent? You are my personal reviewer! Is it a great deal for $18 or way over priced for original price of $54 and you're welcome!!
Honestly, I’d buy one book for $10-15, so $18 for 5 books is an awesome deal. The books met my expectations and I didn’t see anything wrong with them!
Good to hear! Enjoy them!

This is going to be a group effort to make the rules for the contest. I have picked the randomizer word.   The first three people will add the word RULE and then add a rule that is only one sentence long as a top-level post. Only the first three responses should be rules.  I have replied thank you to the first three rules that count.  Everyone else must follow all three rules and include the randomizer to be considered.  The first three rule makers will each receive about $5 prize for helping.  The winner chosen by the randomizer must have followed all three rules or they will be excluded and another will be chosen.    Winner receives about $10 gift.  This contest will end in 12 hours.  The randomizer word is *Rulemakers*  [Contest is closed.]
Rule one: Don't be a doo doo head
RULE is to make a joke using the word paradise
Rule - State your favorite animal.
1) I solemnly swear I will not be a doo doo head. Not today. Not tmw, not ever!!  2) what do dogs call the shelter-in-place mandate? Paradise. Get it? No? Bc their owners have to be home w them all the time? I know I’m HORRIBLE at jokes! 😂 3) favorite animal is of course a dog!!   Rulemakers !!!  Now let’s get this party going!!  u/space_noodlers u/neongreenpurple u/hexbags
My favorite animal is a cat.   *Where did Mr. Monopoly go for vacation?* A Hawaiian paradise! >!(Get it? Pair a’ dice?)!<  Rulemakers  Thank you very much for hosting this lovely contest! ✨💛
Rulemakers   What is the motto of an ice cream shop in paradise?   >!Heaven Ice Day!!<  My favorite animal is the kangaroo or capybara.
I won't.  What is paradise for a mouse? A 2 ton block of swiss cheese. (Bad joke.)  Cat.  Rulemakers
Rulemakers   My favourite animal is a giraffe :)  What do members of Coldplay use to play boardgames?  pair o’ dice (paradise!)
Rulemakers  Yay this contest idea is so fun!   My favourite animal is definitely a dog... I hope to have two one day soon.   Joke (this was so hard!):   "Dad, what was Adam's mother-in-law called?"    >!"He didn't have one, because he lived in paradise"!<
1.  I wouldn’t dream of it.  2.  My husband asked me if I’ll ever stop quoting Gangsta’s Paradise. Me: The way things are going, I don’t know.  3.  Bears!!!  Rulemakers
1. Certainly not!  2. I'm living in paradise!... somebody's paradise, but definitely not mine! ;P  3. the Quokka! (those little guys smiling in New Zealand!  Rulemakers.
Thanks, Rulemakers!  1) I’ll do my doody....I mean, duty.  2) Did you know the whole thing about D&D players not going to heaven is true? It’s because there’s no such thing as a D&D player who only wants a single paradise.  3) My favorite animal is extinct. It’s called the Gastric Brooding Frog, and there’s literally basically a Jurassic Park science-style experiment going on to bring it back to life. I hope it succeeds, because they were cool little guys. Of animals that are NOT extinct, I’m gonna have to say jellyfish, because we literally do not understand how they’re alive. They’re basically floating sacs of tissue with a few nerves in them. They don’t have brains, hearts, or stomachs, and their eyes are.....not what we consider eyes at all, as laypeople. Like scientists agree jellyfish have some kind of visual organ, but it doesn’t work the way other species’ eyes do. It’s wild.

Rulemakers  What did the gambling addict always dream of at night? Paradise!   My favorite animal is the red panda!
Rule makers   Q: "Dad, what was the name of Adam's mother in law?" A: "He didn't have a mother in law, son, because he lived in paradise"  ^ note that this joke is silly to me because I have a very nice mother in law lol!  My favourite animal is the gorilla :)

He ate more food in one day than most people eat in a week. He was roomy and comfy and spent most of his time sitting or laying down, so I didn't even NOTICE the outside world!, it was absolute paradise!". The other tapeworm responds "So why did you leave?", The first worm replies "Sadly, he really liked eating Mexican food!"  3. My favourite animal is a panda!  Rulemakers <3 <3

*Rulemakers*    I will not be a doo doo head    Why is John Milton terrible at game nights?  Because whenever he comes you end up with a paradise lost.  My fav animal is a fox
Rulemakers  I will never be a doo doo head!    My favorite animal is a sea otter!    Here's a joke with the word Paradise in it:  A Catholic priest, a Buddhist monk, and an atheist walk into a restaurant.  After they put in their orders, the three strike up a conversation about what they believe awaits them in the afterlife.  The priest says, "I try to live my life according to God's word, so that I may go to the good Lord in heaven and live in paradise for all of eternity. I do not curse, I forgive freely, and I pray continually However, I know I am a sinner at heart, and I deserve to burn in hell like the rest of us."  The atheist replies, "Don't worry, that's probably bullshit. There is nothing waiting for us after death, only the void and nothingness. That's why I try to live my life to the fullest."  The two of them ask the monk, who had been silent up to that point, what he believed. The monk started, "Well, I certainly won't be seeing the afterlife anytime soon. I have lived a bad life, however, I am trying to earn enough good karma to reincarnate into a better life. If I earn enough good karma, then maybe I can eventually go to the afterlife."  "Well how are you supposed to do that?" asked the atheist.  Just then, the group is interrupted by the waitress with their meals. For the priest, there is a meal of bread and wine. For the atheist, a hearty plate of ribs sits in front of him. For the monk, there is nothing but a slice of cake on his plate.  In response to two puzzled looks, the monk quickly says, "There's no easier way to earn karma than to have a cake day."
1. I will not.   2. I once took a bus to a far away town. My destination was Paradise, but my bus had to take an overnight stop in Rock Bottom. Still haven’t made it out.   3. My favorite animal is a penguin!  Thanks rulemakers
I love this!   1. Of course! :)   2. I went on vacation expecting a paradise, but instead all I got was a dusty room with a paramice! ;)   3. My fav animal is an otter!   Rulemakers!   Thanks for hosting! :)
Thanks rulemakers and OP for this unique contest!!  1. 😇🥰  2. Two of us washed up on a desert island, the only survivors of a shipwreck.  "There's no animals here but there's plenty of fruit and plants," said the other bloke, "this is Paradise because I'm vegan."  He laughed and said, "You'll have to become vegan too."  "No, I won't," I said, as I picked up a rock  3. Pandas!
Rulemakers  1. I have never been one and I don't intend to become one so I think we're good haha  2. What do people in Hawaii use to play monopoly? A paradise! (Get it? Paradise=pair of dice! I know, it's bad but I tried lol)  3. My favorite animal is elephants! 🐘 I love them 😊

These are beautiful! I love that he puts them on his apron! I might do the same! I’ve been trying to figure other ways to use my pins! Cause I have so many without a home! 💜
That cat pin is ADORABLE!!
A pile of cats!
The stack o cats! How cuteeee!  Those cat butts tho :)))))
Everyone loves the cats, but that Cowboy Beebop pin is bomb.
Cowboy bebop yesss
Aww that’s sick!! Great taste in anime too, Cowboy bebop is one of my favourites 🥰
waaoh awesome! 🌸
I love the cat one!!
We have these canvas art aprons and I've always loved pins but I have this thing against knick-knacks, so I was like, until we decide where ALL the pins go, I refuse to start collecting them. So we decided our canvas aprons were perfect and now we both have a collection (very different ones at that lol)
My goal is to get all of them bc I want Ein on my art apron lol
Hahah that’s pretty awesome! They don’t get too heavy with all the pins on them do they?
Nope! They are already a thick material and they tie at the waist and the neck so nothing is pulling really
Awesome! I think I’ma do the same! I’ve recently started to really like these pins and I have like 5 now so it’s good to have an idea of where to put them
