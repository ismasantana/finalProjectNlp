We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say "PM me anytime" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


"PM me anytime" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say "PM me" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.

I have no desire to get up earlier and do something with my day even though if I could force myself I’d probably feel better. 

It starts to get dark within an hour of waking up usually and it’s so depressing but it keeps me isolated in my “comfort zone” 

Being up in the middle of the night feels freeing for some reason, no one awake, no guilt for responsibilities, I can sleep away the day and not feel guilty about it.

But I’m wasting time and I want more than anything to feel okay again. I want to start to get my life back to something that I can derive some genuine enjoyment out of and move forward with productive things. 

I became depressed again about 10 months ago since my mom passed and these past 10 months have gone by so fast, I’m almost 26 and I’m scared at how fast time is moving without any stability forming in my life. 

I’m 25 and I feel like I’m wasting time, which I am. But it’s so hard to even attempt to start getting my life in order. 

It feels so far out of reach

My anxiety ate me alive this morning I felt awful and fought with my parents about it. They told me to kill myself so after panicking I took my jacket and left my home. I went to the nearest bridge and sat there with my legs out of the bridge, over the water. For the first time I was completely calm. Every other time I attempted I was as scared as hell and that was the reason I couldn’t go trough with it. Probably I would have done it this time. Instead a woman grabbed me from behind and took me back to the bridge. She even took me home scared that I would try again. I don’t even know how I should feel. I don’t know anything anymore

Edit: I wrote this post in the heat of the moment but I just wanted to tell you that my parents really love me, it was just a difficult situation I didn’t know how to calm myself and they didn’t know either. It just degenerated but I know they did not mean it, not even a word. When I came back they were terrified that I could have really killed myself, they were really happy to have me back with them.

the only thing I look forward to is sleeping, I feel like when I'm in bed all my responsibilities go away and I feel somewhat safe. when I'm not in bed I just feel so tired, I don't have the energy to do anything, but I have to, I have to put up the image that everything is okay, because its easier to suffer alone than be a burden on everyone.

When I think of foods that are nutritiously sound, ugh it just sounds awful. Having to go out. Go to the store. Make food. But then again... I know my weakness is junk food. I lost all this weight, and I won’t let depression convince me to gain it back! But fuck... it’s hard. 

Anyone else relate to this?

I've tried, for the past 10 years I've heard people tell me things get better, but they don't.

I've been going to therapy for the past 3 years, and I still can't move forward. I have skills in web development, but nodody gives me a chance, and there's a 15 years blank in my resume so they're not even trying.

And for relationship, I've concluded that I'm a despicable ugly anomaly that's not worth it.

Today I've considered killing myself, but I'd fail that too, I went outside and screamed, and went back home to bed, where I've been for the past week...


[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l04sxc/im_actually_doing_ok/
I've been suffering from depression, anxiety and borderline disorder for years, I've always wanted to be an artist, but never thought my work was good enough, never been happy with it, I think I stopped drawing for like 5 years because of it, plus all the shit I've been through, stalked, treatened, I never really been in a good place. Always thought that the only things that made me happy, watching a cartoon and thinking about a moment for weeks or playing a game and being proud of defeating a difficult boss, were stupid and meant nothing.

Back in 2019 I had a job at a gaming bar as a cook, I do love to cook, but the job was exhausting and was stressing me out really bad (and honestly, even today I think I wasn't good at the job, not in the quality of my food, but as a professional), and it was being really hard on me, plus all the trauma and problems I've had for years, but I didn't want to say anything because my mom was really proud of me for finally landing a job.

Unfortunately, it took the best of me and I tried to kill myself. I lost he job because of it and tried again a few months later.

I ended up drowing in debts, I always used video games as an escape and always had a compulsion when it came to buy them, so I sucked my cards dry to buy stuff, as the year ended, I had no job and 3k in debts (roughly 1.5k American Dolars, I belive, wich may not seem much, but for someone who had no job and was still living under my mom's wings was devastating).

I was feeling really bad, but decided to ignore it, we had a family trip to Japan early 2020 (a bit before the quarentine hit) so I decided to not worry about it and just enjoy the trip.

It was well, but I couldn't stop thinking about my financial problems, how I shouldn't be there (my mom paid for the entire trip) and my mom eventually found out, I hid my financial problems from her for months, so I was really stressed out.

But the trip was actually an amazing thing for me.

It was something that I've always wanted to do, since the first time I watched Spirited Away as a kid, that movie was the beginning of my love for japanese culture and the reason I wanted to become an artist, and I never thought I'd actually be there.

The first feel days were ok, it was really nice, but my mind was still on my problems.

On like the 4th day we went to a Seven Eleven to buy some food and the cashier saw us speaking portuguese (we're brazilian) and asked us in portuguese if we were also brazilian and we said yes and started talking.

She said she had been living in Japan for 15 years and it had been years that she hadn't seen her family or even spoke portuguese with anyone, she was literally shaking that some random brazilian showed up at the store and was neraly crying because she loved hearing her native language again and be reminded of her family.

That was the first sweet thing that happened there.

We visited a lot of places, it was everything incredibly beatiful, everyone was super gentle and really nice to us. 

On our last week on the country we spent in Tokyo.

The first night we were there we got a recommendation from our Hostel to try a sushi restaurante near it. The restaurant was owned by the sweetest elderly couple, he the sushiman and his wife helped him. They had this wall with poster signed by people from several coutries who visited, so the wife asked us to sign and my brother (who knows a little japanese from his classes) told her that we were a family, a mother, an older sister and a younger brother. We spent the whole night talking to them, the man knew a little english, it was a bit broken but we could understand him, but his wife knew little to none english. Everytime he asked us something and we couldn't properly understand his wife would grab something to show us what he meant, like when he asked where we were from but we didn't understand and she grabbed a globe to show us. We started talking how me and my brother are a fan of japanese animation and his wife quickly went inside and brought us a Hello Kitty plushie, I thought that she was just showing us but she handed the doll to me and said "present" (in that broken english that we often see in anime), I couldn't believe it, that woman, who never met me, we didn't even speak the same language, gave me a plushie because I said I loved japanese animation (I'm not even a Hello Kitty fan, but you can bet I accepted it). That plushie is one of my prized posessions today.

Fast foward a few days, we were in Tokyo so I asked if we could go to the Pokémon Center. I've been a HUGE Pokémon fan my entire life, seriously, my love for Pokémon is immense, so I couldn't pass the oportunity to visit the Pokémon Center while I was in Japan. I was hoppinh with excitement as we made our way and once we got there... I saw those walls painted with Pokémons, a giant Snorlax Clock  in the center, a wall with Pokémon game timeline, I was literally crying with hapiness, I've never been that happy my entire life, I was like that Blastoise kid from that meme. As we were cashing out our itens my mom looked at me, saw how fraking happy I was (note that my mom, even thought I love her very much and she loves me very much, always critized me for being an adult who loves Pokémon and said I should grow up, and I've told her countless times that cartoons and video games were the only thing that made me happy were stupid) and said "See? I don't get it why this makes you so happy, but if does it's not stupid. Life is mostly made of small things that makes us happy, so don't you think it's worth living to see those little things?". That day something started to click on me.

We went to visit Mount Fuji, wich is one of the most beautiful sights I've ever witnessed, seriously it doesn't even look real, it looks like the sky is a giant windows screen saver (matrix confirmed?) and went biking, we nearly got lost but and elderly woman, who didn't speak english, showed us the way (who said that we need to know someone's language to communicate?).

Once the trip ended, I was thinking about what my mom had said to me. We made a woman day just by speaking portuguese with her for a few minutes, they were very gentle with us and they even gave us some presents while we were there and I never been happier, it was a dream come true, so I came back home with a mindset "I'm gonna try again".

I sit back home and started to draw and I didn't need hours of thinking (rather, oberthinking) to draw something I just did it and I liked it, I actually enjoyed the process and I enjoyed what I made... it was the first time in years.

But I still had my debts to deal with. Altought the pandemic was, and still is, a very bad event that we are going through (and should not be taking lightly, and for all of you who are suffering direct or indirect consequences from it, I wish you all the luck, it's okay to not be okay during this times, we're here for each other) everything closed up, including schools. One of my mom's cousins wanted to find an art class for her son, but everything was closed, so her aunt suggested that I'd give him some lessons. I was really nervous, I never been a teacher before, and even though I was happy with my art it was still not the point I wanted to achieve, but I gave it a try.

I ended up loving teaching, my students are very happy and evolving so fast and the big irony is I realized I knew a lot, I mean A LOT of stuff about art, I just didn't used because I was so afraid of failing.

Some of my students, who don't even take classes anymore, because of schedules, even recommended me to others, without me asking, because they loved my classes so much.

Today I have 5 students, give classes 5 days a week, paid my debts and in 3 weeks from today I'll be moving out of my mother's house (I'm 26, turning 27 in June) back to my home town, where my family and friends are, paying my own rent, caring for myself while doing what I love doing. I'm also saving to buy a new badass PC to work better with my students and play better games with my friends (I only own a laptop right now, it's good but it's not perfect for my job). I sold a lot of things that I was hoarding and I'm ready to enter a new chapter in my life.

That trip to Japan changed something in me.

I don't think I beat depression and watnots, but I'm most certanly learning how to live with it. I still have really bad days and fear that I might have a breakdown someday, but I'm trying my best everyday, I'm seeing things differently. I'll always carry my scars but I'm proud to say that I had a pretty bad day last year and instead of harming myself, like I've done before, I sat on my chair and drew a nice illustration that I really enjoyed.

Thank you so much for everyone that read this all the way through. I know that things aren't easy, and you don't have to feel bad for not being able to handle it, but if you can find something that makes you happy, even if small, it gets easier.

I hope you all have a wonderful day and if you don't, I hope that you are able to get through it.

And don't feel bad if you can't handle things right now, it's alright, tou have the right to do nothing when things aren't ok.

I know death is inevitable. I know that the best thing I can do is to cherish the time I have with my mother. To make her feel loved and cared for. To listen to her stories. To hear about her day. To just be there for her. But everyday I cry myself to sleep thinking of her dying. It’s every single day. I cannot imagine my life without her. I cannot imagine her getting any older. I don’t know what to do about this sadness. I feel like these thoughts are impeding my functioning in an extremely unhealthy way. I will just be talking to my mom and she’ll see me start tearing up as she’s talking for almost no apparent reason. I’ll look at her cheeks, see the wrinkles forming, and the tears just well up. And I feel so bad just crying in front of her telling her I’m scared to lose her because I feel it only takes away from her happiness. I don’t know what to do but I’m really fighting over here. I just need some help, some perspective, anything to help me accept this morose reality.










[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l03jdt/my_life_ended_at_28/
Wall of text incoming.

So I went to college trying to be like everyone else. My co-op experience was truly awful. Now that I'm working full time I can see how awful the situation my supervisor put me into was. He created a hellhole for me where I couldn't succeed at all, and every step I tried to take was ridiculed. My coworkers treated me like the plague and gradually I didn't feel alright anymore. The great thing about it all? He won. There's nothing I can do to erase what happened anymore. At the tender age of 28 I'm officially screwed. This happened to me 5 years ago, and there's no way to actually fix this situation.

When I went back to the same college that had screwed me harder than anyone ever had things weren't okay at all anymore. Those 6 months led me to become "cut off from the tribe" and I was lonelier than I've ever felt in my entire life. Everything hurt, and hurt in a way that cut me down to my very soul. You know what the fucking great thing is? When I went back I got rejected for so many co-op opportunities at my school that I started to give up. I had no real friends, and since that point I wouldn't even consider asking a girl out. I was dying on the inside, and it was long before I began to fail/withdraw from classes because I didn't feel like a human anymore. I was just a zombie walking around.

You know what my dumbass did? I went to my "student counseling center" to try to seek help. All I wanted was for there to be some sort of path for me to feel "normal" again. When society rejects you and makes you feel horrible you'll do anything to try to feel okay again. I went a year and a half trying antidepressants & therapy and none of it helped. None of it helped me feel any better. You know what the fantastic part of all of this? In spite of that now I have medical records of depression. I weaned myself off Effexor years ago but the medical records still exist. I just wanted someone to talk to...anyone. If I knew then what I know now, I would have never tried at all.

Do you know what awaited me when I graduated and got my useless degree? I got rejected from multiple jobs. It was horrible being rejected for jobs I was overqualified for. I ultimately ended up working at a small bank, something that didn't even fit my personality at all. I got fired from that job for telling a joke (not kidding either), which I guess you can chalk up to me being socially inept if you were looking for somewhere to park blame. I'm not exactly seeking sympathy here. Afterward, I got the privilege of driving 50 miles a day to another job that treated me like dirt. After 6 months of that I finally got a decent post grad gig. I tried to reintegrate into society using this job, but honestly these past few weeks have been harsh. The past trauma I've experienced is awful enough; I'll never be okay again.

To make matters even better, I come from absolutely nothing. I took out more than 100K of student loans to attend an institution which very nearly made me commit suicide & my credit card debt at points would have made Dave Ramsey have a heart attack. I literally paid to get tortured by people who hated the very idea that I could even exist. I didn't even attend my own fucking college graduation because I was hurting so much. The emotional pain I've endured in my 20s is so bad that it's left permanent scars that will never, ever go away.

Even though I stayed stable through the pandemic & continued to work it's not the same. I got back into the same bastard institution for grad school and even with a free ride & an excellent job I'm miserable. I paid off the credit cards and am making headway on my student loans, but it doesn't fucking matter anyway. I'm so far behind other people socially now that all I can do is think about what made me this way in the first place. I get to be the moronic weirdo living with his parents at 28 since I have to save every dollar I can to pay back the loan sharks. I can't even join the military or do something to change my circumstances because my dumbass decided to seek "help". You know how wonderful it is to hear that even though this happened years ago that the slightest medical record makes me ineligible to even join the military? It fucking makes me feel awful.

I guess the real reason I'm writing this is that I just wanted someone to know that I existed. In spite of everything, I just wanted someone to know that I was a person just like you. I wanted friends & to build a life of some sort just like everyone else. Knowing I will never have that no matter how much effort I put forth is fantastic. My 28 years on this planet was (and will continue to be) just a series of failures.

I'm done.

Edit: not suicidal. Just acknowledging the obvious at this point. The things I want aren't achieveable; not now, not in the past, and certainly not in the future.










[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l007ax/i_fucking_hate_everything/
I hate my friends, family, and my life even. During middle school, I was bullied until mental breakdowns each day for 2 years, and do you know what my family and my consulers said "suck it up", or some shit like that. And after middle school, my family didn't have the guts to call a therapist, even when i was showing signs of depression and suicidal thoughts. I am in 11th grade and I am being affected by mental problems because of the bullying. I hate my friends because all of them betrayed me and when false accusations of me being a "fascist", a "racist", etc came from my bullies. All my "friends" told me to fuck off and kill myself. They even told my secrets to everyone. Do you know what its like to have everyone in your life betray you? 

I have depression, mood swings, anger issues, dark thoughts like murder, suicidal thoughts, paranoid, etc. 


Right fucking now, I have a "family" that thinks every thing wrong with me is video games fault. Video games were the only reason why I didn't end myself. It helped me feel important during a lot of dark parts of my life.

Hey guys. I'm 26 yo and for the past few years I've been dealing with depression, last month I decided to change my lifestyle,  eating healthy, workout, meditate and more. I did it for 20 days I felt sort of happy but just ONE little stupid thing was enough for me to go back. I feel worthless, I hate myself, the only thing that makes me not wanna do it is my mom and my sister ... I feel everything I do is for other people... I don't want anything for myself ... I donno it's 4 in a morning and I am crying to Toy story 1 soundtrack , I think back then I was happy ... will I ever feel normal again? I am tired of sleeping and doing nothing for all day ...

I’m fucking miserable all of the time. I’m simply playing different parts that other people want me to play. Loving daughter, funny friend, good student. I don’t care about any of it. 

I feel like a robot or an alien or something. It’s like I have some vague idea of what a human in supposed to do and behave like, but I feel empty inside. 

I’m not interested in new hobbies or changing degrees or doing something valuable with my life. I’m basically just existing. Nothing I’ve done has worked to help me recover from my mental illness, and I’ve begun to accept the reality that I’ll live this way forever. 

I’m tired of living my life for other people. I wish they’d all just leave me alone and let me wither away in peace.








[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l021kb/exhausted/
Hi all. My wife has been struggling with depression and anxiety for a few years now, and we've had some incredibly dark times, the worst being when I had to talk her out of committing suicide over the phone while I was in a different country with work a few years ago. 

I won't give you all the grisly details of how bad it's been over the last 6 years or so but emotionally, I'm exhausted and it's taking its toll both physically and mentally on me. I feel so selfish talking about my own feelings when she's in such a bad way but I can't see any end to it, and we've tried so many things. Without divulging our whole life to you but I'm her entire support network and having to be relentlessly positive, even when I'm feeling this bad is getting harder by the day.

I don't even know what I'm asking for here or if I'm just trying to let off steam but I really don't know where this ends. This is absolutely dominating both of our lives. I'm starting to have some pretty bad thoughts myself and the last few years have my life just seem to be a joyless blur. Do people really fully get over their depression? Hers only seems to have gotten worse. I'm starting to feel resentful now and I don't want that. I guess any chat or advice would help.

Thanks.

It’s with you when the phone rings and you’re too frightened to answer it.

It’s with you when you look into the eyes of those you love, and your eyes prick with tears as you try, and fail, to remember how to love them. 

It’s with you as you search within for those now eroded things that once made you who you were: your interests, your creativity, your inquisitiveness, your humor, your warmth.

And it’s with you as you wake terrified from each nightmare and pace the house, thinking frantically of how you can escape your poisoned life.

One of the most relatable descriptions of depression I have ever read.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l08l62/ive_spent_the_past_10_mins_typing_here_then/
I don't know how to describe what I'm feeling. When I want to let it out it's like it stops at my throat but won't go any further. I'm so exhausted, confused, lost, nostalgic, extremely EXTREMELY nostalgic, empty and lonely. And it all amounts to a pain I feel in my throat, numbness in my body, pressure behind my eyes. 

I wish there wasn't a lockdown and I didn't cut all my 'friends' off. I wish I kept them around just for the sake of never being alone, like I always pushed myself to do. I really want a hug, I want to be around them. I need a hug.

Today was the day I new was coming but didn't want to face it. I have been feeling so down and in the dumps lately. I have been finding no joy in anything, I have to be high all day to even get through the day, I called out of work for the second day in a row. I can't seem to get my brain out of this funk. I have dealt with my depression for 5 years now and I know how to still bring myself to do things I know I should do like shower, eat, clean, breath. 

I live with my girlfriend and I told her I would take the Christmas tree down this weekend and I did that today. I made a really great and nutritious breakfast, wrote a few things, and even cleaned the kitchen. Im functioning but I'm not happy I feel like a robot. I can feel the constant lump of tears in my throat waiting and wanting to explode out of me. I can't seem to take my mind out of this empty state of sadness no matter what I try to do, I always zone out. I tried to watch some anime but I wasn't able to focus, tried to listen to some music still couldn't focus. I could only focus for so long on my writing until I got distracted. 

I feel like I was so accomplished today, I scheduled everything out, and met all my goals for the day but still feel so incomplete. The way I am feeling right now is complete shit. I can feel the anger of why can't I just be happy festering inside my chest, I can feel the melancholic cloud over my head. I tried to take care of myself today, I took a shower, did a great face care routine, got into cozy clothes, made a great breakfast, smoked, but all I can focus on right now is when is it acceptable to start drinking or can I go to sleep right now and hope that my girlfriend doesn't bother me too much. I have done everything I know to do to help with my depression but none of it is working. Which I know, that's usually not how it goes. When I usually get into these funks I am usually able to pull myself out of it but this one seems to have me by my throat and isn't letting go. 

I feel like the universe was trying to tell me this was coming in the following weeks to this weekend. I was so tired, no matter how much I slept I was always tired. I wasn't very hungry and my anxiety was so high. I got into arguments with my girlfriend over the smallest things. But I just kept going because what else am I to do. 

I know that I will get through this but I just haven't felt this down in awhile and its starting to really consume everything I think, everything I do or don't do, and everything I decide to do. Its becoming debilitating and I am TIRED. I just want to sleep for 4 days. I feel like my head is stuck in this dark, stormy cloud and my ears are filled with static and my eyes are too heavy with exhaustion to keep them open. I can't think straight, like a constant tornado in my thoughts. Everything is so hard to accomplish right now.

Does anyone else have pretty much all physical symptoms of depression? I feel weak and drained most of the time. Had tons of blood work done, all fine. I had some major life changes, and I never feel happy but in my mind it’s because I’m feeling bad physically. It started after having my first child, and it’s been a year and a half and the feeling never goes away completely & keeps coming back. Does this sound like depression? Anyone else have mostly physical symptoms? It’s like the weak feeling of when you have the flu.

Yeah Im not gonna dare to have kids. I have both sides of generational trauma and I'm not spreading that shit. Idk if my brothers going to have kids, honestly I kind of hope he doesn't. Our family has physically healthly genes but holy shit has no one been mentally stable in a while. My parents set me up with their shit and were like "why are you depressed and bipolar even though we are both super emotional and irrational people?" 

Anyways but high functioning anyone? \U0001f44b
I just do the old "lol I'm depressed \U0001f60c\u270c\ufe0f" even though I wanna die 100x over.

Sometimes i wish i could see what would happen if i wasnt here, what my loved ones would say. Who would care, if they'd cry.. im so tired all the time, its so hard to enjoy anything at all. All i want is to know im loved and that people care, but it seems like no one tells eachother these things anymore. Growing up my parents never really said i love you, me & my siblings didnt either. Now its so uncommon it makes them uncomfortable. I just want to be told im loved and that i matter but in detail so i feel it from somebody significant in my life. Does anyone understand?

I fell asleep on the couch last night. I didn't want to move. I didn't have the energy really. I woke up this morning to my dog trying her hardest to play with me. That usually makes me somewhat happy but I felt so empty. I still do. 

I've been thinking about my own death a lot today. I was thinking maybe I'd be sad, or that the people around me would be sad. But I don't have people, and I'm not really against the idea of ending it. See, my friends all stopped talking to me. I got myself in some trouble a while ago, and I got hurt in the process. A couple of years later, and Im still in pain. My arm shakes, my back kills me. I have a hard time staying on my feet. That's not even what bothers me though. It's the shame I feel. The loss of my career, and my place in an institution that gave me a purpose. I don't have one anymore. I don't have friends, because I don't know how to talk to people. The friends I used to have all put me aside for people that fit thier lives better. So it's just me and my dog now. And I'm tired. 

I want to work so badly. I'm skilled, I'm qualified, I'm motivated. But nobody wants me. 134 job applications later and nobody wants me. I used to fix helicopters for pete's sake. I learn quick, I love to work, and keep my hands busy. But I have no opportunity. I can't even get a chance. I don't have felonies, hell even my misdemeanors are just charges and not convictions. 

I'm drug and alcohol free. I'm in shape, and average looking. But I lack the ability to speak to people. It terrifies me. If someone wants to talk to me, I always talk back but I can't start a conversation when I have nothing to talk about you know? Nothing interesting is happening in my life and my hobbies are not very popular. I can't take my dog anywhere because I can't afford the gas to go out. So I just stay in. I clean, I cook, I watch tv. I reach out to my old friends but nobody replies. I tried internet dating but that's been a major blow to my self esteem so I just kinda gave up on that avenue.

I'm tired. I'm so out of energy that I can't even feel sad. I thought about how I would kill myself all day today. I thought I would feel upset about the end but it seems like the light at the end of the tunnel at this point. Why do I have this life if I can't do anything with it? I crave social interaction, but am not invited into it. I crave love but don't have any to give. I crave work, but nobody will let me.

I can't turn it around. I've tried. I'm so deeply in debt and am completely crippled socially. But I'm tired of wasting away inside away from happiness. My dog keeps me alive because she deserves the love I have left. But what happens when she's gone? I certainly will be out of my remaining purpose. 

I just want to go to sleep and stay asleep. It would be so much easier than waking up angry that I did. 

Anyway, today is almost over. Tomorrow is a new day. Maybe I'll find something tomorrow.

Tl;dr - I'm just venting. You don't have to read it.

I want this post to be honest and truthful. My painful account of what happened in my life and how you can benefit from the lessons I've learned.

Neither my mother or my father worked, my father due to his illness, bipolar disorder and my mother due to her responsibility in caring for him. This resulted in there being absolutely no money coming into the household, we couldn't afford food and I'd often go on a slice of bread for the day. We really had nothing and I lived off of a diet of crackers, bread and whatever my mother could bring home with what she had scraped together in the evening. There really wasn't anything that I'd describe as stable in that house, everything was always in some kind of crises, including my parents. My father was hellishly neurotic at times thanks to his illness and my mother who could only really deal with one house fire at a time, would often try to escape from her reality through her care for me, forgoing whatever thing needed dealing with to offer me some love. Arguments would break out so fierce they'd cause my sister and I to scatter into our bedrooms. I'd often wrap my head in my pillow in an effort not to hear any of it. I've never revealed this to anyone but even at a young age, I cried myself to sleep every night. Although I was young, I knew something wasn't right and there wasn't much I could do to change any of it. I wanted to change things and I'd sometimes brave confronting my parents in their arguments, trying stop them, which would only result in me becoming the target. My sister and I never talked about any of this, we'd quietly deal with it on our own.

Looking up at the same four walls that had held me in my prison for fifteen years, I cried, as I did, every night. I can still remember this particular night well, this was a particularly brutal one. When I cried, I tried to do it as discretely as possible, my parents however, knew I cried because I was awful at hiding it. Sometimes I'd randomly break down and cry when getting yelled at, simply unable to cope with the treatment, which would earn an even worse scalding. As I looked up at those walls, an impending sense of inescapability struck me as I cried worse than any time before. *Will I ever get out of this?* Suicide had entered my mind often enough that I developed a mechanism to deal with it, I had to believe that there was a different reality, something better for me, that comitting suicide would be admitting that there was no other option. I asked myself, instead. *How do I get out of this?* What little things can I do to crawl out of this situation. It seemed daunting, I came up with an analogy to describe the task in front of me. I'd have to crawl out of hell and then be greeted by everest... I had my room which I could influence, beyond that, it was utter chaos but if I could make my tiny little corner of hell worth living in, then there would be hope.

At school, I'd often sleep through my classes because I'd been up all night crying. My teachers never knew the extent of the problem, some of them offered some concern whilst others treated me as another problem child. All of the turmoil at home meant that I became a bit of an outcast and that's when the bullying began. I simply had no energy left in me to fight it and I often just let them bully me, although it was awful, it wasn't nearly as bad as what I was dealing with at home. One day in class, the tables were arranged in a U shape, perfectly positioned for the entire class to see what was about to unfold. One boy who was much larger than me came up behind me, put me in a headlock and bashed my head of the table. As I said above, I had a habit of crying when I simply couldn't handle any more treatment and I burst out into tears, a habit that eventually carried on to become panic attacks. Everyone watched, no one did anything. I was fighting a battle on two fronts, at school I was bullied every single day and I'd go home to the whirlwind of abuse and chaos that awaited me. *It was hell.*

I stumbled across a book that would change my life, up until that point, I had barely read and I would hardly say I was literate but from a random search on philosophy, I discovered "Letters From a Stoic" and would find in it's wisdom a philosophy that spoke directly to what I was going through. As much as I struggled to read it, it felt like Seneca himself was writing the letters to me. I could not yet change my situation but I could certainly learn to deal with it until I could. Paired with a drive to fix my tiny little corner of the world, I would lay on my uncomfortable old bed in my clean, organised room and I would read. I can honestly say, those moments were some of the best I've ever had. After all those years of struggle and pain, just simply lying on my bed with an organised room and a line that seperated me from the chaos, brought me immense joy and I remember those moments fondly, I even remember one day when I lay on my bed reading with the sun coming through my ruined old blinds and finding a sense of calm in it. Seneca proved to be great company at that time and I read those letters multiple times. It was still however, an immense task to get out of this situation and I knew it. Driven by stoic philosophy, I put my head down and just got on with it. I simply put up with any and all chaos that would come up, so long as I knew that I was making progress towards where I wanted to be. Until I could afford to feed myself, I made do with what I could find and was grateful nonetheless. Reading Stoic philosophy allowed me to understand that I had a agency over how I could react to my situation. That no matter how bad my environment was, I would always have my reaction to it and I could choose to be ambivelent if I couldn't make a difference to my situation at that time and as long as I was making an effort every day, that was enough.

This whole journey really was like crawling out of hell only to be greeted by everest, I got out of that situation but was greeted with a greater but different battle to fight in dealing with my trauma. I have nonetheless, arrived at the place I was seeking when I looked up at those four walls.

The truth is now, everest doesn't seem that bad compared to what I was going through before and whilst everyone else who hasn't gone through hell, seems to look at the journey in front of them with fear and trepidation, I simply plod along, as I always have done and enjoy the 'easy' terrain.

**If you are going through hell right now, know that it has a purpose, the challenges that most people will crumble at, will seem trivial compared to what you have gone through and you will be able to lead those people forward. You aren't just important, you are vital to everyones future and you will find that people look to you in moments of crisis and you'll be able to turn to them and say, "not to worry, I've been here before".**

**So stick at it, keep trying every day and I promise you will succeed.**

I'm not okay and I'm tired of pretending I am. I've never talked about my problems to anybody because I feel like telling them would just burden them. I hate myself. I have a voice in my head that's constantly telling me that I'm worthless and should just disappear. I can't do it anymore. My expectations for my own capabilities have gone too far I went from a happy go lucky kid to the mindset of "If it's not perfect it's not good enough". I'm scared to tell people. I know I need help but I can't reach out and ask for it. Would it really be that bad if I was to disappear?

The knowledge that I’m shitty and ugly and I don’t belong here and I don’t deserve anything good. Sometimes I forget. Hell, sometimes it doesn’t even bother me that much. But I can never escape that; separate myself from that. I will always be worthless, no matter what gilded jewels may be placed on my crown of shit.  I try to fit in but I will never belong. I will never be one of them. I’m a square peg trying to squeeze into the round hole. I can wear the flowery pink dress or I can drop a fuckton of weight, but nobody will ever see me as more than garbage. I look like it, I smell like it, so I must be it.  

I fooled myself into thinking I was fine. I take the pills and I have my routine and have the pets and the husband that make me feel like maybe I can have some kind of a future. But it’s an illusion. Because sooner or later it will be taken from me, or through some typical dumbfuck actions that I will idiotically make, I will lose them. And I don’t deserve them, so why should I have them? I should be alone. I should crawl into a fucking hole and die.  

I thought somehow I was growing up, growing out of this seemingly eternal phase. I thought I was winning the fight and overcoming the dark cloud and rising above it all. But I wasn’t. I was just sampling the kind of life that real people have. A life for people that aren’t fucking garbage pieces of shit like me. Boy was I really blinded by how shiny and pretty that life looked. But it’s not meant for me to touch. I’m meant to writhe in the filth like the little worm I am. Doomed to a longing that cuts so profoundly that every other sense goes numb.  

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to care anymore, I don’t want to think anymore. I wish there was a peaceful way to end this but at the same time I feel like I deserve all the pain I get. Perhaps it’s good that I’m practically invisible. It means nobody will notice when I’m gone.

I have been at my current job for three years today and I can't explain how much I hate it. I've been doing the same ish thing for 3 years, but I've also been working alongside projects that helped me build skills for future internal jobs (that clearly hasnt helped).

Despite having worked on pretty big projects basically probono, I didn't get either internal job I applied for (even though the projects were essentially those jobs).

I haven't felt this low in a long time. I feel like I've just let myself down, I'm a failure, and I have nothing to live for. I can't get another job and I'm stuck in the one I hate where it's full of confrontational people all the time. The job has annihilated my mental health.

To make matters worse, I am losing my hair, I hate how I look, I am socially isolated because of COVID, and my partner works away 5 days a week so I barely get to see him. I'm alone all the time and I feel stuck in this horrible situation that is my life and I just wonder what the point is.

The one thing I focused on before that kept me positive was our wedding day, but that's unlikely to happen due to COVID.

I am just so angry at life and the fact that other people are luckier than I am. I've studied and worked really hard, and I'm always the one who struggles the most. All my friends who have wealthy families don't do any of this and things just get handed to them on a plate.

I'm just so tired.

Im living in Finland with my dad and my mother lives in Estonia with my sister and a brother. Recently I visited them for 2weeks and been visiting them for the last 3 years as I only visit them 2 times a year since of school and work. Well I came back home today and been feeling sad because of the fun things we did together and memories. My step dad (who lives with my mother) is also a cool guy. Basically I have 2 homes. The thing is that everytime I come back after visiting my mother and friends I feel like shit and sad for a whole month. Even though I know I will see them again in the summer and this might sound weird but my mom washed my hoodie the other day and when I came back home I smelled it and my eyes started watering. The smell just reminds me of my other home (where my mom lives)

My depression steals life from me. I look in the mirror and see a disgusting face, an overweight body, a failing student, a useless life, an unworthy girlfriend, a disappointment to my parents, and an empty shell. 

I can never feel confident about my face, body, and style. I'm terrified that I'm overweight, and that I'll never look good enough for anyone. This is what bugs me the most. I never feel pretty, I never feel comfortable, and the only way I'll go into public is if I'm wearing a full face of makeup and baggy clothes. I've had some people on reddit tell me I look okay, but I've had so many tell me I'm ugly and disgusting. I just want to feel okay for once, but I can't.

Everything's going to shit, I can't eat, I can't sleep, school is just frustrating, and impossibly hard, I don't talk to or play with friends in my free time like I used to,  I stay up all night, and my only happiness is temporary, when I eat things I know are unhealthy, like candy.

I go the entire day like a zombie, I'm just barely motivated enough to play games, let alone get work done.Every day, when I wake up, I feel so goddamn annoyed, that I can't stay in bed, that I can't remember anything, that I don't feel like doing anything, but my parental figures come screaming at me, shouting, telling me all about how I'm affecting their lives, how I need to go to school, because school is the most important fucking thing in the world.

I just go through the day like a slave, I can't muster enough willpower to feel angry, so I supress it all, come home, don't get anything done, internet shuts off at 10PM, but I'm not sleepy, so I lay in bed, annoyed at myself because I can't go to sleep, check the time, it's 5-7AM, and I'm just barely getting sleepy. I don't even know who to tell this to, who to call. I only have enough energy to do anything in the nights, and all the help lines are closed then. Who do I even call to ask for a therapist? I live in a small place, so is there even a therapist available? It's like I'm stuck in this loop, and the only thing that aleviates the pain of existing is playing games, the thing my parental figures are trying to prevent me from doing so much of.

Get off this subreddit if you're depressed. It sounds counterintuitive, but just do it. Seeing people who are going through the same thing as you is very comforting at first, but over time it instills a sense of hopelessness over time. That you're never going to get out of depression, because you're surrounded by so many people who are seemingly stuck.

If you're here to help, you are an angel. Take care of yourself.

If you're here for help, try not to linger here too long.

Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven speaks a lot about what I feel. Whenever someone asks me on how I view depression, I just tell them this.

Moonlight Sonata has 3 movements. I am imagining them as a three horizontal parallel lines (2nd movement on top, 1st mvmt on middle, 3rd mvmt on bottom).

The 1st movement sounds sad but in a calm manner. The type of sadness that you know will just past. That is what I feel all the time (except for the sadness that will eventually go away feeling if that makes sense because I know for sure this would be a long journey lol). Neutral but there are still "mild" high and loud parts, and also the low ones. Awhile ago, I realized that I don't really feel any emotions. I just dictate word per word to myself what should I feel and how should I react to a current situation then completely mask the hollowness with that instruction. That's why I see it as the middle line, neutral. I feel somehow safe here.

The 2nd movement sounds cheerful and joyful. Genuine happiness, but there are still hints of that sadness. This sounds like the moments I really want to enjoy. But there's a catch... it's the shortest one. :(

The 3rd movement sounds so heavy. Literally DUN DUN DUN DUN. There are times that your mind suddenly just want you to bring somewhere down there, really deep imaginary places. It's heavy on the chest and lots and lots of breakdowns without knowing why. AND without knowing why leads to overanalyzing everything that is happening in your life. That even the most trivial things become devastating. This is like how the sound (I don't know the right term) changes a lot of times. Different thoughts keep coming in to shred you. There are parts on this movement that you'll hear a bit of hope and sensing that you're almost there somewhere comforting, but then a second later, it's actually not. It just spiraled back to the shitty start. Also, this sounds raging and that's what I mostly feel towards myself while on this level, which is the third and lowest line on my imaginary horizontally parallel lines. Ones I'm here, it's so hard to come back up.

Moonlight Sonata has always been somehow calming for me and now I kinda figured out why. I guess the emotions left in me automatically connects to this music :D

like, i can hardly think of things to talk about anymore, because all i can think about is how bad i feel. and obviously i won't make a conversation about that. i fucking hate this. today is actually a better day though, which is why i started thinking about it. i realised that on better days, like today, while i'm still not happy, even i can see how pathetic i am most of the time. it sucks. i was extremely talkative and full of life before, idk when this even started. anybody else?

So yesterday I decided going to a techno party but the past few weeks I've been feeling like total shit, I do not care about my life at all, so I got wasted, no surprise, I just didn't want to feel anything and I wanted to forget about everything, I did coke, xanax and shrooms and just got completely lost, the next day I couldn't believe that I did those things because I usually know how to control myself and to say, the worst thing is that I don't regret it, I was so lost that all my problems dissapeared.

i want to end everything

this guy who told me he was interested in me and wanted a relationship with me back in december had become quite distant ever since i got upset when he cancelled on his plans to come out to see me (long distance type thing). i called him out on it and he went ghost, after a few days things went back to normal (or so i hoped, clearly they weren’t lol). the last month has been very turbulent. we went from texting and calling all day every day to texting maybe once a day on a good day and no more phone calls. he says it’s because he was off work when we were texting and calling constantly and now he’s too busy to do that which i get but i see him active on reddit on all the days he works, when he says he doesn’t have the time or energy. when i try to set aside a time to call he blatantly ignores me, he wants to avoid calling me like a plague. i don’t understand how things have changed so much from just a fucking month ago but i am done. 

the kicker is that a year and a half ago he blocked me on everything and we lost contact for a year due to an issue we were having back then. we’ve since reconnected and the first few months were amazing, he was so considerate and friendly and pretended that he actually cared about me and then nov/dec came and things got more heated, we expressed our feelings for each other and agreed to try out dating each other. about a week after that, no more, was when he canceled on his tentative plan to come out here. then things got shitty. long story short i feel like a complete fucking dumbass for even accepting him back into my life and falling for his bs a second time. 

i’m also devastated because we got in an argument due to his ignoring me for days at a time then gaslighting me into feeeling like the bad guy for calling him out on it. at this point my self-hatred is at an all-time high and i want to kill myself but also him. i want to watch him suffer. i obviously can’t get to him physically since he doesn’t live near me and i would never actually kill or hurt him physically but the desire is so strong. he hurt me so bad, he ignored my calls and voicemails where i was SOBBING and having a panic attack. he hasn’t contacted me since then but he hasn’t blocked me either. i’m so devastated and defeated i have literally no desire to live in this shitty world for one more day

One year ago today I attempted suicide my overdosing, it failed and I woke up the next morning surrounded in my own vomit and my mom yelling/hitting me. One year ago today I was sure that it wasn’t going to get better, but it did. I stayed in the hospital for a week under suicide watch staring and a blank wall never knowing what time of day it was until my meals were delivered wishing that I didn’t fail. I acted how they want me to and was able to be released right after the iv was pulled from my wrist. The next couple weeks were rough and I looked it, so many people found out because I have a problem with over sharing when things get silent. My life since then has been better and worse I’ve been put on medication that has helped me tremendously I’ve made so many friends and memories but I’ve also been more bold with my actions, sneaking out and going with groups of strangers alone in the middle of the night( I’m a 17 year old girl so kinda scary thinking back), police encounters, drugs, and bad friends who use me. But I’m slowly getting better and my grades are starting to go back up, I feel nimble sometimes but I know I will never ever try to go through that pain again, I struggle with self harm which I know is a bad habit but I’m working on it and I have a new escape from reality going snowboarding and I feel more alive. My life is getting better and yours will too! I’m sorry this is kinda long but I’m really happy right now and wanted to share\U0001f642

I have no personality, I have no other feelings.
I've lost most of my hobbies, interests and goals.
I'm just anxious and depressed all the time.

I'm not even a person, my whole existence is just my anxiety and depression.

So yesterday I probably had one of the worst days for my depression that I've had in a while. I'm not going to go into too much detail but it was pretty bad, almost to a point where I didn't feel like I could keep myself safe/manic. But the thing is today I feel a bit better but why do I miss how much I was struggling yesterday? I feel like it's because of the blue monday thing and idk I guess I feel like my depression is only real when it's at its absolute worst. Does anyone else feel like this

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l075l9/it_may_sound_strange_but/
I have compassion for everyone here, i drop by regularly and even though I don't post, reading the posts, everyone's story, it makes me really sad actually. 

I just wanted to tell you that even though we are strangers on the internet, we are still human beings and this form of connection that we have may seem miserable but it's still better than nothing.  You are not alone in this mess!

Sometimes when I go on social media I’ll see posts like “it’s okay if all you did was get out of bed” “you’re doing your best”, like how is that doing my best? I feel like such a failure if I’m not doing something. Idk... can someone explain this to me. Maybe I’m being to harsh on myself but I really mean it, how is doing nothing okay? I feel like a break is only deserving after accomplishing something. I hope I don’t come off as harsh, I’m genuinely trying to understand the other perspective.

It sounds so disgusting. They started to smell so bad but I just could not find the energy to do it. I turned to noodle cups, cans of energy drinks, microwave meals, Uber eats etc...stuff I could just throw out the packaging. Or I just didn’t eat at all. A few times I got my depressed ass to go buy bananas or grapes so I actually had something good in me though. At one point I even bought more bowls because it seemed easier than washing the ones in my sink. 

TW: gross lol-
Some were plastics and I just had to throw them out. Not only were they slimy with food residue that became a gelatinous oil sticking to the sides, but I think mould had embedded into them and I just didn’t want to take the chance. 
-End TW

It was so hard forcing myself to do it. I know if I just washed them right after I used them this wouldn’t happen, but it keeps happening regardless. Wish I had a dishwasher honestly. I just don’t understand why this shit is so hard. But finally they’re done and it doesn’t smell fucking horrible. Big win for me.

They are the few things I actually care about in this world. Telling them just makes me feel like I am fucking up their lives. Being fully heard out seems like too much to ask.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0717w/i_feel_like_my_internal_rage_my_destroy_myselfmy/
Externally I seem nearly okay.  I am good at my job and well liked by my co-workers.  My boss thinks I'm a hard worker.  I don't have a formal swcondary education but I'm fairly intelligent, I graduated second in my class from highscool.  When I have tried therapy in the past my therapists always tell me that I'm so smart and insightful or a really interesting person.  I hold 2 jobs (one is my own business).  I'm a dutiful partner.  I've done volunteer work with animals. I help my family out even ones that I'm not fond of.  I basically never yell or get angry with people....

But in reality I'm boiling under the surface and have been for years.  I feel hateful and out of control on the inside.  I indulge in self abuse and self pity.  When I'm alone at work sometimes I cry while going about my daily tasks.  And sometimes I feel like I hate nearly everyone in my life.  And I try to avoid thinking about big life decisions because sometimes it leads me to think about not wanting to be alive at all.

Recently it is a new joy in my life that has ironically made the pain seem more piercing.  I have a partner that loves me and supports me and tells me how wonderful I am and how proud he is of me. 
He has told me I am the best thing in his life and that I make him so happy ...  And I feel like it is bullshit.  I feel like I have sold him a lie.  

My parents were drug addicts that used to belittle and beat each other. I was molested at 4 years old by my elder brother's best friend while my parents were busy cheating on each other and fearing stupid things like their house being "haunted".  My mom was regularly so high she would drive into on coming traffic on the way to my school when she wasn't gone in jail.  My brother started calling me queer for liking normal girl things and then telling me not to be a sl*t before I even hit puberty.  Later my mom started telling me she wanted to leave me or commit suicide because of how awful it was to be a mother/wife.. I was bullied in school for being fat and a nerd. My first boyfriend was abusive, wouldn't tell his friends about me and regularly threatened to leave me if I refused sex.  My second BF would threaten to kill me as a "joke" fairly regularly.  Basically my whole life from 3-24 was full of some kind of neglect or abuse.  

The positive people in my life now think I'm pretty great from what they say to me. My friends say I'm strong and I do well for myself.  I'm brave.  I'm funny. I'm smart.. 
 They tell me I can do anything. 

But I hate myself.  I feel like I'm a liar.  I'm some broken thing walking around taped together hoping no one realizes how fucked up I am.  I don't feel okay.  I don't feel brave.  I feel stupid.  I feel angry at my family for bringing a child into that mess.  I feel angry at myself for wasting years on abusive people.  I feel like a waste of potential and space for not getting a degree or making something more of myself than being an independent landscaper.  I feel out of control in my life.  

I feel like I don't know how to make the feelings go away.  So I just shove them down.  I cover my pain with a fake smile and a nervous laugh that I hate having developed.  I avoid emotional subjects because I can't handle speaking on them without crying.  I try to be tough because it's the only crutch that has saved me all these years.  I can feel it all.  Or I can feel nothing.  There isn't a in-between with me.

Sent this and never got a response back..\U0001f494

I can’t keep doing this over and over again. I want to be with you. I do love you. I do care about you. I do miss being with you. It’s obvious we’re both still affected by stuff in the past. I don’t know exactly everything you are affected by but whatever it is I want to be able to talk about it so we can move past it. I’ve been trying to tell you how I’m still hurt but it just seems like every time I do you get offended. 

All I want is for you to listen and understand that there are just so many unresolved issues between us. I’ve made plenty of mistakes in our relationship. I own up to my mistakes and genuinely apologize to you and go out of my way to let you know how truly sorry I am. I feel like I’m the only one left actually trying to fight for what’s left of this relationship. I feel like I’m pulling all the weight. 

I just feel like you give up so easily on this.. I can’t continue to be the only one trying to resolve things. We can’t build an actual healthy relationship when there are still cracks in the foundation. I don’t know what you really want out of this relationship..but I do know what I want and need to be happy in this relationship. 

I need trust, to be able to not feel like you’re constantly talking to someone else or that as soon as things go south you leave. I need honesty, to be able to be open about things even though it may hurt one another. We are both going to continue to make mistakes in our lives. It’s just how we handle our mistakes that show the healthiness of our relationship. 

I need to be able to feel safe expressing myself and I want you to feel the same way towards me. Just like our late nights staying up and just talking about whatever popped up in our heads together. I miss just feeling comfortable around you and not feeling like I was doing or saying the wrong things all the time. 

I want to be able to just lay here and cuddle with you. I want to be able to play with your hair, face, ears. I want to go out and do things together like just driving around and listening to music. I want to be able to spoil you and take care of you. I want to wash your hair for you and shave your face again. I want to steal your clothes. I want to wake up in the middle of the night to you rubbing my head or cuddling me. I want to wake up in the morning and get my daily dose of morning wood. 

I want to make those stupid ass candy apples together that we never did because I was just so out of it. I want to watch you play your stupid games that I never understood why you liked them so much. I want to make you wear certain shirts and beanies so I can get that weird feeling when I look at you. I want to have head rubs and back rubs. I want you to use my toys on me because I haven’t had an actual good orgasm in so long and you always did a really good job. 

I want to take bubble baths together even though we barely fit. I want to be carried around like you used to. I want to be able to talk about our baby together and make decisions together. I want to be able to hold your hand while I drive or just in general. I want to be able to go on random adventures with you like a cabin in the woods or an amusement park. I want to be able to get high with you again one day. 

I want to watch you bond with our son. I want to watch you become an amazing father. I want to watch you fall in love with him. I want to fall in love with you all over again. I can honestly keep on going but for a while I honestly forgot a lot of good things in our relationship and now being able to actually recap them and just blurt it out makes me realize so much more how much I do care. 

I not only want you in my life but I honestly need you in my life. That may sound so selfish but right now I’ve never needed you more and it scares me because of how broken we are right now. I just wished you would come here and just go through all this bullshit with me and work through it so we can come out better than before. All I really have to say is I just need you here by my side to get through this together. 

Also I hope that you try and think about what you really need and want from a relationship. I hope that we want the same things but if not then I understand..I will still love and care about you but we both know it wouldn’t be for the best if we both want different things and if neither one of us is willing to truly comprise it will just hurt both of us in the long run. I’m willing to listen to what you need and want to try and compromise to work things out because I do really want to be with you like actually be with you face to face.

I’ve been struggling with major depression most of my life. Lately I’ve been better. I’m not suicidal anymore. I don’t feel sad as much anymore. Does this mean I’m not depressed anymore? I’ve been told depression isn’t a phase and it doesn’t just go away. But idk.. I feel different.

I'm an introvert who struggles with making conversations, and In have no friendships. I'm not too bothered about having no friends because, i feel safer alone. I used to volunteer to help myself gain experience talking to people but the pandemic has set me far back. I've been depressed due to some family issues for years now. When i try to express my feelings to my parents, they ignore it, then they yell at me when i refuse to tell tehm about my personal life. My sister emotionally abuses me and i've lived with her for a while now, thought about moving out but i don't have the finances. Thankfully she's getting married soon and moving out. I feel trapped and tired, like i'm in a cycle. I was feeling suicidal for a while but i had to struggle to have it pass by myself. Now, i'm battling a lot of anxiety with depression and i'm now feeling a lack of empathy, to the point that it scares me and i feel like i'm spiraling out of control, my brain is screaming but i can't even respond. The pandemic made it worse and I could use some advice if anyone has any? Sorry for the long read.

Instead i should focus on an education, bc im not happy at all where i live,  i think. Im doing a course in two weeks. I really cant stand it anymore that i did something illegal, arent we all somewhat criminal?

Nobody calls, nobody texts, nobody cares.

Why do I even bother? 

You get close to someone and you’re filled with this mysterious thrill of emotion. You start to feel like somebody cares. That you’re not alone. That there is somebody watching with this oddly distinct feeling deceiving you. You begin to question reality, but this is it.

Self-blame, self-hatred, self-isolation.

I was lied to. 

You’re confused. You want answers; Where did it all go wrong? You blame yourself. You’re ashamed. You hate yourself. It’s your fault for ending up like this. Nobody likes you. Trapped. Can’t breathe. You hide yourself from the world. It was never meant to be this way.

Lost, troubled, disoriented.

Where do you go? What are you supposed to do? No motivation. Everything is a blur. You want signs, directions, a pathway. Nothing. You’re hopeless. Is this life? Nothing remains, it’s over. There are no choices left. It’s better to die painlessly than to be alive suffering.

I was fat all of my childhood. Then I became obese around my mid teens. Then I finally lost the weight. What sucks is that my skin has so much damage from from being so heavy that now I have to have surgery. It cost so much and I’m willing to pay it to help my mental health, but fuck it sucks. Like I see these guys on Instagram that have never been fat and only skinny and their abs and skin look so nice where as for me I still car see it because of my skin. I compre myself way too much because I don’t think my body is valuable, and I wish I wasn’t dealt the cards I was dealt. I’m exhausted of always feeling like my body is shot unless I’m at the gym actually working out( that’s the only time I don’t feel bad about my body). I wish my parents would have forced me to loose weight or join a sport and would’ve taught me nutrition at a young age. Fuxk my body, I wish I could replace it.

3 years ago I started getting tattoos really heavily. They’re all very large and over the majority of my leg. Lately I’ve been getting really depressed and anxious over them. I loved them when I first got them and only as of lately my anxiety has taken over. I’ve considered laser but I’m worried the area is too large and it won’t heal properly.

I (19M) am In a pretty low place right now. Its alot to go over though. I'm at that point where it feels like your mind is physically in pain. It feels like none of my life prior to this moment really happened and I am not a real human. I am drawn to suicide, but am trying to think my way out of it. I dont want to exist any longer. I've been feeling this way for I'm not sure how long, but its been awhile. I fear this is neverending and it seems like it is at this point. I dont know why I'm posting this. Maybe I'm hoping someone can talk with me and make me feel better, but I dont think anyone or anything could take me out of this. I don't know.

I'm a broken person. I don't fit anywhere. I don't belong. I don't have friends. I feel uncomfortable even around the family I have left (non-toxic ones). I've been ostracized by my own siblings. By fucking support groups.

But at the same time, do I really want to fit into a society so profoundly broken and disgusting? I don't want to be a wage slave - wasting 1/3 of my life and all of my energy just to make money that goes to paying bills for a place I can't enjoy because I'm so damn exhausted. I don't want to be part of a society where half the people believe masks are oppressing them and won't wear them for the greater good. I don't want to be part of a society where people are abused and cast aside for circumstances beyond their control.

What do you do when there is no good solution? What do you do when you know that you and the society around you will never both be fixed at the same time? What do you do when you believe neither can be fixed at all?

I feel so alone, but I've been thinking all this over for months and months and I still haven't come up with a single viable solution, let alone a good one.




[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l08kkd/can_you_personally_feel_a_difference/
I've been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember, so it's somewhat hard for me to distinguish between "good" and "bad" as far as emotions and events go. It all really just blends together and I only think "oh, that was probably not a good thing" when I tell someone else and they seem uncomfortable. Since I typically feel a general numbness and sense of apathy, I've been keeping a diary/mood/activity tracker for the past year as it comforts me to see that data. 

Anyway, my memory and sense of time constantly feels hazy so rather than thinking "I'm getting worse again" I'll notice it through my diary's weekly stats and other people's reactions. I feel as tired and irritable as what I consider my usual, if anything the only difference is my muscles ache a bit more and my appetite seems to have disappeared, but my mom has been offering to wash dishes and do other chores that are my responsibility lately and today my boss even texted me asking if I was okay, which confused me. Does anyone else relate to this? Since I've lived like this for about 10 years now, even after 2 failed suicide attempts it was more of a thought "as expected, no one noticed. It'll be inconvenient for a while until I fully recover."

Objectively, I can tell I'm not doing well as my room becomes a mess and my sleeping/eating/hygiene habits become worse. However, I never think "I have to get better" it's always "it's such a pain to hide this from people who wouldn't understand." Really, I just feel tired and it doesn't make a difference to me whether I end up with bruises that day or not, even if I cry for an hour straight it's just a nuisance and I hate myself for wasting time like that. When my depression seems to get "worse" it's not a noticable change for me personally, but seeing others' reactions stresses me out. I try so hard to seem normal, to not inconvenience others, I don't want their pity and hate when they "try to cheer me up." I want to hurry up and "improve" soon so I can go back to quietly doing the bare minimum and being generally ignored by everyone again.

Been dating someone with severe anxiety and depression 2 years.  Mostly it manifests as anger and he always says a lot of horrible things and breaks shit on bad days.  He's seeing a therapist and trying though.

It's been bad lately because he lost his job and his father is dying.  His father was not a good person. I went home with him when his dad went on hospice.

Today his dad died, and he's lost it.  Broke shit screamed horrible things at me and his mom.  I'm trying to help but he's dumped me anyways during the rage (doubt he means it, he said "its what you want anyway the usual bull).  He and his mom aren't speaking and I'm just sitting in the bedroom and intermittently trying to comfort his mom.

I want to go home.  I don't want him in my life anymore because I am not equipped for this.

I'm scared he will kill himself if I try to leave I don't know what to do.

Posted here because depression doesn't seem to be something unaffected people can understand, and I was hoping someone could tell me if I should leave or keep trying to help.

I (23F) have had depression/ anxiety all my adult life, since i was a teen really. Never really was a people person, never really kept friends when moving schools, never really felt connected with people. Ive tried. Ive tried different meds at different doses, therapy, exercise, vitamins, drugs fuck all of it. But that pit never goes away, that ... but it would be easier if you weren't here. Makes me angry that people dont give a shit, but if i were to finally take the next step everyone would cry for the social media likes. You ever just feel so unworthy of it all, like it all just washes past you, never really touching anything, like a puff of smoke. 
I try to hide don't get me wrong, im always too quiet, not funny enough, too loud, too something for other people.
Im starting to think it won't ever get better, that ill be a miserable, needy, pathetic fuck my whole life. 
I used to walk past this bridge on the way home from work before i moved, every single time id think about jumping, just falling and it being over, there is nothing like that where i live now, i just wish i had jumped.

I watched this movie with my parents a few days ago and Ive never cried like that. At the end when he was playing the piano, and 22 was a lost soul, and then when he was given that second chance. And that last line, I was holding the crying in and almost couldn't hold it in front of my parents. They just said it was weird or stupid, while I ran upstairs and cried myself to sleep. Ive never cried like that. I have cried because of someone dying in a game or movie, but that movie made me cry about me. I'm a waste of life. I'm just taking up space where another person could be living much better in. I have done nothing with my life, and I don't think I ever will. I have no purpose, and Im a waste of life.

So I finally decide to vent to someone about how I'm feeling and they block me. It took EVERYTHING out of me to vent to them and their response was: 'oh'. That's it. 'Oh' to me pouring my feelings out. I'm so fucking done. I can't anymore. Why is it that whenever people vent to me I'll put aside HOURS to talk and listen to them, but when it comes to me nobody cares?? I sound so fucking selfish right now, oh my god. I literally can't anymore. Fuck this shit. Fuck existing.

Whenever I fall into a depressive episode I search up real seppuku videos online and just watch these people disembowel themselves with a knife. Some pull their organs out and they just fall over and die. Although I think I’d hang myself if I were to do it bc I somewhat like being choked or choking myself, this one time I’m got a dull cutlery knife and just stabbed myself. Even if I feel like dying I just am too pussy to do anything

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l02pwp/how_do_i_get_motivated/
I might make a longer post another time that is more personal but I’ll try to keep this one shorter as my main question I want answered right now is how do I motivate myself.

I’m 18 and in my 2nd semester of college. I had a good first semester with all As and a B+. The thing is, getting good grades doesn’t feel as rewarding anymore. Even in my last 2 years of high school it wasn’t doing the trick. Now in college I have to take classes that I’m uninterested in because they require generals and I have a hard time focusing in those classes. Some of the classes we literally don’t even meet with professors weekly. I had a bad first week of the semester. I hardly did anything. I am ashamed because I know what I have to do but it’s just so boring and uninteresting that I pretty much chose to slack. I’ve been struggling with motivation for a while now. I like to think I’m not lazy. For example I did an internship at a bank this past summer and I got a lot of good feedback and they said they really liked having me. It was something I was interested in and there were clear expectations of me which helped me thrive. I had people relying on me to do my part which pushed me. During class nobody really cares about each other. There isn’t much interaction. You basically just have to do everything yourself and it just is tough when you aren’t too interested or engaged. I did great in classes related to my major because they interested me and were more engaging. I know some people will say it’s only and a couple months and maybe you can just push through but I’ve been doing it since junior year of high school and I’m just tired of it. Maybe I have something undiagnosed, maybe I really am just lazy but I don’t know. I just wish there was some way to feel motivated and excited to learn again.





[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l0783x/depressed_and_drinkng_at_least_6_beers_a_night/
I've been through a lot in the past year (I'm sure everybody has a story from 2020). I had to take a job I don't like in order to pay the bills. I got arrested for DUI in the summer and had to pay thousands in legal fees (thankfully I got it talked down to a ticket), I lack the self-confidence needed to get a girlfriend and go back to school, and I drink around 6-7 beers on average a night and have done it for close to 2 years with the exception of a few days. The drinking really started after my first and only girlfriend dumped me 4 years ago and I needed something to cope with. I'm still not completely over her.

I want to go back to school but I'm too scared to do it because I work full time. I've been seeing a therapist for the past 4 months and she's helped me a lot, but I still feel helpless and bitter about life. Like there's times where I just don't care and there's the chance I might go off on someone or hurt myself. I get suicidal thoughts on occasion, particularly if I'm sleep deprived or really drunk. 

I know I shouldn't let the success of others bother me, but it seems all of my peers are now in successful relationships with at least halfway decent careers they enjoy, and I'm stuck working a retail job I despise and barely making enough to pay the bills with what's left of my lawyer fees. 

I get easily angry at some of the slightest things, whether it's forgetting something from the store or eggs not sticking when I cook them on a frying pan, and I'll pitch a fit and throw stuff while talking down on myself (the latter of which I wasn't too aware of until my therapist brought it up - negative self-talk). Last year I almost got fired for cursing out one of my managers (who a lot of other workers didn't like) and on another occasion hung up on a costumer on the phone for giving me a hard time (I'm terrible with talking to people on the phone for the most part). While it was situations that triggered me harder than usual, these are things I didn't do at my job in the past. 

I really want to go back to school to go into human resources or be a consultant. But I'm scared I can't handle the work load and my full time job along with my drinking would be a problem for that (and I'm terrified of the thought of going into more debt, especially since I'm not great with school anyways and I'm in thousands in credit card debt already).

I have a lot of problems and they just seem to keep building up. I'm 33 and I feel like I don't have the control I should have. Part of me is almost to the point to where I'm questioning if life is worth it anymore because I'm so fucked up. I understand why people commit suicide and it's to stop the pain in their lives. I don't believe necessarily that that's the way to go but through my perspective, I get it. 

If anyone can relate or/and has some sound advice for me than that would be great. I apologize for my lack of structure in writing this post but I wanted to get this out there before I head into work.

Side note: I do work out regularly and besides the drinking, I stay in good shape and eat a mostly healthy diet. I keep my apartment clean and I take care of myself hygiene-wise and stay in touch with good fashion. Just some positive things I wanted to bring up that I do maintain despite my issues.

Yikes.. I just don't feel capable of doing anything. But then when I lay around, I feel anxious. It's like there's no escaping it. 
I got dumped a year ago from a long term relationship and just can't seem to recover. Therapy...helps. But only for a short period. I just want the pain to go away.

I probably need to stop being in contact with my ex. It gave me hope for a while. What I now know was false hope. I need to just tell her that I cant do it.

Ugh i feel so anxious and upset right now you guys. Like i'm on a nightmareish merry go round that wont stop

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l06yoy/my_life_is_pathetic/
I live alone. I’m unemployed. I have no friends and haven’t since high school. Even then I barely had any and never hung out with them outside of school. I have no degree and have lost all my financial aid so I can never afford to go back to college. Even if I did I have literally zero idea what I would go for. I have no hobbies or interests. I’ve never been in a real relationship or had sex. I’ve never even been kissed. The last time someone asked me out was my freshman year of high school. Ten years ago. I’m overweight and even if I lose it at this point my body is ruined with stretch marks and stretched out skin, especially on my boobs which I have literally hated since the day they started growing. 

I look back on my life and I’m just embarrassed. It’s so pathetic. I have wasted the last 10+ years. I hate every aspect of my life. I don’t even know how to fix it at this point. I keep trying to get my weight under control but how do I do that when the days are so fucking long and I have nothing to do and no one to talk to? I end up just eating out of sheer boredom

I would anything to go back in time and start over. I spend literally all my time thinking about what I would do differently and then I just cry for hours because that’s obviously not an option. I wasted my one chance at life and now I’ll never be  happy

(This is my main account, I don’t really care if someone I know sees it. It’s nice to get this all written out. If you do know me, you may not want to read it, though.)

I just feel so alone. I’m in college, I have friends and a girlfriend who I care about, and I still feel so alone. It seems like I’m no one’s favorite person, and it feels like everyone just tolerates me. It doesn’t feel like anyone cares about how I’m doing or who I am anymore. 

I had one really close friend who I used to tell everything, but for the past few months she just doesn’t seem to care about what I tell her anymore. And she criticizes me a lot (e.g., my singing, my writing (I’m not a good writer but I try my best)), which just hurts so much. I never speak up for myself about how things affect me (conceal don’t feel) because I’m afraid of how people will react, which also ties into the next paragraph. It’s a horrible, self-destructive trait I have, but that’s just how I’ve been my whole life.

I also don’t feel like my girlfriend cares about me as much as I care about her. Now, we’ve only been dating for about 2.5 months, so it’s not like I’m expecting it to be like we’ve been together for years. But, it seems like she never really wants to text me (one small example is that she never sends me good morning texts anymore, which is a little thing that made my whole day in the past), and when we are together in person she still just seems distant. She’s told me that her love languages are quality time and physical touch, but I always have to initiate anything physical like cuddles or kisses. I really care about her deeply, but I just don’t know if she feels the same anymore with the mixed signals. It just adds to my feelings of loneliness, and I get incredibly anxious whenever I think about it.

I’m also worried about what will happen when my mom dies. Hopefully it won’t happen for awhile (knock on wood), but when she and my grandma go I won’t have any family left since I’m an only child, I have no contact with anyone on my father’s side of the family, and no one on my mom’s side seems to want to talk to me outside of holidays anyway. I’ve spent many nights over the past few years having breakdowns about her passing away, and a few times I’ve told myself that I just won’t worry about it, that when that happens I won’t have anything left and I’ll just end my life. So, I don’t know what’ll happen then.

I starting thinking about suicide in high school. I never really had any plans back then, but it’s been sitting in the back of my mind ever since. For the past two years, I’ve thought about it at least once every week. Almost exactly a year ago, I was a hair away from going through with an actual plan. I haven’t ever been that close since, but I still frequently think about what would happen if I decided to do something.

Lastly, I don’t know what I want to do with my life. Almost everyone around me seems to at least have some plan of what they want to do, like become a vet, teacher, nurse, etc. I feel like I’m wandering around aimlessly, and I have no clue what I want to do. I’m not really great at anything. I keep telling myself that Tolkien quote that not all who wander are lost, but I think I really am lost. And I don’t know what to do.

So, to sum it all up, despite being surrounded with people, I feel very alone. It’s nice to type this all out, and if you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading. I hope you have a great day.

I started seeing a therapist along with a psychiatrist in the summer because i was feeling suicidal. It took months of nagging but they finally agreed to let me see them.

The therapist was nice but it was only 6 sessions because it was an acute session for ppl in crisis and I didn’t have time to get everything out. While it wasn’t life changing it was nice to talk someone who would be empathetic to the issues in contrast to my parents (who would just tell me to grow up and stop whining) and some of my friends (who would probably not understand and mock me)

The psychiatrist visit was what helped the most due to getting access to anti depressants. When I started taking them I felt a lot better. Before I used to have random mood swings where I’d feel miserable and suicidal for hours triggered by thoughts of my past failings (you can also look through the previous posts on my profile to see what are some of the things that cause this). I would brood for the rest of the day and not want to do anything. With the antidepressants the impact of this was reduced significantly and if I did have negative thoughts I could push them aside. It wasn’t perfect but it was much much better than what I experienced before. 

Now come to January I’m almost out and haven’t had an appointment in a couple of months to get a refill. My parents stopped paying for the appointments because they said it was a waste of money. I can’t get a refill because I need to take an appointment first. I asked my mom what I’m supposed to do then and she just said, “Deal with it.” She went on the say that “other ppl suffer from depression and they aren’t whining and are learning to push on.” I got into a fight with her after that and have again fallen back into the same misery I had before taking the antidepressants. It pisses me off too because my parents are a good chunk of the reason why I’m very depressed and suicidal (again see previous posts for context). I would pay for the appointment but I don’t have much money (and I’m trying to save up enough to move out of this shitty family and get my own car). I offered to pay for an appointment but she refused to let me, and I don’t have access to insurance stuff and other aspects so I don’t know how to book one. 

I don’t know what to do. I was doing much better under the antidepressants but now I don’t have access to them anymore. My parents don’t care about my depression, so I guess I’m stuck waiting until I make enough to pay for an appointment. If anyone knows any ways to get easier access to anti depressants or ways to fight of suicidal thoughts and misery lmk. I only have one pill left that I’ve been saving.

I met someone wonderful and we had a great connection in many aspects but the closer we became, the louder my depression was telling me I'm not good enough.  So of course I did what I do best, hurt him by pushing him away and letting my inner critic win. He has so many lovable qualities and all I can dwell on are the ones that make me unlovable. It seems like once I started developing feelings for him, I started doubting why I'm worthy of reciprocation. I can feel my thoughts slipping lower and lower. I wish I was stronger than this.

I just am tired, my brains constantly depressed and I don’t want to move or get out of the house or talk to anyone, I got this one guy who jus wanted to mess around and I feel like useless trash like always but maybe that’s just how I feel to myself. I dont know I got no life, no real friends, no one I feel is strong rock support really and I feel lost and like every second is just a burden and I wish I was never born. I wish I was blind or deaf so I wouldn’t have to see anything that would upset me again or deaf and hear something I don’t want to hear again. And I wish I could kill my thoughts so I don’t have to think anymore. I disassociate a lot and Live in my head. I got no schedule besides sitting in my bed doing nothing but thinking about depressing or bad shit all the time. I just wish my body would shut down or me just constantly sleep. Yea i get it I’m a piece of shit, worth nothing and a no one, and I wont ever will be, My body is useless and my personality means nothing and my confidence doesn’t exist. I’m tired. I’m gay, in a small town, I sometimes wish I wasn’t gay, and had no sex drive because everything in my life has been surrounded by sex and no love and just being used. I hate everything about myself, it won’t change and I’ll probably grow up to be some piece of shit some how. I dont know the future but I think it’s all fucking stupid. No one will help me.

I haven’t cried since end November of last year and honestly I really feel like I should. It took me a while to realize how much you let go when you do it but the problem is that it almost looks like I’ve lost the ability to do it. It’s not that my tearmakers don’t work but whenever I feel bad or just extremely lonely it never comes, no matter how hard I try. I’m apparently quite good at masking or distracting myself from everything that bugs me day in day out but sometimes it just strikes me all at the same time. I really wish I had more friends, a soulmate, that I wasn’t this ugly, that I didn’t think this much, that I didn’t worry so much, that I didn’t care, that I could do more, that I wasn’t autistic and that I didn’t get crushes so easily. You might think some of this will come in the future but to be honest I doubt sometimes if I will make my spot in this world. See this thing it forces you to go with it and whether you resist or not, you will eventually die. Now what I like to do is shit with music, gaming and helping people but it all either feels like an escape or something that I’m not sure of if I do it out of ego or that I actually am wise and deeply care since It seems like I’m not able to cry because of someones death either. I’m not suicidal anymore but I still know why I used to be. See this earth sure is a beautiful one but I’ve never really felt like it was made for me or that I was made for it.

Pls don’t take this too serious. Perhaps this is just my regular vent. Idk why I typed this all at midnight and at this point idk if this is all even true and if I’m not crazy or anything but I just felt like sharing the shit that goes through my mind sometimes.

Peace out I guess.

Do ppl gaslight you with your mental illness and your opinions about them?

I have a friend who has seen me through (and been on the receiving) of my manic episodes, suicide attempts and depression.

 She snoops through my phone apparently because she read my manic text about her that I sent to someone else. So those things are also held against me. 

However she is no walk in the park, even her sisters agree (but probably wouldn’t tell her) that she thinks she’s perfect. A huge peeve of mine is ppl being inconsiderate because I am a super accommodating, helpful, considerate and generous person . I’ve told her countless direct and indirect ways and everything goes back to me. I’m sensitive, I’m unable or the good ol SHE HOW SHE IS! 

Wtf. People don’t understand we can have our issues but still make complete sense and not be overly sensitive and making things up? MIND YOUUUU I’m on my meds and doing better than I have in a while. I’d say I’m 68 % compared to -82%. 

Does anyone else experience this in your relationships? I’m tired of it. I’m also tired of paying for my manic episodes, I take responsibility buttttt shit I can’t help mania. I don’t want this shit ! 

Any advice ?

But in truth your crumbling down. Your brick wall is weak and quickly decaying to the point where it’s hardly standing. Behind that smile is actually you screaming in pain, wailing for everything to just be over. Please be over. God just let it end.

But you keep picking the bricks up one by one. They’re so heavy and your body is weak but if they don’t get put back together then there will be nothing left. Then people would see the truth; behind that wall there is nothing. Just an empty void where you used to reside because this disease has erased everything you truly used be.

I had long hair for like 6 years but I cut it really short recently. Finally after like forever I actually love myself and how I look . I forgot how that feels like. I had to beg my mom and threaten her that if she doesn't cut my hair I'll cut it myself she didn't wanna do it because she was scared I'll regret it. I showed a best friend and she didn't like it, my brother just noticed today and said I swear to God you'll regret it (swearing to God in Islam is a *huge* deal). I look like I'm coming outta the 70s but I live how I look finally. My mom and other best friend think and say that I look great but negative comments stick easier and I'm starting to doubt if it actually looks good. Also my mom tells me to keep it tied back or tie part of it but I ignore her. Idk what to do and I'm a people pleaser and I hate that part about me, I literally out everyone before me and I don't know how to change. One of the reasons that I wore hijab was because I was very insecure about my hair and never really liked it until now.

Very recently, I started feeling much lonelier at night. I get the strong urge to text everyone I know in hopes of a response. Just a single response makes it. Sometimes I get one or two and that feels like a high. A short lived high sadly but still.




I recently started smoking dope, to help with my tourettes and that helps a bit, mainly cause it makes me tired



Anyone feeling this?

Ive battled depression for years.  Ive been ahead of it for the past year or two but really struggling today.  I have things I need to do but have 0 energy to give.  I have a good life, good job, good family.  Lots of people would trade spots with me.  Not bragging but its a humbling reminder that depression strikes even during the good days.  

I understand why people commit suicide.  Im not saying Im at risk - but no way I could carry on for the rest of this life feeling like this.  I get why people take that way out when I feel like this.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l01fd4/problems_with_relations_and_self_image/
I've been having a real problem lately dealing with people around me. I feel like I'm a nuisance at best to the people in my life, and a burden to a number of them. I also can't seem to bring myself to talk to anyone I know about this.

Now, I've heard a lot about "the importance of self love." I like to think I recognize a number of positive traits in myself; intelligence, impartiality, compassion, and determination. But I can never see anyone else seeing me that way, even people close to me. I always figure they see me as irritable, petty, rude, and hypocritical. I think other than immediate family, nobody would be put out by my death or suicide more than a day or two.

So, a few questions. How likely is it that I'm just being paranoid about how my friends and family feel about me? How can I tell what they really think? If I ask, how can I tell if they're being honest? And, maybe the biggest question: if I feel like I see myself positively, but I don't believe anyone else does, do I REALLY love myself yet?

Hi warriors. A little about me: 27, trans guy, married, with a three year old. I've been depressed since I was 13 with a lot of trauma. I've tried almost every treatment: almost every medication, therapy since 13, inpatient places short and long term, electric convulsive therapy, ECT, everything....

I'm here sitting in several states away from my home. My family and I are trying to get back to our home state and find a house. My son needs treatment for his severe ADHD and I'm feeling like the world is on my shoulders.

I just want to go home....I have an eviction on my record that wasn't even our fault. The plumbing kept backing up in our old apartment because of rusty pipes. I feel like I'm going no where. I'm trying so hard to get back. I'm going to get a job as both my husband and I are in disability and don't have much money.

I'm just waiting for life to get better but I feel so hopeless. Just a vent. Needed somewhere to get it off my chest. I just don't want to be here anymore.

... Dont know where to start, but I'll try

At the moment there's really a lot of stuff in my life tearing my head up. My dads sick, my dog is being a barky prick, I feel my and my (few) friends have nothing in common anymore and only meet to get drunk and talk about random crap, my girlfriend and I are very different places in out lives and want to do different things, my jobs suck and general sadness/feeling down, while I have to smile and laugh when being arond people. 

The only thing I still love is my big passion for photography, I spend all the time I can researching and working on projects - this gives me so much energy and joy in life. This means everything to me.  

I called in sick for work today (and will again tomorrow) because I really cant go out my door and just want to stay at home doing  the things I love to recharge my feel-good batteries, but now I feel like I betrayed my boss. But I told myself this morning that it's okay, and wrote on a piece of paper that I will tell my boss the true reason why I called in sick. I'm sure he will understand, I guess? 

I really haven't felt this sad and fragile for years, though I have allways felt depressed/melancholic to some degree, but now it's a bit to much. 

Sorry, I just had to get all this out of my head

There is no one I could ever spend my life with. Every friend I had just left me for better people while I just could go to bed and cry a little. My family never cared about me; I had to find a way to survive as a kid. I am just a human, different from you, but at the same time equal; tired and hopeless, I am waiting for my final.

&#x200B;

I wish I had less time than I was expected to have for this life. You can laugh at me, you can sympathize with me, or you can just ignore me. I cannot even cry, even if I want to, because there is no reason for me to waste more time. I wish I could end this, but it seems I will have to wait a little bit longer for that end. 

&#x200B;

I am just a human, limited by this body and brain. I hate these emotions I experience. I hate myself and feel old every time I look at myself in the mirror. I am just a lonely human, waiting for my end.

I don’t know if this should go here or r/SuicideWatch or whatever it’s called (new to Reddit lol), but I do not have a plan or note or anything of the sort so I’m resolving to post this here because it’s more depression-fueled than suicide-fueled (though the latter is definitely present). I just need some advice.

I am a recently-graduated-out-of-high-school 19/f, and I’m currently 2 and a half months into my first job. I currently work a full-time, 12hr swing shift (5-5) for a paper mill and I don’t know if it’s the right job for me. I suffer from severe anxiety and depression (of which I have almost attempted once), and because of the former I focused more on school than I did a job, as I feared I would not graduate if I did not focus all of my waned attention on homework (I have diagnosed ADHD). I have medication for my illnesses, but I do not take them because my biggest barriers are that I fear they will change me, I have poor time management as a result of my ADHD and always forget to take them before I leave for work, and I get extremely nauseous whenever I take them. I’ve been on 4 different antidepressants and they all make me almost vomit aside from barely doing anything at all. It’s awful and it feels like I’m never going to find the meds that work for me. I know I should be more open and that it’s just my depression assuming the worst but I am paranoid of losing what little I have of myself left.

The job makes me extremely depressed/suicidal because I feel like I have no control over anything anymore and I’ll never be able to leave the job I’m at to stop these feelings from coming on. I am an avid drawer/writer, I enjoy video games/tv shows, I like going outside and walking/skating/swimming, I like collecting Legoes and making stopmotion videos, I could go on but for brevity’s sake I’ll leave it at that. It feels like, to me at least, that nobody else there has any time for the amount of hobbies that I do (for example, both of my parents have little to no hobbies, my dad golfs and my mom very rarely went horseback riding while she worked there) - and I do not want to give them up. They have been a part of my life for many years and I am very bad at dealing with change (I know it’s a part of life, but to have moved from my childhood home to my parents getting their divorced finalized and my grandparents moving from their house and so many of the shows I rely on ending all within the timespan of 2 years, it is starting to crush and terrify the shit out of me). I’m partial to believing that if I worked a job that is 8hrs, or at least something that isn’t 12hrs, that I would feel as if I have time to do the things I enjoy. I have nothing else to live for if I do not have those things present/cannot daily perform them in my life, but the job hunt might be a bitch to do.

I mostly took the job because my mother pressured me to. My family has a history of working there (both of my parents and both of my grandpas, my dad is currently the only one still employed and has been there for 40+ years, my grandpas worked for a similar amount of time and my mom quit to go back to college after ~12 years) so I felt as if I was obligated to buckle down and “carry on the tradition”. The pay is very nice, but I have also never worked before so the impact of $20/hr is significantly less unless I’d worked a retail-esque job beforehand. I know, I shouldn’t even be thinking about quitting with that kind of paycheck, but every time I go there I feel like I am going to mentally combust.

Everyone there continues to tell me how “all the new hires keep quitting, don’t they know how good this job pays”, “I’ll never understand kids these days”, etc etc etc. I make it seem like I’m not considering leaving when they talk to me about this but it’s getting harder with every shift that I work. I am not strong, I am not experienced, and I am not okay with being in a work environment where if my ADHD distracts me hard enough I could get severely wounded or potentially die (those machines are scary, man).

All of my coworkers are over the age of 27 (60% of the employees are over the age of 50). I had a very rough experience in grade school and was bullied to the point of becoming so introverted that I do not know how to communicate to anyone without feeling like I am being a nuisance, and the fact that everyone feels like a teacher to me or better than me does not help. I don’t feel comfortable talking face-to-face or in a “let’s be friends” context with anyone that is over the age of 30 - or at least ones that give off a “I’m better than you” vibe. They’re not mean, per se, but there are definitely some people I’ve worked with that are assholes to me because I am new (I am on extra crew so they throw me around the 4 different schedules from time to time, which sucks in its own right because I have no say and it feels like I am basically working unprovoked overtime with no extra pay) and it’s very discouraging.

I hate the noise. I have very sensitive hearing and small ear canals to the point where I have to wear earmuffs instead of the standard earplugs, which doesn’t bother me, but it is the noise and fear of losing my hearing that scares me. I love music, and it is one of the things that held me together during my junior and senior years of high school. I know it probably won’t impact my hearing that much, but I am still scared nonetheless. The earmuffs are also irritating the eczema in and around my ears (even when I apply stuff for it) which does not make things any easier, and I don’t have any earplugs that do not fall out of my cursed, tiny ear canals, lmao

I am unsure if I should quit and find a job that is more suited to me, or if I should stay and tough it out - but I fear that my unchecked anger issues and past history of self harm will come back one of these days while I am there. I have considered calling in for a mental day or calling a hotline, but I always back out because I don’t want to let the person I switch in for down. I have thought about going up to my supervisor to express my concerns, but I only have a few minutes of breaktime in between each roll of paper (which take about half an hour to get through) that I cannot leave for more than 10-15 minutes because we would be short one person (me) that we need in order to stay on schedule. I have applied for different positions but so far I have heard nothing. There were other people with seniority that applied before I did, and since over half of the people working there have been there way longer than I have, I doubt I’m going to get out of where I am for at least a few years, and I don’t think I’ll last that long (even if I do there is no way I’m skipping on going to college in the next year or so, so either way I’m going to have to quit eventually, I just don’t know if I can handle much more of this).

My mom is extremely pissed at me for even considering quitting - which, in a way I understand, but it seems like she’s mad at me without even thinking how this is taking a toll on me mentally. My dad is much more open (even willing to help me find something somewhere else) but is really bad at emotionally-driven conversation. I am scared of what my mom will do if and when I quit under these circumstances. Hypothetically I don’t even know if she’d be supportive if I decide to tough it out and quit, say, the end of this year to go to college (I’m thinking about being a programmer or something in meteorology or photography, or maybe just something simple like a librarian. I don’t know why I took this job either, but my mom basically did everything for me to the point of agreeing to the interview for me, and I know she’s just looking out for me and trying to help me, but I just don’t think I’m cut out for extremely labor-intesive jobs. The biggest drive to stay for a while was to just save a lot of money so I don’t feel like I’m swimming in debt by the time I enroll, but man, if I end up killing myself in the next few weeks I don’t think that will matter).

Even if I do decide to quit, I don’t know how to convince my mom I am struggling other than to check myself into a mental hospital - which, I don’t want to go back there, but I’m running out of options at this point. I just want to work somewhere that I don’t fear for my life if something goes wrong or where I just shelve things. I love organizing. I love being helpful. I enjoy feeling like I am apart of something. I do not love running 50 feet at a moment’s notice while I am severely dehydrated (with asthma >_>) to sit in a paper machine that is hotter than Satan’s asshole and wait for 10-20 minutes for the paper to get back onto the roller. I do not love cutting the extra stubs of paper and shoving the 40+lbs stack of paper manually into the pulper and risk clogging it up and having everyone tear into me and then break down. I hate crying at work and then breaking down in the car after my shift. I have done it a lot. I am at my breaking point.

Sorry for the long read. Thank you if you read this far. I joined Reddit to ask for advice for this because I have nowhere else to turn to; I’ve asked friends, but I wanted (a) fresh, non-biased opinion(s) because I don’t know if the friends I told were just saying what I wanted to hear.


TL;DR: I just started a new job a few months ago and the stress and pressure it is putting on me is making me want to end it. I am afraid to take my meds and fear that if I stay at this job any longer I will lose interest in my hobbies/interests, and essentially the biggest part of who I am and therefore not have a will to live anymore. My mom is extremely against me quitting (even to go to college) because she thinks I am incapable of doing things on my own (like looking for a new job) and doesn’t realize the full extent of how depressed I am. What do I do?

For a while I felt empty but I realized that I have passed this stage now in addition to not feeling anything anymore I inhale the emotion of others so that it becomes as empty as me and I do not know  what to do to get back to the previous stage before people leave so as not to become like me

I'm trying to get myself out of my parent's house and all of the different obstacles and challenges I have to meet just makes me want to give up. I feel like I am working every hour of every day doing the only work I can find as an unskilled/uneducated person. Every day there is no true rest. If I give an hour of free time to myself I only have reason to kick myself for my irresponsibility. Idk man this hand to mouth bullshit demotivated me so badly.   

I really just don't know how I'm going to continue on each day. Everyday I learn I have to make a new sacrifice in my life and I'd like to say that I need to make these sacrifices to 'get ahead" but the abject reality is that I have to make these sacrifices in order to keep a roof over my head and to keep my head above water. 

Idk man.  I'm just so tired of all of this. I. Struggling to see how life can be anything but cold and grey. I just want to lay down and die but I'm too scared to kill myself. Too ashamed of myself to let myself stay in the same place. But I just don't have the wherewithall to keep moving forward. It's all so tiring.

I suffer from depression and anxiety. I could sleep all day if given the opportunity. Yes there are times when I am feeling exceptionally down that I sleep to have a reprieve from the depression. But even when I am not I am still tired all the time.  I’ve done an at home sleep study and have been tested for the following: A1C, vitamin d & b12, testosterone, celiac, anemia, thyroid. All came back negative. 

Have any of you dealt with this in the past, or are currently dealing with it? Have you had any success in overcoming it, and if so, what exactly worked for you? 

Thanks

I have schizoaffective bipolar type. I have been hospitalized 16 times in the last 3 years. I went completely off my meds a few months ago because I felt like I didn’t need them anymore and everyone around me agreed. I have been struggling for about a month or so. It has gotten worse now that my biggest support person through all of this has passed. All of the symptoms are back. A few weeks ago I was really manic and now just completely depressed. I am seeing and hearing things. Either I don’t sleep or sleep too much. I’m extremely anxious all the time. I have thoughts of self harm. I’ve seen my therapist 3 times in the last week. I have contacted my psychiatrist 3 times and he got back to me Friday night but nothing has been done to put me on some meds. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m letting everyone down for being sick and I cannot do the hospital thing again

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz4j2r/bought_a_gun_with_my_stimulus_for_suicide_posting/
Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice

I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff.

My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a "perfect" "son" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way.

As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly.

My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. 

I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over "no one really cares about you" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships

But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem

All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. "No one really cares" 

I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult 

I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from "I hate myself and want to die" to "I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive

I don’t have anyone anymore, none of my friends talk to me, and i don’t remember the last time my parents said ‘i love you’ i don’t even remember the last time they gave me a hug. they saw my scars two times and they said they would help me, they said things would be better. When will it be better? Why haven’t they done anything? I haven’t had a normal sleep schedule in months, i’ve been staying up till 4am hoping things will get better. They lectured me about this thinking that my depression went away the day after they noticed, they put a screen time on my phone so i can’t distract myself from all the shit going on in my life past 9pm, 9 fucking pm. Last time they did this, i had a mental breakdown while they were laughing peacefully in they’re room. I’m going get away from all this, i’m going to end it all, the pain, the sadness, i hope my family is proud of what they’ve done. Goodbye.

I cant go on anymore. I want to suicide painless but i dont want to go to hell. And im sick so i could cry until my body would fail, but that would be painful and i dont want to suffer anymore. I begged my parents to give me sleeping pills but they wont listen. At least when i sleep i dont feel the sadness and fear anymore (except for a few nightmares i had) i used to daydream and thats what it gave me hope but a month ago i lost the ability and i dont know how or why. Since then my depression turned worse and worse. The reason i got depression in the first place was because my parents emotionaly abused me but it was mild, but with time it got worse. The more i grew up, the worse my parents acted and the worse my depression got. I just wanted them to support me a little. Now im an adult and they told me im the biggest idiot and that i should suicide. I just dont have the courage. Theres no hope, i know there isnt any. I wont see my dreams becoming true, things wont get better and all i want is my ability to visualize and daydream back so i could work again on my stories and scenarios (i worked alot on them, i tried to show my parents a few but i kept got told it wasnt good enough i got scared to show them or anyone anymore) i needed to talk but ive been told to shut up, when i cried instead of trying to comfort me they just kept screaming at me to shut up and tell me how if i dont stop crying because im sick i will die and no one will care about me, wich maked me cry ever worse. Now its too late, i didnt talked when i needed too, i kept too much and now it exploded, now i guess i just need a painless death but im still a bit scared of hell. Right now ive been told that im gonna suffer because i cry so God will give me reasons to cry (for them i dont have any) and that it gives what you want. I ASKED SINCE I WAS LITTLE FOR ALOT OF THINGS AND WHAT I GOT WAS BROKEN DREAM ONE AFTER ANOTHER, THEN HOW CAN SHE SAY THAT HE GIVES WHAT YOU ASK FOR??????? I have to cry when im alone otherwise im threated they will break my stuff if i dont stop crying. IF GOD IS GIVING YOU WHAT YOU ASK FOR, THEN WHY I STILL CANT VISUALIZE AND DAYDREAM LIKE I USED TO A MONTH AGO???? I ASKED FOR THIS EVERYDAY SINCE I LOST THE ABILITY!!! I guess she ment it gives what you want only on negative. My parents say that im in depression because of too much good. Well, for the past few years ive been called a retard daily until i ended up beliving and becoming, ive been always told to shut up when i cried, when i tried to talk to them about how i feel they laugh in my face or told me than im weak, my artwork/stories were always not good enough for them and i used to like myself until they told me how retarded and ugly i was over and over that i cant even stand myself anymore. I do have food and a roof, but can it still be called too much good if my soul and mind are now shattered? If anyone has ever lost its ability to daydream and visualize but recovered please let me know... that was what helped me to deal with my depression alot, without it i cant do anything. I tried to paint and write like before but its just horrible what i do now... and i forgot to mention that ive been criticized for my tasted, being told how i have crappy tasted from music to food and clothes to pretty much everything. I was smart, creative and a bit ambitious when i had support (from friends before they left me) and now im a retarded piece of shit what dosnt diserve its breathing air

i've ben crying a lot since idk Wednesday. friday i cried a lot in the shower, very loudly and dramatically, allowing myself to let all the pain to come out. spent Saturday and sunday sleeping eating sleeping again crying. so much loneliness and emptiness. Then today, i put on some very dark make up to make my crying look dramatic (idk why it helps me cope at least i feel like im in a movie or something its do stupid....) anyway i felf euphoric with the make up, felt so hot and sexy i couldnt even think of reasons to cry anymore. all the pain and the motives weres still there i just seemed to not care because i felt so powerful. then i went to the shower with the make up on and cried for a little. then i had luch, took a nap and woke up feeling so fucking empty. that was around 6pm. its now 2am and i've beeb crying since. i feel so empty. i feel so awful. idk why i just feel like no one truly cares for me. i feel alone in this world i feel like im grieving a loss but no one even died. i feel so awful for existing i feel gross i cried so hard tears fell on the floor and in my ear. i just cant stop. my head hurts so much my eyes are so swollen. my room is so messy and gross and i feel disgusting because i feel like there's nothing ahead of me life feels so pointless i hate existing like this i hate it i miss being hugged and touched and having people genuinely like me for who i am. i dont ever want to leave this bed again i just want to drown in my own tears im so exhausted.

just had a massive fight with my mom, it felt like it was something bigger than me that I couldn't control (started crying and even slammed my door) and afterwords the only thing that I could think of as a solution was killing myself, I'm still feeling regretful for what happen, just want to stop being a burden to my family. This fight was one more confirmation that I hate being alive. I just feel like no one loves me they just "tolerate me" anyway so I want to know if you guys know/think that feeling these anger attacks may be a effect of being depressed or it's just me being fucking done with this life...

Please excuse my bad English, I'm not a native speaker.
I'm depressed again aren't I?
I've had a depressive episode before but I don't remember much of it.
It feels like there's a black hole inside me, sucking all the life out of me, it hurts so bad and I want to scream and cry but I can't do it, in fact I can't do anything. I've been staring at a blank screen for 3 hours now instead of doing my homework.
I absolutely loathe myself, I keep thinking 'how could I be any worse then this?' and yet every day I prove to myself I can and I know that people around think so too.
It's obvious, the first thing in the morning I hear is an angry mum or dad yelling at me to come out of bed and that's the only reason I do or more accurately 'try'
I try to hide how I actually feel, no one cares about it anyway, they never did. Even though I try to hide it, it doesn't always work and when I do show, they say I'm a crybaby, that I should stop overreacting. 
They don't understand that I'm not just grumpy or sad, or that seeing a friend is gonna fix it. Or they ignore it and hope it will go away, maybe it will but not because I'm feeling better but because I'm better at hiding it.
I've noticed that the things I liked have become a bore and even annoying at times, I wish I could like them again, so I don't have to pretend I do.
But to be honest, I'm a bore too, or a burden. A massive one that won't go away, I'm sorry I'm still here, I wish I wasn't too.
I can't even take care of myself, brushing my teeth or even eating feels like climbing a mountain, let alone sleep. I mean, I sleep more than ten hours a night and yet I can't wake up and stay up, I'm so tired it felt like I didn't sleep at all. 
I'm so done... I don't think I can do this much longer. Then again, I probably deserve it, it's always my fault, I should get used to that. I should care less, but I can't. When I have even the slightest chance of having to speak in class my heart goes berserk. My mind starts flooding with fear and I can barely manage to get out a 'yes' or 'no'. There's no way I'm turning on my camera in class, I'll spare the class this ugly mug, I've been pretending my camera is broken that almost cost me my grade for a test. That was 3 weeks ago, I think… I don't remember. I can barely remember anything at all. That's no wonder when you don't even feel real. I sometimes feel like I'm a ghost looking over my own shoulder or that I'm in VR and the world around me isn't real, I wish it wasn't. I have considered hurting myself again, but I didn't. Not because I didn't truly want to or felt the urge to, but because I'm a whimp, if I wasn't such a scaredy cat I could've been outta here and yet here I am, sadly. I can't even go to a therapist myself, because I'm in wheelchair.
Ugh, I need help and I don't know what to do anymore…

No one ever fucking listens to me, why are my problems never big enough, why does getting raped not matter, why does coming home with my clothes soaked in blood from bullying not matter because it was two years ago, why do the lasted effects of childhood trauma not matter, why do I need to get over it, why am I not good enough, why am I not strong enough, why am I took scared to take my own life, why am I not good enough to anyone, why don’t I mean anything to anyone, why didn’t I kill myself two years ago, why didn’t I do it in front of my mom, why didn’t I do it at the school, why couldn’t someone find me with slit wrists, why couldn’t someone call the cops on me, why couldn’t I be in the hospital, why do I not try hard enough, why can’t I be dead

I just have to vent.

I fell into the worst depressive episode of my life in late 2019. Spent about a year in a hellhole I was certain I would never escape. Luckily, I eventually did, but still struggle with some residual symptoms. Currently in treatment.

2020 has been the worst year of my life and now 2021 seems like it's going to be just as bad.In early 2020, it turned out my father had stage 1 pancreatic cancer. He went through surgery, went through chemotherapy and all went well.

Then one of my cats got ill and we had to put it down.Then it turns out our second cat has a tumour and probably have about 6 months to live.When you thought it couldnt get much worse, my father became ill again.Now he's in the hospital and the doctors tells us he has about 1- 2 weeks to live. He isnt even allowed to eat due to complications of the surgery and his entire gastrointestinal system is completely fucked.

And just to top it off, I'm suspecting I have covid-19, in which case my entire family has it. And there's a 10 day mandatory quarantine even if the tests come back negative.I have no idea how to tell them. I have no idea how to tell my siblings they cant see their father in his last moments on earth because I might have covid-19. He have to die alone in a hospital, surrounded by strangers.

I'm sitting here just...

This is just comical at this point, but I cant even laugh. I cant even absorb this in any way, I've just emotionally shut down now.

Recently my dad found out I had a bunch of missing assignments in one of my classes, I could tell how mad he was just through text. I mean I never really see people type fuck in a text before unless it's a joke. I barely ever hear him say it, that's usually my mom. I told him I would try, and he said I had to do it, not try. I couldn't do it. I had 3 weeks and I got like 3 assignments done out of the 41 (we get like 2-5 a day). Any time I went to do them I would open the computer, and then either close it, or just start at it for 30min. I didn't have the energy for it or any motivation. I mean why am I even doing it, just so I can live a worse, more stressful meaningless life. Ever time my parents confront me about missing assignments, it gets really bad. Last time I felt so drained and empty, and I felt like they hated me to the point where I just needed to get out of there for a little bit. I started to walk down the driveway, and my mom screamed at me to get back inside, then told me that it was just missing assignments and that I have no reason to walk off like that. The rest of the day I just layed down in my bed telling myself how much of a disappointment I was. Then at night, I always say goodnight and tell them I love them, no matter how mad I would be I always say it. I wasn't mad at them anyways, I was mad at myself. When I told my mom I love her she just sat there and asked if I even meant it and nothing else. I was completely broken all that night. She didn't talk to me for a week too. It's my life anyway, like, just let me mess it up and move on, because life I guess.

That class I had a c+ in btw.

The class now, im going to have a D I'm sure, and it is already a C. And I got a 0 on the exam. And I told my dad I would do it. My mom doesn't know, because he found out before Christmas, and I didnt want to ruin my mom's mood. Now, I'm not only scared of what my mom will say, but my dad too, last time my dad listened to me after my mom went to her room. Now I have zero support. They don't know what this is like. They are going to say that I spent all the time I should've been doing the work playing games. Little do they know I've lost interest in my favorite hobbies and now spend my days sleeping and laying down scrolling through my phone, thinking about how bad the next day will be, just waking up to more life. Normally I try to fight back in these arguments, I don't think I could bring myself too this time. It's just pointless trying to explain everything. For once I tried, and just couldn't do it. Everything they say about me will be right. "You're just fucking lazy" they'll say, and "just do the fucking work". They expect me to be able to get all A's all the time, like there isn't a single class I can't do. I would get a B and they'll just tell me I'm not studying enough.

I'm afraid of how this argument will affect me and my relationships with my parents. And if they take my phone, I don't know what I'll do. Last time I had an argument, I was going insane, I was crying, laughing, and yelling all at the same time, i don't know what was happening to me, I just couldn't stop, I was just so mad at everything me, my lack of ability to do any stupid thing, and my parents for making assumptions.

If they take my phone, instead of spending all day on my phone, I will be spending all day laying down with me. When I am alone with nothing to do, my thoughts take over me. I rant for hours about random stuff I can think of, or I beat myself up over old stuff, or just for being me 

What do I do about this? My dad is the only person I feel comfortable talking to about my problems, I'm afraid of being alone. Is there someway of going about this that doesn't involve telling them about my (self-diagnosed) depression? I know I should tell them, but I can't, at least for now.

Growing up I got made fun of. I was the only african american and hispanic girl in my family. I was called blacky even tho I'm caramel complected. I was also called shadow still to this day I never understood what the name shadow ment. I have really bad depression and anxiety as well as being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This all stems from my child hood and it has caused me so many issues as a adult. Trying to make friend while having anxiety is the absolute worst while most judge others I judge myself daily. I make it seem like I am ok but I am not okay. I have gotten called ugly my whole life so it's basically installed in me. Even on my preetiest days I feel ugly. I tend to push people away due to me judging myself for them if that makes any sense. Venting a bit on here. Anyone open to chat/ share your story with me?

Hi, I’m 20F. Basically my grandma died yesterday and it’s the first family death that has impacted me horribly. Everyone else was either really distant or we were prepared for it to happen. I’m so so so sad. I’ve never felt this, I knew it was coming. My heart breaks everytime I look at my mum because I just see sadness in her. Her mum and dad are both gone now. She lost 2 brothers and a sister. Her mum was her rock. I want to be strong for her but I can’t stop crying. And when I cry my mum gets even more upset. I just can’t. Like every time I think of my grandmas bedroom, or the fact we can’t FaceTime her anymore, or the fact that all our family back home is grieving right now, I break down. I make breakfast for my mum and sit with her in her room sometimes but it’s so hard because spending time with her makes me just wanna cry with her and at the same time seeing my mum cry is easily the worst thing I ever have to witness. Anyway I’m just wondering how you all pull through death of a loved one and comfort family. I can’t stop crying and I get migraines from crying so it’s literally the worst cycle. I’ve also been dealing with severe anxiety and depression over the past 11 months and I feel like the anxiety is putting really horrible scenarios in my head now that this has happened. 

TLDR: how to comfort parent when grandparent died

ive been taking Zoloft 50 mg for about 8-9 months now, it started a little difficult but within the first month i was improving nicely, i kept on getting well on it until very recently (past few weeks).. i read about this and some people suggested its because of life changes that cause new stressors which is true in my case.

i have an appointment with my therapist in about 10 days and i think i should bring this up to her but im scared because what if she puts me on a new medication and i need a whole month to adjust to it? i cant afford the time to do this because my midterms are starting and the side effects would make me struggle a lot more than i already am

also, i have been experiencing a lot of guilt for needing the meds and having depression in the first place, however im too uncomfortable to bring this up to my parents or even my therapist

has anyone had a similar thing happen and has some advice to offer? anything to ease my stress about the situation would be very much appreciated


[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l04vi0/im_a_disappointment/
Today, after my dad told me to go on a zoom workout for my rowing team i used to be part of, and when i told him i already worked out today, i realized something. I'm a disappointment. It took me 15 years but i now know. My dad is disappointed in me. I'm just not sure what he wants me to do! Let me list off what he wants from me.

1. Be completely healthy and fit
2. Go to Harvard
3. Do stuff he wants me to do
4. Work in government

I cannot accomplish all of these.

1. I am fat and I am trying so hard to become better, but I don't have his support. I've seen results but he cannot accept that. It hurts every time.
2. Come on. Really? My dad is Indian and EVERY Indian dad wants their child to go to Harvard. And even if I do excellent in school and become a prime candidate to go to Harvard, there still is almost no chance of me getting in.
3. He doesn't like anything that I do. And I feel like I spend my life trying to please him.
4. I dislike politics. It always puts everyone in a bad mood. Why would I want to do this?

I just feel like I don't remember the last time my dad was genuinely proud of me. I don't want him to know how I feel because then he will feel like a failure. But the truth is. I'm the failure. He always talks down to me. I celebrate little wins I get but he can never accept it. I say, "Hey look! My arms have doubled in size, I have never felt more alive! The gym is working!" All he can tell me is that I haven't done anything and that I still have my gut. It's not right that I talk down about my dad but I can't just suppress these feelings anymore. Sometimes I just want to jump out of my window and maybe their lives would be better without me disappointing my parents.

A friend of mine told me 95% of people who kill themselves didnt know they wanted to kill themselves toll 5 minutes before they did which has me paranoid I'm going to get the urge to do it one day. I'm very nihlistic.i dont see much point in life but  I dont want it to end. The thought of death terrifies me and i think it's a foolish thing to do. I have depression and anxiety and feel life is pointless and sometimes get sick of living it but I've never in my 27 years felt an urge to kill myself... should I be worried it may happen one day? I dont take medication for my anxiety or depression because since I dont feel like killing myself I don't see a point further more I'm scared TO start taking medicine because I've heard so many times people have to find the right medicine and a lot of times getting the wrong medicine makes you suicidal.

I get sick of life. I feel like there's no point. But I figured people who kill themselves usually think about it for awhile... maybe I'm wrong. I dont want to kill myself and the way people talk it's like people dont have the choice when they do it and it just comes on randomly.

Living with dual diagnosis and expected to function “normally”  is so hard. The mood swings, disassociating, anxiety...on top of being a mom. I’m 26 with a toddler and I feel so trash when I she wants to play and I can’t even get out of bed. Or crying in the bathroom like it’s sound proof. I feel like a big waste of space. But if I die then she’s alone. And will probably be depressed. And so badly I want to be a good mom and give her all I never had. 

I swear it hurts even more only living for someone else. What’s wrong with me that I can’t live for myself?

I've been on a collage course and my lectures are awful due to the work load I have had to work without eating or any free time for weeks on end. During this I've had no money and my mum abandoned me and my younger brother and now we have both been kicked out.

After a lot of other things one I realised I was abused as a child ( emotionally) and two I am currently being assessed for autism. 

I pushed myself as an artist so hard for my course and eventually I ran out of ideas and just did that would set me the most marks. I now cant create any more I have lost my creative spark which is awful as it's my hope to get a career in the field but I cant if I cant make any art.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l095us/i_hate_who_i_am/
It feels like I have no control over being me. I have no way to change who I am. And I feel like the person I am, is the exact opposite of what people want someone to be like. I push everyone away, out of fear of actually having a reason to live. I hate the way I look, my priorities, my personality, everything.

I have no effort to start my assignment thats due in 48 hours that we’ve had literally months to do. I’ve been getting below average grades for months. I lie to my parents about reasons why, “oh my lecturer didn’t give us any help” and “oh it’s just a mock-exam” and I hate it.

I’ve been out of work since march due to the pandemic, but have been on furlough. I’ve been trying to make myself happy with impulse purchases, and even took money out of my savings that my grandfather left for me when he passed. It’s made me hate myself so much, knowing it’s going to waste. 

Another thing is, I honestly hate sleeping so much, It probably sounds completely opposite to what most people suffering with depression say, and that they look forward to the escape from being awake. But man, it terrifies me. I hate not being conscious, despite being depressed 99% of the time I’m awake. The feeling of having no control while sleeping, terrifies me. I stay up until 6am everyday, and wake up at 3pm (the only reason is that my sister is a teacher and comes home around then). Sleeping, and feeling like I’m missing out on something, anything terrifies me.

Meaning; here on Reddit. Where can I read up?

I'm kind. And a do stuff to myself that's hurting. I've often told people I hate myself, or rather don't care about me. 

It is like I'm angry with myself - even though I know I'm kind to people.

It's weird. I don't really wanna feel sorry for myself. Some say depression, some say bipolar. 

I dunno. Whatever. It's the Internet and here you go.

Ok, so I want to start off by saying that I am 17, and I am a bisexual male. I live in the bible-belt of Wisconsin in the U.S. I grew up homeschooled and was a fundamentalist Christian. I deconverted a few months back after accepting my identity as bisexual and queer (in more ways than one) I realized it was all fucking bullshit. Now my family has a long history of mental illness. And I mean seriously fucked up. from the age of 15-16 I struggled with self harm. I really hated myself. And I pushed back who I was and it really fucked with me always pretending to be someone I'm not. I have had such close calls with ending my life, and it saddens me to think about how many other LGBTQIA+ teens who were never out of the closet killed themselves because of self hatred. Recently I have been doing a lot better with my mental health, but I'm still not out to my parents. And I present way differently then I wish I could. I really love who I am now, but I cant really express it. I want to be able to dress how I want, use the colors I want, paint my nails, get piercings etc. But I cant do that living where I do, my dad would be furious. And I dont want to be put in danger. So me and some friends are planning a trip to Florida on the 31st. We are visiting some friends and are gonna stay there for a couple weeks. I dont plan on coming back home.  My brother lives down there and needs a roommate, and I know of some available jobs down there. My parents most likely wouldnt do anything anyways. Maybe get pissed off, but I dont think they'd call the police. Ive lived away from them before. Anyways, I just wanted to vent...

It’s lockdown here and it will be for a few months. I can’t function without Ritalin and weed everyday. I’m craving romantic affection so fucking much. I don’t think being single from 15-17 as a pretty average guy is healthy. anytime i find something good it doesn’t last long. Nobody reaches out to me anymore. It’s like everyone in my life has forgotten about what i deal with. My parents don’t even believe i’m depressed despite my gp’s diagnosis and the fact I display so many symptoms openly in my household. I’m getting to the point where i’m getting weed on tick (owing money by a certain time) because it’s the only thing in my life right now that feels good. And there’s so much pressure for school, i’m in my final year and our government won’t tell us if we’re going to have exams yet. I’m just so goddamn tired of living like this

it’s stupid, i know, because i can live on without any treatment, it’s just another issue to pile on to the mountain of other worries i have that make me feel like shit, it’s so tedious- why can’t doctors / gps / nurses help or at least give me a proper diagnosis for things for some clarity 

nothing major, just issues with painful periods and me being hard of hearing,, not knowing what to do with myself about them just makes me feel so disconnected from the world, how can i begin to love myself if i can’t understand what’s going on with me in the first place? 

and it’s not like i haven’t tried to get them sorted, i’ve been turned away by doctors for my problems, or they just do a few check ups and say it’s fine or how nothing is guaranteed, i’m just tired and want to know what’s really going on with me and how i can become better

Hi

I am a 20 year old full time student in a university in Florida. I'm currently in my third year of getting my bachelors in Finance. I work for one of the biggest tech companies in the world as a technical advisor at home (corporate sector), I work part time and even though I don't have a very high paying job currently, I have full time benefits and frankly there would be a lot of opportunities for me within the company once I graduate and be able to work full time and possibly relocate. I have a 3.6 GPA, and I am one of the best advisors within my team at my job (statistically).

I have considered becoming a professor, so getting my PhD in finance or a related field and staying in research/academia. This would mean that I would skip getting masters and go through getting my PhD right after getting my bachelors. Furthermore I really would like to get into a target school even though I am not in a target school for even my bachelors. (I goofed off in high school and did not try at all for my SAT), in order to even have a chance that would mean getting at least a 700 on my GMAT and have a great GPA and some great recommendation letters as well. 2021 would have to be the year where I have to do all of that in addition to working so this is where my challenges arise.

I'm severely depressed and have suicide in my mind every minute of my life(for couple of years now), the only reason I haven't taken my life yet is because I have a family that loves me very much and I don't want to make their life that much sadder and make my parents think that they were failures because frankly they have done their very best for me and I love them to death for that, and I don't have any more expectation for them. I also have Anxiety and ADHD, and I find it very difficult to get up in the morning, if I had the ability to erase myself from my parents mind and leave I would do it in a heartbeat but I can't, so i'm holding on as much as I can but I don't know how much longer I could do it. 

While COVID-19 made me stay at home much longer and made me gain a bit of weight, I can still get girls and if I want to I do a great job socializing with all age groups. I drink socially but I tend to smoke a fair amount of weed, and there are a very few people in my life (girlfriends and EXs) that know that I have depression, and I feel the way that I do.(my parents don't know) My father has been battling with depression his entire life and I think that my mom is getting depressed too, but not close to how I feel I like to add, and to be honest other than my parents there are alot of cases of depression in my family. Idk if this is relevant but i added it anyways 

So here is my dilemma, even though I know that nothing a person on reddit can say to help me with my depression and other mental issues, I need some advice for my professional career. I want to quit my job and only focus on my GMAT and school, this would give me some free time, and only make me focus on school but there are issues with it. First of all I have a great job and people in my age group would kill to have my job, I'm insured throughout and I have stock options and tuition reimbursement (even though i get grants from Financial Aid), I work from home, and i'm pretty good at my job(i feel good a bit after my shift but I feel as the job takes a lot out of me sometimes). So if I quit I would need to either stay with my parents or take out loans to pay for my housing (tuition is fully paid for) (i would take out loans from 1 year only since getting in a PhD program would pay for my tuition and housing) I recently moved back to my parents after my rent lease was over because all of my classes are online but I want to possibly move out very soon. 

I feel like quitting the job and having more time for myself can be better for my mental health but I only work 20 hours a week and it’s a great job, so please give me your opinions.

Thank you in advance.

I have treatment resistant depression and I'm doing a treatment that basically puts you in a sedated, dissociative, altered state of mind. I've found that it makes the brain more receptive to new ideas and thoughts during the 45 minutes when it's at it's strongest. I find it difficult to direct my own thoughts in that state but I found listening to a video about letting go of your lonely core self really helped. Ideally I'd have my therapist in there with me but since that's not possible I'm wondering if anyone can suggest a good YouTube channel or podcast or something that is just like positive and healing affirmations? Something to kind of guide my thoughts in a positive direction.

36 and feel like I've made so many bad decisions since I was a kid and now they're all coming back to bite me hard. I never knew how too make friends. Was too immature and thought other kids hated me because I was  annoying and kind of gross and had add. I'm still a virgin and the last person to like me got fed up and left. I don't blame them, but there's no one now. My mother got tired of me too. I don't blame my parents, but there's no way to fix it all now. I'm unemployed, hate every job I get and I wish I could start over, but I have so much haunting me now that there's no way at my age I can begin to try to get up and start over. I feel invisible. Just want my time back to fix what I broke.

Today coming home from school alone I wanted to murder everyone I walked past and all along the way moaned loudly enough that everyone could hear. Somehow I think that may not be healthy, I'm gonna go use my desperation as a jump pad to ignore my anxiety tmrw and try to get help somehow, I'll go try to talk about my depression to friends I sort of trust. 

Hopefully writing this will remind me the importance of getting better. Someone on this subreddit said to not linger too long here to get better, I'll take the advice and call it a day. God damn self improvement is a piece of work. Will it actually get better? Not this year with this fucking pandemic. I've been an unhappy lonely introvert for so long, and before this pandemic started I actually was starting to socialize a lot more, and then BAM. Fuck you all your efforts were in vain. Now instead you have to live with the facts that you can't go to parties you finally enjoy or have any important senior high school experiences because of your paranoid family and because you've lived far from all your peers for many years.

Im so lonely wtf. Im surrounded with people who don't have these problems to this extent, and it just makes me so fucking sad because they all think I'm nice to be around, I'm just wondering how much I would've enjoyed this year had I more favourable conditions. Why did this pandemic shit come around right when I start to have a life, and on my last year of high school too, now I know my entire school life was been wasted.

Can't be bothered to reread this, I'm just venting here to maybe see if it will calm me down. It sort of did but also I still want to kill myself and I know that my past 7 years have been wasted and spent just unhappy. Ahhhhh-hhh fuck this man why is life so unfair fuck im sick of trying to self improve bye bye gonna take a shower now cause im addicted to them even though it just leads to me having further suicidal thoughts and also bad skin because of the hot water but whatever i just want to not be alive anyways might as well pretend to not exist in the shower

Selfishness. I look at myself and that's all I see. I bring pain to myself and others around me. I know better then these choices I'm making so that makes it twice as rewarding. My life only exists to suck the the life out of others, their time ,money and emotions... I'm like a parasite that takes others happiness in hopes of satisfying my own but remain empty and add guilt to the list. I lie to myself until I think I can convince them that it's the truth. But the ones close see right through it. Where is the lifeline?! Everyone talks about it but it's not there. I wish I could put an end to this. Right now. I'm trying to decide if the pain of me doing this to myself would be more detrimental to them than to have me drain their happiness slowly for the rest of my existence. I hate what I am. Always have. Desperately running after the attention of those I admire. Something in me desires love so ferociously but I'm unlovable. My life has only brought burden, stress, confusion ,pain and unhappiness to the ones I care about. I am better off not existing. I am unhappy and tired of what I should do and hurt others when I do what feels good. Nothing about me could bring happiness. I'm sick to my stomach as I write this, as I think of the ones I love. The only thing I have given to my friends is fake laughter. I am worthless. These thoughts are so loud in my head. These thoughts tighten my chest, they never stop just keep circling around and don't even fade during the high. God, if you exist,DO SOMETHING!!! Or do me just one favor and  remove me from existence.

I miss my old life when I could do whatever drugs I wanted to and have actually freedom to live my life but now I’m a medical student that gets drug tested frequently and I spend all my time studying and having panic attacks about grades and thinking about driving into oncoming traffic to avoid taking a test.

Sometimes I don’t even know why I did this. I thought I wanted to be something better than just working at a bar and rolling all the time. But now I’m 200K in student loan debt and there is no turning back.

Sometimes I wonder if anything is ever going to make me feel as good as I did back then when I was always high. I don’t really think so.

a few days ago i posted here about me being numb, and how it sucked because a family member died and i couldn't react, well, my brain actually only realized yesterday what happened, my favorite person in the world left me...

i cried all night, i cried at the funeral, i still cry. 

listen, before this event i was already extremely depressed but now it's so much worse, i miss this person so much... i just want things to go back a few years.

now to what i wanna vent;

i think it's my fault, the death i mean, i really do.

i believe we live in a simulation and sometimes i cannot tell what is real or what is not, but i'm 92% that this was my fault, this because of two events;

in 2018 after my suicide attempt, i promised myself i would kms in november 2019 and no more than that, well i didn't and i went to 2020 alive.

in 2020, roughly in september i went to take my drivers license exam and the whole time i heard so many voices in my head telling me if i passed the exam something bad would happen and i would regret it, but i passed and i didn't felt happy; when i got home at the end of the day, my mom told me this family member was diagnosed with brain cancer and i felt so bad...and so guilty...

if only i died in 2019 or if i failed the exam, things would be fine.

&#x200B;

i'm so tired of my mind and my thoughts, it's exhausting, i just wanna be gone. no matter how much i try things only get worse.

I think the cruelest thing about depression is that it cripples the only defense humans really have which is their brain. I want to be like Viktor Frankl and think about everything so objectively that nothing hurts anymore. But my brain is compromised and I cannot defend myself. It sucks lol.

Sometimes I have a moment of rest and clarity where I can study my depression and the patterns I see. And I can formulate some sort of treatment/break the pattern based on my observations. But man, you really can’t do much with depression that goes in deep. 

I feel like everything and my perception of everything is fucked up. I feel like everything is ruined and I have no doubt society plays a larger role in my situation than just my brain. Depression isn’t just a personal problem/brain illness, there’s larger systemic issues in our society which people aren’t addressing that contribute to people’s sufferings/depression developments. Anyways I just wanted to say that because when I first realized that I got so angry I couldn’t feel sad anymore-
hopefully it does the same for you.  

Do you guys have any good song reccs during coping time?
I like listening to The Smiths, dandelion hands, girl in red, Bedroom, Teen Suicide, Wallows, Current Joys, Amine, and stuff. They’re mostly like indie peeps so hopefully  you’re into that I or you can give some recs . Sad music makes sad people feel better :)

While 2017 is the last year I can look back on and truly say was "decent" for me, I feel like I didn't appreciate every year before 2020 enough while it lasted even if some shitty things still happened. Last year was awful (both for obvious reasons regarding things that affected the entire world/the US, where I live and for personal reasons) and so far this year has still been just as bad as last year, if not more so. My mental health is getting worse, I'm getting stressed and angry more often and I have lost my motivation. I really want to do better, but I can't focus or push myself at all. At the same time, I always just have that voice in the back of my head telling me I don't deserve to be alive. One minute I'm telling myself that nothing matters so there's no reason to do anything, and the next, I'm chewing myself out for being lazy and worthless. I feel a sense of guilt each time I let another day pass by, since time is going by so fast that I feel like every day I've lived is a day wasted. I'd say I don't know what to do, but I know I could probably try to get help and I just don't because I get the sense that I'm faking all my "problems" and that other people have things so much worse than I do. I deal with the same things every day and can't find a way out. I've been getting headaches every day, I have no appetite for anything other than coffee and I have absolutely no energy or will to do anything but stay in my bed and live the exact same miserable day as I have for months. It's a miracle I'm even able to force myself out of bed anymore. I can't even imagine myself being able to succeed in life, so I won't even try to. Fuck it. I don't care.

 my brain is degraded and i also have brain fog. but the weird thing is... im even lacking common sense nowadays and critical thinking. like i cldnt understand anything or form an opinion on anything. put me in a debate, i wldnt be able to argue or defend my position..... but atleast im aware of this. 

literally anything i read online doesnt register in my brain. i dont grasp much and i am not capable of giving a proper response... like if you are in a debate, you are required to know your facts and thinking critically... and i am not capable of that whatsoever.

My friend died from NeTs syndrome, I wanted to go to the funeral but my parents got covid and I didn’t know if I had covid or not so stayed home. I was tested negative and overall I’ve been depressed. Many say talk to a therapist and I’ve already had one say go out and enjoy your life... um no. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

I felt vulnerable yesterday commiting that im selfish cold person who never appreciated someone's attempts of loving me unconditionally. Although im the kindest person you would ever meet but i would say he is much kinder. 
This is not the first time i feel vulnerable commiting my guilt but its much harder because he means a lot to me, i didnt do him anything wrong but made him feel like im an agnel who keeps on loving him whilst im just tired of love as much as he is. 

I feel awful not because what i did is a major unforgivable thing 
But knowing that i caused him lots pf problems because of my angelic look.

How can i feel better? My back hurts now and i didnt answer a message, all my friends are worried but i couldnt answer,im ashamed. 

Im fighting the suicidal thoughts cause im not this kind of people but i feel like i dont deserve living.

Hi friends. Looking for some relationship advice. My partner has been depressed for a long time and we recently moved in together. I don't think I realized how bad it was for him, and now I find myself taking on the role of a caretaker more than a partner. I want to be supportive and we regularly talk about his feelings. But I find that he usually doesn't care for his basic needs without help from me, and that's really difficult. It's hard to connect with him in an emotionally intimate way. He often seems distant, like he's hardly here. I'm questioning what role I play in our relationship. I can't be responsible for his basic needs like showering and exercise. But if I don't step in, those needs won't be met. I really want to stay together, I just don't know what to do. I feel that my emotional needs are also going unmet. Any advice? Thank you.

Discarded, or just ignored?  Can anyone remember the last time someone called you just because to see how you were doing? Or the last time someone actually made you feel like you mattered? Or what it feels like to belong somewhere? I can’t remember what any of things feel like.

Hello all,

I'm an immigrant to the US based in the SF Bay Area, CA. I came to my home country last month for a vacation. It had been 2 years since I saw my parents and I guess I've been bottling up a lot of emotional baggage cause depression hit me like a tsunami as soon as I got home.

Just for some background I've not been doing well financially. I was laid off due to the pandemic, a month after I started my first full-time job. As an immigrant I needed a job to stay in the country and I managed to claw my position back by working at minimum wage.

Coming back to the depression, I've never felt this way before. I've got crippling anxiety, and a desire to sleep because I don't want to be awake. I've cried uncontrollably to my mom atleast twice a week since I got home. I used to feel broken inside but now I'm also scared of how my declining mental health will impact me.

I've got an offer a for a new job that's paying well in a small city but I'm not excited about it at all. I'm way over qualified for the post and the nature of work (administrative/clerical) will not satisfy me at all. I feel like joining it would derail my career. Maybe the depression is taking over my thought process. Idk.

I'm still in my home country and I don't know if I'm ready to fly back to the US and be alone again. My parents are super concerned about my wellbeing. 

I'd appreciate any suggestions that would help shape my perspective and get me back up on my feet.

I feel alone so im reaching out pls be kind

Im 26F . My birthday was yesterday so i feel like that triggered another episode. Jk its been the same epi for weeks. So I had bad depression and anxiety the last 7 years but since aug 2019 to this day it is absolutely consuming. Crying for days like i just watched you murder my pet but nothing actually happened to me. Anxiety attacks where i panic and cant breath. Everything is going to shit as i get deeper into depression and this unknown area of myself. Nothings actually wrong but why do i hate everything and nothings fun anymore. My boyfriend wont leave me but he cant deal w my saddness either making me feel guilty for not knowing why its happening... 
sometimes my crying and saddness literally makes me wish i didnt exist, why? Whats wrong in my brain. So many opinions on depression to “ its your own mental state, its hormones, its genetics, its lack of purpose “ ....... Im not religious (sorry not sorry) but what can i do? Doctors have tried me with counselling and anti depressants before but right now im only doing acupuncture once a month for other reasons outside of mental health and counselling again ... why cant i just feel myself beyond the saddness or even get a 50/50 break instead of all day everyday. With covid, and moving i have no friends or anything except on the phone so thats not helping me, and now im this deep i feel no one can see my real self to even want to be my friend.. i feel sad w this. I feel guilty i cant snap my fingers to be fine or fake it to pretend.... Whats your stories, how am i similar to you? What helps you and why? Pls share

Hey mate.

I don’t feel comfortable talking in person about this so I thought I’d text it. I’m dealing with some mental health issues at the moment.

I have spoken to my doctor and we are meeting again this Friday. As of right now I’m just not in the right mindset to return to work this week. I will speak with my doctor this Friday to discuss myself going further. As of right now you are the only person I’ve discussed this with. So your discretion would be appreciated. I understand this would be classified under sick leave without pay. Thanks mate.

I just want a break and I know it’s all I need.
I want to go in a hotel in the middle of nowhere surrounded by nature and forest. I don’t want to have to worry about school, parents, grades, future, relationships and news. I want to be by myself, no technology, and no one but me. I want to be able to finally get a good night sleep and be able to enjoy life and not having school steal everything away from me. I want to go away and be forgotten. Go shopping in a small grocery store with no one inside and be able to dress like I want. Be able to sing my heart out and draw everything that’s on my mind without feeling scared to be judge. I want to forget everything and start over again. 

sorry if this is cryptic but I just felt like writing it somewhere

I have everything I need so far to work on my projects. I did all the research to know how to make it all work. But I'm so exhausted. I dont have the energy to take the step. I'm not in the environment I want to be in and it drained me. Everytime I get the drive to do something, something else gets in the way and kills my mood. The anxiety of being in my own world only to get pulled away to reality terrifies me. I know I still got a long way to go to get out of here, but I dont know how long I can manage this. All I can do is trick myself into moving forward so if I can just accomplish things little at a time for now.

-sorry for the big chunk of text-

Im currently a 21 year old with depression and adhd and Im so lost in my life. I feel stuck in an endless cycle and no matter what I try to do it never seems to workout for me. I was an average student and graduated highschool but after that is when everything started to fall apart. I had no idea what I wanted to do so I studied business administration did that for a semester felt bleh so I took some time away from school and then went back for IT again felt bleh and then went into nursing and I it wasn’t terrible but then the COVID happened and my classes went online I finished my semester and realized that it isnt what I wanted. Im current not enrolled as of winter 2021. I have no idea what I want to do with with my life and Im 30K in debt already. Im so stressed because I feel like I cant handle school right now but Im scared if i stop now I wont go back later. I want to get an education and a career and my parents want me to get an education and they dont know that i switched this many times and that I am currently not in school. I am just working part time 15-20 hours in my part time job as a supervisor making ok money. I know I wouldn’t mind being in this job for now or even a few more years if i worked more hours (which i can depending on how busy it is) but the most I can get is 35 which isn’t exactly full time. I just am scared that I might get stuck in this job and I dont know where to move from here. I did apply for some other full time jobs but its hard to find work right now because it’s January and COVID. I want to have a career but dont know how to go about finding one I would like and how I would get there. Im also debating what to do for school if i even go or i should just work. I feel like Im behind all my peers my age and I don’t know what to do. Im also stressed because I dont know what to tell my parents because they aren’t exactly understanding and don’t believe in adhd and depression etc. Im also scared they might kick me out for not going to college anymore. Im so stressed! I just wanna live in the mountains herding sheep \U0001f62d

I was in the bathroom. Everything was ready. I left a hateful suicide note and grabbed the bag I was going to suffocate myself with. Everything was fine until I faced my reflection in the mirror. For the first time in forever, my hair looked beautiful. I stared into the mirror for a few seconds before I dropped the bag. I couldn't get myself to pick it up, and a tear rolled down my cheek. Soon enough, I wasn't able to see the mirror. I started to wonder if I really wanted to die, if I really was ready to end it all. I could hear my family talking, but had no idea what they were talking about. I started ugly crying as silently as I could, and fell onto my knees. I don't want to die. I don't want to live. I don't want to run away. I don't know what to do. There is no way out. Deep down, I still have hope that things'll get better. Hope is the most cruel feeling of them all.

I have so many issues for no reason and this is the best way i can express my feelings. Which is by writing. I just want to know what is that's wrong with me. When everything feels so right. I feel like I'm in this weird euphoric state nearly everyday. That i can't really understand. And this is when I'm sober. I just smoke weed nothing else. I try my best to be happy and find something in my life if purpose. But i can't feel anything. Yet i feel so much. Can someone please explain what's happening to me. 

I just wanna let go of everything. And be free. But there's nothing holding me back. Yet i feel so held back. I have everything i could ask for. Yet why do i feel so empty. Why does every good thing stay for such a short time in my life and mind. Why is it that the bad things are the only things that stay. People say you have a choice of what to think about, yet my does it feel like i dont. Why is the only thing that stays is the bad thing? How hard is it to be happy, when there's nothing there to make you sad in the first place? How is that possible?  How is it possible to suffer from nothing visible? What do i long for? Is it happiness? Is it love? Is it to be accepted? Do i deserve any of this? Why is my mind a complicated mess when everything seems so simple? Why do i despise myself when there's no such reason to do so? How do i fill this void in me? This emptiness darker then the shade of black, is it something I've done to my self or is it an accumulation of everything that's happened so far? The scars of cowardness are visible through everything. Yet I try to hide it through optimisticy. Just sitting and hoping one day my optimisticy becomes something true.

It never stops.

I ( M 14  ), have been depressed and anxious for the past 7-8 months now. My friends know i'm not really feeling good, but they don't usually take it too seriously. Suicidal thoughts have been coming these past weeks and I just don't know how to really tell people what's going on inside my mind right now and I don't know how to tell them the pain that's running through me right now ( mental pain).

I'm a uni student (UK) and have been at my uni accomodation for lockdowns 2  and 3. Before the pandemic began I'd already been suffering with depression for years, but the past year has really taken its toll on me. My depression has not only got worse but I've also developed an eating disorder and despite trying to ask for help my uni has done nothing for me. I don't have anyone to turn to, and with no certain end in sight any time soon I keep finding myself thinking 'What's the point?'. I've been trying to keep busy and I do at least 20 minutes of exercise most days if I can but nothing seems to be helping and I'm so unsure of where to turn. I'm ashamed to admit to anyone that I've started smoking too and putting on the weight from binge eating is only making me feel worse.

Does anyone else who's been going through something similar have any healthy coping mechanisms they could recommend?

I’ve had anxiety ever since I can remember and recently I’ve been feeling very depressed mostly because of my family. I’ve considered killing myself but just don’t have the guts to do it. I overhear them saying that they should ignore me because I’m putting on an act for attention. 
I feel so hopeless, I’m completely isolated and the people who are supposed to be my support system take mental health as a joke.

hi, i wanted to share my own experience with depression and mental health after spending countless hours reading other people's posts. you are not alone, and so many other people go through it too. if you are reading this, you are special and one of a kind. please acknowledge mental health, and spread love to others, the world, and yourself. 

i am diagnosed with depression at 15, but after talking it through with my physiatrists we figured out i developed chronic depression, starting at the age of nine. i was very suicidal and depressed growing up and i was deeply afraid to talk to my family about it because of the idea that they would shame me and say " you're a teenage who just wants attention ", so i kept my mouth shut. my intention was to never gain attention and pity, but instead to get help. it came to a point where last october i stopped going to school, i cried everyday and started cutting for the first time. i had never felt so alone and isolated in my life. covid doesn't help the fact that i can't go out. i barely talk to anyone, and i stay in my room all day so i didn't talk to my family as much. 

&#x200B;

my friends have always been there for me. they may be 15, but they emotionally carried me. they're sisters to me. if it wasn't them calling me, texting me, checking up on me, i seriously don't know where I'd be. i originally thought sharing my secret about depression would only cause them to hate me. i didn't want to bring my burdens onto someone else, especially the only real friends I ever made. turns out, my friends shared my stress and the load felt less heavy. every single one of my friends sat with me and spoke to me whenever i needed someone to talk to. i could lean on their shoulder whenever i felt emotionally vulnerable or unstable. 

&#x200B;

i cried when i finally told my mom i was depressed. she was shocked because i kept it a secret for so long. then she cried, hugged me, and told me that she loved me. that hug was everything i've been wanting my entire life; an older figure that i could rely on when things felt so impossible and out of place. the following week she took me to the doctors, and i was diagnosed with depression. now i'm taking therapy and we're looking at the idea of meds. 

&#x200B;

the people in my life showed nothing but support. 

&#x200B;

i wrote this post because i was lacking the will to live today. what are you living for? what is the purpose of your life? who are you living for? 

&#x200B;

i'm so grateful and appreciative everyone reacted with open arms and love. nobody rejected me, so instead, they guided me through it. that is the right response to give. right now the entire world is going through a pandemic, and things are already tough as it is. it requires nothing to love and to be kind. if everyone had a little more support, the world would be a little less hurtful. 

&#x200B;

it feels like my life is over at fifteen.i haven't even gotten to live long enough to get a career, meet new people, travel, accomplish a meaning with my life. how can it feel over when it hasn't even started?

I (16M) think I have lack of attention. At first I’d like you not to blame it on my age and better give me an advice 

I’m really trying to impress people somehow.  I post me playing crazy guitar solos that I don’t really like in my ig stories , I post some skate tricks. And all I think about is not how “good I am “ , “good job mate” , I’m thinking about how people will see it and think about me. Repost it or whatever. I feel like I’m trying to impress everyone. Show people that I’m “worthy” ? 

I don’t know, maybe I should visit a psychologist? I can’t focus on important things ,like studying for example. I’ll I’m thinking about is actually doing all these things to impress people. 

I can’t stay concentrated in public. Or when working.  I feel clumsy and abstracted. 

Understanding my actions , or let’s say my vision of them makes me feel miserable.  

I just feel left behind somehow.

Lately I've been feeling so off. I don't know if something is actually wrong or if it's just my anxiety. I haven't felt like myself. The world has kind of felt like a dream and I've been questioning EVERYTHING. "Is this real?" or "Am I dreaming?" and to think that way is such a sick feeling. I get myself so worked up that I begin to get so lightheaded and almost feel like I'm about to faint. I've been so tired lately I literally feel like I could close my eyes and sleep anywhere at any time. I'm so fatigued and exhausted. I keep telling myself that I'm about to drop dead or have a heart attack or stroke and then I scare myself and again get so lightheaded that I am almost in tears. I just want it to stop. I want to feel normal again. At one point I got so worked up that I ended up throwing up a few times. I got a COVID test just to be safe and it was negative. I'm going to my doctor asap for a physical and blood test. I just keep telling myself that something is wrong and that I'm about to die and it spikes my anxiety and gets me so worked up. I'm a M, 22 by the way. I take Prozac (40mg) and Wellbutrin (450mg) because I have diagnosed anxiety and depression. I've been really bad about taking my wellbutrin lately and honestly I go days without taking it. I think I may be feeling this way from withdrawling from it? I don't know. I'm so lost and so sad. I just want to feel normal again and I want to live my life without questioning anything. If you've got any advice or have experienced this yourself please let me know.. I feel crazy. \U0001f614

I’m going to try to keep this as concise and clear as possible but the brain fog makes it hard. 

TL;DR I’m almost 39 and have been depressed my entire life. I’ve been diagnosed with major depression, anxiety (GAD and social), and CPTSD. I’ve done so much work on myself and years and years of therapy, including EMDR, so now feel hopeless and like nothing will convince me that I’m not a horrible human being. I’m open to advice but please read the entire post. Otherwise, comments ok. 

I’m the youngest of my siblings. Also first generation, parents grew up in Mexico, had a middle school education. So grew up really poor and dealt with what I now recognize as traumatic events growing up. 

Shit that happened before I was 10

* Alcoholic dad. 
* Abandoned by dad. 
* Had to call the cops on my dad when he got too drunk and angry. 
* Poverty (the kind where I remember one can of food before food stamps came)
* Had to take cold showers or deal with utilities being cut off. 
* Dad was in a major accident, mom had to go back to work. 
* Dad became primary caregiver suddenly. 
* Got fat 
* Disciplined by my mom with the belt or fly swatter, whatever was within reach.

School was tough, not popular, and lived in the shadow of my super popular , skinny sister. 

When my dad left again when I was 15, I tried to kill myself and had my stomach pumped. It sucked but it’s how I finally got therapy, mandated by the hospital. My family is from Mexico and didn’t really believe in any of that. My mom had taken me to all these faith healers before. 

I got assigned a counselor and he changed my life. I got the help I needed. Things haven’t always been easy, I’ve had a couple  major depression relapses since then. I’ve also had some other tough shit happen but always managed my way out of the depression hole with meds and therapy. 

I’ve got a super successful 6 figure career now, my own home, a beautiful son, loving boyfriend, but I’ve relapsed into despair again. 

It’s harder to tell the voice that tells me I’m a huge piece of shit that it’s wrong. I also stopped my regular therapy during the pandemic , I don’t know why really. I’m still kicking ass at work, getting shit done, and most people would be shocked to know how I feel. 

That I hate myself, I’m a horrible person, even worse mother, and don’t deserve anyone’s love. I’m just this selfish, stupid, fat, bitch. 

I’m just going through the motions, like a robot.  Sometimes I feel like I’m just watching myself go through the motions because I have to. 

I feel like I’ve got no fucking reason to be depressed, logically I know depression doesn’t work that way, but I’m tired of fighting it. 

I don’t enjoy anything anymore, I’m sure my friends are tired of me never wanting to do anything. 

I did make some steps to get help and I guess that’s all I can do. Told my psychiatrist I wasn’t doing talk therapy and to hold me accountable. Now just need to follow up and call the therapist back to make an appointment. Fucking hold on and make one step towards help. 

I’ve also went on an audible self help shopping binge , even paid $750 for fucking MadeFor and did it for one month. 

But here’s the thing, I’m terrified it won’t help. I know all about self care, I know all the things that I’ve learned with therapy, done EMDR,  and there’s not anything I feel will help me with not despising myself. 

Every other time I’ve felt like this there were some external factors like shitty home situation or addict ex husband. I’m just disgusted with myself. I wish I could care for myself like I do others. 

I know how to put my oxygen mask on, but I don’t see the point anymore. I’ve done so much work to get help for depression MY ENTIRE LIFE , so wtf can they do now? 

They’re going to suggest new meds for the fucking 20th time in my life, therapy 1-3 times a week, but just have a BTDT feeling. I’m exhausted of that cycle. 

I’m not suicidal, but I also can’t say I would be upset if I died. 

I’ve got some hippy dippy friends who would probably say I’m being awakened or there’s some shift everyone is going through. I wish it was that , but I know it’s depression. 

If anyone else has ever been in a similar place I’d be interested in hearing about it and how you worked your way out. 

Thanks for reading this.

Has anyone else noticed a lack of true depression representation on television and media? Aisde from this reddit forum, it's hard to see a depressed person in media.

Because I suffer from really bad anhedonia (can't feel anything/can't feel pleasure), I often gravitated towards watching Dexter and making that character my favorite. Not because I want to kill people lol, but because he was the only person I knew in media who just couldn't feel anything normally. Of course he couldn't feel anything because he was a psychopath, but it was a warm feeling to know that there was someone else who couldn't feel /had blunted emotions.

In the end, Dexter wasn't completely like me because he got pleasure from killing people. But I get pleasure from nothing.

cause i want to go to therapy cause there’s something wrong with me and it’s affection my life so drastically that idk if i’m gonna live for a long time and i really need help to stop this pain mentally and physically but i just don’t care about myself enough to do anything about it.. plus i can’t leave my home without a reason to. it feels like i have a physical illness but i don’t think i do, i’m so shit in hospital bills just for them to say there is nothing wrong with me. i can’t even sleep cause all i do is have nightmares every night. I don’t know what to do cause i don’t like speaking to people so i don’t know if a therapist would help much but i’m tired of living like this,,,,I had solace in smoking weed but now if i take one puff then my heart beats super fast and i feel uncomfortable and i don’t know why, it makes me hate life so much. i know it’s my fault but i’m in such a bad place in my life and i don’t know what to do

i feel no happiness in life at all, i’m financially stuck and i dislike myself so much that i don’t care to do anything about it so it’s like a cycle. Thing is i’m very self aware and it just makes me more depressed, i’d kill myself but i have younger siblings and i don’t want them to be upset also i’m afraid of death , i just feel so stuck



















[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l00097/depression_in_college/
I’m currently a sophomore in college and have been struggling with anxiety and depression since my freshman year. I have always been a quiet kid who never said much but I always had friends growing up. I always knew that I would have to get out of my shell once it was time for college but when I actually got there the realization hit me hard. I made some friends but I started to get really depressed because of who I was. I wanted to be outgoing and fun but that’s just not who I was. That combined with school work and adjusting to being away from the comfort of home really made me quite depressed. 

I started Wellbutrin and citalopram my second semester my freshman year and it really did help. I joined a fraternity and really started enjoying college. Then of course covid hit and sent us all home for the semester. I came back sophomore year feeling good and I decided to go off my medication. Fast forward to the start of my second semester (which starts tomorrow) and I’m starting to feel depressed and anxious again. I have been feeling kind lifeless the past month and now that’s turned to anxiety and depression. I’m nervous about how this semester and my future will go. I’ve decided to go back on my antidepressants so hopefully that will help. Does anyone else have any other advice or encouragement? Anything helps. I’m probably just overthinking everything but I’m worried I’ll fall back into a dark place.



[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l02t1d/what_do_you_say_when_people_ask_what_youve_been/
I mean, I can’t be honest about it

“Oh I’ve been sitting around looking at my phone while contemplating my existence with going to the gym being the only somewhat productive thing I do on a daily basis”

So humiliating when it’s someone like a relative or old friend kicking ass in life asking you this.  They probably know the answer just by looking at me

Title. I'm sure on many reasons. But I have thought of killing myself for so long I just don't dare to do it. That "afterlife" is so scary to me.



[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l02r9q/trying_to_be_here_for_my_wife/
So I've had my own struggle with depression most of my life. I've got it handled, mostly, about as well as anyone can I suppose.  My wife... Not so much, and I'm trying.
She had a troubling childhood, highschool was brutal, she has PCOS which started then, she put on weight, got taller and broad shoulders, as well as facial hair. She took comfort in food.  PCOS gives her hormonal complications, particularly stress hormones, giving her a wicked temper.

She's just been properly diagnosed as diabetic, in addition to having been all but immobile the past year due to a knee injury, and hasn't worked since November 2019.

About once a month, usually around her period, things get a bit ugly. She told me she feels hopeless, doesn't want to live, the typical depression expressions. I listened, talked it out, explained it's just the depression talking and she will feel better. She did for a couple days (this happened Wednesday). Friday, she starts with clingy behavior, needing cuddles and tea and hot water bottles. In addition, she started nitpicking and nagging over little things, basically several instances of "why aren't you doing x THIS SECOND", despite my hands being full or otherwise occupied and about to perform the task of given a second to do so. Like, the kettle had just switched off and she attacked me for not pouring it immediately.

This culminated in a fight yesterday, where she's telling me I need to be reminded of everything and she's sick of having to do everything for us. 

We haven't spoken since and I'll need to talk to her shortly. When she gets that agitated, there's no reasoning, it's all dismissive and "she's right".

My question, does her behavior sound like an attempt to control the few things she can, when the rest of her life is out of control? Should I approach her with CBT techniques? 

I mean, and I'll say this to her as well, she's not wrong that she does more around the house, but she's home 24/7 and I'm only home 3 hours most days before bed, it's the explosion of rage and not allowing me time to complete a task before assuming I hadn't done it.

Appreciate any advice anyone can offer, as this triggers my depression as well, thinking I'm a terrible husband.  Can I help, or is it time to send her to see a professional?

I've been known by myself and my family for being the 'quiet one' that just sits in the car and day dreams for the whole drive. The type of person that doesn't talk much. I remembered recently that even from a young age (probably around 7/8) I used to be kinda dead to the world. When I was younger I used to cry about anything that happened and I remember my sisters used to say lots of things that upset me (even tho they weren't meaning it) and I would cry almost every day about little arguments and stuff. Have I been like this for longer than I thought? Was I just born like a little saddo?



[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzzn08/effects_of_taurine_while_taking_antidepressants/
Hey people,

I just started my increased dose of Amitriptyline 100mg (tricyclic antidepressant, very similar to SSRIs/SNRIs). It also blocks the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline. I also bought taurine yesterday because I read positive stuff according drive, motivation and mood and hoped it could be a little „add-on“ for my antidepressant therapy.

My questions:
1. Does someone here also take taurine and antidepressants at the same time?
2. Are there any theoretical dangers or risks combining taurine with an antidepressant?
3. What are the effects you get from taurine? Does it help with depression (mood, drive, anhedonia), social anxiety and/or cognitive deficiency (memory/focus issues) somehow?

Would you recommend combining taurine with antidepressants or is it a dangerous no-go?
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l06u8q/how_do_i_restart/
I'm not sure how to fully explain this, but I'll give it my best try. 

I was diagnosed with depression ten years ago, mid teens and I'm pretty sure I had it for a while before the official diagnosis. 

A sobering thought hit me the other day. I don't recognise the ambitious, competitive person I used to be. I cannot fathom how I was ever that person, and now there's something I have to face:

I've had depression and mental health issues for close to half of my life, now. When does this go from being 'not me', to no, no, this is actually who I am, when I've been dealing with this for nearly half of my life. My adult life has consisted of this entirely. How can I pretend this is an illness that I can get over, when this has been 'me' and my 'life', for nearly the majority of my existence? 

And I cannot for the life of me, figure out how to restart. How to pick up and reestablish myself. How to get back to what I was, or at least become something different to what I am now. 

Is there anyone here who knows? I've lost most love for life, all of my hobbies leave me feeling like there's a void in my chest, I don't even really read anymore. 

I just exist, and the space where I exist, I hate. I don't like it here, and I don't know how to fix that. 

Medication, therapy, CBT etc. I've had it all. What do I do now? How do I fix this?
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzuzny/i_fucked_up_again/
I should be at work right now but I was such a total dumbass and I went to the bus station one hour later so when I returned home and my parents saw me I covered this shame with another lie. I told them that I was called from work to tell me that my first workday was delayed and I will start tomorrow.

I'm so stupid. How do I get out of this? Tomorrow they will see me going one hour early to the station and they will see through my lie. My uncle always wonders how I got to be so stupid and my father is ashamed of me. I disappointed him. I am only a social parasite to him.

Please, tell me something to sooth my pain.










[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzxdou/the_mentally_draining_struggle_of_demisexuality/
I believe I am demisexual (32M), and to be honest, I've always really hated that, because it's made dating feel like an impossible task, and thus, I've been single and alone my entire life, and I'm just tired of being single and alone. I've only ever felt something for two different women in my entire life, the first almost a decade ago, the second right now. The first was someone I knew for over a year before I fell for her, she rejected me, and dropped me from her life.

The second is someone I've known for almost 5 years (she was in a relationship that entire time up until recently), and she's the best and closest friend I've ever had in my entire life. Romantic feelings aside, she's been a super important part of my life, and she continues to be my one true friend.

I've expressed my feelings to her, and it doesn't look like it's going to happen between us, but we had a good conversation, and we're still on just as good of terms as we were before. Actually, it feels like me telling her this brought us closer together, for whatever reason.

The problem is, I care for her so strongly and so deeply, that I don't know that those feelings will ever truly subside. I've never felt as strongly about anyone as I do for her. But not only will we not be together, but I'm also going to have to eventually watch her build a life with someone else. And most likely, I'll still be single and alone the entire time, because I can't seem to date, myself.

I don't know what the "solution" is here. I know some will suggest taking some space and time apart, or even straight up ending the friendship. I will not end the friendship, because she's my best friend. I need her in my life. I just do. And my feelings aside, I do want her to be happy, even if it's not with me, because she deserves that. Time and space haven't helped me so far; in fact, they seem to make me feel worse, because the more time spent apart, the more I miss her and think about her.

So I don't know what I am to do. I can't lose her, but I don't think I can get over her. I don't know what to do.



[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l06pl1/i_am_just_done/
the only times the people “in my life” are actually there for me are to tell me how “strong” i am and how this is “just temporary” and they “believe in me.” i don’t give a shit. i don’t care at all. i need help, and support, and love and no one is actually willing to share it with me, even my family. and then those same people claim to love me after writing off all my pain, and then they go 6 months with out ever reaching out to me or acknowledging i exist at all. 

and all these same sons of bitches will probably play up so many fucking theatrics at my funeral. but within a week i promise you their lives will be back to normal. no one will give a single shit. it’ll be like i never even existed. i’m not even sure if i fully do now. 

why did my parents have to give me all this pain just so they could have a cute little baby for a few years???

they say therapy is supposed to help but i’ve spent 7 years of my life in treatment. they say medication is supposed to help but it replaced all of the good emotions i used to have with mush. the best i can get with what i have right now is 45 minutes once a month, meanwhile i have 10 crises going on at once at any given moment and my therapist isn’t even specialized in what i’m struggling with. i can’t even come close to getting this hypothetical “help” with out having $1000 dollars a month to give to the people who are supposed to “help.” good thing i am so mentally ill that i can barely function so that’s something that will never ever happen for me!!

fuck this stupid fucking planet. fuck these stupid fucking people. i am done. it’s beyond clear that there’s no space that wants me. there never has even been close to someone who is genuinely happy i am alive and genuinely wants to be around me. i am tired of the lies, of being misled, of everything. i am done.

I miss who I was before and I feel like the only way I can get back to myself is by dying. I can’t love or trust or feel comfortable any more. The guy who raped me lives right above me and I live in constant fear. I don’t know what to do.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l06l4a/disconnected_and_melancholy/
Hello everyone! It's my first time posting here in this forum so nice to meet you all! 

I've had depression in the past but with help it's gotten a lot better. I don't have highs but my lows aren't as low as they used to be. I'm just neutral. However my main issue is my melancholic nature. 

I feel like there's always this air of sadness and melancholy around me and it makes me...well, sad. I've accepted that this might be how I'll probably be for the rest of my life. I know the future isn't set in stone but I just have a feeling that's how it might be. Or maybe things can change, who knows? Some days I have no problem with the melancholy because I'm so used to it. However, other days like today, it really gets to me. 

Another huge problem is that I feel disconnected from everyone. It's like everyone is connected by  strings but mine have been cut. I sometimes worry that I'll feel disconnected for the rest of my life. 

There was only one time I felt connected and it was when I saw an online concert. After the concert, there was a chat box and people from literally all over the world where telling everyone to go have a good night and wishing people well and it made me tear up. I felt connected to everyone in that moment. Then I cried before I went to sleep thinking, "Will I die without ever feeling connected to people?" I'm even tearing up right now. 

I think a big part of it is that I don't have people who share my interests so I'm alone and I don't have anyone to talk to about it who can relate. I just have full blown conversations with myself at 2AM. It's sad, I know. But it helps sometimes. 

This pandemic isn't helping either. I've always felt stuck but at least I could go outside and walk around and take the train and go to the park and museums. Now I can't do that because so many places are closed or have closed down permanently. 

I just want to travel and get away and maybe even start over but it's tough, you know? It's not impossible but tough (especially financially). 

Anyway, that's all I wanted to talk about. There's more but I'm having trouble formulating my thoughts right now. Thanks for reading. Take care and stay safe everyone!

I'm realizing I'm not well and the only thing I know to do is stay busy. Does anyone else live thier life like this? If I give myself too much time it's like I stall and just start spiring downwards. Part of me feels like I just need a partner to help encourage me and take my focus so that I can somehow relax without relapsing, but I don't know that it would be healthy for me or them either. I just get tired of being alone and I get tired of always running but I don't know how else to stay up. If you live like this how do you do it? How do  you keep up in the long term? Have you still managed to add some value to your life and relatuonships? Can someone with chronic depression really have a mutually beneficial relationship?

I tried to fill it with drugs like heroin but it isn't enough i have overdosed so many times trying to feel enough and with psychedelics i would go above and beyond and never get close id go psychotic first

Everytime i try to fill it its emptiness is more obvious to me i feel like i'm walking around with a black hole in my chest sucking up all my happiness 

Do you guys also feel like this? What is it? Is the emptiness i feel a lack of meaning or is it not empty at all and actually filled with my sadness or is it something else? How can i stop feeling empty i so hollow its hard to breathe i feel tired all the time and all i want is to die

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l06d50/please_tell_me_if_i_should_go_see_someone/
Hello people of reddit. I think I really need your advice before I would talk to my mom, I'm just not sure if should I start worrying. I feel like it might be depression. And I want to do something with it. Go see someone probably. 

So everything started with the second lockdown (end of the Oct). Firstly, I've lost my whole motivation. Yo. I was almost the best student, so made me distress. Then I've lost feeling of pleasure. I could do anything, and I won't feel anything, but to be precise, now I won't do anything; which makes me feel even lower. And when I hear of my boyfriend doing stuff I would love to do too I'm desperate. 

I started to have extremely low self-esteem. Always had, not on this scale. I have troubles with even listening to myself when I have to say something to a person who is not my mom, dad or boyfriend. I have like ''hits'' of self-hatred during day. When I look to the mirror. When I have to turn my camera on e-lesson, everyone's looking at me, judging me, It makes my cry. Some teachers make me so shy I started to skip lessons on purpose. I cry almost everyday, I feel extremely worthless and absolutely no purpose in my life. Zero. 

 I've always had problems with family. I don't have siblings. I know my parents love me but they simply don't understand me and my feelings, I think they don't like the moments when I occasionally open myself because they feel uncomfortable with the fact they don't know how to deal with that. Also my dad's alcoholic and I have some kind of trauma about spending time with family since I was 11. The best way to describe the way I feel is saying I'm **discouraged** to my parents. Anyway they try their best.

It's embarrassing but I think I also have problems with sexualization of older man..ya. Like my English teacher. It makes me even more shy and that's exactly lessons I sometimes skip. ''Fantasies are fantasies but these are real people''. So I truly don't want to apply my fantasies on the real people because It affects my behaviour in not good way.

I just really wonder if I have to go see someone. Do I?

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzyw2m/am_i_depressed_or_something_else/
I cannot tell if I am depressed or if I have something else.  For some context I have POF, aka premature ovarian failure.  That means that my hormones are all out of wack.  One day I would not be able to leave my room, and just not eat, shower or do anything else.  Then the next day I would be happy, laughing and just excited.  I went to my doctor and they said that my hormones are in normal range and that everything checks out.  So I  can’t tell if I am depressed or maybe have bipolar disorder.  I’m not sure.

I'm 21, about to graduate, and have no plans for the future. I hate life. I hate myself for being so unstable. I can't even figure out who I am let alone what career I'd want to spend my life slaving over.

I'm bipolar & am either reckless and over the top, or disconnected from reality, or completely hopeless, depressed and suicidal. I just got off the phone with my sister, who was asking what my plans are. I couldn't come up with anything & started bawling my eyes out, panicking. I never think about it because I just feel like I'll commit suicide someday. She was talking about how we need to have that conversation but I can't fucking face reality. It's too overwhelming & I'm completely directionless. Most days I just lay in bed and feel like the world isn't real. The slightest obstacle sends me downwards when I'm in a depression & I think I'm just a ticking time bomb. And now I know my sister is going to be worried and tell the rest of the family about how unstable I am and I fucking hate how people feel like they need to intervene. It makes it harder to just die already.

I fucking hate my disease & other people who expect me to just overcome it and integrate into society. What do I have to live for except an inevitable death? Fuck everything.

Good evening to you all,

For most of my adult life, I've been hit with recurring episodes of depression. I was formally diagnosed in 2009 at the age of 23. I was prescribed Fluoxetine/Prozac 20mg and I can't recall any significant side-effects apart from weight-loss.

With this latest episode (which started to get bad in November) I was once again prescribed Fluoxetine 20mg. My dose was increased to 40mg after 2 weeks... Then after a month in total I, in the space of a day, started to feel incredibly energised, excited, hypersexual & started thinking of all the fun, creative projects I  wanted begin/continue. This was a welcome relief after the depression had once again sapped away any joy that I found in my interests. BUT, it didn't feel right. I'm quite perceptive and it unsettled me to find that I had jumped from feeling suicidal and worthless, to elated and overly-confident in such a short space of time. I almost felt like I was chosen to undertake some sort of special mission. Chosen by whom and to do what, I don't know... Then after a couple of days, the good feelings started to fade and then were replaced by a kind of wired and anxious feeling. I was speaking to a concerned friend, and I was crying, but I sort-of felt excited and happy at the same time. Again, it was very unsettling, and not fun at all. Then a short, but deep depression hit me again.

I spoke to my Doctor, who decided to switch my meds to Sertraline/Zoloft 50mg. After a week, the same excited, hypersexual and weirdly happy feelings/moods coupled with depressive symptoms stayed with me. 

Again, I called the Doctor who prescribed Mirtazapine/Remeron 15mg. I'm about to take the first one... So we'll see how it goes. The Doctor mentioned a slight possibility of undiagnosed bipolar... I'm not sure about that as I've not experienced such intense feelings stated above before.

I've seen a lot of posts regarding SSRI induced hypomania. I'm keen to hear other peoples' thoughts on my experiences. Is it possible to have bipolar and not know it? I've read with BP II, the manic symptoms are more subtle and therefore are harder to spot...

We all have heard the phrase: "Come on, see things positively and be grateful for all the things you have, blablabla". However, as I learned, there is no such thing as reality happening to us, all your consciousness is just a hallucination created by the mind. That´s where we hear we should take responsibility of everything that we experience. Even if depression has some biological cause, it´s your responsibility find the root, get checked by a doctor and fix it, which is not filling out a questionnaire and getting antidepressants (I´m not advising you to simply ditch them if you´re on them!!! just saying they are only suppressing a symptom).

For myself any responsibility seemed impossible at first and I was suicidal occasionally. However, I was starting to take responsibility of two tiny things everyday for yourself and others, like watering the flowers, getting a glass of water, holding the door open for someone, etc. For example I thought: " Right now I myself will get my ass to the kitchen, fill a glass with water drink it, hydrate myself and do sthg good to me." If you find that too hard, you take a breath and bring oxygen to your organs who keep you alive 24/7. Over time it will become a habit and othese responsibilities will slowly extend more and more because you WANT to. You will have a drive to do good to yourself and the world.

 I don´t want to sound smart, I just want to share my experience so that every single one who reads this also becomes aware how much greatness sleeps within you.

I currently have a full-time job, I'm mentally and physically exhausted when I get home. 

So I spend my free hours and days in bed most of the time. Sometimes I watch useless videos or read books. But I spend hours and hours doing absolutely nothing, just lying in bed.

I can't get the strength or desire to do anything else and this makes me feel very guilty, I'm just watching my life go by while I'm paralyzed.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kznmla/depression_and_stage_4_cancer/
Last week I was diagnosed with inoperable stage 4 colon cancer with liver metastasis. 
I have more than 10 metastasis all around my liver.

I'm 27 years old, and I probably only have a year or two, or it could be only few month.

I've been suffering from severe depression that is untreated for more than 13 years now, and I feel like it's the main reason that the discovery of the cancer was too late, I didn't care about myself or my body enough. Even though I had symptoms and suspicion about having colon cancer, I didn't make any actions. I had severe abdominal pain and sent to ER but it was too late.

I do regret that I didn't go to doctor sooner, but part of me is relieved because this 13 years have been very lonely and miserable for me.

I have spent most of last 13 years inside of my house. Didn't eat well or sleep well. I don't have friends, and I don't really have a life, dreams or purpose. I don't have a thing that I'm not ready to give up.
I just feel like my life has been so pointless and I have been so ungrateful for the life I have been given.

My chemotherapy starts day after tomorrow but I can't stop think what is the point of chemotherapy, for some low possibility of getting extra few years of this for what?

I'm on my hospital bed surrounded by patients much older than me, but all of them are in better conditions than me, both physically and mentally. And that makes me feel like... I don't know, unfair? I feel like I've been drowning for so long now and no one was there to help me, and I wasn't brave enough to ask for help.

I am not close to most of my family, only my mother. And I feel sorry for her because she is the one who have to take care of me and eventually she will lose me to cancer.

I should probably get some help with psychiatrist, but I'm afraid if I get better with my mental health now, I would realize that I want to live and all the regrets throughout my life will destroy me. I don't want to deal with that since I don't have many time left. I just feel very old and tired.

I don't know what the goal is for posting this, but I guess I wanted to share about myself in somewhere. And who knows, maybe someone reading this will decide to go to doctor for their mental or physical health before it's too late.

Thank you.

She always sees me as a happy and energetic woman, how do I tell her that I don't even have the energy to get out of bed? I do not want to do anything. How do I avoid feeling bad every time I tell my mother that I don't want to see her because I feel tired?

Whenever I'm not doing school and just have free time, I feel apathetic and I dont really do anything. If I have school, I just feel sad knowing that this is the only thing I'm doing in my life, and its about to be over. After this is college, but I dont even know what college I want to go to or even what I want to do as a profession. I dont know if I'm depressed or if this is just normal for everyone during quarentine. My early college classes start tommorow, so I guess I'll be feeling something other than nothing at least.

I’m not happy. My life is headed nowhere good and nowhere fast. My parents divorced while I was in high school. My mother cheated on my father and when I confronted her about it, she told me I had to let her be with this other guy or she wouldn’t help me with college. College was paid by the divorce fund and my dads retirement fund. Moved from the Midwest to LA for acting college. Met girlfriend there. Moved in with her after first year (only year of college we could afford) and had a nasty run in with an entitled foreigner which made us leave California. Living with her family currently. Fixed things with my parents last year, but I’m stuck hopping dead end jobs because no one wants to hire an art student, disagree with authority figures at most jobs as they’re more concerned with commanding people and being right than actually running the business and giving the employees what they need to succeed. Fucked up with girlfriend by talking to someone else but was given a second chance to make things right. I’ve done whatever I could to make her feel safe with me and we seem to be okay but I can’t forgive myself for that. She deserves better than me. Can’t tell her about my suicidal thoughts as she shuts down because of her cousin committing suicide. Her parents constantly treating us like “lazy socialist cunts”. Girlfriend barely able to function. Ask her small things like to turn the lights off in our room when she’s not in there. Never listened to and then am told that I’m not giving enough. Tired of being loved only when useful. I know all of this sounds terrible but I really do love her and her family has it’s amazing moments. Her mom showed me more motherly love than mine had in 4 years. But if I continue this trend day in and day out, I won’t last. People of my family have never amounted to anything. We’ve never mattered outside of being useful. My choices are to stay here and suffer for the sake of my career or to leave all of this behind and go back home to my family and friends and probably settle for some mundane bullshit. Constantly torn because I never want to hurt anyone but there’s not an outcome without pain. Only 22 and strongly feel like I’m ready to go. I can’t see myself continuing on like this.

Hi, I've never been grounded before and my mental health has been terrible lately. My school recently went back to remote and I'm not sure i can do this anymore. Im grounded for 2+ weeks and am not allowed to leave the house or see any friends. Im a very social person (even though Im an introvert) and seeing people or going out in nature makes me less depressed/suicidal. I self harmed 15 minutes ago and honestly don't think I can go these 2 weeks without doing it again. I feel so upset and angry. I tried getting ungrounded but my mom yelled at me so I yelled back at her. I don't know what to do. I feel so depressed and overwhelmed. I feel like I'm just going to end up getting in more trouble after my depression starts to get worse and I get angry at everyone around me.

So I know this isn’t super bad compared to what other people go through but I just had a hurtful realization today and I just can’t get out of it. I have OCD, Depression, Anxiety, Body Dysmorphia, Social Anxiety, and PTSD. I have lived practically all my life with these. I manage with them and I was fine with them because I was isolated most of my life. My sister is my best friend and my parents always thought that keeping us from things was helping us from said things. So I never really had friends growing up. I wanted friends but my friends were never “good enough” deemed by my parents. After a while I just stopped trying to make friends. My social anxiety didn’t really help either. Well I am married and on my own in another state and I’m realizing the crushing loneliness. My husband is my best friend and I love him and he understands me. He was excited to take me to another state because of my mental state of being in the same state/city as my parents. Well to end my long story, which I apologize for, I am turning 22 in April. I got excited because I really wanted to plan a birthday party because I saw all of these parties people were having (safe social distancing guideline ones of course) and I realized I don’t even have one friend to invite. No friend to talk to. Anyway, just felt like I could get it out of my head here. It’s hurting me to keep it inside.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l05n0f/food_anxiety/
I feel like I’ve developed a very strange relationship with food lately since my depression has been increasing. 

Most of the time I have no appetite which I know comes from my depression, but when it comes down to deciding what I need to eat for dinner, it is such a trigger for my anxiety. Does anyone else suffer from this? 

It’s like I start thinking about how I need to eat soon so I can get on with my night and hopefully sleep well (I also suffer from insomnia now so I try to eat earlier dinners). I start thinking about how my night is coming to an end and the anxiety for the next day sits in. Additionally, I just can’t even decide on what to eat, meanwhile my stomach is in pain from not eating enough. Idk if any of this even makes sense but I’m starting to think about food in a toxic way I think, and it even brings up body dysmorphic thoughts for myself.

Also, when I do decide on something to eat- and something goes wrong with that meal, I’m embarassed to say that I lose my shit and can’t calm down. For example, I decided to order bdubbs wings the other day and I accidentally hit sauce on the side rather than the wings coming covered in sauce. This is such a minor issue it should not have been a big deal to me, but it upset me much more than it should have at the time.

Any advice? Any thoughts? Anyone else going through the same thing?

     My demon's name is Abigail. (Don't say it three times or she appears, I think.) Once I designated my apartment a positive energy zone, I started making Abigail wait outside. I turned up my music a little too loud and cleaned my kitchen. I shaved my face and took a cold shower and put on a nicer shirt than the holey band tee I'd been rotting in all weekend. I held myself accountable. I built myself a sanctuary. I praised myself.

     This is my head. This is my home. This is my heart. These are my feelings. Noone can love me like me. I'm a machine.

We have been friends for like 3 years now. She had these problems from the beginning of our friendship. At the start everything was fine, we talked about her problems a lot and eventually she successfully recovered from bulimia. On the other hand she still struggles with depression and self-harm to this day. I listen to her vent every single day, but I think I just can’t take it anymore. I’m tired of stopping her from self-harm and suicidal actions. What can I do to make her seek a professional’s help or even what can I say to put her in a better place(no magical words, just some thoughts about what would you guys want to hear during those times)?

My friends only hit me with the "same lol" or ":(" when I try to tell them I'm not doing well, or think I'm joking when I'm trying to reach out for help.

My parents are extremely stressed out themselves by work and managing the house because I'm not helping them at least at home. When I do talk to my parents they tend to get frustrated by my nagging and they don't understand why I don't feel better when they tell me "it's not all bad"

My therapist greatly underestimates how bad my depression is because I just can't open up because I have immense trust issues and I also think I have no right to feel this bad.

I quit school to focus on my mental health but it just steadily declines over the months and I am close to hitting rock bottom. The only thing that's keeping me sane is constantly playing video games which gets worse, I barely do anything else anymore. 

I have nobody that's able to listen to me and understand, and I desperately need it. But in the end nobody cares about you once they get frustrated by your exhaustion...

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l057iq/sometimes_i_feel_fine_but_worried_still_and_i/
So I recently quit my job because of my depression. I hadn't taken meds for longer than a year so it came back to bite me in the ass I guess. And there were times I was very sad and felt hopeless. But on my last day of work, I was going to shed tears a few times throughout my shift. Thats why I wasn't even able to finish my 2 weeks. I just couldn't be there.  


It's been a few days after I quit and I feel fine I guess. I sometimes wonder if I made the right call. I was going to quit anyways but I don't like how I quit because I had promised to stick around for a bit longer. I had every intention of it. Not working (my regular routine) is making me a bit depressed as well, again, despite not liking my job.  


Which brings me to the question, how do I know when I'll feel fine to work again? I should note that I started taking my meds again and it seems like it can take up to 2 months for it to kick in. Maybe I feel pressure because my family just sees me in the house playing video games. But I am paying for rent and will continue to do so for the next few months (for the meds to kick in; luckily I saved a bit, just enough. not like my family will kick me out but I hate it when they talk shit over anything).  
And I have other stuff to keep me occupied. One of those things I can make into a career. It would be my dream job! But I have zero energy. Even when I was on my meds and feeling better, I simply didn't have energy. I only want to do easy things (watching tv, video games, music) but not work even though I'll enjoy it (I've done tutorials of it). Maybe sitting down and learning is what really overwhelms me.

I am in need of some purpose. I love fiction but I hate when I google “books for people with depression” the top 5 are all overly popular books that have all been made into movies like “perks of being a wall flower”, “its kind of a funny story”, etc. What are some books with a similar mood that you have read that give you comfort in being ordinary and sad (lol). Books with a similar mood to a depressed persons life, where I can empathize with the main character. Please give me your recommendations because google is disappointing me and my brain is too dead to do heavy research.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzvtis/why_dont_people_say_shit/
Why have we developed a culture of not speaking out about being depressed or having abusive parents? I'm not saying you need to be an activist, but why don't people say that they are actually struggling. Instead we run to a forum of internet, which is easier than talking about it. I just realized how messed up I am and I wanna tell everyone. Not because I care what they think/getting attention but solely for the fact that they know I struggle as a person who might seem fine on the outside. That's the thing, I don't expect everyone to be open about their deepest darkest secrets, and obviously not all the time. But shit, my friends haven't even said anything like that to me, so maybe that's why I feel like I don't have any. Again not expecting them to suffer from diagnosed BPD and severe depression and anxiety, or anything else. I wish people would cut the bs, even for a second, actually like the matrix. I also didn't realize how many young adults struggle with bad parents even in their 20s. No wonder why everyone's depressed. But hey corona is bad. Why would we stop the skyrocketing suicide rate when there's another (scarier? not really) thing happening. Look I'm not undermining covid, but it's a scapegoat to ignore mental health again.

My life was never good; alcoholic dad, bullying and parents divorce would sum up most of it. I was until recently still a virgin and just felt like a loser and wanted to lose it as fast as i could since i had fear that if not i would end up as a fat neckbeard piece of shit. The story begins this new year. I had the coice between going with my mother to my stepdad(a corona denier btw.) and going to my cousin to celebrate new year. I chouse to go to my cousin. When I came there i noticed that there was a girl i didnt recognize and didnt think anything of it. My whole relative circle is strongly christian so i thought if she was at my cousins house she would be the same. She wasnt. Long story short i saw that she smoked and spoke with her over a few things and she had the idea to drink the alcohol the parents of my cousin had in their refrigerator. We waited until they all slept and drank the alcohol. She wanted to smoke so we sneeked out of the garden and went to smoke a cigarrette. So thats where it started. She started to inhale the smoke and kiss me and exhale the smoke into my mouth(I also smoke nonregulary so it was okay). When we later went up she was asking with her body for sex as she sat on me and started making out with me. So i fingered her. After that she wanted sex but i said no since i had no condoms and wasnt sure if i wanted to do it at all. The next day i wanted to go home and went to the bus, she followed me to the bus stop and asked me if i could stay for another day. No matter what i said she just didnt stop to ask me. The only way i could go home in the end was because i said that need to give my cat new food. I then went to a friend of mine who also knows my cousin and told him about it and long story short i got condoms. What came next is selfexplainitory just for the fact that i found out that she was my second-cousin and that i threw the condoms out the window that was directly over the window of the parents and it was stuck in the tree so that they could see it the next morning. Now my life is even more fucked than it was before...

Next time I won’t be sitting around waiting for you to come back. You’ve left me no other choice but to actually move on. I’m not going to continue to be the only one that seems to care about the other. If anything you doing this to me and ignoring me for days on end knowing I want to try and talk to you just makes me care so much less about you. 


It’s truly funny how you think I can just move past so many things after all the damaged you’ve caused me without even attempt to fix what you broke. Sure I’ll take all the blame for what I’ve done wrong and I’ll deal with the consequences of my actions but I sure as hell know this isn’t what I deserve whatsoever. At this point I don’t even wish anything bad on you. If anything I honestly wish maybe one day you will wake up and realize what you have but I don’t think you can even comprehend that type of love. You’ve left me on my own to take care of our kid and it’s probably one thing I will never be able to forgive you for. I may have kicked you out of my house but you decided to leave for good even after I begged for you back to the point where I was puking my guts out.


I stayed loyal to you even after you left me when I didn’t even have to. I wanted a lot of things with you and I tried my hardest to fix what we both had broken. Can you actually sit there and say you’ve tried your hardest to make up for all your wrong doings? Because to me honest to God you really haven’t. If anything you just expect me to get over it and move on from the past. So many times I just looked stupid trying to win back you after you were the one who did me wrong. Maybe you enjoyed me chasing you..maybe you enjoyed knowing that no matter what you did I would always come back running to you..most people would call me weak or a fool for wanting to be with someone who didn’t appreciate my love..but you know what I truly don’t give a shit because at the end of the day I know that I did everything I could to try and make things okay. 


I don’t enjoy constantly wondering why I’m not enough..I don’t enjoy trying to find reasons as to why you aren’t here right now. I don’t enjoy thinking of all the ways you’ve hurt me. I don’t enjoy the anger or pain in my body. If anything I try to mask all the awful times with you by the good times..but I’m done trying to avoid reality by living in fantasy world. You were never really truly happy with me. I was never really truly  happy with you. We both want really different things in life and I obviously can’t give you what you want or need. All I ever wanted was to be loved by you but you never really knew how and it’s okay.


I never deserved to be cheated on so many times. I never deserved to be left on my own while carrying our child. I never deserved to be betrayed by your mother. I never deserved to be treated like shit by Ms.CC and your dad. I never deserved to be ganged up on, talked down, and kicked out when I didn’t even do what you said I did. I never deserved to have to constantly question why I wasn’t pretty enough or good enough for you. I never deserved to be constantly lied to. I never deserved to not be told I love you after months of being together. I never deserved so many things. 

All I wanted from you throughout all this time was just an apology after you hurt me but I never really got one from you for any of it. I don’t even really want one at this point because you won’t even really truly mean it. You just want to leave all the wrong you’ve done in the past..but that’s fine I’m done carrying all the pain with me. I never got the apology I wanted but I’m going to choose to forgive you anyways. As for everything I’ve done wrong to you. For things I may not even be aware of that hurt you. I’m sorry. For the things I am aware of like breaking your glasses and you not being able to see for a whole day. For getting you kicked out. For hitting you a few times and everything else I’m sorry.


I just need to move past this chapter in my life. Even if I don’t really want to. I know it’s probably best for myself, the baby, and honestly for you as well. Even though you’ve literally caused me more pain then any other asshole I’ve met in my life. I don’t regret ever meeting you or all the time we did have together. I felt something for your dumbass the first night I started messaging you on Tinder. You made me happy when I didn’t think that kind of happiness existed. I enjoyed the little life we made together in our apartment even though it was full of chaos I will miss it. As for our baby I can’t really say anything other than I hope you decide to be in his life somehow. If you want to be here for him I won’t stop you. I won’t let my anger or feelings towards you let him miss out on having a father. I honestly hope you get your life on track not only for yourself but for him as well. I’ve always hoped the best for you and  will continue to do so...take care.

Every single day I fall deeper into depression, and the advice I'm given just makes me even more upset. I'm depressed because I don't have any meaningful relationships and I never have. I was bullied all throughout school starting at 9, and the only think I was told was that, "it will get better."..... I was bullied all the way up to the last day of school and it never stopped. When everyone was starting to experiment with dating I was alone and told, "just be confident." I've had 2 girlfriends that both cheated on me, and I currently get rejected, ghosted, and treated like Jason with a chainsaw while all my, "friends" jump from relationship to relationship. 

Now as am adult no one can figure out whats wrong with me and everyone thinks I'm fine. I'm told to just focus on my education and questioned about why my degree or my savings don't make me happy. I'm a film student so follow along with me for a second: lets just say hypothetically I make a blockbuster hollywood movie that everyone loves and I get rich......I still wouldn't be happy.

I wouldn't be happy because I just want a meaningful connection with someone. I'm tired of playing games with, "friends" and having to listen to them talk about how much they love their SO. I'm tired of being called names and told I only want sex when I ask for advice or look for help. I'm tired of someone acting interested only to hide when they see me walking towards them.

Would you be happy if every day you felt like a monster trying to fit in with normal people?

I’m a stupid fucking idiot and I can’t do anything right. I love alienating myself and burning bridges of the the people that actually care for me the most. Don’t have any friends, work a shitty job, barely make rent every month and I can’t even afford school. I’m a fucking waste of space and I haven’t lived up to any of the expectations that people (my parents) had for me. Just kept fucking up time and time again. God I swear I think I’m a masochist sometimes because I keep doing things I objectively know are bad for me but what the fuck do I care. I am an adult and should know better but here I am. Haven’t had a successful relationship in almost 4 years and every relationship I have I blow up because I know in my heart I’m not good enough for these people I trick into caring about me — that I’m just going to drag them down to my shitty level. I’m a fucking piece of shit that has somehow convinced itself that I’m not a piece of shit and that people fucking like me. Haven’t left my room in two weeks because why bother other people with the burden that is me? When I can just stay in my room and not bother anyone. I’m bad at everything and I can’t \U0001d625\U0001d630 anything the way I think I can. I’m glad I don’t have the confidence I had when I was 18 bc it’s easier to live life knowing you’re a fuck up rather than fooling yourself that you’re the shit. The one relationship that I had that I thought was going to last I fucking ENDED because I kept telling myself that I wasn’t good enough for her and then I tried to bring her down for thanksgiving and when I told my friends they all told me I was rushing into things and I had a panic attack like I always do and ended the relationship not two days after telling my loved ones I was bringing a significant other home for the holidays. Even my dad was skeptical about it and he has always supported my relationship endeavors. Everyone around me has successful lives and I am just a thorn in everyone’s sides. I realized that \U0001d610 was the fuckup friend in high school that everyone had to coddle along to make sure they didn’t kill themselves. And I somehow managed to convince myself it was the other way around. I have cheated in every single goddamn relationship I’ve been in and for what?? To undeserving women that only had their heart to give to me?? I was so scared I did cowardly things to affirm it? I’m such a piece of shit. Life keeps affirming to me that I am nothing and will always be nothing. And the worst part is is that I don’t even deserve to have these feelings. There are people out there with actual hard lives and I’m so privileged that I get to whine about how I don’t meet anyone’s expectations. It’s almost selfish for me to have these feelings, which makes me feel even shittier. Horrible negative feedback loop. I’ll stick my Dick into anything that has a heartbeat because I can’t stand to be alone with my own thoughts. Don’t even remember half of the people I’ve slept with. Just so that I can feel better about myself. I pretend to be the person I wish I was so that they think that’s who I am and then I fuck them and leave. I’m a piece of goddamn trash yet I try so hard to keep this veneer of an upstanding person because heaven forbid the world finds out that sadboiultra is literal human garbage. I just want to not be here.  I just want the constant pain to go away. I don’t even know why I am hurting which makes me even angrier, more confused. Fuck me, right?

I been depressed since I was young kid and haven’t told anyone. My coping mechanism includes smoking tree, watching porn & jacking off everyday, staying isolated, and constantly having thoughts of suicide. The pandemic has made it worse and I don’t know to live with myself anymore. My dating and social life has been on a large decline which has gave me more of a reason to hate myself. I came on this forum for privacy and to remain anonymous. But I just needed to vent and let somebody know before I off myself.

As funny as they are, it's always me at the end of every joke. Mugs being sent in the group chat? All mine from a few years ago. An account being made on IG to take the piss out of someone? You bet that's about me. It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't tell me I couldn't take a joke every time I complained about it - I don't even if I can take a joke or not at this point.

I've done so much cringy shit in my life that I can't help but feel as if I deserve all of the jokes and everything that I'm getting, even if I hate it. They take the piss out of everything of mine, from my accent to my gullibility and my all round personality, but I don't even really blame them. Even if it feels like I'm being pushed around by them, it could be worse.

Being the least funny, the least charismatic and the most anxious out of all of them doesn't really help me either. I just want to be a completely different person entirely, and I probably would be if I wasn't an impulsive dumbfuck who can't get their words out properly. 

I definitely can't go to them and talk about it, it would just be adding more fuel to the fire. At the same time though, I don't want to feel like I'm just using people as emotional sponges either and give them more to worry about than what they need. I don't even know what I need at the moment. I just want someone I can open up to.

Succumbed to failures. Can't count them on my fingers now.. The passionate old self is dead and the present is scary. No way out of this. Along with this there are some disastrous set backs that just make me weak. Like if there was just one place to breathe. 
Not suicidal ... Will never be . You can't kill the dead . will have to survive and just ... Idk... It sounds meaningless having seen what goes through the process. 

Heart- broken
Career - dead 
Head - hurts 
Hotel - nvm

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l04fhd/i_have_never_been_able_to_think_about_the_future/
When I was 18, I had my first panic attack because I took a few moments to envision my life plans. I’m 22 now and can still vividly recall exactly what I saw for myself. I saw myself at age 40, in a small apartment by myself (with fluorescent lights, definitely the worst part) and I was deeply, deeply unhappy. What sent me into a full panic attack was the fear that I would feel so helpless and alone that eventually I wouldn’t be able to handle it.

Since then, I have refused to let myself think about the future, even when I am mentally well. It never ends well for me. But as I am approaching adulthood, it is starting to have some consequences. Like I am refusing to actively search for jobs in my field because it is a reminder that the future potentially exists. Does anyone relate or have advice?

Let me give you some back story. When I was young I was placed in home school and had been in it until I ended up in middle school. From there I found my self being alot less social then I was before.

Fast forward to present day I feel a strange disconnect from my peers. I look around at people my age or older and I see how they act. I feel as if I'm alien towards them. Whenever I'm in a conversation I can't seem to connect to the topics of modern age. It's like im in my own confusing world trapped in a endless collection of thoughts and idea. With this I also feel like this life is just a worthless transition of existence. I don't even find myself feeling any type of inner emotion towards major changes within my life. Is something wrong with me?

So I am pretty sure I have an eating disorder. I was talking to other people on a Facebook group and apparently I’m not the only one who gets a sort of high after going without food for a certain period of time and that it’s also (apparently) addictive.

I went without food for three days last week and the euphoria was amazing. I felt so calm and at peace, even if things were a little hazy and blurred until I caved and had food. I really want to experience that again and I’m a little scared. I don’t know what I should do. I want to be cute/handsome and valid by losing weight but I’m afraid at some point it’s going to cause problems.

any help at all would be so deeply appreciated, i dont know what to do.

this is long, im sorry. i dont know how to put it shortly.

its been getting so much worse lately. he doesnt want to see me, he pushes me away, he always tells me i dont care about him anyways, even though weve been in a relationship for 2 years, he doesnt see that im still there for a reason.

hes telling me about how everything is hopeless, how he wants it to end, asking me over and over what the problem would be with him just calling it quits. hes exhausted with school, has to learn a ton, wants to quit it and start again later but his mother threatens to move away and sell his dog if he does that. he tells me shes constantly pressuring him, calls him lazy and just makes things so much worse.

he used to be in therapy, not anymore, says it doesnt help. he was on antidepressants too, though im pretty sure he just stopped taking them too. he has terrible insomnia, doesnt even get an hour of sleep in the night, but doesnt wana get help for that either.

i tell him to get help, he takes offense. im honestly considering on calling someone to pick him up and put him into a closed psychiatry because he tells me nearly every day how he wants to die and he couldnt control it if he gets to that point.

he tells me i wouldnt care, i would just get over it, he thinks im with him to hurt him, or for my own gain, he says ill leave him anyway so 'whats the point of trying', i tell him over and over that i love him and ill help him, i offered him to move in and quit his school and take the dogs and ill help take care of everything, he doesnt have to pay rent he can just rest and recover but he just says 'or ill just die', nothing i say goes through to him, he doesnt want my help, he doesnt want to go back to therapy, hes just isolating himself, tells me if i visit him he wont open the door, hell just have a mental breakdown, so i havent seen him in months.

does anyone have any advice at all? any? im trying so damn hard to make him comfortable make him feel loved he just tells me he doesnt see it he tells me im cold and im just being fake when im showinf affection. im so helpless. is there anything i can do? anything at all? im so fucking scared to lose him. i dont know how to help. he just rejects everything i try. im so scared hell just snap and really end it. i just wanna help i dont know what i can do.

any tipps at all would be majorly appreciated. thanks if u even read all this.

Every hour I think about howm much of a loser I am, how much I want to die. There's no hope for me.



[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzys56/i_just_dont_function_anymore/
Hey, everyone, this is my first post and I'm writing this down because I hope to find people who can relate to what I'm going through right now. So for a while, 6 months I think, my condition has become worse and worse. What I mean by this is, that I've begun to lose my motivation for doing stuff for school, for cooking myself healthy meals, and even practicing personal hygiene. I stopped coaxing myself to do sports. 6 months ago I was overweight, now I'm on my way to become obese. I feel like I could eat all day only crap food (I'm too lazy to cook). At the same time, my sleeping habits have become unusual (like my eating habits). 6 months ago I went to bed around 9 PM-now I fall asleep at midnight. I think about doing stuff for school but most of the time my thoughts don't lead to actions. I've become indifferent to meeting deadlines that our teachers set up. Every morning when I wake up, I turn the TV on. Not for watching but only for hearing something-to feel like there's something going on. The worst thing about this whole thing is that this condition is not permanent, sometimes I get a little bit of motivation(most of the time after I had human interactions), but that motivation doesn't last for long. These ups and downs make it even harder to bear because I feel more guilty about not being able to function the way I used to. I sometimes also cry but I usually don't know why. Of course, I hide in my room when I let my emotions out so that my mom won't be able to notice it because I'm afraid, she might ask why I was crying and I wouldn't be able to give her an answer. So if she doesn't notice, she can't tell me that I have no reason to cry.  If you have similar problems, I'd be very thankful, If you'd tell me how you cope with them!

It's been a week now since I started my unpaid internship (i'm 21yo) The first few days I suffered from anxiety and I had my first panic attack, but then with the days the situation improved little by little. I thought I finally got used to it but instead here I am again here, again asking myself why I still go on in this meaningless life, without a future in a society without true values. I am just a small and useless gear in an even more useless and stupid machine, right? 

What keeps you going on?

I wouldn't even be able to kill myself, I don't want to hurt the few people around me...

Hi, I'm from Argentina and on my 1st year of career, 'cause I lived A LOT of bad situations in my life, and now at my middle 22's I can return to college for my 5 years of duration career. I'm really depressed, thinking about suicide myself with a .22LR gun I have from my grandpa, and anxious (I waste all my days in my mind thinking about my problems, doing nothing, complaining to my friends and my friends are enough with my shit). I'm really really frustrated for my actual situation with no girlfriend, no job, no good situation in my career, a lot of fucked up familiar problems and so... I get really mad with myself by an experience with an ex member of my class in high school, I've tried to flirth with her on IG, but she's on her's 3rd year of career and working harder in a full time job, so I was in my mind thinking than I was doing well but... try that.. puts me soooo down... she was not interested on my obviously 'cause I'm... I'm nothing... I'm a dump, dumb, blind, I didn't deserve a girlfriend and less a girlfriend like her, she didn't let me meet her now. So... I'm devastated, in ruins, my heart is broke and I'm poor, I want to became a professional in the future but I'm really fucked up in every shape and form.  


 I was so frustrated in this days than I'm in my mind thinking about develop my appearance the most I can with the not much money I have, to get some new stuffs to dress and have a haircut (I'm with my long hair like Kurt Cobain, but getting bald and obviously not rough, I'm more like an indigenous dude, I'm ugly). The few friends I have are trying to do their best with me because they can notice I'm a hidden suicidal guy and.. I'm so lonely.. 'cause today I've found my friends.. they're in my head.. I'm so ugly... but that's okay, 'cause so are not you, broken mirrors. Tbh I'm a 80% sure I'm going to kill myself soon, 'cause I'm an autistic adult and I waste too much time, really much time, inside my home in my depression and now I'm really frustrated with myself and all. I hurt ppl in the past and now in social medias by my non self confidence and antisocial disorder. I delete FB, IG, and also I created accounts again with 1 or 2 followers for now. What should I do? I'm doing right? I'm in time to create a new life for myself? I'm a bad person?

Sorry if this is kind of a long read and I feel bad saying this cause this sounds really selfish. I mean I understand that everyone has their own things they gotta manage, and the pandemic certainly isn’t helping things. It’s just that it’s becoming so hard to maintain personal connections with those who aren’t anywhere near me. Even if it’s not true, it feels like they want nothing to do with me.

I’m a first year college student, and in my area it’s definitely not a safe decision to be on campus, so I’ve pretty much been stuck at home with my parents for this & last semester. So being in essentially one room all day, every day, for almost I can’t even remember how many months, that stuff really affects your mental state. For the record though I’m completely thankful for what my parents have done for me so far.

But anyway I only really have one or two close friends at this point. If I try to text someone else just to see what’s up & how they’re holding up, I either get no response, get left on read with no response, or they just constantly say they can’t talk right now. I get it, people are busy, but there becomes a point where it  seems they don’t want anything to do with me. Cause as far as I know, they’re certainly active with their other friends on Instagram or whatever. 

And not being in-person for college is  just not good because of how difficult it is to meet people. Even if we have a groupchat for a class or something, it’s not exactly the most active thing in the world. I don’t know, I guess the loneliness and isolation is really catching up to me. I thought I could handle this, but it’s just getting to be too much. In any case though I’m sure other people feel this way, so I’m sorry for making you read four paragraphs of me rambling.

Hi everyone!

I was put on Pristiq 50mg (prolonged  release) on 2013 when I was living in Spain .On 2016 I moved to UK but pristiq is not licensed  in here . The one similar to pristiq and NHS can provide here is Effexor. So kept asking to my family to send me pristiq from Spain. Unfortunately  last batch  they sent me by post mail got lost and I've almost ran out of pristiq. 

I Spoke to my GP but obviously  she  was not  sure about what would be the right dose of effexor to sort of equal my 50mg of pristiq . We decided to do effexor XR 75mg  but knowing that only 55% percent of venlafaxine gets converted  to desvenlafaxine I would say 75mg is not enough ? 

I have to say I've done pretty well with pristiq 50mg during last 8 years and I always been on the same dose,  the only reason I'm switching to effexor is because Pristiq  is unavailable in UK I would hate to spoil everything  when  everything has been so easy and stable  for me on pristiq.  

Could  anyone please advise on that? 

Thank you very much  everyone

Hi, how is everyone doing? Little bit about my situation... I'm not the person with depression it's more of my little sister. I really want to help her but I have no idea what to do or where to turn. Ive tried researching online to see what my options are but ultimately none of the things they say has really helped her. So I'm turning to reddit in hopes that someone can give me some advice.

She's about to turn 14. I've noticed that her behaviour has changed alot when she was around 12. This is when our dad left and we had to move houses ( from a large house in a nice area to a significantly smaller place in a bad area). At first I thought it was just a transitional period and that she would get over it. But as time went on I could see the joy in her slowly fading away. I took her to the doctors and she was diagnosed with depression and is on some medication for it. Which has helped a little but I really just miss my happy little sister and would do anything to get her back.

So the main reason for me writing this is to ask people who have had/have depression or even just know about it, what can I do to support her and ultimately help her get back on her feet.

Thank you for reading this in advance and I'm looking forward to any help that I can get \U0001f60a

Hi guys,

I've finally showered today and i'm wondering is there a special app that I can use to track things like this (showering, eating, socializing etc). I think it would be helpful to me to see my progress. Can you recommend something?

I like MindDoc (former MoodPath) for tracking my general mood, but now I'm searching for something different.

Thanks!

I work at a small business and in September everything went to shit and my two favorite coworkers who happened to be my managers were fired. I’m only 17 so keep that in mind. I wanted to text them immediately and say thank you for making work amazing and being patient with me. Sadly, I didn’t think I had their numbers.  In November one of them texted me (they’re married). 

Now. I really really want to thank her husband. Two weeks before he was fired, he unknowingly saved my life. He had no clue what was going on but he knew I wasn’t ok and he made me feel better as I was losing my shit outside. He gave me this stupid rock that his wife drew on that said “be happy” and hid outside. When he had a bad day she’d send him to go look for this rock and he’d be looking for happiness. Not knowing what was happening or why, but knowing I was not ok, he was there for me. He talked and made me feel better and insisted I take it home. He was always there to encourage me and he was so patient. He’s a father figure to me when my dad lives hours away. He encouraged me to chase my dreams and cried when I got into my dream school. But he doesn’t know how important all of that was to me or that the day he gave me that damn rock he saved my life. If he hadn’t had given me that I would not be alive today. 

I want to thank him for everything. I could ask his wife for his number or their address? But also is it even appropriate for me to send him anything? 

I also need to thank his wife. She did a lot too, but nothing like that. I’ve been thinking about this since they got fired too. I just really want to thank him for saving me and giving me a chance, y’know? But how do I say thank you in the best way possible??

This is what’s going on in my (22F) life (I’m sorry it’s long):

I have a job as a carer of an old lady and it doesn’t make me feel like I’m doing something with my life or for the world. It’s only four hours a day and it’s so easy I can’t keep my mind from thinking.

I didn’t go to uni, but I want to do a project management apprenticeship as soon as I get a laptop but it won’t be possible until at least March when I can afford it.

I have a long distance relationship but he has a happy, busy life so we only talk late at night.
I live alone and have no friends because I’m new in the city (South West of England) and with all these lockdowns it’s impossible.

My family lives in another country.

I have no one here, and I feel like I have no purpose in life.

But the curious thing is that I know my life is not really bad, but I’ve got too much free time, no one around and I feel so lonely that I can’t bring myself to stop feeling so miserable.
I’m so tired of this, I can’t even eat because anxiety is eating me from inside. I’ve been throwing up lately but I can’t make myself have proper meals and more than once a day.

Any advice? I don’t know what to do and I’m so frustrated with myself because I feel like I could be all right if my city just wasn’t on lockdown and I could try to socialise, or if I felt my life had some meaning. I’m tired of feeling like this, I can’t live like this, I’m just crying all the time.

First time poster.....

So on Friday night my world collapsed. I was arrested for something that I’m not going to go into on here. I’ve never been in trouble before, so this was a very difficult evening. I was questioned, and all electronic devices ( apart from what I am typing this on as this is brand new) were taken from my home. Including my boys devices and my work stuff.

When I got back at 2am on Saturday, my wife wanted to know everything.... I told her everything. She has since moved her and our son to her parents. When she told me “I have lost my best friend” that cut into me so hard.

I have never been emotional....preferring to bottle stuff up.

There is a chance I will go to prison (although this is a first offence, and if it goes to court I will plead guilty). 

I’m not eating much, neither if my wife. Our son knows the police took me away, and that they have his devices, but we haven’t told him anything else yet.

My wife acknowledges I am a good dad, and that she will never take him away from me, but I feel I have lost EVERYTHING.... my home, my family, any respect. Up until this stupid mistake we were a happy family. I still don’t know why I did it.

This is likely to drag on for months till I get any indication of an outcome.

My wife has confirmed I am worth more dead than alive.... and I have to agree with her. The house would be paid off, and she would end up with a lump sum of around £100k.

I have explored my options, and looked at how I would do it. But the thought of leaving my son is so far stopping me..... but part of me acknowledges I have already lost him.

My wife has also said that if I go to prison she will claim full custody of him.

My father was a dick, and I guess history is repeating itself.

When I spoke to my wife yesterday, she basically said we are over either way.... which has crushed me. So much for “for better or for worse” in our vows. I also told her that it’s not the first time I have thought of ending it.... before her I had seriously thought of it.

The last 10 years of marriage and 14 years of knowing her all over in a moment.

I have spoke to my boss this morning, and I have a couple of days off sick.

Today was a good day, I laughed and made my friends laugh, we went out downtown and ate donuts, we walked around the city and looked at the monuments, pretending to know everything about them.
I was the most annoying ahole ever. They're not my friends, they don't care about me, I'm just a waste of their time, I need to stay away from them and leave them alone. Everything was just painful, everything I say, just tell me to shut up and I will. And that's the only thing I've done since new year. No work, no studying, I have no more future, everyone is so nice and I fuck up everything. I shouted at my dumbass dad and insulted him for the second time in my life, I broke stuff and shouted as loud as I could, my parents finally realized that I'm a failure.

I'm not asking for nice little words of support, I've failed my life that's all, just accept it, just listen to me I'm tired of people saying I have a future and that I'm intelligent and blabla

I don't have depression, I'm sorry if this is not the right place for my garbage.

I'm a male and every time i go out and try to get past my social anxiety i just get thrown out of a conversation and if I'm stay i get harassed to hell and back. My family just doesn't say anything nice about me and i just want a compliment. Also i really want someone to love me. I try to go into a relationship that i don't force myself into. I want her to hug me, cuddle, kiss, or anything that signifies love and i wanna do the same. But it seems like I'm a burden to my family and everyone. I should just hide away.

Just venting, maybe hoping for someone who's been through something similar to help me out of this rut. 

In January 2020, I moved across the country for what I thought would be a relatively short amount of time (6 months) to work temporarily for a non-profit. I ended up meeting my current partner, and about a month and a half in, we became very serious. I'm not the type of person to bond so quickly with someone, but it just felt right and we get along so well together. About a month later COVID hit, my job went online, and we decided it would be best to move in together. Almost a year later, we are still sharing an apartment on a split lease and for the most part, our relationship is great.

However, I have not been feeling like myself for a very long time and am worried I am losing track of my life. I have been only working temporary or freelance jobs since my non-profit job ended, and am not moving forward with any long term goals except for the relationship. 

Maybe because of this, I have stopped responded to text messages or any kind of communication from friends I knew across the country, maybe because I feel like I have nothing to share with them that is positive about my life or future. No matter how hard I try, I just cannot keep up a long-term communication with anyone, and I don't really know why. I'm not interested in what I used to be interested in, heck, I can't even listen to music anymore (something I used to do 24/7) without breaking into tears.

I am so depressed most days that I just stay at home, which I guess makes sense since COVID cases in my county are skyrocketing. I just don't feel like doing anything anymore. I have no desire or even hope for a career, and every day just feels like it drags on. I don't want to leave my partner, but I fear I may be holding myself back by staying here where I know no one but him.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzuc26/i_want_to_stop_existing/
Everyday I wake up I hate myself for waking up and not just dying in my sleep. Each day seems harder and harder to survive and make it through. And I don't even have a solid reason for feeling this way. I have the "perfect" life. I have an amazing family, a good friend group, I am conventionally attractive, I am successful in academia - but I hate myself more than anything else. I almost feel guilty for even being alive. I often find myself thinking how other people would deserve my life a lot more than me. I feel like all the other people who have it much harder than me should be given my life instead because I simply don't deserve this life. I don't feel worthy of anything. And I just want to stop existing. I wish I could delete my entire existence because I don't want my family to suffer if I were to just kill myself.  It upsets me so much that I don't even have a reason to be depressed and so many people have it way worse than me and they still enjoy life. But I simply can not keep going like this. I don't see my mental health getting better any time soon..it keeps getting worse and I am afraid of the future. And I am only 20 years old. I don't know how to keep going I feel as if there would be stones placed on my back that make standing up and being happy impossible. I don't know how to explain it. I don't even feel anything anymore. I can not enjoy things, I am too tired to cry, I just feel as if my body is an empty case.

I had terrible anxiety during my high school years and it prevented me from getting a girlfriend. So after graduating, I wanted to loose my virginity badly so I saw an escort.. then another 2 times after that. I don’t feel terrible about it but I would prefer it would’ve been someone who actually liked me. Now I’m 22 and still haven’t had a serious relationship. Which makes me depressed everyday. I think I am going to go to a doctor this week to try out either anxiety or depression meds. I do not want to be alone anymore.. but then when I am with someone, I sometimes want to be alone.

Very quick rant.

This is the reason why I don't share my problems to my mother. All she says is that her problem is bigger than mine, that's why I shouldn't worry about mine.

What, is she going to think that if she says that to me my problem would go away?

This may sound overrated but I don't even have a father to begin with. I don't have anyone else to talk to. I do have friends but it seems like everyone doesn't even listen to me.

This made me come to a conclusion where it's okay for me to bottle up my feelings. I know that doing that isn't going to be healthy for my mental health in the long run, but it's the only thing that I could do.

I watched the new movie "Soul" on disney+ and to be honest, I feel so depressed since then. I was already depressed before watching that movie but it got a new low now! I don't feel ready to live, without the feeling of fitting anywhere, without goals, and only with dreams that might be just dreaming at the end of the day. 

I feel like doing nothing anymore, I know I need to do something, but I just can't!

I WANNA CHANGE MY LIFE and I feel so close to achieving it. Just. One. Single. step. But then I just freeze, slip on a banana, and lay on the ground...

 I just want to fit somewhere, have the same old day, with the same old job, rest in the same old house, and feeling how my life is beautiful. 

What should I do guys?

I used to just wake up and be happy everyday. I went through something kinda traumatic 2 years ago and ever since it feels like a switch went off in my head and my brain is permanently broken. I try to so hard to put myself in the best situation to be happy but I still can’t even reach what my normal used to be no matter how hard i try. I stopped drinking/smoking, I eat healthy and exercise and I try to be as grateful as I can possibly be for everything I have in my life. I don’t complain about anything to anyone as I’ve been trying to fix this myself and i know no one wants to hear my problems. I’ve been doing all this for the past year but at the end of the day i just feel so alone even tho i have great family and friends around me. I think I’m just forever stuck with these demons now. 

Idk what the point of this post is. I just hate how I have to try my hardest every day to just not be miserable. It’s so exhausting I don’t how much longer I can keep pushing myself. Wonder if anyone else can relate. I’ve been thinking about seeing a therapist but that’s been my only hope for so long I feel like if that doesn’t work I’ll then be completely hopeless and then have no reason to not just end my life.

Hi, everybody. It’s great to post here. Firstly I’m sorry to hear that so many of you are struggling. It’s not fair, and it seems like this hits a ton of sweet people. I hope the best for all of you, and to many, I can relate. It can get a little easier, a little less severe even though the struggle is a long one.

I got ghosted by a guy I fell for recently, and while I’m pushing through that, I found that it’s resurfaced a lot of awful emotions I haven’t dealt with in years.

I was already full swing back into my eating disorder, but now I feel that even it isn’t enough to help me cope with the reasons why I might have been rejected.

I’m overweight—-not to the point where someone will be openly rude to me about it and others would disagree or say it’s not too bad,  but definitely enough to look really gross in a bikini. I’ve never liked my breasts, my face is a little weird and on top of being from an ethnicity that isn’t well-liked, I feel that most of these men are out of my league. It really, really hurts.

I’m also 34 with an incomplete degree and a lot of trauma surrounding school and my continued failure in completing and going to grad school. I feel that because of having a rough life,  my race and my age, it means that I’m not an attractive partner to anyone. I’ve been trying to think of how to cope with that; to neither settle and yet be okay if the person who works for me never comes along. I don’t want to move backwards with my depression and be where I was in the past. I guess I just want to be okay with having limited worth.

I do exercise, to the point I’m bordering on orthorexia. I am a little obsessive about my skincare and hygiene, so that’s fine. I just can’t really compete against girls with lighter skin, good degrees and smiles without gaps in them. It gets harder as our world becomes more and more appearance based. Those little unique things I liked about myself years ago are not stumbling blocks, and it’s frustrating when I have this duality of being told I’m talented, gorgeous and all of these other compliments. I just can’t trust them. If that were the case, why hasn’t anyone non-abusive really wanted me?

Anyone else go through that? Where on one hand you’re complimented so much or told how great you are, but in practice, you KNOW you aren’t even hitting 50%? How do you navigate that sort of duality? Where is the truth?

tl;dr: I’m a pudgy, aging black woman without the educational degrees to make up for these shortcomings

I am so lost and I don't know what to do. I am 24 years old and still living under my parent's roof. I am not a freeloader or anything like that, but I recently graduated from college and I am working two jobs full-time trying to make a living while changing my career so that I can be me stable.

I am so lost. Last night was the tipping point. Let me clear: I don't have the guts to kill myself. Death, actually, scares me -- but last night I felt "who the fuck cares" for the first time in my life.

\--

My brother (23) and I live in a partitioned room and he was playing video games very loud at 12:25am. I texted him multiple times to lower it, and he wouldn't. When I approached him, he laughed at me. I had work early in the morning so this set me off. I slammed a door and my parents come out of their room freaking out at me. I tried to explain the situation, but they only cared about me slamming the door.

My brother then physically attacked me. He through a broom at me, and he punched me in the face. My father had to hold him down and my parents still blamed me for the incident. Maybe my response wasn't perfect, but attacking me...?

This morning my mom told me to move out and called me a psychopath while not saying anything to my brother.

I try and do everything for my parents, while my brother sleeps at his girlfriends house, randomly throws parties, and goes on vacation. He is a college dropout and is literally working as a cashier (which is not a problem at all).

I am a 24 year old gay man -- I have no friends -- I can't hold a relationship -- and I don't feel safe at home. I have nowhere to go, I am broke, I don't know that to do.

I am on Adderal for ADHD and Zoloft for depression. I am happy when I am not home.

I am sitting here crying because I don't know if I am a bad person. I have been described by my friends and coworkers as "one of the nicest people they know". I literally just got a humanitarian award at my job.

I am so confused. It's like two different worlds.

\--

EDIT: It's not always bad, and that's why I am so freaking confused. My parents love me, no doubt. We laugh and we get along most of the time, but they easily are triggered and throw everything they have done for me in my face.

Hi, I'm from Argentina and on my 1st year of career, 'cause I lived A LOT of bad situations in my life, and now at my middle 22's I can return to college for my 5 years of duration career. I'm really depressed, thinking about suicide myself with a .22LR gun I have from my grandpa, and anxious (I waste all my days in my mind thinking about my problems, doing nothing, complaining to my friends and my friends are enough with my shit). I'm really really frustrated for my actual situation with no girlfriend, no job, no good situation in my career, a lot of fucked up familiar problems and so... I get really mad with myself by an experience with an ex member of my class in high school, I've tried to flirth with her on IG, but she's on her's 3rd year of career and working harder in a full time job, so I was in my mind thinking than I was doing well but... try that.. puts me soooo down... she was not interested on my obviously 'cause I'm... I'm nothing... I'm a dump, dumb, blind, I didn't deserve a girlfriend and less a girlfriend like her, she didn't let me meet her now. So... I'm devastated, in ruins, my heart is broke and I'm poor, I want to became a professional in the future but I'm really fucked up in every shape and form.  


 I was so frustrated in this days than I'm in my mind thinking about develop my appearance the most I can with the not much money I have, to get some new stuffs to dress and have a haircut (I'm with my long hair like Kurt Cobain, but getting bald and obviously not rough, I'm more like an indigenous dude, I'm ugly). The few friends I have are trying to do their best with me because they can notice I'm a hidden suicidal guy and.. I'm so lonely.. 'cause today I've found my friends.. they're in my head.. I'm so ugly... but that's okay, 'cause so are not you, broken mirrors. Tbh I'm a 80% sure I'm going to kill myself soon, 'cause I'm an autistic adult and I waste too much time, really much time, inside my home in my depression and now I'm really frustrated with myself and all. I hurt ppl in the past and now in social medias by my non self confidence and antisocial disorder. I delete FB, IG, and also I created accounts again with 1 or 2 followers for now. What should I do? I'm doing right? I'm in time to create a new life for myself? I'm a bad person?

Depressed, anxious, obsessive, bpd, suicidal etc. etc.

All blood tests are normal.

A lot pf physical activity. Excellent diet of good fats/carbs, protein, no alcohol etc.

Normal sleep.

Utterly dejected and incomprehensibly depressed/anxious/obsessive/intense feelings. I can't share this with my family as it makes them upset and they don't understand me.

I've seen 15 therapists (including an anxiety and dbt group) and 4 psychiatrists. Been to hospital a few times too. I've tried ssri, snri, tca, maoi, stabilizer, anti-psychs, benzos (for anxiety). Also have tried a wide range of supplements/other agents (turmeric, magnesium, lithium, nac, vitamin d, vitamin b12 etc.). Ketamine is not offered and there is a TMS clinic though it's too far away.

The last contact I had with a general practitioner didn't go well as they (two of them) didn't understand me and didn't seem to believe I had issues. I also sensed that they were fed up with me. Told me to see another psychiatrist. Thus I saw a psych and they tried another maoi (moclobemide) and it didn't work.

I need help, I am really bad. Yet I can't face going into the surgery again and telling them my problems because in the past it has gone badly 9 times out 10 and made me feel worse.

Don't know what to do. Even typing this feels pointless. The anhedonia is often intense. Self harmed again last night though it doesn't help. Almost too depressed to even do that. Can't cry - no tears.

Thanks if you read this.

It’s hard for me to want to eat many things because of the medicine I take. I have to remind myself that it is better to eat something rather than nothing. 
I find myself wanting to not eat because I can’t stomach nutritious foods, but I have to eat. 
I eat what I can and I want you to know that it’s better than not eating. Food equals calories equals brain emotional functions.

I've had a bad past growing up, more than what a kid should go through.

When I was in year 5 I developed a coping mechanism in which I would force myself to be sad in   
happy situations, that way when the next bad thing happened it wouldn't affect me. 

At the time it helped, but fast forward to now and i find it an unhealthy coping mechanism.

For the first time I have taken steps and now currently on a dose of anti-depressants.   
I find it extremely difficult talking about my thoughts to my friends and family.  


I can talk about some lighthearted feelings, i'm feeling groggy, just a bit sad ect ect.   
However I would hate to let them know how much i'd quite like to go away. 

Not that I'm unable to find joy, its just that I can't seem to enjoy, joy. 

&#x200B;

I'm an adult now, get yourself together.

I feel isolated from all people even though I am not, I feel isolated even when I talk to people, or among them, it's like there are walls or kind of barriers between me and people, which make impossible to be close or even be interested. I almost don't talk to people it is neither possible nor appealing for me. I feel like I don't love anyone I should so in the end of the day my family, my friends are just strangers to me. I don't even get if I feel lonely or isolated

Just to get through an hour, let alone a fucking day is a nightmare. I don't think i can ever live for myself, no matter how many people showed that they were there for me. I couldn't find the will to live for others either a while ago but now I'm really fuckinh trying. Im putting my everything and fuvk everyone who says that I'm not putting in effort just because i don't get the same results that they would expect but notheless i do put in the effort. I feel like I'm gonna crack any day now and I'm just afraid that it's gonna be very soon. I woulf be happy if its soon but the unexpected shit scares me. Idek what im doin anymore likr i have no motivation to even fuckin brush my teeth. I dont think i have washed my hair in a fucking month or more. Idk when was the last time i showered. Idk when the last time was when i ate 3 perfect meals instead of starving through the day and binging through the night like a pig. I don't when the last time was when i valued life over chemical substances. The only thing that even tells me to be alive for another minute is my dog. I just wanna lay flat on the floor, let everyone physically walk over me and die of starvation.

Two days.  
I've been permitted two days of happiness, and then from night to day it was like a switch was flicked inside my head.  
All the thoughts came back in full force, I'm in the worst mental state of grief I've ever been. I don't want to continue like this, this crushing feeling of loneliness neverending.  
Today I woke up from dream I can't stop thinking about. I was with my "sister" and asked her if her birthday wasn't coming up soon, and she said it was today. I replied "So that's why I've been feeling awful, I forgot" and hugged her. That hug left me heartbroken.  
I don't have a sister in real life, but this fake hug that happened in my head is killing me inside, because all the feelings are real. I can't even tell at which receiving end I wanted to be at, but now I'm agonizing and crying over it.  
I'm broken. Deep inside I'm broken, filled with thoughts that tell me to hurt myself and "good" dreams that only hurt me more.  
Just a hug, that's all.

Hey guys
I’m not sure if I should post this here but I feel like I could not take it anymore . 
I’d like to hear any type of advice for what should I do in my situation and how to deal with stuff like this , thanks. 
23, m , I grew up in a dysfunctional family where you get yelled at simply by stepping into the room and doing literally nothing. Emotional, verbal and even physical abuse runs in the family . It’s also absolutely “ok” here to completely humiliate each other , give each other names and abuse each other in various types of forms , as I said earlier. And that’s the reason why I’ve decided to type it here. I could not take this anymore . I literally can not. They yell at each other EVERY DAY . Sometimes my mother ( who is in her 60s) can make it physical towards her mother ( my grandmother, who’s in her mid 80s ) . And that’s considering the fact she ( grandma )can barely walk and stand on her feet. I’ve told her about this and warned her that I won’t let her do it again but it keeps happening and now I do nothing with it. Every other member of the family: father , sister witness this every day and do absolutely nothing . 
Speaking of my father who is also in his 60s : I’ve told him about this and he said “ that’s not your business and you should not take part in solving this problem “. And when I asked him : who should and why won’t he do anything so she won’t hit her he said:“ what can I do? You are waiting for me to load a gun or something?” Pathetic.
He never actually takes part in abusing my grandmother but he never truly protected her when that was happening. My mother and sister is also abusing him , my father, when they feel emotionally overwhelmed or something like that. 
Speaking of my mother: she’s hysterical. I mean I’m not a clinical psychiatrist but there are a lot of those in her . Also she’s probably has hoarding disorder because 3/4 of our house( we live in a house )  is full of LITERALLY trash. And it’s also been like that for all my life .  
Every room is full of something : clothes, garbage, books , etc etc . I’m so fed up with this !! I’ve told her about this and she wouldn’t listen at all . And that’s considering a fact that she’s a doctor herself !!
Speaking of my sister she’s 12 years older than me and she completely hates me and thinks that I am the reason of all the problems in our family as she said this to me earlier this week. 
I’ve tried to talk to her THOUSANDS of times but it feels like I’m talking to a 10 year old or simply a person who acts with her emotions only. She also allows herself abusing behavior towards grandmother. 
Speaking of me : I thought I was about to kill myself last week. I even thought about calling to one of that support lifelines . But I didn’t because it’s not really confidential in the country where I live and they can actually track you by number. And since my parents are like “well-known” in a place where we live I can’t do that because I’d reveal the “family secrets “ I was told not to reveal for all of my life. 
Before my grandmother moved in this summer the same relationship pattern was present in our family for years !!! So it’s not my first time with this . I’ve had signs of suicidal behavior before but I simply didn’t know what to do and who should I ask for help . 
I haven’t talk to anybody for months . I simply forgot how it’s like , honestly. 
Also I don’t really have a person i could open up about this because I feel like they wouldn’t want to talk about this type of stuff. 
And I also have nowhere to go . I’ve graduated last year from university but was completely disappointed with the whole education experience so I decided not to pursue carrier with that degree. 
I can’t afford therapist rn because I have a very little of money on my bank account . Neither can I afford to rent a place . 
I was thinking about calling the police but they won’t do a single thing , trust me .
What should I do ? And how can I deal with this situations? 
Thank you for taking your time to read this.

I had a good week this week. The first time in a long time. I'm off sick from work and I've been having a great time walking my dogs and playing World of Warcraft for the first time in 4 years. All my worries disappeared.

&#x200B;

I'm going back to work this week and last night I had very severe panic attacks about it and couldn't breathe or sleep. My partner got annoyed at me because I kept choking and hyperventilating in the middle of the night. Today is also the 5th anniversary of my uncle's death. He was my biggest role model and favourite person. His death destroyed my family, and we are still struggling with the fallout. 

&#x200B;

I'm really bad today. I miss him and my family so much. I am in a different country now with just my partner, who works long hours every day as an essential worker. I'm so isolated and just want to cry. I don't want to get up in the morning.  I'm terrified to start work because I know I will completely break down and lose my job.

Im writing this just in case I finally give in the pain and kill myself. Its been so hard to keep up this charade of being happy around people im constantly thinking about killing myself. I just dont know what to do anymore i had to move in with my parents thabks to the divorce I cant work a job that will pay me enough to move away from my parents unless I get a job 2+ hours away I hate being alone but I hate living with my parents its just a reminder of how shitty marriage is and just makes it worse on me. I don't think ill ever commit suicide im to much of a coward but im to the point I barely eat or care what happens to me. I sleep all day I have dreams of her every night but they make it feel worse once I realize she left me. But really not only that she left me she cheated on me then found another guy so quickly I've lost my trust in everyone including myself im broken im hurt its been 5 months but the pain just gets worse. I've tried to find someone else as well but im to ugly to fat and to broken for anyone to be interested. I'm losing a battle with depression and idk what to do. All I want is for someone to love me to appreciate me I want someone who will spoil me just as much as I spoil her I want her to tell me she loves me to give me cheesy one liners. I guess it's too much to ask for though. Sorry for complaining and the horrible gramer I Judy needed a place to vent. Men aren't allowed to show emotions in today's world plus not like anyone really cares around me.

I can't say I am depressed because I have never been diagnosed with depression, but I feel so bad.

Yesterday I had a panic attack for the first time in a long while, and today I have a very bad stomach ache that wont go away no matter what I do.

I have been feeling so down and unproductive for a while now, but yesterday was like a breaking point for me, basically I have been breaking down all day today.

I really want to talk to somebody about my mental health, how I have a tendency of self harm and how I don't really feel all too happy nowadays, but my friends don't keep in touch and my girlfriend is starting to distance herself from me. I feel so incredibly alone and it just sucks.

Sleep is probably my favorite part of the day, yet I don't really sleep all too much. I tried doing something nice for myself by buying new things for my room, but that feeling of "prosperity" (or whatever to call it) was quickly gone after my girlfriend said "fuck you" because I decided to buy a mousepad that she was planning on buying for me for my birthday.

This is kind of a useless post but I just wanted to get it off my chest and tell at least someone.

It feels like I remember every sad thing that’s ever happened to me. My parents split up when I was 11 and I had to move across the country from the place I grew up in for 12 years. Sadness and hopelessness have overwhelmed me ever since. I’m 24 now and as life goes on, it just gets sadder and sadder. I don’t have any motivation, no passion, no friends, and I’m not good at anything. Every night I can’t sleep because I just lay awake thinking about every mistake i’ve made. I’m so tired of existing. I wish I wasn’t me, I wish I could’ve been born someone else. I wish I could just be a kid again and not know what’s coming.

I am a guy that has always had a poor social life...i met a girl on omegle and we decided to hang around again on snap...i was never on there to find love...i was lonely and i was happy she had decided to make friends with me...we went almost a year supporting each other back and forth...i admit that i did fall in love in her although she was 2000 miles away from me...i expressed my feelings for her a couple of weeks ago and i respected her opinion...she wasn't ready for anything...i didnt ask for a relationship because i know that stuff end up in heartbreaks and i never wanted to harm her...however she had saved me and to me she deserves the world for that. As the days went by we talked less and less...at last i had to find out that she was now in a relationship with one of her real life friends...i could live with that but she started ignoring my messages...i grew more worried every time she didn't reply and i kept pushing...i know that's annoying when she says she doesn't wanna talk to people...i didn't feel like i was people to her though...i wanted to help her like every other time...then she blocked me and i used other accounts to reach out to her...i know its creepy but i did what i did only because i cared and i don't deserve to be blamed for trying...i am being as patient as possible but i am broken...she was the first person to stand by me and make me happy and now she has kicked me out of her life...

I need help, I was at the bottom pit of depression due to a bad childhood, everything was tasteless. Then I helped myself and gradually recovered, very slowly I improved. But recently I was accused for something I didn't do, I was betrayed by a close friend. The shit was unprecedented and has pushed me back. I fell down with double velocity, I have hit the bottom again. Worst thing is that my brain is foggy and I am clueless about what to do. The only hope I see at the opening of the pit is that I have once helped myself out of the darkness. But right now, its pitch dark. Life is offering me opportunities but I am dysfunctional. What do I do now? Where do I start?

It has been almost a year since my mom found my limp body inside my apartment. It’s been almost a year since I cut last. I have a million thoughts running thru my head and I just want to press this exacto knife into my fucking skin and just watch the blood flood from my body.

I have a vague method how but I don’t have a date yet. I don’t want to get to that point. I’m a tired, shitty person who is at war with myself, hurting myself and others every day and I’ve failed at fixing this so many times that killing myself is becoming easier than becoming a better person. And I can’t find a way to say otherwise.







[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzht24/being_young_can_suck_ass_sometimes/
Society always looks down on you and in some cases even hate you. There’s so much expected from you and when you can’t perform because you’re struggling they say you’re better off dead. Why are young adults treated like trash? I feel like shit everyday because there is so much pressure. It makes me angry and bitter to be at the bottom of the social tier list. You might as well be a doormat or a punching bag at this age.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz9zl9/its_hitting_me_that_i_wasted_my_youth/
I’m 27 now, and it’s suddenly dawned on me that my youth is over. By youth I mean that naïveté, energy, spontaneity, openness to new experiences, experiencing new things for the first time, not receiving society’s vitriol for your antics because well you’re young and hot and it’s expected. My past was marred by anxieties, dysfunctional family dynamics, and extreme self-doubt and fear which caused me to drop out of school, cut friendships, avoid most social situations, make reckless and self-destructive choices when I was social. I missed out on the most basic positive experiences I should have had in high school and in college, and I’ll never be able to get those back. I’m left solitary with only a small handful of good memories and no skills for the future. I see the people I know moving up in their careers or personal lives and I lag behind. I can tell people view me differently, take my voice less seriously because I’m less educated, less developed (I have no skills, social life, or hobbies), I notice myself not being able to relate to those who are still in my life since we are in such different places. There’s no undoing the fact that I can’t go back or that I have built so few social ties. I can see myself becoming weaker, like I just don’t care if I sleep my life away, learn anything new, create new friendships or a family. When I try to study anything, I feel like I just don’t have the brain or the willpower. I have no patience, no focus, no tolerance for emotional setbacks anymore. I have no way to explain what it’s like to other people and those around me think I’m intentionally being difficult, lazy, or rude (avoidant) and don’t understand what there is to be anxious about or have some simple solution - exercise (no shit), “just do the stuff you’re supposed to”, focus on the present. I’ve heard, read up on, and tried everything. My limitations overpower me and my better judgment. I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin sometimes from the literal panic this causes me. I’m afraid I’ll be alone forever, and it’s becoming harder with age to find that opening for change. People I know (and professionals too) don’t reach out or have the same hope for my improvement the way they used to, or people have given up on me. My avoidant personality is somewhat relieved by that, but it also hurts my heart to know that I’ve been left behind sort of. All of my time is spent remembering painful times, or good times, which is also painful. I’m always in the past because I don’t have the means to build up my present. And even when things improve they don’t get better overall, it’s only a temporary relief until the emptiness of my life confronts me again. I don’t know if there’s a way to ever achieve the life I would have sneered at as a youth but dream of now - I don’t even know if I can meet the basics for stability, steady job, a few friends, a family? My family is 3 people, when they’re gone, I’m literally going to be alone in the world and that terrifies me. If I’m relevant to no one, it’s like I don’t exist. Or, what is the point of existence then? Everyone needs to be cared for. If I will never be able to recoup from the bad choices I made I really don’t know what I’ll do because nobody is meant to be this alone, but the older I get the more difficult new friendships are. It’s painful enough to live with my memories, but their real-word effects are becoming more obvious. I don’t think I’ll make it past 30 if I’m not able to change my circumstances. I can’t talk about any of this to the couple people I have contact with or a therapist, it makes me angry because there’s no way for another person to understand my full story or respond “perfectly”. My bitter self gets upset when people aren’t able to relate to my pain, and I hate that about me. Plus no one can rewrite my life for me, so what’s the point, and a metaphorical pat on the back feels almost insulting, even if well intended. But then I’m left to have al of this brew with no where for it to go and I don’t know how much longer I can do it. I feel so trapped

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzwzs7/im_fifteen_with_3_chronic_illnesss_and_my_life/
Right now I am just absolutely sick of life . I'm only fifteen yet my whole life has been nothing but bad luck and pain. My whole life i have lived in a poor household. My mum was a high school drop-out and my dad was both a drug dealer and user who would rather get high whether it was weed or crack than take care and raise me and my half brother.

 Me and my younger half brother love each other more than anything and he looks to me as a role model. He is probably the only thing keeping me going rn. But we only ever see each other every 6 months and its only for a couple hours because our mums hate each other. We trust each other more than anyone else in the world and yet we hardly ever get to see each other because of the hatred between our mums.

I was born with chronic colorblindness and can only see the world in black and white and shades of gray. When i was 7 years old i was diagnosed chronic asthma and i am a really sporty person so because of my asthma i have never been able to reach my full potential. When I was 11 years old i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (chronic) and so now whenever i want to eat something i have to prick my finger to test my blood sugar and stab myself with a needle otherwise i will enter hyperglycemia and go into a diabetes induced coma, fun. I had braces for 1 and a half years and recently got them removed. I went into the dentist happy and excited to take them off, only to find out that they have put a permanent retainer on my teeth that i will have to have for the rest of my life, unless i want my teeth to shift back into their old place as if i never had braces. I also have osgood-shlatter disease in my left knee. To top it all off i recently had a botched surgery which is going to leave a big scar on my body for the rest of my life :)

No one has ever really cared for me except my half brother. Everyone's always thought "Oh its just Josh" "Who cares about Josh. Just leave him". I have no real friends, they're all just fake ass people who will do or say anything to get what they want. A few months ago i got into a fight at school over some guy hitting on my gf. All my bottled up anger and rage over everything that has been happening to me or has happened to me was released and i thoughtlessly beat him without hesitation. I ended up bloodying him up real bad breaking his nose and teeth and i also cracked 2 of his ribs. The mum pressed charges and my mum was so disappointed in me and we have to pay them recovery money weekly.

I have had my fair share of traumatizing experiences. The biggest one being when i was a little boy i think 5 years old. One of my mum's boyfriends had been sent to jail on a bunch of drug cases. He owed this guy a lot of money that he wasn't able to pay before he got locked up. This guy sent two of his big thugs with shotguns to our house and as my mum was about to go out for a smoke they kicked the door open and rounded up everyone in the house being me, my mum, my aunt and my uncle. They demanded the drug money but when my mum said we didn't have it the took me and my uncle into the the bathroom, held my uncle to the wall with a machete and said they'd make me watch them gut him if we didn't give them what was owed. After realising that we didn't have it they finally left and we move houses.

Basically I have just been through a lot of shit and as of now if done. Sorry if this was too long i just needed to talk about it in some way when i seen reddit so..

It’s like I loose my breath for a second, my heart skips a beat and I get butterflies in my stomach. It’s like seeing the love of my life for the first time in months. 

Then it’s regret. 

My heart is broken, the weight of the world lands on my shoulders and I can’t stand under the pressure. Deeper and deeper I go into the abyss. Blank stares at the celing at 2AM in the morning as all I can do is think about every single bad decision I’ve ever made. 

I am left grasping for air and all the people around me don’t see me as anything but fine. They don’t see my pain, my torment that I inflict upon myself. The tears that sit just under the surface, waiting to be alone and let all those emotions that I have been bottling up pour out of me. 

I sit now and I look at my scars. The loves of my life, the only things in my little world that truly know what I feel. They see me for who I am. I just want our little family to grow again, so I let my heart skip a beat again.

its like.. 2 bucks.. and it's super generous with the filings, you could easily use 3 eggs instead of 1. I plan to make my own little scramble mix thing knock off, and just use a cup of just crack an egg when I'm feeling especially low since you just microwave it (I usually like to make avocado toast in the morning w/eggs since it's a good balance of like.. whole wheat and protein and healthy fats and oils. all that good stuff.)   

yeah idk, i don't have like a schedule or anything which I know helps but uhh.. a huge part of whether my depression is aggravated or not is dependant on how shitty I eat lol so. idk I try to focus on low sodium and fats and proteins since it helps alot with my ability to like.. think properly.. and have an even amount of energy thru the day.. yeah 

also orowheat has this double fiber bread now which has??? so much goddamn fiber per slice??? very cool. I just bought like 4 loaves for 13 bucks and froze 3 of them for later

I can’t catch a break. I quit a toxic job, told how dare I quit a toxic job, am broke as fuq will bills and loans this weekend and I just found out that the second check was “already mailed out”. I’m serious when I say I wanna die. The past 3 years have been the worst but honestly since dec 9nth, when I turned 25, I’ve just have not been here. I’ve clocked out cuz I feels so powerless in my life. 3 years with this diagnosis even though I’ve known since I was a kid I had this and I’m just tired, but apparently being tired is an excuse. Nothing I do changes anything and I want out so bad. I often think the Christian god is messing me up because I left christianity (I don’t agree with it let’s say that) but now he wants to just ruin it. I also took up witchcraft but my “craft” has been hurt. (And I don’t need to here how that’s what I get for leaving, I’m reminded every day). I’m just extremely exhausted and I’m ready to go. I’ve said stuff but nobody gives a fuq, but watch me fail and then get mad at me and call me selfish. I have no win-wins, just a whole bunch of loosing. And then I’m told that I’m just being a baby. I hate living and I’m so tired of being so stressed that small things make crying spells. I hate living so much. I want an out so bad. Nobody cares if I’m suffering. They just want me to shut up but then wonder why I smoke shit tones of weed and not talk to them at all.

I realized what a horrible person I turned out. I tried to kill my parents, became a bitter person, shut myself in FOR NOTHING. I didn't complete my novel, traveling the world, helping the homeless. All these things I thought I knew to be a certainty about myself when I was young. If my teenage self had met me today, I would have punched myself in the face. Those dreams were crushed. I'm beyond horrified. My life is already over. Depressed and lonely. I don't know what to do or what I'll ever do to get myself out of this mess. I'm uneducated, stupid and a total failure. I just want to give up already.

It’s bad enough not being able to leave your house, unless it’s essential because of covid. 

Then depression got us doing nothing productive with our day, other than laying in bed. 

We are not living, we are just existing.

Constantly. It is the only thing I feel anymore. Even with people all I feel is loneliness. I don't want to cry anymore. I don't want to be alone. I don't want to hurt myself..

As I sit here feeling alone again I have to wonder if I really have anything in this world.  

I want to feel loved and wanted, but when I lay here at night, I wonder if I truly am.

People tell me they love me, but do they really mean it, or are they just saying it.

Am I anything more than just the blade of grass they walk on?

Probably not.  I'm just here for their enjoyment.  To make their lives better.

My life, it will never get better.  I'll always be here, an afterthought.

Or maybe not even a thought.

Maybe just an inconvenience.

And that's fucking depressing, I used to think it's all about your mindset, which was kinda motivating to better myself, but nah, it's about how gifted you are, it's about things that were decided very early in life.


[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzhjqy/im_not_ok_and_i_dont_feel_like_doing_anything/
Let's preface by saying that I'm probably feeling the emptiest I've felt all my life.

I haven't struggled with depression before. Nothing *really* deep, at least. I have a tendency from times to times (every few years or so) to have deeper moments of emptiness, of feeling I don't know why I'm doing anything, of not knowing what I'm worth. Usually I get through it within a few weeks, maybe a month or two.

My life hasn't been dramatic so far either. I have a very small family. I'm only close to my mother and my sister. I talk to and see my father sometimes, but we're not *close.* I have a great job and friends I can talk to. Honestly, I often feel like I shouldn't complain.

But, now, my life has taken a turn for the worse recently. I'm in my early 30s. I was in a 8 years relationship, for 5 of which we were married. It hasn't always been easy, but we had something. But when shit hit the fan with COVID around March, my wife slowly drifted away from me, started talking to a guy online, became emotionally invested in him. I found out early August, after about three months. She ended our relationship soon after. Things didn't pan out with the guy when she finally met him, but the damage was done.

I've been living alone with my cat since October. I haven't seen any of my friends since, barely have seen my family. I had a semi-date that didn't work out. Neither of us were ready for something. Covid has made my social life a real nightmare.

My ex has recently started dating someone though, and I'm glad for her. She hates herself for what she did to me, but I don't want her to be as miserable as me. She also has the right to move on. We're still in contact, although gradually less and less, as it was fine while we were both alone doing nothing, but now I want to leave her some space, she doesn't need me around anymore. Not in that way.  It sucks that I can't really see my dog and my other cats anymore, but I don't see myself just asking to come by anymore. Someone has partially taken my place now, I gotta live with that.

I'm a fucking mess, though. I more often than not don't feel like doing shit besides watching football. I don't have motivation. Things that usually interested me just... leave me indifferent.

I'm supposed to start seeing a therapist in February. I did see one last Fall, it helped for a while, but since things didn't get better *at all* either in my personal or social life, I just... can't tell myself I'll be fine. I know I'm not, and I'm at a point where I don't even really care anymore. I guess I'm mostly following what people are recommending me to do. I know I have existential self-worth problems. I often don't see the point of it all, or why would anyone ever be interested by me instead of someone else. I don't want to let people down, so I often just think I shouldn't even try to invest myself at all. I'm not suicidal or anything though, and never have been. I just easily feel a void inside, and I'd rather not burden anyone else with that.

Hell, I'm also even getting tired of talking to my friends. All I can do is talk about how much my life sucks, and how I lack motivation for 95% of everything, 95% of the time. And some of them are also starting to date people, so I don't want to burden them either with my shitty breakup stuff. I don't want them to be stuck with my constant complaining and bring them down along the way.

I don't really know what to do to get out of this. I'm not even sure I wish to. Of *course* being happy would be better, but I don't have the strength to do it. Getting back to being single after 8 years and a marriage in the middle of a pandemic while living in a place with *very* strict Covid related social rules, I just... I've never felt that empty, lonely and useless all my life.

Sorry, that was probably all very rambly. I guess I just needed to let it out.

No matter how what happens, it gets shitty everytime. I try my best to put the effort to someone I want to be with, but it back fires and I feel like an entire circus. They flirt, treat me like they want to be around me and do all these things for a little bit. God, I hate people and I hate myself for falling for the same garbage.

And I didn't even hear her saying it until my mom told me when I got out of the bathroom. Me and my mom are in a very abusive relationship with Grandma.

I have had thoughts of suicide, but I would imagine that everyone does at some point in their life. Depression for me really appears in episodes, usually only lasting 2-3 days. I have no frame of reference. I don’t know if this is normal, if it’s just because of puberty (I’m still very young), or if it’s really depression. I wish I could swap mental states with someone just to see...

I don’t have much motivation, but I don’t know If I’m just lazy. I feel tired often, but I don’t know is if it’s just because of my bad sleep schedule. I don’t like social interactions but I don’t know if it’s just because I’m so introverted. I’m very self conscious about my weight, but I don’t know if it’s because of puberty/school... I just don’t know.

is anyone else going through something like this?

Sorry, this is going to be rather long. I’m new to this subreddit. 


If we’re all going to die anyway, will it matter that Person A was a popular, attractive, and intelligent lawyer who lived in a nice house in the suburbs, who had a spouse, two children, and three dogs, and lived contentedly? Will it matter that Person B, (myself) accomplished nothing and spent all day in bed, phone in hand, staring mindlessly at a screen, reading toxic and hurtful blogs just to digitally hurt themselves? Will it matter in the end? Why even try if we are all going to die anyway? At least when I was religious I had some afterlife to hold on to. But what if that afterlife is worse? What if someone commits suicide thinking the grass is greener on the other side, only to find themselves in a pit of eternal damnation far worse than their previous pain, which pales now in comparison? Being atheistic has helped me in one way, by telling myself there’s nothing after death means no eternal pain, right? But then comes eternal emptiness and I believe that may be worse. I’m feeling so unmotivated. 

For me, my main problems that: 
I hate my disgusting body and face so much that no matter how hard I try, I will never compare. So why even try? Why go through that much effort and difficulty when giving up is so easy? But what then? What after the acceptance of nothingness? 

My grades aren’t as high as they used to be after I skipped a grade and because of that I have so much regret. I’m very anxious for my future, because I need to get a neuroscience PhD, because it’s hopeless in this wretched economy to try to become an artist. But in the end, it won’t matter because we’ll all be six feet under. I’m just another sheep. 
I feel selfish for making this post about myself. I really hope anyone still reading doesn’t mind. Although I highly doubt anyone is reading. I just need to type this to get it out of my system. 
Why can’t I be feminine and ladylike? I try so hard to be a certain way, but I’m just so boring and empty and vapid. My very existence is meaningless. I have few friends who care about me. I doubt my parents would miss me, because their love is most certainly forced. I despise myself. But at the end of my life I’ll be the same as you or any other person. We are all meaningless and unimportant. The moment one of us dies, someone is having another baby to replace them. The world goes on, unchanged.

Hey I’m depressed and it’s fucking lame. 

Currently I’m going through a depressive episode and I’m on the mega sad part mixed with anger out of the blue. 

I’m not at the debilitating point yet but I’m at the point where I need to hype myself up for 30 min to just get out of bed. Well I’m working on the hyping part. Mainly I just bully myself into getting up. 

About 20 min ago I worked the courage to tell my s/o that I was sad but he didn’t hear me and I was too scared to bring it up again. I just froze like and deer in the headlights when he asked “wait what did you say?” it was hard to say it the first time and I’m working up the courage to reach out again. We don’t really touch on these topics much cause both of us are emotionally lacking

I’m not sure how tomorrow will go since I’m feeling like garbage right now. Fingers crossed that I get to work and I don’t have to interact with coworkers or they will probably know something is up. 

With the world continuing to turn at a rapid pace while I’m at a stagnant is something I reflect about a lot. Knowing that everything is carrying on while I’m stuck in my thoughts is humbling. 

You aren’t alone with how you feel though. The world maybe moving on but many of us are stuck together in the same place. We may feel alone but removing the tunnel vision can give us new perspectives.

I’m looking for recommendations or first hand accounts of online therapy applications. I’ve had issues with depression, BPD, and anxiety for most of my life. I have a long family history of people with severe mental health disorders. I’ve recently been unable to manage my mental health properly and am ready to seek out medicated assistance. I have insurance but don’t feel comfortable speaking face to face with someone so I’ve been looking into the online platforms such as Cerebal and ForHer which state they can prescribe medication. Has anyone used platforms like this for treatment? Would you recommend it?

A month ago, one of my friends, for whatever reason wanted to see me dick, which I said no. When they asked my size I told them 7. She then said "well every guy says that so you might have to prove it." I just kinda brushed it off at the time. Until recently. I've never sent a dick photo to anyone ever, and a few nights ago her and her friend started pressuring me to do it again.

She said "you know throwaway, I've seen other friends private parts but I've never seen yours." and I just responded with "no you haven't" and saying that I didn't really want to but that didn't stop them. We changed topics but later on she said something along the lines of "I need to see some dick" and her friend butted in agreeing with her saying "throwaway" and I just said "umm why do I have to be involved in this" and eventually I just told them I'd consider it, to which she said "you better." and her friend challenged me saying "well he says he's long soo"

I was left with two options. I would either keep being teased and challenged by them, or show her so they'd shut up about it. So I gave up, and sent her a picture with a tape measure to prove it yesterday. One of my biggest regrets ever. I've never taken a photo of my dick ever.. Let alone send it to someone. This is almost the most depressed I've been in a while since then. I don't want to leave the house. I feel like the whole world is judging me, laughing at me.. I'm going to fall back to cutting again..

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzvcww/the_story_of_how_my_life_ended/
 **For obvious reasons, I'm using a throwaway account. I expect to be told It'll be ok but deep down I'm not ok and haven't been for years. This is my story:**

I’m 25 years old, I live in the UK and have an amazing wife and a beautiful 2 year old. I’ve had a life long fear which I feel if I don’t overcome, I won’t want to live past 30.. something I’m truly adamant about unless I find a way around this and live the life I dream of every night.

I’ve had a tough childhood like most though had no support in terms of oral health from my mum or anyone. At such a young age I had extra teeth which started to crook the rest pushing them forward, my mum and the school never encouraged this being removed or even considered braces. To this day I am in shock that the school didn’t flag this as neglect. Then came my first ever dental appointment due excruciating toothache. I had to have a very common dental procedure, root canal which truly changed my life as I had one of the worst painful experiences and resulted in temporary filling due to how painful it was. Long story short, I was told to raise my hand if I was in pain, my hands were touching the ceiling and the numbing agent clearly wasn’t working. As you can expect the temporary filling didn’t last long, without any choice I went back on my own however I didn’t make it past the door as I collapsed in fear. Years went by, the hole got bigger and finally resulted into gum. I wrote my heart out to the NHS asking to have further procedures whilst put to sleep and explained this was a genuine fear and that I’m in physical and emotional agony. They wrote back saying this was not a fear and as such I would not be entitled to being put to sleep for any dental procedures. The outcome of this letter could have changed my life, I applied privately and was told they can do the treatment but I would only be dazed and not put to sleep and left with gaps in my mouth. Since my oral health has been neglected though reduced sugar and routinely brushed my most recent assessment resulted in needing, I believe 9 teeth removed whereas back then it was only one. All this could have been avoided if it wasn’t for the negligence of the school, dentist and my own mum.

2014 was the day the world stood still for me, the day I developed anxiety and horrific depression and suicidal thoughts. Making it almost difficult to live my life and do the simplest of things like attending events, going to an interview or even pursuing my dream job becoming a police officer. This was the time when everyone partook in filming for the ice bucket challenge, I filmed my grandad, me and my mum and on review I saw how truly crooked my teeth were and at 19 wouldn’t be eligible for free braces. I developed a strong hatred towards my mum and locked myself away lied that the footage was corrupted and lived in my room with blacked out curtains, and eventually lost my job. I was prescribed anti-depressants and found day to day incredibly difficult knowing everyone is looking at my teeth. I had a rule when leaving the house, straight there and back, no in-betweens. I then found out about Invisalign thanks to a youtuber named Zoella, I did so much research and this encouraged me to get back on my feet, to get a job to pay for this treatment, I started a go fund me to get to that goal faster without success so I tweeted out asking about this, eventually was given a free Invisalign assessment. I had x-rays and the hardest part of my life was asked to open my mouth wide so she could take a picture with a DSLR, it took an hour to convince me reminding me of the before and after photos and eventually when she took the picture, infinite tears rolled down my face. On my way home I was so depressed I contemplated jumping in front of a train and the only thought that stopped me was getting that perfect smile and being able to start my life fresh. The assessment results came back, saying I was not eligible as I had damaged molars and would need 5 removed and would have gaps for the rest of my life. I also looked into braces and another invisible braces treatment but with removal of my molars I would not be eligible anyway as they are required for any type of teeth straightening treatment.

Early 20’s I built up the courage to go to the dentist as I was still even to this day relying on pain killers to get me through the week. I cried walking all the way to the dentist, I cried laying in the chair, the woman who assessed me judged me, kept telling me how I failed and had the worst teeth she’s ever seen, whilst telling her colleague whilst laughing the numbers of my teeth and saying they were either gone or beyond repair. When I got up, she said you will need to have 9 teeth removed and I shouldn’t have eaten so much sugar and that I was a stupid boy for getting it this far. She even laughed in my face saying she was surprised how healthy my wisdom teeth were. My fiancé was outside so proud of me eager to hear good news as I walked out and I cried lifelessly in her arms telling her they made me feel like the worst person in the world. My now wife stormed in and made a serious complaint, the owner took me in tried to reassure me and laid me down, apologised and said he would look after me and gave me free box of toothpaste. I still broke down in front of my wife this time while in the chair and clearly as I am having to write this wasn’t enough to encourage me to go back as it was clear it was all about money and not how I felt.

My wife doesn’t know this but everyday I eat chewing gum, swish mouth wash or brush my teeth so many times a day to cover the decay and horrendous bad breath. It’s had a knock-on effect with my relationship I can’t even bring myself to kiss my wife in the morning without fearing I have bad

breath. I almost cancelled our wedding thinking my teeth would be on show in the pictures. I developed a lottery addiction in hope I could pay for the Jimmy Carr treatment, have all my teeth smashed in and starting fresh like you see on embarrassing bodies. The smallest of hope I have left. I don’t want the fake celebrity look. I just want to know what it’s like to naturally smile, not be in constant agony and not have to hide bits of broken teeth/blood that fall out nearly every time I brush. All I want is no noticeable gaps, reassurance and straight teeth whilst being put to sleep. But it’s clear that this is an unrealistic dream and fear I will have to end my life to end this lifetime of torture. I don’t know how much longer I can live with this.

You know it’s funny, we’re in a pandemic and conveniently I can wear a mask in public and be myself without feeling judged. I dread the day this is no longer necessary, and don’t look forward to having to open my mouth for a covid swab!

So yeah, that’s the story of how my life ended, I question as I type this if I should delete this and stop being a coward as there are so many people worse off but I guess this is my last cry for help. I’m not asking for sympathy I just want to smile.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzp51d/i_say_that_im_ok_but_im_the_most_depressed_ive/
For the past few months I've been pretending to be ok, when in reality I'm at my worst. Suicidal thoughts flood my every thought and my will to do anything shrinks every day. I'm at the point where I dont want to get better anymore. 

A month ago I had called my bestfriend to tell her goodbye, she immediately came to where I was and she listened to me for an hour. Before she left she made me promise not to end my life and I agreed, but I don't think I can keep that promise anymore. I want to talk to her about it more but I feel like a burden on her life. I would love to say goodbye but she would just try to stop me. 

Nothing feels worth it anymore. Everything I ever enjoyed has lost its excitement. I dont think I can last much longer.

I'm sorry if this post sounds pathetic, I just needed to talk about it.


[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzp2ir/i_might_have_depression/
OK so I feel like I should talk this out, but to be honest, I don't trust nobody in my family enough to talk about this or to seek professional help through them.

Ok so some necesary facts about me, I'm 18, I have asperger syndrome and ADHD, and I've had slight suicidal thoughts for as far as I can remember. I've been to psychologists before, but it was mostly to "treat" my ADHD.

OK so most of the time I feel "normal" as I try to keep myself occupied in some way or another during the day, but it is when I'm not doing something that all my self-deprecating thoughts arise. I start to think stuff like I'm worthless, useless. I feel likeI can't satisfy anybody emotionally-wise. I feel like I haven't accomplished anything in my life.

The problem I have is that, when I calm down, I can see that it is all lies told by myself, to myself. Like, I  in college full time with good grades and a scholarship that covers most of my tuition, that should prove that I'm worth something, right? Yet I cannot Avoid feeling like trash sometimes. 

I have said to myself that I'm happy most of my life, without really thinking about it, what does it really mean? What does it feel like? But at the end I always end up proving me wrong, I am not happy, and I'm not sure I have ever been. 

I have thought about killing myself before yes, but at the end I think it's just better to keep on living because of the amount of resources that have been expended on me, but if it wasn't because of this, the world would be better without me. 

I'm tired of pleasing other people, of trying to make them happy, or not angry at least, but of I commit the most microscopic error, I start to spiral into depressive thoughts. Its not like I have to be nice to people or anything, but I think I'm more useless If I am not like this, the thing is, I do it at the cost of my own happiness. 

I just want to be happy...

I took an edible for the first time in my life recently. I've never felt more alive. I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder and taking 100mg of Sertraline daily (I skipped it the day I took the edibles). But while I was high on the edibles, I felt so alive! So fun, free...as if I didn't have this mental illness. There's got to be a cure, rather than a temporary fix like weed edibles or antidepressants.

I can feel the anti depressants kick in. I can feel them wear off. Whether it is completely psychological or not. There is a time of day, everyday, usually around 2 hours before I take them again that I think about killing myself consistently. Then I take them and I am numb. The urge to die is still there, but I am too apathetic to do anything. I feel like I am just in this cycle of pushing down this urge, until one day I slip and give in.

How I want to give in. Why does it have to be so complicated. I know what I want to do. I’ve always known. Those who know me best know. It’s unenviable. Unless something manages to take me out first, I will die by my own hand. I have been waiting so long. It’s the only thing that excites me when I think about the future. Soon. It will all be okay, so soon.

The world is so grey and unsatisfying compared to how I used to see it. I used to be a straight A student and I used to genuinely enjoy every day. I started to view school as something that I could get through with ease and I could push everything off to the last minute. Now I can barely pass any of my classes and rarely even attend online school. It started to get really bad when covid hit last year and I completely let go of any sort of schedule I had. I started sleeping all day and staying awake all night without a care in the world because school was indefinitely cancelled. It was a relatively worry free summer until school started back up again. It was online school and we basically had to manage ourselves to get everything done with little to no outside help. This is when everything started falling apart. My self discipline skills were exercised and it had turned out I had no self discipline at all. I miss school almost every single day because I have no motivation to get out of bed. I constantly wonder what I’m doing with my life and if the path I’m on now is gonna get any better. Often times late at night I’ll tell myself that I need to get better and pull myself together but by the time I wake up in the morning I have no energy to act on it. I spend every waking hour of my day questioning my choices. There are times when I’m genuinely happy but they don’t happen very often. Whenever I’m invited to go out and do something I really want to, but I always end up wanting to be at home shut in my room doing nothing. I have constant anxiety about school and how I’m a failure and how I’m disappointing everyone that I know. I want to get that motivation that I once had back but it’s so damn hard. I never want to move anymore and the very few things that I’m passionate about are starting to seem unfulfilling and boring. It just feels like I’m crawling through life blind. I don’t want to die, I just want this all to stop and I don’t know what to do. I just need advice for how I can get motivated. I feel like if I don’t start now then I’m going no where.

This is the first serious thing, and personal experience of torment I'll be presenting in an online setting, or even any setting period. I've always mainly just been pedantic or light hearted about my struggles or the down falls of the world, but honestly at this point I just need to express a serious thought for once at least.

I've been in a bad place for a while. A long while. I've always had these cycles of happiness > anger > sadness > hopelessness > repeat, and I could deal with it because I knew eventually the negatives would end and I could enjoy my life again. The last year or more, the happiness portion has been shorter and shorter, and increasingingly less significant. While it used to be I could learn an instrument, talk to family, spend time with friends, and generally enjoy any possibility of life, these days the happiness is just a brief relief of perpetual self torment and animosity for my own existence. The worst part about it is that even that brief relief has been less and less long. Now it has come to be stages of anger and sadness and relentless hopelessness last weeks, months, maybe even a year, and the relieving period can be just a moment, a single moment of "huh, that's alright," before the continued dread. 

I recently returned to work from a procedure for a physical ailment and that week or 2 weeks off was the only time I had to fully process myself and enjoy whatever nothing there was I had to do. Now I'm back at work and finding it impossible to do even a single task a single call anything without hating every second of it. Days are going by so slowly because of this constant repulsion with every single second of doing anything, to only end the day with not doing anything but doing bullshit waiting to sleep, only to wake up and do it again. My life feels like I am in a perpetual loop of waiting for something, but I have realized what I am waiting for is just a reason to live, a reason to do anything at all, to just keep thinking even; I now know that what I am waiting for is nothing, and it simply cannot come to save me. 

I have tried to get a day, just one extra day off work a week, rather than this draining 5 day 8 and a half hour a day work week, I can have a little wednesday break between. I requested this in Hope's I could maybe use that for my dread break and finally enjoy my actual weekend, but ultimately the request was rejected, so I can't even determine if that would help. Sure I could see a professional, get a stress leave for some time to think, but I am just coming back from a leave. I can't afford to go on a leave every time I hate everything, and after I just requested days off, they wouldn't take that well when I return. 

I always hear people who have been or are depressed, people who look to help others with advise on dealing with it. The common response anyone will say, is the common trope: "it gets better," I very much hope no one else in a bad place is reading this, because I need to say that... it doesn't, not for everyone, it may very well get worse. Maybe you'll have some high points, but it's a blinking light in the void, and if you try and find it you'll just be disappointed to find it's just as dim when you do. 

I've given up on hoping for the next brief period of happiness to enjoy anything, I give in to this tormented existence. There's no worry of my life, I'm far from suicidal, suicide requires motivation in action, I have lost any of that I may have had left. I simply accept that I'll just never be happy again, I accept that I am just an empty shell and am done looking forward to anything other than that.



This isn't me asking for any help, god forbid anyone actual read this whole essay of my life. I just needed to express some thoughts as a form of therapeutic relief and to really see where I am as it's hard for me to figure out who I even am sometimes.

Please help me determine how to tackle my issues. I have identified these problems:

\- internet addiction

\- fear of people taking advantage of me

\- low self worth

\- ocd and paranoid thoughts

\- fear of financial instability

\- poor physical and mental health

\- very strained relationship with my bf who I have hurt

&#x200B;

My proposed solutions:

\- keep practicing pilates and walking on treadmill every day

\- make steps towards eating healthy and cooking everyday

\- allow myself to sleep as much as needed without guilt

\- allow myself to use the internet to find the emotional support and therapy I need

\- do 1 romantic thing each day for my boyfriend, to slowly show him I've repented and repair our relationship

&#x200B;

My predicted struggles as I implement these solutions:

\- keeping my emotions calm, not self harming, turning off a loud spiral of negative thoughts

\- convincing myself that other people are trying to hurt me or that I am hurting myself

\- not knowing how to motivate myself to cook, exercise, reach out to talk, etc other than general thoughts of "do it or else bad things will happen", and this thought triggers anxiety and drains me

&#x200B;

If you have any advice or encouraging suggestions please I'd love to hear :)

Blessings on your own journey through the depression. One day this time will be appreciated because we are learning a new way to manage ourselves and work with ourselves and others. We will greatly benefit from the lessons we are learning now, just patience and commitment to the journey, being a student.

About a month ago I pretty much just stopped hanging out with friends. Every weekend I [M 16] would go over to a friend's house and it would be the same thing each time. We would just hang in his room, get something to eat, go biking, come back to eat and maybe work on a beat or play videogames and as it got late go biking downtown at night. After that go back to his house and watch a movie and hit the sheets. So it's been a little bit since we hung out last but in the last week's I have been feeling less and less depressed. It happened over a few days and then I finally realized, that I didn't feel sad, apathetic, or just out of it. 

I still do feel very low-energy and unmotivated all the time but I just don't feel depressed. I still have suicidal thoughts occasionally. These don't scare me because I know I don't have the strength to do it. Just because I don't feel depressed doesn't mean I'm totally happy. I'm kinda just in a neutral state 24/7, and I still have a pessimistic/realist outlook on life.

I'm really not sure what triggered this. I was doing absolutely nothing different to then from now. The only thing I can remember that could have somehow triggered me is dead ass watching Callmecarson and Jschlatt videos. When I was watching their videos it would make me genuinely laugh and make me so happy. Though this is obviously a good thing I don't see how it could just make me "not depressed". To me that is very absurd and probably not what triggered it. Also 2 days before I was feeling "okay" school started up again (online) so maybe that could be it? I also think, no because I hate online school but yeah idk.

But now that I no longer feel depressed I'm not sure what to feel. Nothing's different, life is still the same and I'm still the same on the outside. Very low-energy, and quiet. I just don't feel sad that much anymore. I'm also playing videogames again. For a really long while I stopped playing videogames because they were just not making me happy. Along with this I was avoiding my friends online. Before I usually would tear up before going to bed just staring at the walls of my dark room thinking about sad stuff listening to death grips, machine girl, and corpse. 

Final comments :

It would really help if someone could tell me why I might be this way or what could have triggered it. Of course this isn't technically a bad thing but I'm struggling what to feel and now I'm kinda just emotionless. 

2-3 weeks ago I left r/depression because the titles of the posts very just very depressing it got annoying, but now I'm back to post this.
Also sorry for making it so long, I struggle to stay on one topic and can tend to jump to other parts of a specific subject. Anyway thanks for reading, much love.

Hi all, 

I totally understand what y'all go through. A large majority of people on this group are teenagers. 

To give my two cents to the world, I started this podcast where I have a guest coming over (another student), and we talk about issues the youth of today faces, and their possible solutions.

Please do check it out. 

You can find it's link on Instagram @ SoulTalk.byWasif

Life is not worthless. The reason y'all are here today in this world is for a reason. Find that reason. 

A common quote that resonates with me is 'He who has a why, can get through any how.' Find that why.

I kind of find mine by starting this podcast, and trying to help people in any way I can. I feel peace whenever I can help someone; you will too, that's how nature fashioned us as. 

Love you brothers and sisters, and hold onto life. You guys are all amazing in one way or another. stop comparing yourself to others.

Thanks

I never bothered to make any New Year’s resolution, but my lifestyle has changed since the start of 2021. I did everything to make me feel like myself, and happy. Those positivity tips posts, pastel motivational quotes and printing out things I specifically enjoy looking at to put on my wall worked for a moment. The carefree feeling of having a dance party inside my bedroom at night was just temporary.

Turns out, once I have become like this, I can’t be ‘normal’ again. There’s always this dark cloud inside my mind telling me you can never be the same again. Things will only turn out to be worse. I got my life together but I still feel like there is something seriously wrong. I can’t find words to describe my it anymore. It’s been years. All of my teenage years, since I was 12, I have been battling with depression and anxiety. 

Almost got hit by a car today. 100% that driver’s fault. But for a split second I was wondering what can I do to end this pain. There’s plenty of things ahead of me, like entering my dream university. But they are starting to become less exciting, one by one.

I want to talk and share some experiences that i have.

So, hi!

Something that i realise is... rely on outside opnions can make more harder to get out of this hole that u are.

My experience. Force routine, exercise... etc

This things FOR sure can be good for you, but at least me, i cant keep it up. And makes me feel more miserable after some time.

After some much time spend on, how I get out this hole steps. Im trying to figured out my own way. You can say im fool, but, believe or not, its working for me.

I don't have the perfect routine set, but i slready can get up early if I want, and sometimes i do. 

I don't feel so much miserable like before. Im learning how to enjoy the things i do, even if doesnt mean I can get something of it. Makes me feel good, its already great. (Life it's not just about having job and earn money btw)

I still have some issues with myself, sometimes I get a little down, but nothing as effective as before. 

As far the most great that im feeling for while.


Some advice. U can listen what ppl have to say, can be great for you. But, listen what u really want, and just go for it.

I want everyone to be proud of themselves that they are taking up the fight against this disease. Often it is and it is so with everything that we want everything right now, immediately, as soon as possible. We forget that the healing process is a long process, marked by a lot of effort. We take small steps that bring us closer to our goal, although we do not see it now and they seem silly and meaningless to us like everything else, but they bring us closer to recovery, did you get out of bed today, brush your teeth or eat something today, or maybe you just didn't have the strength for anything and you just lay in bed OK! next time you will definitely succeed. Please be nice to yourself and don't punish yourself if you don't do everything, it's normal when you're depressed. Unhealthy perfectionism really isn't good. Be proud of small steps, hold on !! <3

Tldr: i was ghosted by my employer twice.

So i'm a filipino, i had this client from north carolina for 2 years, I used to make her photo booth templates. We became close friends to the point that she became comfortable asking what techniques she should do to get more booking. And I did. I even made her facebook page which gained her lots of new clients. She was so kind, gives me tip for making her orders on time etc etc. There were times where i just make her orders and send all the files to her, and she just sends me the payment even without reminding her. But one time after sending her my work which she approved she just ghosted me. 

I told myself It's okay, it's just 20 bucks anyway. 

Then after 10 months she contacted me again. she said she have a new business, a home decoration business. I was happy for her because it seems like her business was taking off. She asked me again to make a page, logo, banner, etc. After finishing it, she then paid me. We talked again like nothing happened before, we asked each other how we were and how my business was going (mine was not operating anymore btw) and hers was just very successful for a start up business. She asked me again how to make her page successful so I gave her my knowledge. She then offered me a job of being her social media content creator and manage her fb page as well. I gladly accepted it but she ghosted me again. 

What made me so sad is that she's now applying all the knowledge that I taught her. How did I know? Because all of her pages that i made for her are still connected to my fb profile because she told me that she doesn't want me to "leave" the page so that if she has questions, I can just answer it right away. 

I should've known that it will happen again but my stupid self still belive that there's still kindness in human.

This ain’t as serious as some of the other people on this site but I though I should put it here if anyone has advice

So I’ve been working out recently with family but all they do is compare me to people and criticise how I work. I reflect that criticism can help you grow but my confidence is fading aswell as that I ain’t the smartest person in school and test and that are getting to me. I feel ugly lack confidence and have no real skills. 

With few exceptions like listed above my parents are good people but they argue a lot and their the type of people that don’t like to admit their wrong. I’m not worried there gonna divorce or anything but it’s always in my mind and sometimes it’s hard to block out. 

I’m bored shitless of this get up, do some shit  life style and I know that’s life but if that’s all there is to it (not to sound suicidal cause I’m not) but what’s the point then.

Sorry for this block of text and advice or support  would be greatly appreciated thanks.

Not really sure that this is the right sub, if not feel free to direct me elsewhere. So last year I got pretty bad and wasn't able to motivate myself to do anything, I could barely find a reason to get out of bed. I'm quite a bit better now and I have been getting some work done but it's mostly admin and busy work that I am stretching out to take up time. I just can't seem to start on the actually important big stuff. It's like in my head it's this mountain that I'll never be able to move so I don't even try. I know people say to break it up into smaller things but even the smaller things seem insurmountable. Does anyone have any tips or methods to motivate yourself to get up and do the hard things? Again if I'm in the wrong sub I'm sorry.

So my ED clinician told me to “give it another week” and I honestly don’t feel anything not sadness or happiness this week just neutral but last week I had spoken to her about my SH for the first time and even suggested it may be depression 

It just feels like I have to be sad all the time but when I have my moments it either lasts a week or I delve into SH

I’m not tired, I’m depressed.

I’m not rude or stuck up, I have social anxiety.

I’m quiet because I never know what to say.

When I’m spaced out it’s because I’m imagining myself in world where I’m happy with myself and people are happy to be around me.

I know you’ve probably talked about me when I’m not there. Saying things like I’m so weird and awkward. I know I am.

It’s not that I don’t like you or don’t want to be around you, I just find comfort in isolation because I know I’m safe.

I don’t tag along or initiate conversation because I feel like a bother. I feel like my presence is annoying so I’d rather save everyone the trouble.

I’m really nice to people because I’m a people pleaser that’s afraid to stand up for themselves and even more afraid of confrontation. I just let people walk all over me.

I’m always out by myself not just because I’m independent, but because I’m alone.

My thoughts consume me to the point where I deeply hate myself. 

I can’t tell you any of these things because I don’t feel comfortable talking about my true feelings. I’m also afraid of judgement and don’t want to hear “toughen up” or “you just gotta try.” It’s never been that easy.

So instead I keep these things to myself, damaging myself more and more day by day.

just dumping my woes here. i haven’t talked to anyone about what im going through because i can’t. 
i dealt with pretty severe alcohol dependence from age 18 until shortly after my 23rd birthday. i was hospitalized at 18 and diagnosed BPD, but haven’t had any mental healthcare treatment since then. the borderline diagnosis started to seem ill-fitting as i got older and now im pretty sure i have MDD with psychotic features. it’s like a psychological manifestation of a dubstep remix of a Scandinavian death metal band covering all of Hospice by the Antlers. that’s what it feels like inside my head 30% of the time, the other 70% is just radio static. the vibes are absolutely disgusting in here.
anyway, i drank heavily almost every day for about 5 years. i almost never drank alone, and i realize now that the drinking was mostly due to social anxiety mixed with loneliness. i turned 24 in december and i have no friends. i don’t mean that in like a quirky “haha i have no friends \U0001f92a” kind of way, i mean i don’t have any friends at all.
in 2017 my best friend died. i don’t think i ever really processed it, or frankly anything else traumatizing ive ever gone through in my entire life. when i was drinking i had friends at the bars but since i quit i haven’t spoken to any of them, for obvious reasons. i haven’t been able to make real friendships easily because im very uncomfortable around anyone i don’t know, and now it feels like im too old to make any. 
in december 2019 i started dating my (now) fiancé, and did acid for the first time. the promise LSD has shown for addiction treatment is no joke, because after 5 years of alcoholism, a handful of insufferable AA meetings and several failed attempts at sobriety, i stopped drinking. the desire for it went away completely, and i didn’t have another drink until this past New Years when i drank one glass of red wine. still no cravings. the social anxiety went away, the immobilizing depression and thoughts of suicide went away. it was a miracle. i was making art again, after not doing anything besides work and give myself alcohol poisoning since i was 18. i was in a wonderful, healthy relationship with someone i love very much. 
then the pandemic hit. we both lost our jobs in march, and since my lease was up i moved into his 1 bedroom apartment so he could afford rent and so we could quarantine together. it was fast, but even now i know it wasn’t a mistake. our feelings haven’t changed, but both of our mental illnesses and the state of the world have made things harder.
until the middle of July i was still doing great, despite the chaos of the world. but then i started having really bad panic attacks every day. i thought they were seizures at first, or maybe migraine auras because i was having full out of body experiences— Alice in Wonderland syndrome among other visual distortions. 
it sounds like HPPD but i had those experiences as a kid all the time, long before id ever done psychedelics. i would wake up in the middle of the night frequently and have this overwhelming sense of terror, like nothing around me was real, and like i wasn’t real either. i didn’t want to wake my mom up because she had my little sister to take care of and my dad was abusive, so i would just lay in my bed at night watching the fabrics of my reality fray at the seams and wait for the sun to come up. sometimes i would sing to myself. i think ive been depressed and anxious since i was 9-10 years old. 
back to present day. once the panic attacks subsided, the depersonalization/derealization lingered, and i plummeted into (now) the worst depression episode i have ever experienced. im useless. miserable, empty, helpless. back and forth between delusions about how the reason why im so depressed is because im being punished by some higher beings for attempting to experience happiness and health. delusions that my fiancé is poisoning me as part of a complex human experiment by the CIA. delusions that when i sleep, a government agent astral travels into my brain to take away the parts of me that make me human, or that ive been replaced by a computer, or that none of my life is real and im just a robot who’s been programmed with human memories. falling asleep every night with bizarre flashing images of my loved ones being killed projected in my eyelids. is that normal? i could go on and on. 
i have no relationship with my dad. he moved out when i was 13 and hasn’t made an attempt to be in my life, even when he did live with me. i just found out he has stage IV colon cancer and he wants me to come visit. i don’t harbor any resentment. the past is the past and staying angry about it does nothing for anyone. ive felt that way for years, but now i feel like I have a fucking gun to my head to try to rebuild some sort of relationship with him. like i don’t have enough time and the more pressure there is the more insurmountable it seems. i get to this level of overwhelming stress about everything, even the fucking dishes when they pile up in the sink so you can imagine the type of stress im under now. 
on top of that, we have to pack all of our stuff to move 2 hours away in 8 days. ill be 2 hours away from my family and i don’t even know how to drive. the only real discernible reassurance that i am a real person will now be even further from my reach. 
none of our unemployment payments have been sent since the end of december, and it’s our last week in the city. i was hoping to see my little sister before we left, take her shopping and make sure she’s okay, but we have no money so i have no way of getting to her now. if the payments don’t come in the next couple of days, i won’t be able to say goodbye. there’s so much that’s weighing on me and i can’t even force myself to get in the shower most days. the little things that help me get through the day are all out of reach and basic day to day self care is now unattainable not just because im depressed, but because i don’t have any money for quarters to do my laundry or to buy face wash or vitamins or paper towels or pay my phone bill. i was so suicidal through the fall because i just hated myself so much and was so tired of feeling empty. now i want to kill myself because i can’t afford to live, and the life im living doesn’t feel worth sticking around for.
i haven’t talked to anyone about anything in so long. it’s so much suffering to hold inside each day. i can’t talk to my fiancé about it because i know it only makes him worry more, but i just don’t think im going to make it. there’s too much. it’s crushing me. im so lonely. i need someone to take care of me. no ones ever taken care of me before. I can’t do it anymore. i can’t do it. i don’t want to. i don’t care to. im not equipped to help myself, im not capable of getting better again. statistics exist for a reason. maybe im just supposed to be part of one.

My issues probably aren't as bad some others. I have no illusions about how it would affect my parents, and I still know they would be hurt by this. I can't kill myself, because I dont want to hurt them.

I feel like I'm gonna jump in the air and rip myself apart. I hate myself

I just realized now that everyone I considered close to me, and perhaps even cared for caused my Anorexia, especially my girlfriend. But last time it happened was 6 months ago though my mentality is still really fucked up. 

 I don't trust anyone anymore yet I feel frustrated because I feel alone. But if I'm not alone I'll just get Anorexia again? But I don't want to cut them out of my life because I don't want to be alone and I'll just be eaten alive by my thoughts. 

I don't fucking know anymore dude. Tried turning to religion but I feel a tiny bit worse. Escapes are dying off and I'm losing my motivation to do anything.

I don’t even know where I’m supposed to start with this so here it goes I guess. 

Most of the time I like to think that I’m happy and outgoing and then all of a sudden something hits me where it stops me from doing schoolwork, trying to hangout with friends and talking to my family. Usually it won’t last this long but just recently it’s lasted 2-3 weeks. I’ve been feeling like my own childhood friends don’t want me there so I don’t really try to text them or nothing. There is one that I recently became good friends with and she is very nice and offers help whenever needed, but I don’t ever know how to ask for help. 

 School has been a real downing thing as it just stresses me so far out that I try to work and I just get frustrated and quit. As a result my assignments have been piling up and as it’s nearing the end of the semester I’m worried I’m not going to graduate. 

I’m sure my family would love to help, but I don’t want to put that worry on them so I’ve been hiding how I’ve always sat and thought by myself about what I can do to help pull me out of these bottomless pits I keep falling into. Really the only thing that I’ve come up with was working and since I’m still in school I can only do a couple hours a day to get my mind off things. This would be why weekends are the hardest for me since I barely work on the weekend and when it’s offered to me, I take it no questions asked. 

As always I’m sure there’s plenty more to be typed but for anyone who actually read this through thank you so much!

I just don't know if anything that I considered 'me' is real. I don't know if I'm just acting or really this is how I feel. My therapist wants to cancel me if she supposedly catches me lying, which implies that she thought I may have lied before, which may be partially true. That one lie was a broken promise, that I would not attempt suicide, but afterward meeting my father in person she 'understood' how I felt. But I don't even know if that attempt for taking my life was really that much of a threat. I made shallow cuts even if I 'tried', pressing the blade as hard as I can, taking all my meds before then, but realizing afterward that one pack is 1/20 of the minimal deadly dose, trying hanging only to stand up after almost fading away.

I took a semester off from uni, currently doing absolutely nothing, reading fantasy books and watching philosophy videos, so probably I can convince myself even more..  I tried to fess up my barely active suicidal attempts to my father and his girlfriend, but as usual everyone understood it as more of a threat to continue my passive life, rather than a threat against my life. 

I have no goal, nothing. Reading the fictions help me feel, I'm happy when the protagonist is happy, and angry when he is angry, disgusted as he is disgusted, sad when he is sad. It feels like being someone who actually has something, and it helps ignore the absurdity of existence. Like I can ignore my own thoughts, giving room for theirs and just staying a quiet observer

But otherwise, no feelings that would help me stand and continue. These just help me feel myself bearable, but also anchors me to passivity

And while I'm anchored I get the wise thoughts from others, to decide if I actually want to heal or want to remain like this forever, giving me no room to say that my wish would be to jump off a bride, because the guilt would just rebound and start killing me again.

Even if I told them, would I really jump off a bridge? I mean sure, every second thoughts is about jumping out of my window, head first, or just take the damn bus and get it over with, theres the chance of surviving but you can try again later

But would I do it? Isn't it just whining, to let me continue sheltered in my room, reading books?

Even when I'm crying, I feel a moment of pause in the turmoil of emotions and my trust to my own feelings start to waver. Am I just decieving myself among the others? Am I really feeling like I've been crippled, or I just ignore anything else

Even while crying and thinking about maybe finally posting something here would get me some closure I thought about upvotes, and became disgusted. I can no longer trust myself, but then who the fucking hell can I trust? The fucking foundations of my life may be a lie

I'm torn

I don't know

I don't fucking know anymore

I'm not even sure why I think that, except that I guess that's something that happens when you're depressed. But it makes it very difficult to care about anything or plan anything long term.

Hi, I'm from Argentina and on my 1st year of career, 'cause I lived A LOT of bad situations in my life, and now at my middle 22's I can return to college for my 5 years of duration career. I'm really depressed, thinking about suicide myself with a .22LR gun I have from my grandpa, and anxious (I waste all my days in my mind thinking about my problems, doing nothing, complaining to my friends and my friends are enough with my shit). I'm really really frustrated for my actual situation with no girlfriend, no job, no good situation in my career, a lot of fucked up familiar problems and so... I get really mad with myself by an experience with an ex member of my class in high school, I've tried to flirth with her on IG, but she's on her's 3rd year of career and working harder in a full time job, so I was in my mind thinking than I was doing well but... try that.. puts me soooo down... she was not interested on my obviously 'cause I'm... I'm nothing... I'm a dump, dumb, blind, I didn't deserve a girlfriend and less a girlfriend like her, she didn't let me meet her now. So... I'm devastated, in ruins, my heart is broke and I'm poor, I want to became a professional in the future but I'm really fucked up in every shape and form.

I was so frustrated in this days than I'm in my mind thinking about develop my appearance the most I can with the not much money I have, to get some new stuffs to dress and have a haircut (I'm with my long hair like Kurt Cobain, but getting bald and obviously not rough, I'm more like an indigenous dude, I'm ugly). The few friends I have are trying to do their best with me because they can notice I'm a hidden suicidal guy and.. I'm so lonely.. 'cause today I've found my friends.. they're in my head.. I'm so ugly... but that's okay, 'cause so are not you, broken mirrors. Tbh I'm a 80% sure I'm going to kill myself soon, 'cause I'm an autistic adult and I waste too much time, really much time, inside my home in my depression and now I'm really frustrated with myself and all. I hurt ppl in the past and now in social medias by my non self confidence and antisocial disorder. I delete FB, IG, and also I created accounts again with 1 or 2 followers for now. What should I do? I'm doing right? I'm in time to create a new life for myself? I'm a bad person? Can I improve my appearance and search girlfriend?

I’m a 22 year old loser with no degree, no drivers license, and I’m living with my parents. I really felt so developmentally behind my peers. They have jobs, relationships, go on trips, etc while I am stuck in the basement. I truly feel like a child. When I was 21, they wouldn’t even allow me to go to bars. They would literally tell me no. If I wanted to meet new friends, they would demand to meet them. It’s as if they were treating them like some child who was going to be exploited by a pedophile. I’m tired of doing chores for them. I’m tired of not living life. I haven’t had a relationship or sex. Their social mores prevent me from seeking out any romantic relationship. They want an arranged marriage for some girl I don’t love in a country far away. I plan to move out at 25 (sadly) unfortunately because I need to save up enough money for moving expenses, security deposit, and some new appliances. It feels like I will have wasted my first half of 20s and my true adult life will begin at 25. I truly feel behind.

I am in need of more sad songs. Something low key. Something with vibes similar to “Achilles Come Down” and “Another Love” maybe. Or just whatever.

since some of you know what happened to me yesterday and today... i'll just share the summarized version of what happened to me..

&#x200B;

last night my sister told me that i don't have depression and i'm just going crazy. she got annoyed when i told her i have been feeling so anxious lately and depressed.. she even gave me a box of disposable scalpel for me to "overcome" my depression and me doing self harm. this afternoon, my dad told us that my mom feels like she'll die soon and i can't even feel any emotions or anything and it's making me feel worse. 

this evening, my mom cooked us a meal and asked everyone to come and eat with her (i don't really eat that much cause i have ed but i'm taking up medications for me to cure myself. i can eat a little but not that much.) So anyways, my mom asked us to come and eat with her but when i was about to come down and eat dinner my sister told my parents that i won't eat and so she ate everything with my other sister. i went downstairs a few mins ago and saw my dad looking at me and thinking if i'm okay but i just did not mind anyone at home because i'm tired with all the shit in here.

i still want to kill myself. i keep telling myself that yeah i'll hold off on it another month, but then i get worried because i think what if i want to do it but don't have the correct emotions and then my chance is ruined.

idk im overthinking and i want to stab my chest but im just so tired. i should be so happy. i was so happy today. i was so fucking unbothered and joyful. but as soon as im by myself it's back to normal and imt tired

How to get used to the idea that people always leave you in the end? And that you have no intrinsic value or anything at all that makes you special in a way you're indispensable? I'm so tired. I feel quite lonely. I try my very best to fight these thoughts but they keep coming back. Is it time to look for a psychiatrist once again?

My dream is that I just walk out the door one day and just vanish completely like I never existed. I want to go somewhere remote and just get swallowed up by brush or wander into a cave and never come out. I wish I could burn everything I own, every paper with my name on it, every picture my worthless face is in, and then die and rot and leave nothing behind but some bones under some weeds where I’ll never be found. Like I had never existed at all and any memory of me is fleeting.

I hate my self. That is something I’ve known for a long, and I’ve been extra hard on myself lately, and a thought came into my head “Am I faking being depressed just to get more attention”, and the more I think about it the more worse I feel, causing me to think that I’m just faking it again, and the cycle repeats, making me feel worse and worse. Is this normal?









[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzn0rc/ive_tried_almost_everything/
I’ve tried over 30 medications and been in therapy off and on since I was 11 (I’m 28 now). I have awful side effects to most. Wellbutrin knocked me out. With a tiny, baby liquid dose of lithium I had toxicity. Zoloft, buspqr, and Prozac gave me awful insomnia and akathasia that almost led me to suicide. Other medications have either done nothing or made things worse. Sometimes I almost fool myself into thinking a medication is working until reality hits and everything comes crashing down. I’ve had a full physical. My thyroid is a little low but fine, but I tried medication for a little while anyway and it didn’t help anything. I’ve tried hormone therapy multiple times. I underwent ECT, which prevented alcohol and self harm (my only two coping skills at the time) from making me feel even slightly better which made me attempt. I’ve surrounded myself with mentally healthy people like I thought I was supposed to, but it sucks because they don’t understand my struggle. I’m successful, talented in my profession and hobbies, have my own business, have a decent family, a good relationship, and I’m still fucking sad all the time. The next things to try are Ketamine and DBS which will be expensive and not covered by insurance. The financial burden of that will be another trigger for my depression so I don’t really know what to do here. Is it worth it to keep trying new things? Will anything ever help? Or should I just accept that this is my life and how I was born and how I’m going to be no matter what and I just need to suck it up? I’ve come such a long way. I used to SH almost daily. I’m about 3 years clean, but I’ve been 3 years clean before and fucked it up. I still get urges at least once a week but I remind myself how disappointed people are in me when they find out and that’s what keeps me safe. I’m just completely fucking exhausted with the “keep trying!” “don’t give up hope”-ass attitude. How many things must I try before it’s acceptable to give up?

   My therapist wants me to stop going to therapy. I’m extremely suicidal and I’m an active self harmer. So, I told her (my therapist) I would most likely kill myself if I stopped seeing her because I don’t have anyone else I can talk to about my feelings. She just told me to find someone else to talk to. I told her I don’t have anyone I can safely talk to and she just told me to pay attention to the people I see over the week. 

  I don’t know if my parents ever cared about me, but, my mom told me she doesn’t think anything will help me after I was allergic to the antidepressants I was prescribed. My parents don’t really like me, they’d kick me out if I was an adult. 

I don’t really find comfort in anything, and thinking about how I don’t have anything that comforts me is very emotionally distressing. I’m trying really hard to improve. It seems like I’m not, though. I feel like writing this might help even though it probably won’t.

In the past several months at least two or three times a day I’ve thought about the bliss of nothing. The end of deadlines, false smiles, fear, anxiety,... just a sweet kiss of oblivion. Heaven for me is the absence of myself. To not think or feel or experience. To live on only as a memory. 

I am unable to do it. I have a family. Sometimes I think about when my child is 30 and situated. Explaining that my love is endless but that I need to rest. That they and my wife are safe, financially sound. That all I want is to experience the absence. I’ve overcome many things in life (childhood through adulthood) but at this point it’s a race to the end. I married someone who I knew wouldn’t need me to survive. It was intentional. No codependency. I offer her and my child a bit of luxury but without me they would be fine financially and with a large family. I offer value in understanding, empathy, money, and education.

I’m going for a vasectomy, I love my child but I want no more. It increases the timeline until I rest. I will be the person I need to be. I will smile, and be proud of every accomplishment my child has, and when they can prosper I will rest. 

I’ll endure until I don’t need to.

What do you think are the triggers and reasons? It feels like actually most people nowadays suffer from some kind of depression. Why is that? Sure, isolation due to lockdown has an immense influence and effect right now, but I also mean in general nowadays, regardless of the pandemic.

Is it because the whole world has just become screens and internet?

Is it because of the economy and its effects on people having to struggle more than before to make a living?

Why is it? And what are ways to stop it/help yourself?

Thank you

Sincerely, a lost soul.

This is gonna sound weird but here we go: A few nights ago, I was leaving my friends place, and I chose to take the long way "home", because that means I have to spend less time there. The weird part is that I felt truly happier in that drive than I have in a long time. 

I've tried to find excuses to go for a drive the last few days, but none of them have had the same effect. I think it could be because of the scenarios (the initial drive was at night on a practically empty highway, opposed to busy streets during the day). The problem is that I can't just say "I'm going for a drive" any random night without my parents questioning where I am going or what I'm doing or why do I need to go for a drive.

Has anyone else had similar experiences? Or any ideas on how I could use this as stress reliver?

Thank you in advance!

I just turned 30M and I’ve had anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. I was diagnosed and put on medication when I was 16. The meds helped me a lot and worked for me, until I was 21. Ever since then I’ve been a guinea pig, trying different medications and none have had lasting relief. Most didn’t even work for me, or just made my condition worse. It’s been a roller coaster ride of ups and downs with each change in medication and nothing helps. I can’t keep a damn job, can’t have a healthy relationship and I have no interest in anything at all. Being my age and living with my parents is fucking embarrassing, but with how I feel, I have no choice. I keep telling myself, something has to give, something will help me, but I’ve been saying that for 9 years. What kind of life is this to live? Suffering in your own mind every minute of everyday and people who don’t have these issues don’t understand. “Why do you always seem so sad and miserable? Just be happy!”, g-whiz, why the fuck didn’t I think of that!? Oh yeah because it doesn’t work that way, I can’t just flip a switch in my brain, to sunshine and rainbows. People just don’t get it. Depression sucks.

TL/DR: Watch that's never worked for over 4 years suddenly starts working, never give up on yourself!

&#x200B;

So this isn't the best of stories but its helped me since happening.

&#x200B;

I received a watch by accident about 5 years ago, one of those fancy ones you don't wear out of fear of being robbed with it on or damaging it. I didn't order it and spent about the better part of a year trying to return it, with the sending company eventually stating that if the original recipient does not claim within a few weeks I should take it as my own.

&#x200B;

Awesome news yes, I never get "lucky" with stuff like this, this watch however came with this nice lil notice stating that it is an influencer model and lacks the mechanisms to function function, it's eye candy only. So it was pretty much throwaway junk, my inner-hoarder decided to store it in a box and forget about it.

Come this weekend, I'm in my usual sombre hole, until I find the box the watch came in. I open the box, try the watch on one last time before throwing it out, and this is when it happens... I try to see if i can get the time set for the 10000000th time when the pin shoots outwards, "Fvxk, now it really is a paperweight." is all I can think... until I see the seconds hand start to move! 

This is what I'm taking as my sign that this year will be the year shxt starts to work, for me, for you, for everybody.

I don’t know why I’m up at 3 in the morning crying over some shit that I guess I didn’t get over in my past. 

You can totally stop reading now because I feel like from here on out is me just venting and rambling while sleep deprived and sad. 

TW for sexual assault, death of pets, and terrorism... I don’t know how to do trigger warnings! 

Back in 2017, I had a complete rollercoaster of a year. 

Staring in February, I met the most amazing adorable boy with a birthday 2 days after mine. We talked on a dating app before officially meeting for a real date on Valentine’s Day. He was open minded, he was kind to people who had nothing to offer him, and our sexual chemistry was the best I have ever had to this day. 

March of the same year, I started going to a trade school for a job I really wasn’t interested in and only wanted to use to pay for my true passion job. I was nervous to start because I was the only there that didn’t want to do this as a career. I felt guilty for being there, but it was only a 6 month course, so I just forced myself through those feelings.

In April, I got to see and have a meet and greet with my favorite singer. She remembered me from the last tour I saw her on. I was so fucking happy and met some wonderful lovely people that I am still friends with while I was there. Unfortunately April was also the month where I watched a TV show with a rape scene that was strikingly similar to mine. That was when I finally admitted to myself. I. Was. Raped. I had never told anyone this. Just my little dog. I whispered into her ear and cried and fell asleep with her in my arms the night it happened. I tried reaching out to my boyfriend about it and he said he wasn’t in the mood for that kind of talk and went to bed instead. 

May of 2017, the previously mentioned singer I had just hugged and enjoyed watching live had her concert attacked by a suicide bomber. If you’re familiar with this, you know who I’m talking about. This resulted in the loss of lives and I knew a lot of people who were in attendance (and thankfully were safe). I was heartbroken for the loss of life, the injuries, and also the mental scars people would have sustained from this. I don’t think people really knew how much I cared about this, but it really took an emotional toll on me. The day after this attack, my boyfriend decided my sadness from this combined with my sexual assault trauma resurfacing was too much for him to handle. He ended our short relationship by blocking me on all platforms and didn’t give me an explanation until a few days after he moved to another city a few days later. 

In June, I finally got the strength to drag my ass to therapy and talk to a specialist for sexual assault and abuse. Here I learned that my best support was my dog. Therapy was the best choice I had ever made. 

July of 2017 was the final straw for me. My dog had been my one and only steady support for me through each and every one of these hardships. She suddenly passed from a heart failure while I was sleeping. I took part of the day off of school, but I couldn’t take the whole day off. That day it rained, and I just remember loving the fact that no one could hear me crying over the sound of the rain hitting the metal roof of the school building.

The rest of 2017 was filled with ups and downs that were much smaller and I really didn’t care much for the life events most people look forward to forever. Turning 21, graduating school, finishing a therapy program... none of it made me feel anything because I just began to detach myself from feeling.

Fast forward to today. I’m in a relationship of 3 years, making great money at the job I went to school for, and have two amazing and adorable fur babies. But why am I still stuck in 2017? I’m constantly wondering what if about my ex, sometimes wishing my current boyfriend was him. I shouldn’t be emotionally dreaming of my ex while I’m laying in bed next to the guy I’ve been with 10 times longer than him. And why am I so worried about my dogs dying as if they’re going to drop dead any second instead of cherishing every moment I have with them? 

It felt so good to get some of this off my chest and then I got to the WHY part of all this and it just makes me so fucking upset. I feel sick to my stomach, I’m crying, I’m losing sleep, I’m thinking of suicide, and it’s all because I don’t have a fucking time machine to go back and change all the little things to make me happier now. I know I’m supposed to accept my past and move on, but I accepted it and now what? I feel like I’m on edge just trying not to fuck up again and I just want to live in the moment and enjoy things again. I hate myself for what I’ve done in the past, how these things that have happened to me made me act and react. I hate myself for posting this but I’m still gonna do it anyway. Fuck! 

Thank you and sorry to whoever actually read any or all of this shit. 
I hope no one I know ever sees this.

Ever since Covid happened my(22) life has been in a slow downward spiral. Physical success in some small areas but mentally I've been declining day by day to the point where I've stagnated completely in my life. 

I'm lucky though. A year ago I met the most wonderful woman and with her i feel like I could actually escape this hellhole. I could go back to therapy, exercise and all that shit they put on a laundry list for fixing my fucked up head. We lived together for a bit because of covid which helped me survive the first 5 months after March but she had to move because of grad school. The mental decline has since become harder to fight. We're not codependent but just supportive in a way both our families aren't able or willing to be. 

I want to move in with her but it would break my mom and dads heart. My dad just got a new house too. But I don't think I'm gonna get out this rut in this house with him. I'm starting to have ideation again and I'm getting more worried I'll have another severe episode. 

Should I just say fuck it. Leave it all behind? How do I do it. I can't just tell my parents "this is the only person who gets it and actually helps". They'll feel like failures and they aren't. Idk how to do this.

I have been depressed for months. Have hardly moved from my chair. Just scrolled mindlessly over the Internet. And barely drunk any water. And now since the past 4 days have been having splitting headaches all day. And I keep thinking I must have some sort of brain tumor. And, while I'm scared I also feel it would be a relief. That's it.

I’m on fluoxetine/prozac for anxiety and depression. Started them a year ago and really helped me, I felt a few months ago I was feeling really low again due to stress in my life so the doctor doubled the dose so I’m on 40mg per day, for the past week I’ve felt absolutely exhausted and keep falling asleep, I’m sleeping at night so that’s not the issue, I’ve zero energy and no motivation and haven’t showered for a week which wasn’t me a couple of months ago. Could it possibly be the medication that is causing the tiredness?

Yes, it sounds ridiculous, but I am ready to leave this world. However, I am a coward to end my journey here in the world. I do not have friends. I do not feel any affection from my family; I hate them for taking my dreams away from me. I feel like a burden for every person I have met in my life, and the lovers I had just used me to have fun or because they felt bad for me. I have tried many times to jump off the bridge, cut myself, find someone to do the work I cannot do. My trust is given so easily to strangers because I do not have the privilege to have someone else to talk to. I have been depressed for 10 years, and I still hope I can finally overcome this state. Nonetheless, I am always getting here over and over again. I wish I had a friend, I wish I were loved. Last time I hugged someone was 2 years ago; everyone I loved is going to die or is already dead. I hope I die tonight, I am too tired for trying again.

I thought I had been freed from these horrible chains - I thought a spiritual awakening, a loving partner, a slightly better family dynamic, and a best friend would help me with this problem. I thought everything was alright but everything suddenly feels very bleak and cumbersome. I just want to push my friends and family away now; I wish they would hate me so this would be easier. If I had nothing to live for this would be easier.

Recently, my best friend and I had a conversation. I've done inconsiderate things but we've spoken; she says she needs space but made the distinction that I'm a good person - that she learns things from me and really enjoys my company. It's just small things that I'm working very diligently to fix. She's dealing with a lot of stress with family and other friends - said it wasn't just me but we haven't really spoken much in the past two weeks and I can't help but feel like if I hadn't come into her life she wouldn't be so frustrated despite how she's told me it isn't the case - that I am a positive part of her life and her only friend that doesn't wear her down.I don't believe her though. I've convinced myself that people's lives would be better and despite how irrational and silly I KNOW that is, I can't get it out of my head. It consumes my daily life. I'm processing the world around me better than I was prior but at the current moment, I feel like I'm floating. I just feel numb and I don't care what happens anymore.

I love my friends - my family - my significant other to pieces but I feel like the more I'm around them the more I wear them. I'm just considering telling everyone I know that I want to be left alone - that I can't do this anymore. Another part of me wants to scream for help but there's no point. I don't have the money for treatment and I would hate myself even more than I already do if I dare ask for help.

To my loved ones, I'm sorry I'm like this. I wish I wasn't so weak. All of the lessons I've learned throughout my 19 years have been more nothing. I know eventually, I'll die by my own hands. I'll never have a family - I'll never experience the joys of life that I hear about constantly. I feel stupid writing this. I'm scared someone will find it but I recall... no one in my life aside from one person has ever cared to know how I'm doing. They dealing with their own things though and it's unrealistic for me to set this standard on them. They don't need to care about me. I would prefer they didn't.

Music ordinarily causes me to feel happy or it helps relieve some sort of tension in myself but it doesn't seem to help much of anything anymore. 

Anyone reading this, I beg you please please tell your family and friends that you care about them. To have those around you who care never bat an eye at your troubles is one of the loneliest feelings on the planet.

I have insurance through Kaiser (in northern California) and I was lucky enough to start seeing a therapist regularly right before the pandemic started. Unfortunately, he quit his job a month or two ago and I haven't seen another therapist since.

Those of you who've tried to get a therapist in the US in the past few months, were you able to get one immediately or did you get put on a long waiting list? I've heard it's harder now because so many people are having mental health issues during covid

In July of 2020, my boyfriend was fatally stabbed in front of me. He shortly passed away, that was the last time I saw him and talked to him. I never would think that would have been the last day, I live with so much trauma and guilt. I want to die because he is not here with me, I loved this man so much. I loved him. I wanted my babies with him. I wanted to grow old with him. Now I could never and I know time heals but witnessing a murder and losing someone I love has put me through so much trauma. I can't take it anymore. Almost every night I think about turning to suicide because I'm tired of being miserable.

Today I finally decided to go outside after reading some articles that going outside can improve your mental health, turns out I was wrong. I felt even more sad, anxious, and so insecure about myself. Apparently I didn't enjoy it at all I preferred my life inside of my house rather than being outside. Everything seems pointless nowadays.

Ok, maybe it is just because I was happier as a teenager, but I honestly think I would have been way happier if I was born in an earlier generation.  I honestly hate new technology and am having a really hard time adapting to everything  being automated.  I love old technology and it makes me so happy when I am actually working with my hands.  I would have loved a job working with computers in the 70s, 80s and 90s, because the tech world was more open to women then.  I also hate being fearful of climate change and fearing society collapse.  Part of my depression is I am extremely lonely....i feel like most people are more interested in their phones then one one one interaction.

I never thought this would be me...definitely not for a second time (first time was in July 2020)

I’m struggling bad. Every single day I think about ending it. Multiple times a day. When I’m not in the mind frame I’m enjoying life and know realistically I don’t want to die...but when it gets bad, it gets loud.

I’ve reached out to 2 friends and my mom. They know and are supporting me but I feel so guilty about it. This isn’t something they should have to worry about. Who wants to deal with a friend or child who’s always thinking about hurting themselves. I feel like a burden and a failure.
I’m super scared one day I won’t be able to talk myself out of it like I can right now. I want it to go away, but instead it’s getting louder.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzpbum/manipulative_parents/
My gf has been so depressed and suicidal her entire life, and feel free to read the whole story from my past posts but

her parents are so fucking manipulative.. I don't know how to help her. It's not like I can just swoop her away or take her to therapy myself, I don't have the assets or means to do so. Her parents are only guilting her further, her mom even missed bringing her to her session today and now she has to resched (but she says she probably doesn't want to anymore because she feels so guilty and wasting money). She was already diagnosed with major depression last week by her therapist and wants her to take meds that won't be permanent, and was genuinely making small progress.. but her boomer parents are just so fucking unsupportive..

her dad even told her that "if you want the family to work, you have to help yourself" "i'm human and i'm' trying my best, and you need to help yourself" to the point that her dad even said "you don't need therapy, you're just paying someone to talk to you". I'm at a loss for words. I've spoken with her dad before and I know he genuinely wants to help and protect her, but I really think he's so blind and full of himself, ironic because he said to his daughter that she's "full of herself".

The last thing was they even told her "you'll regret everything whenwe're gone. and it'll be soon cause we're so old." she can't even open up to them because of them being them. her mental health is only getting worse and worse..

She feels like such a burden now. I don't know how to help her, I'm so heartbroken for her. Even just being there for her probably won't help her heal, she needs help but I don't know what help I can give when she's at the edge of giving it all up again. 

How? what do i do for her? I fucking love her and she doesn't deserve all of this. She's such a good person with a good heart, but it just keeps getting shattered over and over I don't know what to do.. For the record she's not a child, she's an adult but she has to live with her parents too. She wanted to leave that place as soon as she can. What can she do? What must I do?

&#x200B;

TLDR; her parents guilt tripping her further into depression

ps: sorry if I got too carried away with my emotions and calling out her parents for being boomers.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzpazy/generational_trauma/
so, i finally got diagnosed and i’m finally getting help, which is great of course, but after talking about this with a couple family members i learned a lot about my family and i’m not entirely sure how to process it. every single person in my immediate family has some awful repressed trauma that they never got the help for. and to an extent, i knew. i knew they were all screwed up and couldn’t admit to themselves that they were screwing their kids and their grandkids up. but it’s just so weird having a lifelong perception of your family be completely shattered in 2 days. i learned some things about myself too, things i don’t even remember but my sister does. the thing that impacted me the most though was finding out that my grandfather had walked in on his father after he’d taken his life at an extremely young age. i’m sorry if this is oversharing, but god i have no idea how to react to this. i don’t know what to feel or think right now, it’s just way too much all at once.

I used to have moderate to mild depression that worsened and seems to only get worse very slowly. The past 2 years it’s only seemed to have gotten worse gradually to the point where I finally, unfortunately, understand when people say they can’t even get out of bed or brush their teeth/shower. I used to think that was just bullshit and “yeah life sucks but not that badly geez.” I didn’t understand severe depression and I do now. I slowly slipped into this. I spend at least an hour in bed every morning lying around thinking about how i can’t get up. I never wash my face before bed anymore. Taking my earrings out seems like the biggest chore. I never used to be this bad. I need help so bad

Hi guys how r u?
I'll just get straight to it; i've been self harming for about two or three years now i don't really remember and for a while i used to cut my arms. i've stopped now i just do it on my legs. and at first and shit, it was not that hard to cover up. Sure it could get a bit hot at times especially living in Australia,  washing the dishes was  frustrating, and making sure my arms were covered up before someone entered my room was quite annoying BUT over all, it was doable. With all the red and inflamed marks on my arm from past cuts, i can't just leave them exposed. especially Not in front of family, teachers or friends(school). but now it's getting super frustrating to cover up my arms and i was thinking of not really covering them up anymore when i go out with my best friend (she knows/unjudgemental) but i'm kinda worried ppl around me might get triggered by it but it gets kind of :/ to constantly cover them up. Keep in mind the scars on my arms are all fully healed they're just red and puffy but i stopped cutting on my arms a while ago. what do you guys think? 

another problem i have is my senior ball ( prom) is coming up pretty soon and my mom wants to take me dress shopping. i'm rlly worried bc idk how to cover up my scars :((( i told her i wana wear long sleeve dress and she said "u should still try on ones with ur arms out just to see" and i've explained to her how i don't like my arms bc they're fat ( as an excuse i don't actually think that) and i suggested maybe i could wear like gloves? like rlly cool 20's type right but the thing is when i go shopping she is still gonna have to see the dress on before i buy the gloves. and they don't sell realy nice long sleeve dresses :(( i asked if i could go shopping with my best friend (so i don't have to worry about it) but she insisted on coming :(((( wtf do i do!!! i'm rlly sad i just wish this wasn't a problem i wish i never cut on my arms it's so frustrating to fucking hide :((( 

please don't suggest i talk to my mother about it because she talks shit about people who self harm / doesn't believe in mental illness issues. also YES, i do see a psychologist and i am on antidepressants so please don't suggest that either. i'm aware of my problem and so is my doctor <333

if you struggle with the same thing, PLEASE get help. i understand how hard it is and when people ask us to just "stop" cutting it doesn't work, it's an addiction and it's hard to deal with on ur own!!! 

thanks guys i hope ur all okay <33

Hey everybody...
This is my first ever reddit post so probably no one will read it or think much of it. But I'm used to that, so it's fine... 

I've been feeling like shit since the end of 2018 and went into therapy August 2019. My Psychologist was one of those, 'Oh that must've been so hard for you' and 'how does that make you feel' type of people, so I switched to a different one and after our first conversation she told me that I probably have a social phobia and it would probably be good to start on antidepressants since I was also getting gloomy because of my anxiety.

I wanted it to get better so I started taking Sertraline. (An SSRI) after talking to a psychiatrist. It didn't work. I spiraled down into a depression and my psychiatrist wanted to start me on Efexor (venlafaxine). Up until that point, my fear of becoming worse had kept me from drinking. Before I started taking AD I was a problemdrinker and even confessed to my boyfriend I drank waaay too much. Well not now. I was on AD so I'd get better.

Fast forward a few months.  It's 9 in the morning and I'm drunk. I Feel like total shit all the time and am so depressed that I keep thinking about ending it all.
Somehow I still manage to work, but I really hate my job, my bf doesn't understand and keeps saying I make his life hell with my nasty moods and he doesn't like coming home to me...
I know I shouldn't take alcohol with AD, but I feel so low, and the only thing that temporarily makes me feel better, is alcohol.

Does anyone else feel like that? Do you have any advice? Does anyone care? Probably not... sorry to waste your time.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzmljh/suspect_livein_partner_has_depression_possible/
I suspect my partner has depression. The symptoms started 3 years ago with slacking on chores, other responsibilities and lying about debt. I brought it up and it was ignored. I left it. A year later violent bounce of anger began which included wall punching. A couple's therapist mentioned it might be depression. They ignored it. I left it. Slowly months by months it kept getting worse. I brought it up every now and then. Eventually they contacted their GP and did a CBT course. I noticed the homework did not get done, there was a short talk about it when asked and they spent their time playing games instead. Fast forward to now, all they do is work, cook and play video games. The house got as bad as cat urine/feces/sick being left on the carpet for 2 weeks (I had a neck injury and could not move/do anything - I've cleaned it all now though!). The house is so cluttered from unfinished de-cluttering/moving jobs from months back. They are still maintaining personal hygiene and feeding themselves, however all personal responsibility have vanished. They are on a warning with work due to playing games during it. Despite this warning I see them playing games or watching games each time I walk past the office (it is next to the bathroom and the monitor is at door view).  This stresses me out as I am worried they will lose their job and it was agreed that I would be supported during my degree (because I cannot work/study like others) and after that I can be the "bread winner" so they can do whatever they want. 

&#x200B;

**What I am dealing with external to the relationship:** 

* I am deaf, autistic (ASD), dyslexic and in eating disorder and OCD recovery.
* I was diagnosed with some scary health issues which are related to a phobia. 
* I have been successfully doing intensive therapy for coming up to 3 years (super grateful after fighting years to have access).
* Been without my therapist for a month.
* Been in lockdown since last March. (No other social contact IRL outside of partner). 
* My close friend was diagnosed with breast cancer a month back.
* We lost five of my pets last year, all suddenly and unexpectedly to freak illnesses. 
* I have been experiencing bulling and discrimination from tutors and peers.
* My best friend has been putting less effort into our friendship (they moved to another country).
* I have not been given much support from tutors or dissertation supervisor.
* My course is under threat of being shut down and investigated, making the tutors more unhelpful. 
* I have a dissertation due on Wed which is part of an extension for reasonable adjustments. 
* I never learned the basics of essay writing in school due to being mainstream deaf. 
* I need the communal spaces and my space to be clean and neat (ASD/OCD related). 
* There is a pile of charity things in my space.
* All communal spaces are cluttered and dirty. (I have been chipping away at then with whatever energy I can muster. They sadly make them messy again quickly). 
* Not had sex in a year. Kissing has stopped. Hugs are rare. 
* Finding it hard to function as I get bouts of depression related to ASD. Regular depression treatment does not work the same way. 

&#x200B;

For a while I was handling it okay, it was stressful but my WRAP and coping techniques no longer seem to be working. I suspect I might be in survival mode. It has reached the point in which I am experiencing daily triggers for multiple of my conditions. I  had a return of suicidal thoughts (was nearly free of this for a year), I have not self-harmed again but those urges are back too (super tempted), finding myself crying daily, struggling to sleep and just really having a very lonely and rubbish time. Craving love, care and affection. Finding it super hard to give myself that love, care and affection. For now I am trying my hardest to focus on getting my dissertation completed as best as I can. But the stress of the environment I am in is making that extra challenging. It takes me much longer to do task due to conditions. This is not a big issue with the correct support but I sadly have been failed by the institution. **Anyone got any advice on how to make the best of the last few days before due date?**   


**Does anyone have any advice on navigating a depressed partner beyond "focus on you" which might help?** **But is also not a list of things to make them feel better?** **How does one get through this awful, awful phase?** Obviously nipping my relapse symptoms in the bud ASAP is a good step. But outside of that, I am feeling so lost on how to handle the intense loneliness and focus.   


  
Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I was feeling extremely depressed and all of a sudden I had this thought that I'm nothing in this world, you might think this is even more depressing but for me, it isn't. Being nothing makes me feel better because it doesn't matter what I do, I won't change the world, with me or without me the world is still the same. So I can literally do whatever I want. I'm only a little ant among 7.7 billion ants. 

What happens if I stay depressed lying in a bed? The world doesn't give a fuck, It stays the same, what happens if I get my shit together and I actually achieve my goals? The world doesn't give a fuck, just the same thing. That idea made me feel better, it gave me a little sense of reality, it created a spark inside me.

I'm not sure if this is going to be helpful for other people, I'm sorry if this sounds like bullshit for you, maybe it is bullshit, but I think that some people out there must have similar ways of looking at life and that thought could be helpful somehow, thanks for your time!

I've been in my own place for a little over a month now and things have been good. I feel a sense of pride in my own space, have been working on creative projects, and work has been going well. 

All that said, I still dont see a future worth living for. I'll never have a wife or kids, and in 24 years of life I havent found anything worth living a whole life for. I'm kind of just biding my time until my parents pass and my best friend is out of my life at which point I can off myself without hurting anyone.

I've been feeling super low recently. I started cutting again. I don't know who to turn to. I feel like a burden to my friends. I know everyone is dealing with their own struggles. I don't want to add to their stress. I'm seeing a therapist every two weeks and it helps to talk things through, but it doesn't seem like enough. Everyone I tell about my depression ends up leaving. It's hard to keep going sometimes. I feel so alone and trapped.

I'm 25. I had to move back home with my parents when the pandemic started. It's destroyed my mental state. I don't have a job, my parents still control my life. How do I escape? I don't have enough money to live on my own. I can't be myself here. I don't have any passions. Nothing interests me. Things I enjoyed when I was younger have no effect on me now. I sit around on my phone all day. I can't see anyone other than my family for fear of COVID. People my age are going about their lives as if nothing is wrong. How is anyone a productive human? How does anyone deal with the genuine shittiness that is life? Home is a prison.

Edit: WARNING. This horror has become so apart of my life now that I’m use to it. And I forget that it really fucks people up just hearing about it it’s so traumatic. So just to prepare it’s about aggravated sexual assault with young children

Ok so I found out this summer that my daughter who is 12 now was raped when she was 7 multiple times by my best friends husband. She told me that it finally stopped when she went to her best friend, (my best friends daughter) and asked her to tell her dad to stop. And then it didn’t happen again after that. I called my best friend and told her what I just found out. She was shocked and had doubts but said she would ask her daughter if she remembers that. She called me back an hour later crying cuz her daughter admitted and admitted he’s been raping her too starting when she was 5. His own daughter. she kicked her husband out and we called the police and I’m very happy to say after a week of working with the fbi. my friend got him to confess to it all while the fbi was listening. He’s now in jail waiting trial. Finding this all out has devastated our whole family. My husband had to come home early from his deployment we were so devastated. Months have gone by. I signed My daughter up for trauma counseling and they said after two sessions she doesn’t need trauma counseling. That she has moved on from this and is not traumatized by it. I asked my daughter if that was true and she said yes she just wants to move on and be a normal family again. I tell her ok and say help is there for you if you need it. I know this is what she wants and she doesn’t want this to be our life. but I’m having a hard time moving on and I don’t want to upset her. I can’t stop thinking about it. It doesn’t make sense. How the fuck did I not see this.. how did my friend. not see this. Our family have been so close for the last ten years. We get together 3 times a week for ten years. He was so fucking normal. How did I not see this monster who raped his 3 biological daughters now we know, and my daughter was next to me this whole time. We are both stay at home moms. Our kids are our everything. And these kids were always happy. We never once saw them in pain or saw bloody underwear or saw her crying around him. And they had to have been and I can’t move on from my confusion. How was this massive absolute horror happening for years and no one had a clue. And the guilt. My job is to protect her and I failed. No matter what I do for the rest of her life I have failed as her mother. I don’t know how to not have this be my life. I’m never gonna not be devastated or confused or fulled with so much guilt. Everyone says I need therapy but I don’t see the point. On the outside I’m normal. I’m ok I’m not crying on the couch for days. I’m playing with my kids and my husband and I are great. We really leaned on each other. He agrees with my daughter and wants to move on. I feel like my family is moving forward and I can’t stop thinking about it. Lucky I have my best friend still. And she is the only one who understand what I’m going through. But it’s not the same. She understands that for about two years of my life all my photos are ruined. Every photo from the time she was 6-8 all I think about is was this when she was raped? Is she in pain in this photo and she pretending? My friend understands this because all the photos for the last 18 years are ruined for her. And she feels all this guilt and more. I can’t imagine what she is going though. She lost her husband who she thought they “we’re happy” but realizes it was all a lie. She lost her dream house(that she closed on three days before we found out)She lost 2/3 of her income. And she has the guilt of this happening to her three daughters. She knows what I’m going through more then anyone. But what I’m going through doesn’t even compare to what she’s going though. I don’t want to complain to her about my family going back to normal and happy and I’m just frozen with my thoughts. 

Ok so not I explained what I’m going though I was wondering if anyone has gone through something similar. And I’m wondering if me frozen with my horror in my head is just my normal and I need to except it.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kznzxg/was_depressed_for_a_while/
So apparently I was depressed for a while and no one blinked a tear.

I told a guy I was doing therapy and he proceeded to exclude me and talk behind my back to make me feel less secure. The other guy didn't call him out, and said that I wasn't really stepping up enough. Which may have been true. I don't understand how so many people could have sided with him. How they couldn't tell, because no one really knew me, I always hid when things got out of control, when the thoughts got bad, or the anxiety got bad, I avoid being really seen. So even these people couldn't tell, because I am more detached from emotions I could still 'do' things. And to add to that, I was in search of therapy and in therapy and they didn't convince me to stay. I had to go out of my way to talk to someone who was the first to recommend that I go back to therapy. So I found a guy, and he was kind of cold and he wanted to blame me for cancelling the session rather than understand why I did that. And he didn't tell me either, only after I forced another session he said that I seem to have lot of anxiety/personal insecurity. He didn't care whether I went or didn't go. I worked in a group at that time too and did almost nothing and people just told me to do more, no one ever called me out  since of course with my blank face no one could tell. No one was close to me to tell. My mother closer but she needs help and is in denial, told me I was lazy didn't need help, whatever, I didn't listen to that. So nobody told me I needed help, it's crazy, instead they just wanted to tell me to do more. So, once again, on my own will, I started online therapy. And we went down for anxiety, but I told her I thought I was depressed and she didn't buy it lol. Holy fuck. So I forced that down as long as I could until she started really not getting me, holy fuck. So then I ended that, and I was in a house with other people and one guy just messed with me instead of realizing that something was going on. So then I met with more online and they just messed with me, not taking it seriously, I mean it doesn't have to be. Saying that it happens to a lot, saying that my expectations were too high. Then I went home and had another, who we talked about the family dynamic, didn't seem to buy the seriousness of it, obviously I know probably she's not allowed to. She should have emphasized how important it was for me to leave. Holy fuck. So then I said I would stop and she said that decision makes sense. So I got through school again, passing but failing exams. And then I wasn't going to touch therapy again since I spent more than a couple hundred on that shit. Nobody cared, I could have just died. I flew out on a whim, came back couple days later. Made plans to leave in a couple days, cancelled last min. Nobody cared, since the only ppl at that time were parents and they didn't care. I did not have anyone stay with me throughout my college. A girl stayed to mess with me the whole time. A guy just judged me for it. No one tried to understand because maybe it was too hard to understand, maybe I was really really special. So then I kept fucking going. I went for another position where I had to be a leader and support for others, and I cannot do that. Since I did therapy for so long and no one said a single word, I wasn't going to do it again. But all that time I was so empty I had nothing. No one would have reached out, they just assumed I was being difficult on purpose since I'm intelligent and I have that ability to just hold those emotions away and still do shit, albeit very poorly. I did everything to help myself and they still didn't want to help. That is the cruelty of what happened. Since there was no one in my life when I need something there is no one to help and that's why not everyone is going to make it. You can literally do everything, and still not be seen. Maybe I wasn't being clear in the past so they couldn't see me for who I was. But I don't know how I could have put so much in, intellectually, but not have felt anything. To still not feel seen.

I feel so alone, all the time. I don't feel as if I have friends, though I know there's plenty people there. When they don't talk to me or respond I feel like a boring failure that no one wants to talk to, and when they do talk I have no energy to keep up conversations, I just got into the habit of being alone that it's like I forget how to associate with other people.

My boyfriend is the only person I really talk to, and I find myself getting upset at things. He doesn't deserve it and I feel horrible. He's so understanding and supportive, but part of me is terrified he will wake up one day and not love me no more. That he will leave me. 

I want to do good things in the world, I want to help others, help myself, I want to organize my life and turn everything into good things, but I feel myself constantly getting kicked in the face by life. I sit around wondering what's going to happen next? I just keep expecting bad things to happen.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzevth/sudden_depression_comes_and_goes_cant_figure_it/
Has anyone else ever experienced sudden onset depression that can come for seemingly no reason and disappear just as fast? I'm desperate to figure out what is causing this and how to mitigate it. I can be having a great week, and I'm normally a light-hearted cheery and silly person, but it can hit me like a train where I feel total despair, my entire thought process changes, inner monologue becomes dark, and I have a hard time remembering how being happy feels. It can pass in a day or two, or last a few days. The way it feels makes me think there's something going on with a nutrient or chemical, because I've confirmed that stress/sleep/outside factors aren't causing it.

I can't move on until I figure this out; it's consumed my life at this point

It feels like I won the lottery 6 years ago and I'm never gonna have that chance again, killing myself voluntarily thinking it will help. It's been 7 month, she told me she didn't have feelings anymore, I cannot get over her yet everyone thinks I'm doing amazing with how productive I am.

I’ve been on Zoloft and Wellbutrin for about 2.5/3 years now. Just recently I tapered off and I was wondering if anyone else has had experience with higher levels of emotions after discontinuing meds. I was on antidepressants not because I was sad and suicidal, but because I felt down and low energy all the time. I struggled with motivation and always feeling sluggish. I had no interest im doing anything. Meds did help for a little bit after a while it seemed like they weren’t doing anything at all except decrease what little sex drive I did have. Now that i have a full time job and I’m a routine I’m feeling a lot better. I have a reason to get up and showered in the am. Now that Ive stopped my meds I find I’m having issues dealing with anger, little arguments with my husband turns into a big deal that before normally wouldn’t. I also find myself laughing more and at random stuff that I normally wouldn’t laugh at. I just thought I would ask here if anyone else has experienced anything similar, and if you have how did you deal with it? Eventually i plan on doing therapy but I’m just working on getting my insurance straightened out.

Hello! I’m writing because I’m so frustrated and could really use some recommendations. I’ve tried two SSRIs, Lexapro and Zoloft, and they both helped immensely but gave me extreme fatigue. While on Lexapro, I added Wellbutrin. Again, this helped me so much and gave me the needed energy, but it also gave me extreme insomnia. I tried everything, including taking the Wellbutrin early in the morning and the Lexapro at night and trying both the extended release version and sustained release of the Wellbutrin. I took these medications for long time and my sleep problems never improved, so I know it’s not just my body acclimating to them, and that I have to try something different. Any advice on new medications I could try?

Hi,

Not feeling too well been depressed and not doing so well at all. I just feel like I'm too old going to university I currently have a diploma in computer programming which I spent 2 years in community college graduated with a 3.75 cGPA graduated when I was 21. Then I worked at an aerospace company for a year as an electrical assembler and decided to go back to university at 24 for a computer science degree. I just feel like I am too old in school and life just passed by and I never accomplished anything at all. I don't know what to do?

The demolition will never end and I'll never see the "happiness" that lies behind the wall. When will it stop? When will the torment stop, when will the realization of nothingness fade away? I'm alone oh so alone just kill me please. I'm begging you there is nothing worth it in this world. Its just rinse and repeat there is nothing good to work for. It's all just pain and misery, I will never achieve what my friends have. I will never achieve what my parents have accomplished and I'll never touch the idea that I can be just like my icons. I'm just dead to the world, no one missed me and no one will miss me. I'm as good as dead and this virus didn't do shit to me sadly. I'll always be living in the past cause at least the past isn't as bad as now. Looking down into the barrel, I know its painful and I'll join you soon enough just wait a little longer. I'll kill myself soon. I'm just en echo of my former self, I'm just living in a nightmare that I'll never wake up from. Dead end job, no education, no self value, and no one to look after me. I was always meant to be alone forever and I don't care anymore. I get too attached when someone gives me a form of human decency. Probably cause not many people care enough to talk to me. I am the last of myself cause making a family is damn near impossible where I am mentally. Suicide is the right choice like I said before. My stance will never change on that, because once life will turn around I'll probably be dead by then. Just a little longer and I can be set free. I've been abandoned by everyone including God! No one was ever by my side and that is for the better. Become when I'm dead there will be no mourning,  only celebrating because I'll be eradicated from this world once and for all. Just a little longer and I'll be set free...

Lack of better title.

So apparently I have depression, but when I felt similarly over the summer and told a therapist, she said it's cuz I didn't have that many obligations that's why I wasn't feeling motivated as compared to other times. So this really fishy, if these people are really just messing with me, then I start to see that a lot of people are really 'not' there for me and I wasn't just thinking negatively. So if I see it correct, almost everyone not there for me (include mom,dad,sister) and that guy I met, and my supervisor, basically everyone. If I don't think it negatively, and base it on specifically what 'bad' have they done to me.. then.. idk they didn't do anything 'bad', they were just I guess.. ***disrespectful***. A girl always saying my name, greeting me enthusiastically just for fun-- it's called leading me on, not being friendly. A guy kind of criticizing me but then being nice too, that's called disrespectful. A therapist telling me I can get over it in couple months when it's something I had for a while-- disrespectful too? I don't know, but it seems like there is no one left otherwise I keep feeling like I'm being slighted, all the time.

I have a concern, slight suspicion that I bother people sometimes. That I react to their social media stories too frequently and overwhelm them,or that just being around me in person can be too much. I feel socially crippled sometimes. I can't tell if I'm picking up on something accurate or if my mind is playing tricks on me. My mind keeps telling me to leave people alone. How do I resist the urge to interact with people and just leave them alone?

When it comes to suicide who can be regarded as the selfish one? Is it the person who commits suicide and leaves the people behind to deal with the pain of their death? Or are the people who want someone to live with the pain they have the selfish ones?

Recently I’ve been through a lot. I’m not going to get into specifics as I don’t want any of you to feel bad for me. I know there’s plenty of people that have lives harder than mine. But it still affects me in a way I’m sure all of you can relate to. Anyways, I’m trying a new form of expression (for me) and I wrote a poem. I’m not sure what else to say as I’m not sure if anyone will even read this post, but the poem is included below. At the very least I hope this shows someone they’re not the only person going through this situation. 


Failed attempts at love,
happen more often than not.
Sometimes it isn’t meant to be,
no matter what you got. 
Like flicking an empty lighter,
or getting in a taxi with no driver,
nothing seems to work out,
but you hope the future is brighter. 
Failed attempts at love, 
happen more often than not. 
When they don’t want your heart,
even though you saved them a spot.
You think, “Better luck next time”,
and you give it another shot. 


If you read this thank you

I feel like it’s my fault that I’m not doing well. Actually I know it’s my fault. I harmed myself again today. I haven’t had an appointment with my psychiatrist since november because I have no motivation to set one up after he cancelled the last one. I finally called and set an appointment for next Monday but I don’t even know what to tell him. I haven’t been taking my meds because I have no motivation to call in a refill at the pharmacy and obviously I haven’t been doing well. A couple months ago I stopped eating and lost around 10 pounds. I started eating little by little but I haven’t gained the weight back and I’m starting to see myself go back to the same habits. It’s at the point where I have to be wearing sweaters all the time because I can’t keep my own body heat. I know this is all my fault all of it is. I have the resources to be okay but I’m not. I don’t even know what to tell him. It’s my fault I haven’t been taking my medication and it’s my fault I’ve been sleeping all day or staring at the ceiling doing nothing. I know he’ll tell me that but I already know it. I don’t even know if this medication is working for me because I haven’t been taking it long enough but I gotta take it again. Why am I hurting myself like this I’m trying so hard to be okay but I’m not. And now I feel like I’m overwhelming my boyfriend because I’m crying every night and when I’m not crying I feel nothing. He deserves better than this. He deserves someone who can listen to his problems and help him. I wish I could be that person I really really wish I could but I’m weak. I’m so weak physically and mentally and I’m sorry. I’m wasting good resources that someone who has the resilience to get better could be using. There’s no point I’m sorry I’m like this I really wish I wasn’t I’m so so sorry. I’m so sorry I wish I wasn’t like this I really do

I wish my depression was as beautiful as the song lyrics I relate to. As poetic as the words typed out on YouTube comments. The lines and curves building haunting pictures instead of scars on my arms.

I wish my depression was poetic enough that it would live longer than me. At least then a part of me would survive when the darkness consumes more than just my soul. I’m not a beautiful tragedy; I wish it was a tantalizing fad I could strip off.

I’m tears that wreck my body while my scarred arms cling onto the counter as another panic attack takes me back to a time I yearn to forget. I’m fat tears that meld into a line of snot which drips into my clothes that I haven’t changed in days. My hair isn’t a fun emo cut but an entangled mess a brush couldn’t fix. There’s no edgy makeup, there’s no energy to even open the kit.

I wish my depression was a beautiful mess. I wish it was something I used to seem mysterious and edgy to lure others in some like some Venus flytrap. “Oh no you don’t want me, I have depression and you don’t want to try and save me.” You say with such meticulously done dark makeup that tells others you spent at least an hour in front of the mirror with a practiced hand. 

No, really, you don’t want to come near me because my mind has taught me that I’m too toxic to be near anyone except for the monsters that reside in my head. I tell you with bloodshot eyes filled with fear that yet another person is going to kill the last piece of strength in me.

And as I lay here in bed wishing for sleep I realize how bad my depression really is. When you yearn for the monsters that your paranoia creates to kill you, you know your depression has won.

Okay so I'm 15F and trying to decide if I should try and get some therapy. I've been struggling for as long as I can remember (I think I have some sort of chronic depression).  My mom doesn't believe someone my age and especially in my situation could have mental health issues. She constantly belittles me for having any other feeling other than positivity. I've tried directly asking for help and was turned down. Whatever is wrong is getting worse with time, I can't do much of anything anymore. Should I keep trying to get help?




[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzmmh7/rant/
I've been hit with the words "You're too young to worry about this" and "You're still a child, when I was your age I wouldn't be able to handle it" so many times, it both pisses me off and saddens me at the same time. Does everyone view me as a child? Maybe i'm younger than most, but mentally i'm just as strong as any adult would be. You don't have to refrain from venting to me because your shit might be "too heavy" for me. Telling me that you think i'm too weak to handle something hurts worse than if you had told be what was going on. I'm not young and stupid. I want to fucking help you, so you keeping things to yourself because i'm a "child" hurts like shit. I know you have good intentions when you say this, but can you just stop to think for a moment? If you took a moment to be inside my head, swirling with thoughts of ending myself or leaving everybody, would you still view me as a child? I've been alive for that many years, but i'm a lot more mature than I should be. Cant you see that i'm not that dumb? I can handle whatever you're going through, maybe I've even been through it myself. I just hate it when you refer to me as a child when you know damn well that's basically discrimination. It hurts.

so im in an communications class in my college.... and im reading a little bit, and this really hurts me.... 

The people on here, they tell me i deserve to be alone forever.... they say "were alone all the time!" but im reading this research and its disheartening, ive been alone... for my whole life... i have no freinds, no family, and people LAUGH about it. 

heres some quotes from my book for class, " We all know intuitively that communication—the company of others—is one of the most basic human needs, and that lack of contact is among the cruelest punishments a person can suffer. In fact, workplace studies show that employees would rather get negative attention from bosses and coworkers than receive no attention at all. It hurts to be picked on, but it’s worse to be ostracized. "

they wonder why id pay girls to just talk to me, because im fucking alone.... fuckers. 

They dont know what lonely fucking is man... 

" Besides being emotionally painful, being deprived of companionship is so serious that it can affect life itself. Frederick II, emperor of Germany in the 13th century, may have been the first person to prove the point systematically. A medieval historian described one of his significant, if inhumane, experiments:

*He bade foster mothers and nurses to suckle the children, to bathe and wash them, but in no way to prattle with them, for he wanted to learn whether they would speak the Hebrew language, which was the oldest, or Greek, or Latin, or Arabic, or perhaps the language of their parents, of whom they had been born. But he labored in vain because all the children died. For they could not live without the petting and joyful faces and loving words of their foster mothers."* 

WOW..... loneliness kills, it fucking kills.... and these people cheer and laugh and encourage... me to be alone forever, say i deserve it, for being a virgin, for being awkward... as they giggle and laugh with their friends and have hook up sex with chads! 

 "Fortunately, contemporary researchers have found less barbaric ways to illustrate the importance of communication. In one study of isolation, subjects were paid to remain alone in a locked room. Of the five subjects, one lasted for eight days. Three held out for two days, one commenting, “Never again.” The fifth subject lasted only two hours.

The need for contact and companionship is just as strong outside the laboratory, as individuals who have led solitary lives by choice or necessity have discovered. W. Carl Jackson, an adventurer who sailed across the Atlantic Ocean alone in fifty-one days, summarized the feelings common to most loners:

*I found the loneliness of the second month almost excruciating. I always thought of myself as self-sufficient, but I found life without people had no meaning. I had a definite need for somebody to talk to, someone real, alive, and breathing."* 

haha, 8 days? thats rookie numbers... TRY YOUR WHOLE FUCKING LIFE. AND YOU FUCKING CLAIM, "its cause your bitter!" YEAh YOU MADE ME BITTER. 

YOU MADE ME ALONE.

"ew why is he so weird????" maybe because i never have human fucking contact???? "well thats your fault tee hee, CHAD!!!! over hereeee handsome!!!!!!! Get this subhuman out of my sight, be as painful to him as possible please! thank you!" 

I swear its just funny, most people really dont know what loneliness actually is.

I don’t know if anyone else has experienced this but I feel like when I approach talk therapy/ counseling for my depression I have no clue what to say anymore other than “I’m depressed and it’s not getting better”. I feel like I’m saying it over and over and over again. I feel like they’re trying to pry for a situational factor in my life to explain it or to talk it out and there’s just nothing to talk about that I don’t already understand is situational and temporary. Once the issue has blown over, I’m still depressed, it hasn’t changed anything. Recently, I’ve been told to go back to counseling again after consistently going for about a year and then covid hit so I stopped and I just feel like “I’m depressed” is all I have to say and I just don’t feel like it’s productive anymore to talk a point out that’s been beaten like a dead horse. 
(I am also on medications as I have been for a few years now and I would say I’m in that grey area of not a risk of harm to myself but not necessarily “happy” but stable enough)

(I also understand the redundancy of this post in general, if talk therapy doesn’t do the job, why am I making a post and reaching out to other people. I was just wondering if anyone else is stuck in this weird rut or has been in the past and what might have worked for them)

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzmd10/constant_loneliness/
No matter how many people are around me I feel lonely. I spent entire days talking to people online, the moment I go off I notice how unfullfilling that time was playing meaningless games and having meaningless talks with each other. Whenever I go to bed I notice how incredibly lonely I am, just wishing for someone I can cuddle with, where I can just cry my eyes out and just mindlessly complain about everything that is going wrong. Not worrying about being missinterpreted or judged. And without any regret afterward. But no, every day just passes by where I spend mindless time with people "enjoying myself" but still feeling incredibly empty inside.

Its been like this since my girlfriend left me last year and for more then 400 days now its not getting better. I already have a Psychologist, but aside from having 45min a week were I have at least one place I can actually take my problems to, he cant help much, even though he does his best. Im trying to get to know as much new people as I can to maybe find that one person where it finally clicks. Its not a solution, but I dont want to just sit here and complain about everything but not doing anything about it.

Its 4am for me now. I cant sleep because of intrusive thoughts. Thats why im writing this. Venting can help me to at least find a bit of sleep.

hi again. so my dad told me that my mom is telling him that she feels like she'll die soon and i don't know what to feel as of the moment ever since what happened to me last night with my sister. i shut myself down again and i don't know what i should do as of the moment. i really feel so bad because i can't even feel anything or i can't even cry knowing that my mom will die soon.

My relationship has seemingly vanished, it doesn't feel like anything is there anymore and he has more fun without me around, nor talks to me anymore..

I have no work, which means I have no money. And that issue speaks for itself..

I still can't get into therapy..

My meds don't seem to be working still and I've been on them 3 months now..

I'm sat here on my own 24/7 and I'm barely managing to talk to my friends..

I uploaded my first video onto YouTube, but that's just 3 minutes of me kicking around a ball in Destiny 2 so I might just take it down..

I have no interest in things I once loved; drawing, playing games, playing piano, keeping fit (although that went downhill years ago), going for long walks, cleaning, keeping my mind occupied in general, even music..

I sit in silence more often than not, and I go stir crazy staring at the same 4 walls, and I can't go for a walk because it's too cold out. I can't see my friends either because of Covid..

I'm really starting to see no point at all in living and the pill cabinet is looking very inviting..

Can someone with stable mental health or anyone who has an idea actually tell me what it's like?? Because i can't even imagine it. Lol do u just wake up roam around and just not feel a little off? Just feel heavier? Do you cross the street without thinking what if? Do you just get up and productively do things?
Can you imagine the future? What fills your head besides casual thoughts of suicide?

Long story short, I'm a mess of anxiety and depression. I'll have periods where I do good but they never last long. I've lost so many jobs because I can't work. I've tried. Around people, my anxiety gets so bad I start violently shaking and looking for ways out. My depression is so bad I've been inches away from ending it all so many times. And I'm in an Oxford house with 10 other guys now. I'd love to leave but I have nowhere to go and no money. All I have is a car and basic necessities. I have therapy Tuesday and I'm going to see if they can help me. I just don't know what to do and I feel so miserable.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz7r88/by_my_own_choices_i_ruined_my_life/

I started getting in trouble with the law at a very young age, in fact I was 14 the first time I was arrested for an armed robbery that me and a friend did.  I spent the later of my teenage years in a state home for boys because of it and really the only thing that taught me was that I’m not scared of being locked up as long as I know I’m going home eventually... now that exact thought has ruined my life. 
After I was released from the boys home just a few months before I turned 18, I had every intention of changing my life for the better, the only problem was that I didn’t know how, and it wasn’t long before I was selling weed/dope and even though I was against doing meth, I still sold it like it was going out of style and I was everyone’s drug dealer...I mean everyone loved me, I had money, I had my own place, I had a truck and a motorcycle, I felt like I was on top of the world.... but what goes up, must come down. Before I knew it, I was 18 and in prison. Doing time sucked, but I got through it with the help of my mom and dad, they’ve always been there for me, always came to visit me as much as they could, always sent me money whenever they could and they always picked up the phone when I called. My mom and dad mean everything to me. So I did a 2 years and got out on parole,  I came home to my parents house and i started over again, with every intention of doing the right thing, which I actually managed to do for a few years, i was in school, I had 2 kids with a girl I loved and I could tell that my parents were finally proud of me and finally again, I felt on top of the world.  Then everything changed
November 8th 2016 I came home around 11pm after a night of gaming with a friend, I walked past my parents room and out of the corner of my eye I saw him. My dad was laying on his side with his head on his arm and the moment I looked at him, I knew he was dead. I’ll never forget what he looked like, or the panic that overwhelmed me as I tried to give him cpr even though I knew it was far to late, he was ice cold, his face was slumped to the side and he was stiff.  One thing I wouldn’t wish upon my worst enemy is for them to have to find their father in that way. Gone are the good memories I had with him, gone is me seeing him in any way other then the last way I saw him. Everyday I see his face when I close my eyes and it never gets easier, only slightly more bearable. 
But that day I didn’t just lose my dad, I lost my mom too. My mom fell into a huge depression, she quit her job, she started to drink and eventually that’s all she was doing, waking up and drinking herself back to sleep. I didn’t know what to do, I just wanted to help her but I didn’t know how. She didn’t want help she just wanted to die too. 
I was so fucked up about finding my dad like that, I knew I should talk to someone about it, see a therapist or something but I was so depressed all I wanted to do was bury the feelings with drugs. So I did.  Fast forward 2 years later, I’m addicted to meth, I’m homeless, I don’t see my kids and none of my family talks to me anymore. All I did was sell dope, get high and hit licks..and it wasn’t long before I ruined every relationship and was back in prison. Did another 2 years...
Now I’m 29 years old, With 4 felonies and I have never felt more lost in my life. 
I’ve only been out of prison for 3 weeks and I’m already using again, I know if I go back down this road that it’s only going to lead one way, but I don’t know any other way but this one. I want to do right but I feel like I just don’t know how. I keep getting told no for every job I apply for Because I have no work history and my criminal record is terrible. I’m so tired of being a disappointment and a loser, but I don’t know how to not be this way. I know what everyone says sounds easy to someone who’s looking at my situation from the outside. “Well why don’t you get a job” or “ask someone for help” 
That’s the thing, I have applied for jobs, but I’ve ran my name into the dirt around this small city I live in and everyone knows me as a drug dealer or a thief so no one will give me a chance and with each no I get from a job application is just another reminder of how I’m just a failure. 
I just don’t know what to do anymore and I’m tired of being alone, I’m tired of feeling this way, I just want to be happy.... 
I wish that I could catch a break, but sadly I won’t. 
Thanks for listening to me, I have a lot on my mind and I just needed to tell someone without the embarrassment of sitting in front of someone crying my eyes out while I try to explain to them how I’m feeling.




[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzlvie/depression_from_losing_the_love_of_my_life/
I have no idea how to move on or forgive myself because I hurt the one person in this world I cared about so badly that she doesn’t even want to talk to me anymore. It’s been over a month since she ended things and I can still hear her cries and see her tears and it’s killing me.

The story is, I was engaged to the love of my life but she was very conservative and religious and was saving herself for marriage. I’ve had sex with a number of woman in my 20’s and it wasn’t until after a year of dating that I told her I had sex before and it floored her. We were road tripping to meet her friends and she was completely withdrawn the whole day after I told her. When we drove back, she started asking questions about details and I panicked and thought she would leave me if I told the truth so lied about how long ago all this happened (5 years compared to 1 year before dating). I know this was wrong and selfish but I just panicked. Fast forward to early December, we were engaged for 2 months and the lie always weighed on me so I told her the truth that I wasn’t honest about the timeline and she ended things. I tried to ask her for a second chance or to try couples counseling but she said she just couldn’t do it. Now I just feel like crap because everything outside of this perfect and I just can’t believe I was capable of making this mistake and causing her the most pain of her life. I’m not sure how to move on because I still hear her crying in my mind and I then feel selfish because I just want her so desperately to have tried to save things when she is in her own rights to do what is best for her.

It's been like this for a while, I don't exactly know why. Any emotion really, if I'm bored, happy, upset just a little bit more than numb it feels like I physically cannot handle it and I break down sobbing. It's not even like I am overwhelmingly happy, just slightly more than feeling empty is too much for me.

Am I the only one who feels like this?

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzltdc/quick_vent/
I love coming to this reddit, to vent, to feel accepted and not judged for who I am and for what my thoughts are, just wanted to talk about my day.

I woke up, I played video games, I ended up watching some Netflix, nothing out of the ordinary here and that was basically all my day, I don't talk to nobody, so... I winded down and just wanted to talk about some stuff that's really got to me as of late, I was about a day ago or two back in contact with a friend who I was on bad terms with in the past, we talked again, for a bit, I was the one to try to talk a lot as I really am craving conversations with people I stick with, and keep in mind this person knew very personal things about me as we were very close, after talking and getting into an argument I remember this person specifically telling me things such as "I wish I never met you" "you're just a manipulative lying shit" and the list goes on, I... Was literally speechless I didn't know what to day, because I mean technically they weren't wrong?

We continued arguing and it later led to an obvious block... But it just made me realize how lonely I really am, I can't even talk to an old friend as they will bring me down or I start arguing, or I'm awkward, or they don't wanna take time to talk to me...

Back on track I just... Felt so extremely lonely today again, especially in the evening, I cried a bit too... But that too is nothing out of the ordinary... Anyways, I just wanted to vent, it's nothing too serious I'd say? And if you actually took the time to read this long post, we'll thank you so much for reading, I'm not the greatest at formulating myself so excuse me in advance. Stay safe.

I don't want to live anymore, I have never felt a deeper desire to just blow my brains out then at this very moment and its fucking tempting. What's the point in living another fucking day when its the same pain filled torture day after fucking day.

All I can think about all day is how much I hate myself. I hate how I look, I hate my face, my hair, my eyes, how thin I am, how weak I am, how ugly I am. I hate how I think, I hate how I can't ever fucking smile or be happy, I hate how much of a pathetic shy piece of shit I am who is too nervous and unable to make a friend let alone talk in a fucking conversation. I hate how I good at absolutely fucking nothing, I have never been good at a single thing in my entire life and it makes me feel so worthless that I wanna jump out my window right now. I get angry whenever I see someone who is skilled at something, not an anger towards them but a deep fucking self hatred for what a worthless piece of shit I am. I know that they put in a lot of work and deserve to be good at what they are doing, but I also know that I am incapable of that. I am incapable of doing anything noteworthy or anything that makes me more than a waste of space. I hate how I have no motivation to do anything anymore, no motivation to work out, no motivation to eat, no motivation to do things I used to like doing such as playing video games or watching a show.

I keep this all bottled up inside and I can't take it, I have no a single person in my life who would care if I died. hell it would be better if I was fucking dead because then I wouldn't be wasting fucking food or producing waste, someone less pathetic than me deserves it more. Whenever I see friends I hate myself even more and I ask myself, "Why can't I have a single friend?" or "Why can't there be a single person who wants to be around me?" Then I realize the answerer, why would anyone want to be friends with a boring, anxious, depressed, shy, fucking stupid, uninteresting, horrible piece of shit like me. I have given up on anyone on this planet ever giving a shit if I live or die by tomorrow but that doesn't make it hurt any less to know I will alone and no one will even notice I am gone.

I am sick of hearing the same old "it gets better" line over and over being its a fucking lie. It does not get better, it gets more painful every fucking day as that's another day wasted, another week I will never get back, another month spent 100% alone, and before you know it its been another year of suffering and pain. I am sick of that lie, I am sick of being told to keep on suffering all alone at the fucking chance that tomorrow will be slightly better. I no longer see a point in trying, a point in spending another day in pain.

I doubt anyone will read this, I doubt anyone will even give a shit. I hope this is my last post on this reddit, I hope I get the courage to just off myself before I have the chance to have another mental breakdown and type out stupid shit like this again.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzpdzb/self_neglect_and_destruction/
Does anyone else find it extremely hard to take care of themselves for months on end? I tend to neglect my personal hygiene (brushing my teeth, showering, cleaning, etc) and it’s been this way for months. As I’ve been working and doing school from home it’s become less and less important and it’s really upsetting me how little I care for myself, looking back. But I’m sure the cycle will continue tomorrow and the next day. 
Also, I’ve always had a tendency to ruin good friendships and relationships for no reason. I put so much strain on them and do careless things until that person is no longer in my life. It seems at every new milestone in my life, quitting dance, graduating, etc. I destroy the relationships and it fills me with so much guilt because of the things I do or say. After many years of not talking to my group of friends from high school, I still think about them every day. I still think about an apology that just won’t do justice. It hurts a lot.

because hearing criticism makes all of my effort feel worthless.

because talking to people is too hard.

because I have always been "the wierd kid".

because people that bullied me follow me around in my head and I apply them to anything negative that happens to me.

because I see only success in everyone else when all I have is "wasting time".

because I have done to little with my life for too long.

because I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing.

because every single task I try to put time into, I feel like I'm doing it wrong and everyone else is doing it right.

because I have no one to share with.

because I am overwhelmed by the problems I have to deal with.

because I'm an alien from another planet.

because I'm a nobody.

because everything I've tried to fit in and "learn right" have failed.

I'm an idiot. I shouldn't be alive. I really wish sometimes that my brother was still alive and I killed myself instead. It should have been me, not him.

I'm 19 and have never been in a relationship. Live with my parents, never had a job, don't have a license. I'm not lazy and badly want a job to get out of the house and meet someone but I have insane social anxiety that makes me panic just thinking about it. I just want someone to talk to, someone who loves me the same I do them. It's not a sex thing I couldn't care less about that part of it. I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. I'm not good at anything and I can't afford college. I use to see my future ahead of me and was excited but each year that passes I seem to see my future fade away out of my reach. I could try antidepressants but I'm already overweight with a low self esteem and those won't help. Everything just seems hopeless.

All day at work I expected to come home to all the house work done and a bath ready to go and a smoke. Nope. I come house I have to fold and put away three loads of laundry and do the dishes. You okay your game. I wait Patiently for you to get done. You promised me you’d be done by a certain time because I have to work In the morning instead you keep saying one more game. I pass out wake up and you’re gone. I crawl into bed, you join shortly after. Keep in mind my feet still hurt from work. Nothing you promised got done tonight. I lay there as you play on your phone. I get up and grab my game because I can’t sleep. You left me on bed, instead of cuddling me you left me once again to sleep by myself. Where did you go? The recliner. Numb.  I can’t even cry I’m so used to it.  I want to cry, I want to scream, break something anything rather than just sitting here wondering what I’ve done to deserve this, where I’ve gone wrong, what I can do to make it better. So here I am. Telling you all about my day. I’m open to advice, help me out. What am I doing wrong? How can I be better? am I not good enough? Are you missing her?

and by that, I mean reasons to follow through with it. I’m an extremely passionate drummer and almost 18, meaning I gotta venture into the real world, in this case I’d like to get involved with the music industry. but live music has been on a decline. hardly anyone seems to care enough to see a live band anymore, compared to a rapper or generic pop artist.

music is quite literally by life. it’s what I breathe and live by. I’ve been wanting to be a drummer as my career since I was 10 years old, but now as I learn more about life, I now realize how hard it is to obtain that goal. especially in a time like this. I don’t want to live a life that I don’t want. I can’t find hope anymore, it makes me want to die. I haven’t had suicidal thoughts since 3 years ago so this is a very emotional time for me at the moment. I know this all sounds extremely over-exaggerated given the situation, but I can’t put into words how passionate I am about this all.





[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzle16/youre_pathetic_youre_selfish/
I have diagnosed anxiety and depression and am heavily medicated because of it. I spent my entire life trying to make other people’s lives easier. I do the extra chores, I help without being asked, I drive my siblings places, I help with groceries. But it’s not enough. It’s never enough. The best thing to ever happen in my life was going to university. Living by myself. Taking care of only myself. No one to call me names or not make me feel good enough. I actually started to feel better. I didn’t have any more mental breakdowns, I had started to eat better, exercising daily, and overall just enjoying life. But then I came home. I got yelled at for not doing the dishes one day. It’s not that it’s my job, I have three other siblings. They leave their dishes all stacked in the sink and wait for me to come and clean them. So one day I decide to get my hair done and don’t do the dishes my mom yells at me and says I never help around the house. And I slowly start to slip back into my old ways. My bad though processes, I stop working out every day, I start binge eating. (I would like to claim I’m not unhealthy I am average weight for my height and build) but it all starts to add up then today I go to work for the first time because they are finally letting us back since they were scared of college students possibly bringing in covid. So I work my shift and come home to find out my grandfather is going on hospice. He’s the reason I’m majoring in engineering. The person who I found most interesting and kind. And my mom is upset. As soon as I heard that I knew I wanted to go to the gym. It’s how I relieve stress. It’s the day before my mother’s birthday. Since I had just gotten home no one had told me anything they just assumed I would already know. So I put on my workout clothes and say I’m going to the gym, next thing I know my mom is yelling saying “oh no you’re not. You’re helping cook!” I go downstairs to see my older sister and dad have started unpacking groceries my mom follows me down yelling that I’m inconsiderate. My dad asks me to put something in his car and I explain how the gym is my stress reliever how I used it at university. He says I can go later, I tel him it closes at seven so I wouldn’t be able to. My mom then says while we’re waiting for the meat to thaw and my sisters ran to the store to get flowers that I can go to the gym. That she understands why o want to go. So I go for a half hour then rush home and help cook the majority of dinner. Then I get mad at my little brother and tell him not to get in my dog’s face because it makes him anxious then my mom yells at me for telling my brother what to do... and it goes on and on. Me doing the dishes and asking for help etc. then it’s time for cake. We sing happy birthday and my dad doesn’t know where the cake cutter is so of course I’m the only one to get up and get it. I come back and my older sister is in my seat. I ask twice if she could move. Word for word, “can you please move. Come on, you know I was sitting there.” She says it’s not her fault and I shouldn’t have gotten up. So instead of getting mad and yelling, I tickle her side. Forgetting that she’s sensitive and hates when people touch her sides (mind you I’ve never touched her side before or tazed her or whatever you want to call it, I was annoyed and had asked nicely for her to move) I had barely touched her side and she falls to the ground crying like I had stabbed her or something. My mom starts yelling and I automatically go on the defensive and my dad jumps in to defend me. I think it’s done and my mom snaps, “don’t you ever do that again.” I look at her and she’s just cutting cake and slamming it onto plates and I’m just done I push back from the table and leave saying I didn’t mean to hurt and I had apologized. She then goes on to scream that I am pathetic and a selfish bitch and thank god I’m finally leaving them alone. I go to my room, bury myself in blankets. First my dad says to come and join them. I say no thank you and I don’t want to be persecuted anymore. He knows how when ever something goes south I’m the one my mother decides to take it out on. Then my older sister apologizes. And asks me to come, “her father is dying.” Yes he is and it’s awful and sad but that makes it ok to call me pathetic? And then my little sister comes in and keeps ranting that I’m a selfish person. That first I go to the gym and then I refuse to go down and watch a movie with them. My mom told me to go upstairs. That she didn’t want to see me. Why on earth would I go downstairs? My grandfather is dying, I’m a bad person for going to the gym, I’m a pathetic excuse for a daughter, and tonight is the first night that I’ve contemplated suicide in over a year. And I’m now getting one of my migraines that causes me to go blind. So wonderful. Anyone who could tell me that I’m not a pathetic waste of skin would be much appreciated.

Hi, I’m a 20 year old female. I make good money and i live with my boyfriend who has been my boyfriend for about a year now. I don’t know why I get so sad some times. It’s unbearable so cry everyday I really don’t know why. I feel like i have no one to talk to and no one who will truly listen to me. I have been debating picking up everything and moving out of state by myself because where i am now isn’t really where i want to be. Do you think that will fix anything? I am so tired of crying everyday and feeling like a burden to everyone around me.

Hi, first a little back story. I have depression and OCD, I had recovered perfectly but two months ago (just when I stopped taking my antidepressants) I relapsed and I kept it to myself and I though it was the best option but now I see that it wasn’t.
I had a girlfriend, she is the most perfect woman on the universe. But she just broke up with me because she doesn’t feel the same for me and I asked her when did she start feeling this way and she said that like one month and a bit more ago (I never told her about how I was feeling, now I know that was dumb). I feel like we could get back together there because she was in love with me not sick me and I don’t want to drag her to my stuff so I told her that I was going to try and get better and after I feel normal that we could try it again. I don’t know if she agreed to the idea just to make me feel better but I am going to do my best to win her back. 
Now, I need your advice on how to win her back. I know it sounds toxic but I feel like our relationship wasn’t toxic at all because we never stopped being ourselves or tried to change the other person and we can live being far from each other for a long time. But she is the person that I love the most and that is why I want to try again, but if it fails at least I would know that we don’t work and that it wasn’t just the sicknesses fault.

Sorry for all the text and my bad english.

Hi everyone,

I’m writing this as I’ve never really had a week like this, and I don’t know what to do. I’ve had two members of my family come down with serious but non-life threatening health issues at the same time as some work stressors and it’s basically taken a sledgehammer to my mental health. I don’t know that I’ve ever been depressed before, but I am fairly certain I am well on my way this time. I’m worrying non stop, can barely eat, always tired, zero interest in my hobbies, etc.

I’ve met with a therapist to help with my sadness and the triggers, as well as my doctor who prescribed sertraline. I have hope these will help, but the drugs are at least 4 weeks from aiding, and therapy feels like a long term effort to me. In the mean time, how do you cope and function? Life keeps going, and I have work and family commitments that need upholding, but I can barely manage the focus and care to do something as small as shave. The idea of an 8 hour shift tomorrow is crushing me. I took this last week off, but don’t think I can push more. 

I’m feeling very gloomy, and don’t know how to handle things in the short term while waiting for the benefits of the therapy and drugs to kick in. Does anyone have any advice? Any medication that helps quicker that I could look towards? I have a great family support system so I’m very thankful for that at the least.

Thank you in advance.

So I get super happy when I’m exercising.  Life becomes all that it should be and I’m confident and all that shit.

But that’s late in the evening and by the time I shower and get into bed, I’m suicidal again and just waiting until it’s time to exercise again.

I wish it was all over.  Ugh. 6 more hours until I can get on my bike again.


[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzdbda/she_wants_to_stop_taking_therapy_after_2_sessions/
This is continuing from my previous story,  and TL;DR, my GF is suicidal and I forced her to live, and told her family to take her to therapy. I'm glad she was able to get therapy and we were able to get back together and she's been doing great and all and was diagnosed with Major Depression. She was already told that she'd be taking meds but they won't be permanent. However, she wants to stop after her second session. She's starting to feel like she's being more of a burden. Her family is not the best. They think it's all in her head or that it's just a phase or part of being a teenager, when in fact, it's not. and this has been going on for years for her and she couldn't get out of it because of her parents.

&#x200B;

The dad went on about she doesn't need therapy, it'll just tell her to get meds and make her dependent on it. Her mom directly asked her if something's wrong with her head, and she should do it online because of COVID which is understandable but, the root of her problems is in that house and it will only stress her further.

&#x200B;

She wants to live and she wants help, but her parents are making her feel like she should stop and it's useless and she's risking her family's health out of worry and money. How do I convince her to keep going and to hold on?

Im 17 5'6 and im abt 125 lbs. nit bad, im average but yk i have looked better i know im not fat by any standards but i feel it when i look in the mirror. i dont have a bulge, accept for my uterus poking out and i dont have stretch marks anywhere than my thighs and my chest. Im constantly being told over and over again that my body is perfect. BUT I DONT FEEL IT I HATE MYSELF, and when someone comes around and calls me skinny fat; when i see other people with the same body type-- that are called skinny fat, I lose my mind and rage, sobbing and angry. Shut it if you use that term. it really is hurtful and you dont know what ppl are goung through. you shouldnt make ppl walk around on egg shells fearing, brace yourself someone is going to say something hurtful. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THAT (now im realizing this is tying in with my other personal problems so i will end my point here with a final concluding statement.) Please, everyone be kind to others, please make an effort im begging you, be yourself yes,and if you're snarky and kinda rude thats fine! but acknowledge what you're doing and try please im begging you :)

Every day, all day. 

Either I’m sad and I fake happiness or I feel uncontrollable anger, and of course at that point I’m being more real than I could any other way. 

Ah, that artificial, yet genuine sounding, laugh. My smile with the two dimples on the sides that complete it perfectly to convey a flawless expression of utter joy. 

When I convince my best and closest of friends, my family, and other people who really have no place in my life that I’m *”doing fine.”*

I hate it.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzkv3q/i_dont_dream/
I used to dream. I used to want to do things with my life and honestly thought I could do anything with my life. Almost as if I could have anything I wanted if I just reached out and grabbed it. 

Then I got older and learned how much I truly hated existing in a world where I couldn’t just reach out and grab what I wanted to achieve. And no, I couldn’t just work for it either. I wasn’t allowed it. Every time I tried to achieve what I wanted to do with my life I failed miserably. Over and over and over. I grew to hate myself for not having the success I should be having. All this work for nothing. I wanted nothing more than to succeed. That doesn’t matter anymore. Cause when I did succeed, it didn’t make me happy. It made me upset because it wasn’t worth it.

My dreams fell out of my heart. I forgot what it’s like to dream about the things I could do because I knew I can’t do anything I wanted. I was limited to my environment, body, and mind. I  never wanted to be held back. I hate myself for holding myself back. I don’t know what I want anymore. 

All I know is I just want to stop living. I know it sounds cliche and overused, but I just don’t want to suffer. I don’t want to live in this place. It isn’t happy nor fair. It’s a dreadful, awful, no good place. I don’t want any part of it. Even if i tried to fix it, it wouldn’t matter. No one will remember my cries. And the dreadfulness would start anew.

I hope I die swiftly and sooner, rather than later.

Hi!

I just wanted to ask if anybody had some recommendations for a book(s) which I could read to help my case? 

I'm 22M and have been somewhat depressed for about 1.5 years now. I've not yet accumulated any kind of thoughts to harm myself but would like to avoid that. I've lost joy in things that made me happy and have not found anything for replacement. I feel void. I need some kind of a mental restart. I want to feel hungry again. 

I think that I'm looking for some kind of new philosophy. Before I practiced stoicism and it somewhat mixed well with my hardworking personality. Now I'm not even happy when things turn out well. This state of mind is really harming my everyday life and I would love to find a way around it.

Thank you in advance & keep on fighting!

First appointment coming up with a new psychologist. Trying to figure out what foot to start out on.

Hi, doc. I've always been depressed, but I never really cared and it doesnt really bother me. Life has no meaning and I've come to grips with that, but to me life has no value, I would be objectively better off dead and have worked out a game theory assessment to back me up. I deeply regret not killing myself when I was 10, but it is too late to revisit that decision now, but I can't because of how it would affect others, and I have never cared about myself, it has always been about others 

But now I am in so much emotional pain that all I want is to go back to being despondent.

I sound completely nuts



[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz47c2/ive_never_experienced_thoughts_like_these_before/
Lately I think I have hit rock bottom. I have been severely depressed for a long time and been moderately suicidal, but recently it has gotten much much worse. I think about suicide every single day, and the thoughts are so fucking often. It’s so distracting as well, it like pierces through anything else im trying to do or think about. It is extremely overwhelming.

Ive also done something recently that I never even really thought of before, and that was make a full plan for my suicide, which would be by hanging. Somehow knowing this makes it so much more real, Ive also gotten into this mindset that there is no way out and I will be in constant hell forever, it feels so fucking inescapable and I know it will just get worse and worse. I feel so fucking sad and angry all the time, it is just exhausting. I feel so sensitive to everything now, and there is no one to talk to. Ive just never gotten this close to killing myself before, it scares me a little bit. I don’t really know what to do, I’m trying so hard to keep my head above water, but it is getting increasingly hard every day. I haven’t showered in months, all I do is just sit inside all day and do drugs and jerk off. I am a literal recluse, I feel so isolated and alone, like I have nothing left. I don’t know how much longer I can put up with this.


Even if no one responds, I’m glad I could get my feelings out somewhere, so thanks for reading.

Hey all, lately my issues with depression have been getting pretty bad. I've had to move back home into a semi-toxic environment from a town I enjoyed living in, I'm 26 and never had a job or significant other/relationship. the lack of a job due to issues I've had with anxiety and an intense fear of failure. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life outside of vague ideas that seem impossible to achieve and I'm doing a uni course that I have no idea whether I actually want to continue. I'm currently trying to find a place to move into so I can have my own space again but I don't like my chances. I know that this year is the year that I'll have to try to find some sort of job but outside of fast-food, there's not much available here.

All that combined is making my head a rather not so fun place to be at the moment. My grandparents who I'm currently living with aren't really helpful when it comes to mental health, my pops just naive and think it's as easy as 'just think positive' and 'just bite the bullet'.  My nan on the other hand has told me in the past that have nothing to be depressed about and that other people have it worse. couple this with her pressuring me about the house and job situation while occasionally reminding me that my friends and others my age have jobs/careers and relationships, it just isn't helping my current headspace and is just fueling the depression by reminding me how much of a failed mess I am.

I know that I need to do these things but my motivation for anything major has been virtually non-existent for a long time, which just gets to me even more. I can't tell my grandparents this because they'll just think I'm making excuses for being lazy. I can't even really honestly remember the last time I felt proper joy and the moment I do feel a modicum of happiness my depressed mind just comes in and drags me back down. 

All this is why in the darkest moments my depression tells me to end it. because I'm a broken failed mess of a human that should just give up because it just's easier and better for everyone around me. thankfully I have yet to get close to going through with it but it does get awfully tempting sometimes. probably the only thing keeping me anchored to the world is my cat since I don't want to abandon her and I'm worried about what will happen to her if I'm gone. she's been the best lifeline I've had these last few years but even then I'm worried that she even won't be enough to keep going at this rate.

Anyway, my apologies if this came across as a jumbled incomprehensible mess of a post, I'm currently going through a pretty intense wave and just wanted to vent and get something out there.

Cheers guys.

i graduated two months after covid hit. i joined the work force a week before the mask mandate was introduced, and suddenly i had all this time on my hands. so i worked and i kept up with friends and things were up and down like always, until one day i just started feeling nothing. 


and now everyday is the same, it all goes by simultaneously too fast and too slow.  i sleep as much as i can. i stress about how much i dont want this boring life, but i’m too tired to fix it. 


i’m tired of being so tired.

This is a rant, so take it as you’d like. I just wanted to vent and if stuff doesn’t make sense, I’m sorry, but it just how I feel atm.

I have done many things over the past few years. I moved to another country to study, I exercise, I try and talk to people with confidence, I try to stay engaged and fresh with current events, I try to be educated and all of that stuff, I’m working on being more disciplined, I’m becoming healthier, and many people would think that I am in a path of self improvement, but I think I’m not, and in fact, I think I feel even worse than I felt before, because I do all of these things out of fear.

I moved to another country because, way way back, I said I would, and if I didn’t make it, well shit, I would be a failure and I’d be criticized. I exercise because I’m insecure about myself and if I look normal, I don’t feel good about what I accomplished. I just feel like I’m “enough” or “what I’m supposed to be”, and if I don’t look like people expect, I fear I will be criticized and laughed at. I try to talk to people, because, at least for my family, it is “great to have as many contacts and connections with people as possible and you should be able to talk with people and have as many friends as possible”, and if I don’t do that, I’ll be seen as a failure. I always stay up to date about everything because of fear of missing out and feeling like I can’t talk to others about what is happening at the moment.

And I hate this. And I hate to engage with society because of how tiring and boring it is. It is very difficult to find people with whom I don’t have to maintain appearances or fake smiles, or people that are really interested in whatever I have to say. I hate doing all of that and lowkey I don’t give a fuck about any of those things or about myself or how I am. Hell if I did whatever I actually wanted to do, I’d go live in a cabin in the woods or go live on a desert island or maybe just go die in a hole somewhere and call it a day. But I can’t do it because I have to take care of people in my family. Other than that, I feel like I have no real purpose or direction in life and I do whatever I do following plans I came up with earlier in life, when I actually found stuff to be cool and inspiring. That’s why my plans for life end just after I finish university, which is closing in fast. After that, I don’t know what I’ll do.

I'm extremely talented at drawing, but most of the time I can't put in the effort to draw to that ability I know I have. I want to really use that ability, but it just "wont" and I end up drawing like a toddler because...well my brain just wont kick into to gear to do it, but I REALLY want to. This has been a problem for years, it eventually came to a point where I couldn't draw anymore unless I wanted it to come out like a toddler drew it. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD, I know that talent is still in there in me, but these conditions just sap the ability to use it because there's no enjoyment, no motivation, "no point", etc. I occasionally ahve moments, maybe a few minutes at most where it eases up and I'm not hindered but it's very rare. I'm getting treatment, I really hope things will get better and I can be me again.

There is no reason to live, it is just too hard to kill yourself so what can you do?

Fuck this shit. I hate all of these jobs, they're fucking stressful, kill me inside and make me miserable. No wonder depression rates are so high because of these shitty fucking jobs that take so much time out of our lives.

I wake up and I have all these things I want to do, but over time, I just start to lose more and more hope, I feel like my friends hate me. I just feel like I will exist in this struggle and pattern for years. I don't want to live like this for years. I cant put up with a battle every day.

back here again, is it surprising?  
your role in life is akin to a train conductor, i think. you can speed up or slow down if you wish. you got people around you to help move things along. you got changes of scenery, from the dull greys and smokestacks of the terminal to the lush, bright, sprawling plains that you could just breathe in were it a gas.  
and much like a train conductor, you can't stop. you're cruising toward judgement day, so you say "take a load off". but then you get sick of all the green stretching to the horizon because it reminds you that you're stuck in a lifeless grey husk of a train. can't ride into the sunset and take life into your own hands because you're on tracks. and fuck me if the bartenders and waitresses can help you do something they aren't trained for in the slightest. plus, it isn't your job to rely on people.

that's life's cruellest trick, right? you haven't got a way out of it all. death is death so fight that with all your might, but you're so stuck in your ways that death is a preferable alternative to life. me personally, i wanna tear this train off the tracks and go full steam ahead into the hills but this pathetic lump of meat i'm saddled with means that just ain't an option. it empties when i need to write like my life depends on it, it torments me with images of people appearing before me that my brain is highly convinced is real, like i'm the last bit of sanity along for the ride in this schizophrenic nightmare death train. 

how's your lumps of meat doing you? you all stuck on the train tracks of life and chugging along just like me, or have you managed to abandon ship and take a hike into god knows where? if you have then hell, best of wishes, you've done what hundreds of people probably never could've. you'll get to your destination eventually though, so just enjoy the journey. ;)

Last year i started going to therapy, this was a very big step for me. I posted a lot on this subreddit about having doubts about going to therapy and i felt like it wasnt going to help me at all and that i would have to live my life feeling miserable, empty and lonely. I felt so guilty for feeling this way and i felt like the world would just be better off without me. 

This changed little by little over last year. Me and my therapist talked about my past, my living situation, my trauma, the unhealthy way i cope with situations. We talked about how my coping mechanism was needed for me to survive when i was at my lowest, but now, when i am trying to get better it was only standing in the way. 

There was a healthy person inside of me but my situation and my past was crippling this person. I learned that i am not my depression. I am still not a 100% ''healthy'' and i cant be because of my living situation but i am working on it.

i believe i can become better now. And i hope all of you can too.

Why is life so shitty?

Like... Even when I'm having a "good" day I end up being way too aware of the reality that this is it. There is nothing more than working and then dying. There is no big impact that I'll leave behind. There is no way to not die. There is no point to anything..

This is it.

We exist and then we die.

And what the fuck am I supposed to do in the meantime? I don't know how to be alone. I don't know how to settle shit from the past. I don't know how to be independently happy. I don't know how to push myself. I don't know how to be productive and successful. I don't know how to date. I don't know what a healthy relationship looks like. I don't know how to talk to anyone without questioning what exactly I'm saying as I'm saying it...

I'm so tired of not knowing.

I don't know who I am. I don't know if I'm good enough. I don't know what I should be doing.

I want there to be something.. but I'm so stuck on there being nothing.

Everytime I'm on my own I'm seconds from tears.. crying doesn't seem to help.. talking doesn't seem to help. No one ever actually sticks around... My closest friends live far away... And it's not like their available 24/7 to quell my consistent anxiety.

How are there people that are just happy? It seems unfair that some of us are plagued with the knowledge of our own nothingness yet others get to live a blissful existence.

I don’t have anyone else to talk to I I figured I’d write on here. I want to die every single day. Well I do but at the same time I don’t. I recently just lost the one man I ever truly loved because of my mental health and insecurities. I also feel like he never really cared for me anyways and on top of that I was pregnant and no longer am so I feel like I’ve lost everything I truly cared about. I’ve been crying for days and I can’t get it together. I think about killing my self everyday but I’m too weak to actually do it. At the same time I just wish he would pull me out of it but I know he isn’t. I feel like my life has no purpose and that I’ll never feel better again and that I’ll never be able to really get over him and get over losing my baby. I hate life and I don’t know how to pull myself up out of this hole I’m in anymore.

I have very little energy for the day by default, but I found that talking with someone quickly drains me and depletes whatever energy i do have. After just a little while i feel like I can barely talk anymore, i feel literally like I'm losing air and then i basically have to force myself to speak. Oh well.

My husband and I have been separated for about a month. The separation was civil and nothing nasty or shady happened. 

My husband has been going through a really bad depression for about 2 years now and when I saw him last week he seems to be doing worst. He is now even taking unprescribed adderall to help him get through the days. 

He has recently made a lot of remarks about suicide about how hes been thinking a lot about it and him being scared, but has assured me he wouldn't go through with it but idk. I cant help him anymore so I don't know if I should mention to his parents what hes going through to see if they can help him. I have a good relationship with his parents and I'm positive that if they knew they would do everything to help him.

Should I talk to his parents about it or should I keep it quiet?

Why can’t I get hard? I don’t understand why depression affects libido so much. I literally lay in bed and nothing will turn me on. I don’t get an erection. Only thing that gets me going is my girlfriend but I need a lot of foreplay and everything to achieve an erection that isn’t even that firm. I don’t know what to do. I already got checked and have no physical issues. Did someone else experience this? How did you overcome it? I have no desire in sex 95% of the time and it’s making me even more depressed.

I'm a 20(F) y/o junior in college about to enter my second semester and I feel like I haven't experienced the joy of college that many talk about. I transferred to my current college last year and found that I've barely made any friends. I have one of my best friends from home who goes to the same school as me but I want to expand myself. I'm in so many clubs, I even hold board positions in some of them. I feel like I'm doing everything that people tell you to do to make friends yet I feel like I barely have any. I'm currently struggling to find a place to live for my senior year and I desperately want a good roommate. I've had really bad roommates in the past because of random selection. I actually live in a single dorm right now because my roommate from last semester was horrible. I seriously dont want to live alone next year. I feel so lonely in college and everyone has friends around me or people to live with. what did i do wrong? how did i mess up college? i dont know what to do anymore...

Hello all. I'm afraid I have no where else to turn as I don't have many friends and most of my family doesn't speak to me. I made a Facebook status that read "I am not a babysitter. This has been a PSA." Most of everyone I know knows that I don't care much for children. Yesterday and today, my niece and nephew have stayed with my mom and I. My mom left my nephew (12) to watch my niece (11 months) until my sister came for them. I was not told this. Hence my status. 
Well, my mom has since said that she has had it with me and is threatening to move out, leaving me with nothing as I do not have the money to pay rent. (Unemployed, looking for work.) She said that no one asked me to do anything and they wouldn't anyway because I hate them all. I don't. I have social anxiety and depression, so I tend to keep to myself even around family. Apparently that means I hate everyone. This isn't the first time she has done this. One time she went as far as to put my stuff in trash bags and sat them outside while I was away at college. Anytime she gets angry, she lashes at me.
Anyway, I'm not okay. I feel so alone and isolated and don't know what to do. The cycle keeps repeating itself. I just want out, but have no where to go. 
Thank you to anyone who reads this. I hope you're doing better than I am.

I am 38 year old male. Been depressed for a long time, only figured that out and started trying to treat myself over the last five years. Was very desperate and had a lot of suicidal ideation when I started taking medication (buproprion) regularly about a year ago. I no longer have serious ideation or thoughts of suicide. That's a win. However I don't seem to feel or want to do anything ever all the time.
Over the years I lost interest in all my hobbies. I look at things that used to excite me or at least command interest, now I can't be bothered to pick them up. There is a thick layer of dust on my kettlebells. Everything makes me angry. Everything feels a 100 ton burden. I go months at a time without cleaning. I no longer have the discipline to do anything physical and my body is starting to hurt most of the time, so I smoke/eat a fuckton of dope and it did help at first but I've abused it - because of course I did- so I spend most of my waking hours hating myself and seeking distraction, waiting for the day to end. 

I'm stuck. I don't know what to do because I have zero confidence I will be able to execute any plan no matter how modest. Any suggestions? 

Thanks for reading.

 I'm 22, I suffered of anorexia from the age of 18 to 20-21. Because of that, i didn't enjoy my college years and i didn't do the studies i wanted (medecine), my mental health was way too brittle to handle the pressure of these studies.

So i'm now doing my last year of studies (after 5 years), that i don't like at all, i'm feeling useless and i feel like I screwed up my entire life to come because i won't be able to do the work I want. I also want to do another master degree which i'll have more interest for, but i think that i'll be disappoint anyway

i'm afraid of death and i can't stop thinking about this last week, like I'm going to die having done nothing with my life. The covid situation does not help, i can't travel, i can't see my friends etc. The only person I see other than my parents and my boyfriend

I feel useless and I find that life is meaningless. We are all going to die one day and I feel like I'm wasting my time doing anything since the end is the same: death

I don't know what to do to recover my naivety without spending my days thinking about death, i don't know why it came suddenly in my mind like that but i'm not enjoying my time this past week

(sorry if my post is not appropriate in this category, i dont think i am depressed but i dont know where to post this)

I'm sorry in advance for what's probably going to be a long post like a lot of other people, but...well let me just tell you. It's also my first ever big post I've made probably anywhere on the internet so please bear with me lol.

So I lost my job as a childcare teacher in March due to the pandemic, but the center re-opened again in mid June but unfortunately corporate was forced to make layoffs due to our low numbers of children so I was let go at the end of July after barely even working decent hours during that time.

The dreaded job search started again and it was not fun at all, after filling out numerous applications for different places I would get calls/emails back with employers wanting to set up interviews, but when it would come time for me to have the interview I would get ghosted either by them not going through with the interview or having the interview and then not receiving a call back informing me on whether or not I received the job. So that was a huge disappointment and my self-esteem took a huge hit.

December 20th is extremely hard for me because I lost my older sister in a terrible car accident and this year marked 5 years that she has been gone. And I have been struggling to accept the fact that she is really gone because for some ungodly reason it has taken her ex husband 5 years to get her a headstone so I never really had that closure. But thanks to my youngest sister taking over the responsibility she finally has a headstone. Thanks to my boyfriend I was able to go to the cemetery and see the headstone and get the closure that I needed to reassure me that even though my sister is gone she is finally at peace.

January is also extremely tough because the 16th is my late sister's birthday and I miss not having her here to celebrate. But I was able to purchase a tiny cake from the store and video chatted with my older sister and we sang happy birthday and will continue to keep our sister's memory alive, especially for her children my beautiful niece and nephew.

My boyfriend's dad unfortunately was diagnosed with stage 3 esophageal as well as early thyroid cancer, and I'm deeply saddened by it because I happen to have a significantly better relationship with him than with my own dad (but I'm trying to work on fixing my relationship with my dad). Thankfully he is improving and will one day soon be CANCER FREE we can only hope.

Then covid hit my family my mom got diagnosed with it and has been isolated and depressed at home whereas I've been living with my boyfriend for about a year now. Thankfully her symptoms are not as severe as my dad's which I'm going to mention below. I try to talk to her a few times a day whether it be voice or facetime, so I can get an update on what the doctors are saying about my dad and just so we can hopefully make each other feel better or one of us just end up crying a lot. I also try to drop things off for her if she's in need of things.

My dad has been in the ICU going on 15 days now due to COVID. He had a pacemaker put in a few years ago after having several heart surgeries, ablations (when they burn heart tissue to control the rhythm)and zapping of his heart. It doesn't help the situation that he is 70 years old so both his age and having an underlying health condition has greatly increased his chances of dying with COVID. They also found a blood clot on his kidneys, and then on top of that he also managed to pick up pneumonia which was caused in part by fluid build up around his lungs. 

He has been on a ventilator nearly the entire time he has been in the hospital. They performed a tracheotomy to allow them to remove the intubation because the longer they do it that way the higher his risk of infection will be. To top it off, they also had to install a feeding tube. 

He is slowly improving his kidneys and other organs are functioning properly which is a good sign, his heart is surprisingly under control through all of this although he did have a little irregular heart rhythm which they were able to fix with medication.

But then again it's gotten worse in one way as he is no longer in the medically induced coma but is still really out of it, and is in a semi-conscious state. I was able to have a one way video chat with him the other night and I don't know if this was a coincidence or not but earlier that day I was told that he can't move his arms and legs but when he heard my voice he started moving them slightly which hopefully meant he was at least aware of my voice. 

Unfortunately being in this semi-conscious state he's slightly aware of the trache and we're told that he is starting to become agitated and has been trying to remove it so much that the nurses were forced to put him in restraints, but for some reason are taking forever to give him some sort of medication to calm him down and keep him comfortable. 

Before and during all of this I finally found a job after my long search and started right in the middle of the worst of all this. I was given an amazing recruiter who after telling him what was happening at home he was trying to help get my start date pushed back 2 weeks, but it was shut down by a third party HR rep who is not known for her generosity as I later found out.  

What is even worse is that when I started everyone was actually under the impression that I would have been starting two weeks later, so they had to figure out what was going on and that officially became my first day. 

After receiving a call from my mom with an update on my dad earlier this week (which I was able to answer thanks to my boss who has been very understanding) one of the guys from HR had noticed that I was crying. He asked if I was okay and I tried to downplay it, but he could tell something was off so I explained to him what I had going on at home and he generously allowed me to go home and take some time to handle all of this. As a bonus they also paid me for those two days, which normally wouldn't happen because I'm a temp there. 

I'm incredibly thankful but I am still worried about how I am going to perform when I return to work because I am still in my training process and I was messing up a good bit due to how distracting my problems have been. 

It's even more difficult for me because of lapsed bipolar meds due to being unemployed and unable to afford my appointments. I'm back on them now thank god but it still has to build back up in my system and I've been an absolute mess crying god knows how many times. Sometimes instead being an extremely angry nightmare for my boyfriend who has been the victim of my lashing out which I never mean and I feel absolutely terrible for doing it to him.  

He has been extremely patient with me and trying to suggest things to help me relax and I often never want to do anything lately or have the energy. And when we try to play a video game or something I end up getting so frustrated that I will either quit or find some reason to start a fight with him making me feel terrible. He does understand me though as he has been suffering from depression himself for years. 

So in the end things are technically better then they were like a week ago, but the combined weight of everything makes it feel almost like it's actually getting worse despite the improvements. 

That was probably a lot to take in, but I just needed to get it off my chest and writing it has definitely helped. I'm also not very good at writing so my boyfriend helped proofread for me and fix most of the mistakes I made. Thank you so much if you read this.

I feel helpless, It’s like this thing Addiction I have to this I controlling me. I was self harm free for a year until today and I just feel awful about it, I feel so guilty. I just want to be able to make it though a day without crying because my mind wants me to hurt myself. Having depression is the worst thing in the world, I just want to feel good about myself and not self harm.

I started to feel better now , but my feelings are very fragile now , one little bad word and my depression starts over again.I still think about suicide sometimes , but not that much.One of my teacher saw that something is wrong with me , but she didn’t asked me that much, she just aksed that am i okay.I answered what i usually answer to these kind of questions, “Yeah , im ok”.
Its hard hiding something like this.

And I don't even have any excuses. I'm not particularly anxious about the pandemic, my family doesn't bother me, I don't have that much work... 

I just don't have any motivation to be alive. I'm dumb and my attention span is too short, so my grades are falling, so I lose motivation, so I don't study, so my grades fall, so I lose motivation.... I'm too stupid for this shit, and I have several important exams pretty soon. I just wish I could crawl into a hole and die. School is just constant reminder of how stupid I am.

Been contemplating suicide for a year and I'm not stopping. Everytime I go to school I have to take train, and it's struggle to stop myself from jumping on the rails. Feel like it's going to happen soon if I keep it like that. The only reason I'm still alive is because my family seems to care a little about me. I don't have anyone else other than them but I don't even talk to them that much, I'm just being here. So I guess it wouldn't change a lot of things if I was gone

My severe insecurities, body dysmorphia, social anxiety, unproductivity, and so on. It feels I've always had severe depression since I was 13 and those problems I mentioned are some of the causes that continues being perpetuated as I have gotten more depressed. But deep inside me I am self-aware that I can probably really help myself a little bit if I take the first steps. Then it hits me as I sit here all alone in a pandemic for 10 months that I truly have no support system. No friends, relationships ever and a family thousands of kilometres away. Completely alone. I know people who are depressed, but many of them do have a support system. I know a person who has been more public about their depression and they have gotten so much love and support. I'm not putting them down, I applaud them for being so brave. But I don't have anyone and I know even if I am more public about it, I'll only receive indifference or at worst further isolation. It honestly hurts and I have always thought that I have some sort of 'repulsive' aura that makes people naturally distance themselves from me. Now I know that a lot of depressed people are surrounded by people but still are severely depressed and they don't help all the time. But the point is I wouldn't know since I have never experienced such a thing, no 'you can do this' or 'we're here for you' ever. It's things like this that makes me feel utterly ashamed of admitting to anyone I am depressed or seek therapy. It makes me think, even if I do get better, then what? There's no point and noone waiting for me. Anyway, that's the short gist of it from a narrow angle. It's 6 AM here and just felt I needed to get something out.

Venting

6 months ago I tried to kill myself but I wasn't able to go through with it.

Since then I'm even more disappointed of myself.
I had my chance and I wasted it and I should have done it


Just needed to say it somewhere.
I don't really have people close to me I can talk to about it and keeping it in makes me feel even worse so I decided to vent here

Hey so I don’t have a lot of friends. There’s only 2 people that I text: my boyfriend and my friend who we’ll call Luke. I met Luke a while ago before I met my boyfriend. We met on a dating app and hung out but there was never a spark but we became close friends. He got a girlfriend recently and he said that we have to stop being friends. I’m really heartbroken. He threw our entire friendship away for a girl he barely knows. He was always really fun to talk to and we would send each other memes throughout the day that we thought the other would like. Now besides my bf, I have no one to talk to.

I’m really sad about this. My depression has been getting worse and I’ve been dealing with some drama with my family as well as some health issues. This feels like another blow to a year that has been awful so far. I feel so alone, I know I have my boyfriend but I have no other friends to talk to. I feel horrible.

Since years I am plagued with depressions, but lately it just got to the point, where I can't find  any energy to deal with it anymore. Not just that corona keeps me isolated, but also my friends and family drain my energy a lot. I feel that they do not understand on how my depression works and that I am not able to be as supportive as I used to be. I still try all I can to be a support for all of them, but I dont have any energy to keep going. But that fact alone makes me even more depressed. The only thing that can still give me some joy is helping the people I care for. I might be kinda obsessive about it, but that's literally the sole thing I still care for. But by me "not functioning" as supposed the last thing I enjoy will be gone soon. I hate myself a lot for that, while still knowing it is not really my fault. I just really get anxious about that whole thing, cause I fear, that when I "missfunction" for too long my friendships might crumble at some point and my last support I have will vanish.

It gets increasingly harder for me to open up infront of friends or even be around more than two people for too long. I avoid even my flatmates for months now, just cause I severly get stressed out even when meeting too many of them in the kitchen. I know in a way that my actions increase my distance to friends and family and also my loneliness, but I just can't deal with those simple situations anymore. All that fear of people is probably just a result of me getting disappointed and hurt for years, but it got even worse last year. The person I put all my trust in let me hang in a way. Since then my trust issues just increased and my mental health drastically declined. Ironically I feel extremly lonely, despite having problems with beeing around people. Basically the only reason why I post here. Just want to feel less lonely.

I am in a state of loosing the control over my life and the depression and I feel like I just can watch it happen. I do not sleep, I eat way to less and elsewise I am just wasting my time by doing nothing. Allthough realising all of that, I still dont care enough to change. Same goes for my drug abuse, which probably slowly fries my brain. I don't do any work and it's piling up, which makes me feel even more guilty. But how shall I be able to withstand? How can one change, who has no energy to do so?

I am not suicidal, but I sense, that I am moving in that direction just cause I lack energy to continue and don't know how to get out of it as well. I basically can't defend against it anymore. Anything I can do to avoid drifting further in that direction?

Thanks for every reply :)

I’m not depressed, I’m not happy, I’m not sad, or excited, or anxious, or numb, or really anything. I just can’t identify my emotions at all. Does anybody else experience this? Is there a term for it?

I’ve finally accepted that I’ve been seriously depressed for two years and finally made a doctors appointment after avoiding it and cancelling it for months. I’m 23, in grad school, and feel no excitement or hope for the future. I only feel a plateau of nothingness/numbness and then sadness. I don’t remember the last time I’ve been happy. I’m pushing everyone away, even my amazingly understanding boyfriend. It feels like too much effort to do anything. I sleep for 13 hours minimum and if I don’t, I need a nap throughout the day. I feel so lazy and worthless. 

I need hope from you guys that have sought treatment that it gets better because I can’t imagine going the rest of my life feeling this hollow.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzlqro/afraid_of_suddenly_feeling_better/
I’ve been in a pretty serious depressive episode for about 3-4 weeks. I don’t deal with depression a lot. It usually comes from exhaustion after days of panic attacks when I’m exhausted. I’m primarily diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder. 

Over the past week I’ve been doing what my psychologist asked to get better. I got exhausted with it yesterday. I felt a little better, on average. I went from horrible every day to bad days with good evenings alternating with very bad days with so-so evening. Since yesterday was worse than the day before, I got frustrated and thought it wasn’t working. 

I woke up today and still felt depressed. But I gradually got better throughout the day. I got up and around, made myself do some things I like, did some light exercise, like I’ve been doing for the past week or so. I started to get work done without having to break and crawl into bed. I even found myself enjoying doing something silly, and enjoying the way an old song made me feel. And enjoying the nostalgic feeling the song gave me scared me. 

I would stop short of saying I feel 100% like myself, because I don’t. But when I scan myself, I really don’t feel any of the depressive symptoms anymore. And that scares me. What if I healed too suddenly? What if I’ve got a mood disorder and have to start treatment and meds etc. all over? I had a massive panic attack and interpreted the resulting irritability, stammered speech, etc., as potential manic symptoms.

Please don’t misunderstand me. I’m not saying this is some horrible condition that people cannot get past. But I am 33 years old and have been in treatment for something for six years, and I am just devastated at the thought of starting something over. I also primarily have health anxiety/hypochondriasis so I tend to medicalize every fear.

I'm part of a group chat and I loathe it. I hate how everyone is able to interact so easily with each other because they're all already friends. I don't know most of the people in the chat irl and I don't really want to tbh. I hate being in it. Just having the notification at the top of my screen of my phone makes me feel bad. I don't belong in there. I never do. I can't integrate into groups. I'm only staying because some people that I know irl are in there and they're kind of my friends but not really. I thought I'd like it in the chat because the people in there have similar interests and such but I just hate it. It always reminds of how incompetent I am when I try to interact with people. It's like watching a haply couple in front of you while you're going through a break up. I think the worst part is that I unconsciously always compare myself to them. It's not their fault ofc but me making myself feel more miserable because I always come to the conclusion that I'm worthless shit and I'll never be good enough.

I feel like if I disappeared today, no one would notice or care. I feel like I don't mean anything to anyone and never will. I've been feeling so empty and the worst kind of depressed ive ever been because I dont feel anything except this overwhelming feeling of worthlessness. nothing matters, because I have never and will never matter to anyone I care about. all I feel is emptiness and worthlessness.

Honestly a little scared to post this, but here goes.

I'm probably just typing to the void here, but that's okay. Days are blurry - I am aware I go to sleep, and that the sun rises and, technically, it's a new day. Even as I live in those moments it's all just a blur.

Life hasn't been fun. It hasn't been something I look forward to going through anymore. I still remember feeling happy to wake up and do shit, even if said shit was sitting on my ass playing games all day. Now, it's just something to pass time until I can properly kill myself. I dread waking up just to feel hurt. If I'm lucky I'll feel nothing at all.

My mother was diagnosed with cancer early last year. She wasn't sure if she'd make it to the new year, but she has, and is cancer free now. Her and my father would be devastated if I kill myself. Before the cancer I had dabbled in the thought of doing it regardless of how heartbreaking it'd be for them, but I can't now. I can't do that to them, especially to my mom and all she's been through.

So, I wait. And rot internally until they have both passed, and I can finally die too. It's weird, but thinking about how badly I want to die hurts so much.

I am 33 years old, a woman, and I live in America. I'm sure my residence has a lot to do with my depression. I have never really had much for long relationships, but I yearn so badly for someone to share life with. I want to live so badly on my own and support myself - I'm 33 years old for God's sake, and I can't get a loan over 3k despite my pristine credit because I simply don't earn enough. I live with people I once enjoyed, but have changed into negative people. One in particular after getting a boyfriend - one that has touched me inappropriately.

I am a failure. I will never succeed. I will never have a good relationship. I can't even support myself. All I am to men is an object.

Life isnt fun. I dont want to do this anymore. I can't die yet, so I slog on until both my parents are gone. I want to die, but when I think about how little I matter and how there's nothing that makes life worth it, it hurts so much.

I've known for a while that I make everyone around me upset and stressed. My dad tells me that all the time because I swear pretty often. In the last two to three weeks, I have made my mother cry more times than I had in the last 5 years, maybe more.
I expressed that I don't feel like I can talk to her anymore, and was immediately told that I have a double standard. I always expect her to be very polite, and I can treat her however I want.
I know that I'm like this. I've known for a long time.

I just fuck everything up. I have only been out of a hospital depression program for a few weeks, and I'm so much worse than when I started. I wasted my family's money, which we are already short on. If I had tried, I would be better. If I would just fucking work, I would be better.

Every day, I make things so much worse. I'm frustrated, and want to punch things, but I can't do that for so many reasons. And I'm just constantly torn. I feel frustrated, but I'm so depressed that I can't figure out how I'm frustrated, and the two feel incompatible. I'm irritable to the point that making my bed causes me to yell and swear when the sheets aren't perfect or I drop something.

I always have something to worry about. Even today, which is supposed to be a break for me, I'm worried about a piece I was assigned for my music lesson that I didn't practice for. Part of it was that I was away from home and couldn't transport my instrument, but that was only part of the week and my teacher doesn't give a shit anyway.

I'm tired, and don't know what to do.

Edit: Just realized I didn't finish the title. Sorry.

I was only on them for 5-6 months, my Dr kept saying to stick with them but it made my anxiety and depersonalisation sooo much worse.
I haven't taken them in a few months and honestly I don't know if stopping them was the right thing or what to do really.
Had anyone else had antidepressants that don't work for months then suddenly do?

my brain is literally just so terrible at being a brain. I literally wake up each morning and pray that i dont royally fuck up in someway, somehow and still, someway, somehow, i manage to piss someone off, mess up something easy at work, ruin group convo, miss payments, forget every single thing possible, or commit some other failure that shouldnt have been in anyway difficult, and each time it just reminds me of how not normal, how not useful, how not important my existence is and just...... ugh.

i feel as if my life as a whole is just an example to everyone else as to what not to look like, to what not to turn into. I set the bar for the lowest standard of living everyday and i just want to get life over with.  The frame of Kane Strang's "my smile is extinct" has literally been my life mantra.

I just went to a psychiatrist for the first time and got diagnosed with depression. Apparently they really think i should take medication for 3 to 6 months but i am really scared of it. I am looking for advice or experiences from people who took it. Side effects, dependency, effectiveness? Or how can i treat it alternatively? I am going to go to see a therapist but she seemed to think it should go together and not be an alternative.
Thank you by advance

After spending a good portion of my day browsing toxic sites and hating myself, I now feel exhausted and I can’t complete my homework, start my workout, and i just want to stay in the shower forever.

I’ve struggled with severe depression for a long time, and sometimes I wonder if it started earlier but wasn’t noticed. Recently, it’s been worse than ever. I’ve tried so many different medicines but they don’t work, not really. I’m afraid that I’m just wired this way. That something in my brain is broken that keeps me from ever feeling joy, that keeps me awkward and unattractive and uncharismatic, that keeps me in the fucking dirt. I can’t focus or work anymore, I just get no joy out of accomplishing anything. Even if I do, it just hits me over and over that people my age don’t give a shit about me. They don’t care, and it’s my fault. I started to distance myself from my friends because I couldn’t put on a happy face anymore and they were super put off whenever I tried to talk about what I’m feeling. I haven’t talked to most of them in a while, and I know they won’t reach out no matter how long I wait. I don’t feel confident or attractive at all, to the point where it seems like girls don’t even know I exist. It’s not their fault obviously, but it doesn’t stop me from feeling so unwanted that most days I just want to collapse. I used to get joy from playing the piano, from video games, from working out. None of those things seem to help anymore, and I’m afraid they won’t start to be fun ever again. I feel like a cold, disgusting rock most of the time, just shuffling by. I wish I had people to turn to outside of my family. I can talk to my parents, but they don’t know what to do and I know they just feel obligated to care. I wish I could feel confident and attractive in my body, and be able to engage with people properly. I wish I had something to be proud of. I wish I could feel accomplished when I do things. Sorry if you read this far, I don’t really have anything interesting to say. I’m only eighteen, but it already feels like I’ve wasted so much time and so many opportunities that the chance for me to be well-adjusted and happy is gone. I don’t really know why I posted here. I’d ask for reassurance, but it would probably feel hollow, I don’t know how to make things better. Thanks for reading.

Hey guys! I know there's people here who need much more attention than I do perhaps, but if you do read this, thank you. I (16f) have idealized suicide and have planned to kill myself for years now. Every time I've written my suicide note and tried to plan everything out, I realize how many obligations I have on this earth. I am the older sister of an 8 and 10 year old, who I both love to pieces. I've been a "third parent" to both since the eldest could talk. My parent's aren't the most emotionally available, and although by financial means we are very comfortable (think upper middle class suburbs) my dad definitely has rage and violence issues and in general, teaching things like emotional regulation and other important lessons for kids was always on my shoulders. I try pretty hard to raise my siblings right and be the best I can possibly be as not only a daughter but a role model for the kids, but it really fucking sucks sometimes. I'm also a high achieving student (president of multiple clubs and lead two nonprofits) and I get good grades (straight A's in AP's etc). My parents don't put a ton of pressure on me, but I definitely do pressure myself and have kind of realized that I might have anxiety issues over it. I'm not trying to sound arrogant, but rather I guess trying to explain how I used to always justify not killing myself.

Here comes the thing. Im just starting to spiral more and more and realize it doesn't matter. Everyday I wake up and I walk downstairs to get some food or something and just think over and over about how much I want to just be dead. To just have so much burden lifted off my shoulders and how nothing actually matters. I know people have it so much worse and I sound so ungrateful for what I have, but I want to kill myself so bad.

I drafted out a final goodbye. I have a couple versions for important people in my life, but for my siblings, I wrote how sorry I was. I tried my best, but I keep feeling like I'm failing and not being the best I can. It just really feels like I spent so many years trying and trying to fulfill some purpose and it doesn't matter. I really am not worth it. I feel like a con with everything I do. So many people think of me as that friend or girl that is doing it all, and I can barely get up every morning and get through it with a smile plastered trying to make sure I am doing everything right. It just feels like I try to be such a good student, friend, etc. and even at "peak" performance this is all life offers. I'm shirking on my obligations, and the guilt is killing me. Thank you if you read up to this point! I posted this on suicide watch, and I guess I just really need someone to talk to me in some way. I don't want to burden any of my friends or family (although parents have refused to get prof. help) and I haven't seen a friend in person since august bc of following pandemic rules. I don't know if I'll actually follow through, but I have the pills and a full day off from school tomorrow to deliberate i suppose.

Lmao I just wanna sit and do nothing my whole damn life. I literally refuse to work I hope it kills me, I might just end up going and starving to death I hate life. Theres NO way I can do a 9-5 job daily. I can't even move i have no energy. Theres NOTHING IN MEEEE, life is a fucking troll. People take life so fucking seriously, what the HELL.

I have a rare congenital visual impairment called septo-optic dysplasia which renders me blind in my left eye and low vision in my right eye. I am 19 and I have stagnated; I need a job or to start college but can’t motivate myself because of how difficult my vision makes everything. Even things that should be leisurely and entertaining like watching videos or drawing are becoming a chore. I love to read but reading has always been straining for me. I pushed myself through high school and performed at an advanced level thanks to my natural aptitude for academic and artistic work but after graduation I started to stagnate and can no longer motivate myself to work as hard as I once did. I feel like everyone else around me has moved on to the next step in their life whether that be college, the work force, or the military but I am still just hanging out at my mom’s house waisting the days away and waiting for a shit situation to magically improve. I feel like a massive failure and disappointment. I feel like I should be able to push myself to work extremely hard like I did in school again but I am just kind of tired of busting my balls all the time. I am suicidally depressed and I feel like the biggest loser on the planet because I have given up on life and all of my dreams for the most part. I want to be a contributing member of society and feel like I have a purpose.

sure there's a long list of phone numbers but i dont think there's any that would answer my call and provide comfort. 

and no please dont tell me to call helplines or wtv those are irritatingly useless.

it might just be my thoughts, it might be not.

whatever, it has always been this way.

Hi,

I know that no one can medically advise me or be able to tell me what's going on with my personal body/brain, or what might work best for me, when y'all aren't me or my doctors. But, this is the main thing I've been struggling to figure out for years now, and so I wanted to try and just finally put this out there and see if anything comes of it.

Essentially my biggest struggle since end of high school, so about 8 years ago, has been huge difficulty with doing academic-type work (which now translates to job applications, and office work). I find huge difficulty in all parts of the process, from getting myself to want to do it, to sitting down to actually doing it, and to making headway and getting it done. Up until midway through high school, I could make myself study for hours for all subjects, whether I found them that interesting or not. Math wasn't my best subject, but I did fine. I was very concerned about grades though and I took on more and more and essentially spent most of high school on an extremely sleep deprived schedule and a totally junk food vegan diet. My health tanked, my grades tanked, my productivity tanked. I feel like I've never fully recovered. I had some sobbing spells senior year, but I think that was largely due to severe lack of sleep and poor nutrition and also correlates sometimes with my cycle (so maybe PMDD, but I feel depressed other times of the month too, and it's not consistently bad every month). Whether because of that or due to post-puberty shifts in hormones and genetic predispositions, I feel I have some mild-moderate anxiety and now-and-then depression, including SAD. No panic attacks, no suicidal thoughts, just a restlessness, an 'I can't sit still for more than a bit at a time, or I'll want to get up and walk around or clean/organize things' type of feeling, and often a loss of interest in things/no huge passions, no interest in doing hobbies, no major pleasure or happiness from anything, and a fatigue and brain fog. 

I have endless energy for walking around, running errands, cleaning etc but when it comes to academic work, I avoid it like the plague and in college I'd stuff myself with snacks, which I somehow felt I needed in order to get myself to do work -- not as simple as needing calories for brain power, cause I'd eat a healthy meal but then want processed snacks in order to do homework -- chasing dopamine and pleasure chemicals maybe? Work drains me, it feels mentally/emotionally painful, and I never feel like I have my full brain power or creativity that I had in youth. I never also derive much excitement or interest in/from it or learning or achieving. I also wonder if I have developed a huge anxiety/stress response around it. Like oh this paper is going to be so difficult and take so much time and work, and not be fun, so now it's this big awful thing in my head.

I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but scared of meds/pursued the 'everything but meds' natural routes. I finally had one zoom call with a new psychiatrist who said he doesn't believe in the need for testing for adhd and instead just has patients he suspects have adhd to try meds... he gave me concerta (36mg to start) and I took it twice and felt like I was in major panic/anxiety, I was scared of how I felt, so I didn't take it again. I also went to the eye dr who think I don't have adhd but instead have an eye focusing disorder and am in eye therapy for that... that could be part of it but it doesn't seem like all. My other psychiatrist says she believes in trying to treat the anxiety/depression first and seeing if adhd symptoms remain. I just restarted therapy, both talk therapy and EMDR. Some days I'm open to trying meds (I have prozac I was prescribed in case I wanted to try it, sitting in my drawer, never tried it; I also have wellbutrin that I took twice and had massive insomnia that I'm not willing to experience again) and other days I think no way, I'm not at all cool risking weight gain or loss in sex drive or insomnia or a shitty adaptation period or tapering off period. I'm trying to exercise more. I just don't know. I might find another adhd specializing psychiatrist who could test me for adhd. I've tried so many supplements. 

sorry this is an incredibly long post (my first one, too).

Everything about my life is just fucked. Im sitting here antisocial crying in my room fucked up while my family is downstairs having a great time. I’m for some reason programmed to want to be cool and accepted, but too smart and aware to be cool. My brother was just as depressed but is a fucking idiot I cannot figure out why I strive to be like him. I fucking hate my life and could end it right now. Everything could be better if I just fucking ended this shitty boring useless life. No drug in the world mutes this depression engrained in my mind what is wrong with my Jesus Christ. I’m so over this shit. Why do I have to be the youngest in my family and get picked on for every single thing I did. Why do neither of my  parents give any sort of care for my issue that they know I have. Do I even have an issue? All I know is I’m fucked in the head and I’m posting this screw it. This is so incohesive but whatever no one in my life gives the tiniest amount of care I just need anyone real to read this.

If only there was some semblance of hope I could latch on to, but this fucking pandemic is gonna keep going until the end of time...

As I'm sitting in bed I am painfully aware of all the shit that needs to get done. I can't do it. I can't bring myself to do much of anything these days. All I want to do is sleep and I can't because I get lost in my own thoughts.

That's the other scary thing. My thoughts aren't just hopeless daydreams anymore, they are a disorganized manic mess that I can't keep track of. I am so frustrated with my inability to concentrate on one clear thought and I just want to scream or go nuts and break something. I guess there is still some rational part of my mind working because I haven't done that yet.

I feel like scratching the skin off my body I swear I'm going crazy.

Lately, my symptoms have been really taking a toll on our relationship. He does not struggle, and does not understand, and I hate to say that it angers me. I know I should not look to him to save me or change me, it's something I need to do myself. Any advice would help, as my mood is fogging my reality and feelings for him.

Today I read some while about Taoism and it greatly helped me alleviate the loneliness I usually feel.

It is a concept basically aligned with ourselves and a nice instrument to use to gain what you will.

Just getting this out there for those who would try. 


Be in with yourself and flow like you will.

Accept what all is and all will be better.
You're part of the all, after all. Be truly part of it.

It all stems from your mind, so let your mind flow and be free

Meaning is fluid
Your tastes change each day
You try to move on
But the world also moves

Move with it
Accept what you have
Let go of illusions
Forget what you know

Find out who you're being

Bye

paranoia is terrible. I can more or less deal with my depression, but this paranoia is a whole other level. I'm not sure if this is a vent or asking for advice, but here goes:

I don't have "the govt is watching me" or "im being stalked by aliens" kind of paranoia, just the casual kind, if there is a casual kind. Things that I do now and plan on doing in the future have all been built around keeping my paranoia at bay, which I don't think is even possible. Things that the average person wouldn't worry about, I think about in tenfold. For example, when I'm older I'll eventually need my own place to stay. If I could afford a big house, would I want one? No, because if I'm on one side of the house then someone could sneak in on the other side, and find me and hurt me. But there are more places to hide there. Do I want a smaller house? No, because if someone does decide to waltz in then I'll be much more easy to find. But I can keep a watch on everything more easily. Do I wanna live in the city? No, because it'll be easier for people who can hurt me to hide in plain site. But people are more likely to witness what happens and help. Do I wanna live in a secluded area? No, because if someone wants to follow me home and hurt me, no one will be there to witness or to hear my screams. But there are less people around who potentially want to hurt me. Do I want locks on every door? Yes, so it'll be more difficult to get to me on the inside. But then if I need to get in somewhere, it'll take longer, giving someone more time to catch up to me and hurt me. There's soooo much more that I could honestly take hours writing them down.

Of course there are other things that people might think are less strange. I always check to see if the child safety locks are on in a car just in case I'll have to jump out. Walking in front of people in the street is a nightmare. what if they're following me? Buying things is inconvenient. What if my info gets stolen, or if I get hacked again? And any time I get a delivery, I shred anything that has my name and/or address, so people won't be able to find me and hurt me. I got molested as a kid and ever since then I can't really trust guys of any age. At this point, overanalyzing is my specialty.

the world is a scary place, and i wish I could ignore it most of the time. I'm usually not suicidal (I do get there sometimes), but generally I wanna live life. It really sucks that I can't really live it (even in a pandemic-free world) without being anxious of everything

Sometimes i can have a few days where i am somewhat ok, but then it all just comes back to me.

I have thought a lot about what that teacher who knows told me, and one of the things were that if i didnt get help, i would end up wasting my youth and regretting it for the rest of my life. I need help, and at this point i actually want it too, but i am in a position where there is nothing i can do.

I keep telling myself that i am fine or that im making it all up, but i know that it isnt true.

I constantly think about everything that is wrong with me, and i just want it all to stop. But i cant.

At this point i just cant wait to die.

“Here we are again, tortured by these incessant thought and feelings of insecurity and unacceptance. I am without a doubt, other, an outlier, the imperfection in a most beautiful image. But, who am I to blame other than myself? I have always been cold and aloof, confiding in no one but myself. Letting people see the scars I bear would only bring out the fury and vitriol in me. So I’ve made a prison out of these walls, confined to a state of privacy, isolated from everything. Nevertheless, ridicule and judgement follow me everywhere. They plague me like a sickness, a sickness for which there’s no cure. All of my days seem gray and lackluster. But I’ve made something out of my state. It is this insufferable predicament that has made me a more resilient person. In this anguish, deep within it at its roots, I’ve discovered myself and who I’ve yet to become. I am tied to it like it’s a critical part to the whole of me. It’s fuels every fiber of my being; my passion, my poise and my rage. It has taken so much from me and yet shown me so much too. At times I’m convinced I love it more than anything else. I’ve known it all of my life and it will be there at my side to remind me of my truer self until the absolute end.”  

I promise you I’m okay. I just feel a lot. Thanks for reading :)

I think I’m going to kill myself but I’m scared it won’t work I don’t want to have any permanent effects and I don’t want to have to go to the hospital because if I do my parents won’t be able to afford it cause we don’t have insurance, I don’t think anyone will really miss me that much except maybe my sister but I’m sure she will get over it eventually,it’s not like I have any friends I’ve been homeschooled my entire life and haven’t even talked to anyone other than family in like 7 years I’m sure my parents will be sad for a little while but they will get over it, they just think I’m going to be a loser who lives in their house forever anyway. I just can’t take it anymore I’m so alone I just want to end it but I don’t know how my parents don’t allow me to leave the house (they didn’t let me before COVID either) Im always being watched I have no privacy I share a room with my sister and my parents are always spying on me. Maybe I should try to get help but I can’t my parents don’t think depression is real and I can’t tell them I’m depressed because they would just say I said it for attention. I just can’t take this anymore, anyway thanks for reading.

For 2-3 years i had episodes of random sadness like every week. I was diagnosed with mild depression. I’m pretty sure i may have anxiety but that’s not diagnosed. I don’t give a fuck about my depression, it’s the anxiety that’s just horrible. 

Somehow those episodes just went away?? I used to have episodes from a trigger or maybe just sitting on my bed. I still have zero motivation to do anything but sit on my bed and play on my phone.

I’m behind on school work. I’m still suicidal but never really remember how much i wanna die until i have an obvious trigger, like getting yelled at or just anything horrible reminds me of how trash my life is.

I feel worthless.

The past year I was able to transfer to a relatively prestigious university. I did decent the first semester. I was able to meet some people and form some friendships. I am currently financially stable and my major is conducive to that staying that way. I have no physical conditions. 

Despite being blessed with all this, I’m still persistently depressed and discontent. I hate myself and I hate living. I’ve been passively suicidal for a few years and it’s gotten no better, despite me making attempts at fixing my mental. 

Honestly, I don’t see the purpose in life in general, all we do is distract ourselves until death anyways. I’m aware how entitled I am and sound having all these good things, but it doesn’t really change the fact that I couldn’t care less and I would much rather not exist at all. 

It doesn’t help that my manager at my job this summer also killed himself.







[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzggnj/accepting_others_negative_opinions_of_you_is_this/
Much of my adult depression comes from low self-esteem that I developed as a kid. I grew up with both classmates and family members commenting on my (fat) body, shunning me for being a teacher’s pet, not wanting to be around me because I stunk, and telling me that I have “heavy hands” and a “sharp tongue” and super negative, and that’s why I’m hard to get along with. Nothing quite like growing up in a small town and leaving with not a single friend.

I hated myself for those things and I hated my experience of constantly being told that I was less than worthy. As an adult try to look past those labels and see myself as worthy of being loved but no matter my efforts I end up being just as toxic as ever towards my loved ones. I think it’s time for me to just accept that what everyone was saying back then as true. Maybe I really do stink and have a negative outlook. Maybe I do come off as being a know it all. Maybe I am stubborn and that’s why I haven’t been able to be physically or emotionally healthy.

I really hate that I’m listening to the things that brought me down in the past. It pains me knowing that everyone was right, and that I have been so wrong to try and justify my existence as is. But maybe it’s my resistance to that initial feedback that kept me down all along. I should have listened, even if it hurt me for a long time.

Is giving into the negativity ever the answer? Is this what we call acceptance?

   So I just got compared to myself. My boyfriend (we are long distancing) just told me off for being sad. Like, why are you feeling like that and why is it lasting so long? Like he met me year and a half ago and I was fun and careless and full of life so he asked why can't I be like that? 
I just felt so ashamed and lonely. Trying to explain what suffocates me and he just being like you take everything too serious life is  easy.
I lost my job, financial support and all my future plans went to shot with this pandemic, and I know its like that for most of us. I love my family but I resent them bc I want to live out with my boyfriend, he has a house of his own 600km away from my  city. My parents are not gonna be happy im afraid they won't even talk to me anymore because without a job and moving there its risky no I know that but I just can't stay and don't know hoy to say it. I don't want to hurt anyone. Trying to talk to my BF and he reacting that way...I'm just feeling worse and in a spiral of anxiety and sadness that I don't know how to get out. I cant even joke anymote and i feel im not fun to be around...and that im going to be alone in the end. I just want to end this feelings.

During the period between march through july was one of the toughest periods in my life. I struggled with self harm constantly. during the month of May I couldn’t go a few hours clean. I broke up with my toxic ex and now I’m with somebody who cares about my mental health, and my well-being. he really wants me to stop self harming and I’ve been almost month clean, but it’s getting bad again. I’ve tried sleeping my feelings away, using nicotine, and not eating for long periods of time. I never liked any of them is not to self harm. I just need some new ideas. i feel like i’m going crazy

No physical touch, intimate or otherwise for over 5 years.
It really feeds into my low self-esteem and ideation about feeling ugly and unwanted.

I've got this constant feeling of emptiness and dead feeling inside.

No one is ever going to love me despite having love to give. I have a big heart but that's obviously not enough.

All i do is go to work then go home even before the pandemic this was my pattern. I'm 30 this year and there's probably 10 year olds out there with more life experiences than me.

Is this all that life has to offer for me?.

If so, what's the point in going?

I don't usually do this type of thing. When I was a kid it was considered pretty taboo to even entertain the idea of having a mental illness, much less talk about it. But I'm 26 now and I've found myself without anyone I can actually talk to about how I've been feeling. 

&#x200B;

I'm a masochist. Pain has always been my thing. When I cut as a kid, it wasn't just a release, it was all I had, the only scrap of control. Suicidal thoughts were super rare, I never wanted to actually end my life, I just did it because I was hurt and confused and didn't know what else to do to snap out of that stupid numbing veil. 

&#x200B;

I've tried to deal with things, get better, and I feel like I have. But when I look at how old I am now and how many things I've felt like I've been sitting in the passenger seat and watching someone else destroy, I want to cry and cry and cry until I dry up. But I can't. And I want more than anything just to tell all of these people I love so much that it isn't me, or at least it isn't who I want to be. I came so close a few times but I can always see it when they seem to just click off or go away, because eventually I've fucked up enough to drive them away. I'm turning into my narcissistic mother, as much as I've fought to not be her.  


I really did think I was getting better, though. I haven't hurt myself in a decade, unless you count fucking myself up being clumsy. Until last year, I didn't even *want* to hurt myself. I was still getting down, but the days where I would be an absolute monster one day and an infuriating maniac the next were getting fewer and farther between. I met a guy who took care of me and understood me, got pregnant two years later, and now I've got the best reason to try and take care of myself.... playing by herself as I type this because I can't bring myself to smile for her, and god damn it that shit plays hell on my take on myself.  


For the past month, now, I haven't felt like myself at all. I feel like I did when I was a teenager, when I wasted all those days trying my best not to be awake. When I didn't get up to bathe, eat or brush my teeth for days, and nobody paid it any mind, and I made a dark little corner to blind and deafen myself in, where no one cared to go.   


All I can think of now is how sweet and peaceful it would be just to let it end. God I love my little girl but what good is a mother who can't even find a way to have love for herself? I would die before I let her turn out like me. Her dad is the best man I've ever met in my life, and I drove him away from me, but he loves her fiercely and he can likely parent *better* without having to worry about me. I'm dead weight, and a ticking emotional time bomb to boot.   


I don't have any control over what I do, and I'm scared. It's getting harder and harder just to put my thoughts somewhere healthy. I feel like I've been fighting a tide for years and it's been teasing me, letting off a little to allow me some progress, then ruthlessly shoving me back to the start. I feel helpless. Part of me wants to feel pain and be punished, the other part just wants this to be over. I'd kill for someone to just beat the fuck out of me, and it hurts just to admit that, or any of this. I know I need help, but I don't know where to start. I feel like I'm all alone.

i've never had rl friends, i've gotten ghosted about 20 times in the last few months, mostly by people who texted me first, no therapist whatever wants to help me, none of them reply to my emails. i have extreme abandonment and trust issues.. maybe that's what i fucking deserve. i'm done with living, i just want everything to end and will do my best to reach that goal.

I thought I won over my depression years ago. Maybe it's because of lack of sunshine or drop in hCG hormones..

Ex and I broke up due to his anger issues. I then got into an accident and am physically disabled. I also found out I miscarried.

Now, I'm stuck in home alone for the next couple of months, unable to shower. Eating and drinking water became extremely hard due to lack of mobility. Silver lining, I guess I get to lose weight.

Is there anyone who wants to be gaming buddies to help distract me from reality? :)

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzjt29/venting_im_really_stuck_therapy_doesnt_help/
Hello everyone,

I'm really defeated in general. I don't know where to start. 

Basically I want to know peoples' personal experiences with therapy and how it helped them (especially If your depression is mostly biological based).

Currently, I have a great therapist, and I really like him. My issue with therapy is that I don't think it helps me much. I've tried a lot of different types: CBT, DBT, sensory processing, along with many others I can't quite remember now. 

Let me explain my issues:

Mainly depression. Cause is almost solely biological. I was born premature and wasn't touched by human hands until 6 months of age which obviously causes a lot of problems in the brain and all the synapses, blah blah blah. My dad also has major depressive disorder. I have little to no trauma that my therapist and I feel affect my mental health. 

Anything you can think of therapy helping someone do, I do. Most coping skills don't work for me; they don't give me relief. I live a relatively healthy lifestyle (working out, walking daily, journaling, sometimes meditate, try to "feel" my feelings but not get stuck in them, I have a good self esteem and self image, a GREAT family and support system, common social interaction, etc.). I'm very stuck and having a hard time because it feels like everything that "should" help someone and I hear people say helps them, doesn't help me. 

When it comes to therapy now, I'm kind of defensive because I feel like I try everything and it doesn't work to give me any positive result (insight, relief, etc.). So when something is mentioned, I put walls up because I know myself and I know what does and doesn't help. Are there just some people that therapy doesn't work for? Because I think I might be one of those people. 

I just don't feel joy anymore. I can live the "best day ever" but I really wouldn't truly enjoy it. It's like someone put a bubble around me so I interact with the outside world but never really get to "connect" with it.  Life isn't worth living at all anymore to me. I know it will be one day, but I don't know how much longer of this cycle I can take. When I'm not depressed, I'm a relatively happy person though. 

I just can't find relief at all. I'm constantly in distress, and emotionally uncomfortable. The only times I notice coping skills and therapy to actually work is right when I'm about to come out of a depressive episode. Other times, nothing helps. I just hold on for dear life and hope I don't get drowned/kill myself. 

My depressive episodes last 1-2 years on average and there's a break of 1.5-3 years in between of living like a normal person. Life doesn't feel worth it if I'm spending 1/2 of it in a depressive episode.

This is going to be a long post. I'm sorry.
I'm 29F. I'm married and I have 2 kids. 8yo and 6yo. My 6yo is nonverbal and autistic. We have a pretty standard life. We live with my in laws. WE DO NOT MOOCH. We have our own bills and our own separate "financial life." We don't ever dump our kids off on them. In fact, we haven't had a night alone in over a year. We are very present parents.
We live in an area with a top notch school district and would love to stay here bc of that, mainly bc my 6yo gets really great services.
The problem is, my in laws are so toxic. Do I love them? Absolutely. My kids adore them. But toxic, they are. Any issue we ever bring up to them (very genuine issues), they completely disregard and brush off. They are very selfish and don't even realize it. I would even say they gaslight us about things a lot and make us feel ridiculous.
I often wonder if I'm a bad person, if I'm the gaslighter, etc bc of all this. It's honestly so stressful. I will literally google "am I emotionally abusive" and quickly realize it's them!!
For the record, they are never like this to our kids.
The problem is, we want to move out. We want our own separate life. But homes here are SO EXPENSIVE. Homes nearby are SO EXPENSIVE.
I'm so incredibly depressed. I feel like I'm in a hopeless situation. I'm estranged from my family. I have no friends. No job. Covid had made everything worse. We can't afford to move out, but living here has taken a toll on my mental health and my husband's.
I genuinely feel like nobody cares about me. I genuinely feel like there is no help for me. I tried to tell my MIL that i was feeling very depressed and she completely ignored me as if she didn't hear me. It's making me wonder if there are actual people in the world that care about each other? Is everyone this selfish?Why don't I have people that care about me? That is so foreign to me, like a fairy tale. I would literally do anything for anyone. I would literally listen to anyone without judgement. It's so lonely.
I would love to see a therapist but I don't have any insurance bc my husbands insurance is so expensive and he has severe issues, he needs it more. The free clinic is not taking new patients bc of high demand due to covid. I've literally been googling tall buildings, high bridges, suicide methods, etc. and contemplating which ways would be best and which ways would be not great. The thought of traumatizing my kids used to be enough to nip that in the bud. But now it feels more like they would be better off.
I wake up in the morning ready to try and have a good day, feeling silly for being so depressed the day before, for not eating,  for crying. and as the day goes on I remember why. And each time I sink a little lower. I definitely am starting to realize that there is no hope. Maybe I actually am a shit person.

I've always been a loner and very been the sharing type. Im quiet if I must say. Almost 3 years ago, I opened this reddit account to escape/find an avenue to escape what was happening to me.

I was married for 2 years to the most amazing woman I'd ever known, but she life couldn't just let us be.

She was diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer. When I first heard I don't think I handled it well. I was angry, I was scared and confused. I confess I was selfish. I'd always been a loner, my father was a preacher and he never really let me do.anything but church activities and prayers.  He was trying to groom me but I hated every moment of it. And then came this interesting and annoying girl who I seemed to never get enough of and just like that, she changed my life. She helped me grow by letting me know I wasn't taking control.of my life and i had to do so to grow. 6 months months later we both moved to the states to start a new life, 2 years later I asked her to marry me and she said yes. All of a sudden, the only person Ive ever shared who I really am with, who knows me more than anyone in the world, my best friend ever is about to leave me like that. How was I supposed to react? 

I was with her and I tried everything to make sure I don't lose her, I lost alot but I didn't care, I just wanted her. I went to sleep on a Friday, about woke up the next day but she wasn't by my side, I called her name and no answer and went to look around the house. I found her but was gone.

On February 23rd, 2016 (my birthday), the love of my life took her own life, and didn't even say goodbye cos I think she knew I wouldnt accept it. About 2 years after that her sister told me she had actually gotten diagnosed with cancer twice before we met (which she never told me) and that she was depressed for years and always running away or never really wanting to talk to people. I guess I was the exception.

Basically I've been depressed ever since and I've just been throwing myself into work. I'm accepting my fate and hoping to heal. So here I am.

* Forgive me for the rough post. Sharing is new for me and I'm sincerely struggling to type this. *

Thank you for reading...

Hi. I just want to share how i feel this past few months. I'm a young adult, 22 years old. Ever since the pandemic started, i lost my job. I became more miserable. I can't find a job because of COVID. I don't have anything left on me. I always keep wondering why am i still alive, i don't have a purpose. My life is a series of torture. I see my friends grow and cant help feel jealous over them. Like i always ask God why am i like this? I always did well. I worked hard but why am i suffering like this? I just want to end things. I've been thinking of killing myself everyday ever since May of 2020. I even started preparing myself. Deleted my social media accounts, emptied my bank account. Now, i'm left on deciding how should i kill myself. Its a burden right now.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzch6c/my_dad_tried_to_kill_himself/
My dad has always been very healthy but lately he's completely changed. He doesn't eat unless we advise him to, multiple times (he lost 10 kilos/22 pounds in a month because of it), mind you, this is someone who used to be very very strict with his eating habits - he never skipped a meal. 
He doesn't give his opinion on things anymore, only if you directly ask him to, which is so odd to me because he was always so passionate about expressing his point of view on things. Now he barely talks to us. Now i know this may seem small to some people but little changes like these kept going on and i was starting to get worried. And then yesterday happened. He tried to kill himself. I will not describe how. 
I feel overwhelmed and helpless and guilty and just want to cry with him all day. I love my dad so much and just want things to go back to what they were. 
I am now terrified of leaving him alone which he doesn't like. 

I think he's depressed but nothing has been diagnosed. 

I can't force him to get help but i also can't just sit around while he's clearly in pain. I don't know what to do and it's killing me.

I have moderate depression and my therapist has suggested that I get something that forces me to get out of bed and to actually do something. I was thinking maybe getting a fish or some plants would help? Fish are rather low maintenance pets so even on worse days I can still take care of it but it's still something that I'm looking after/working towards in a way. Plants are a little more high maintenance but are very pretty and could probably make my house feel more lively.

If you're depressed and have tried looking after fish/plants, how do you recommend it?

I've tried so many things to help my head and been on the real stuff, which helped better, but this GABA stuff is making me feel worse and extremely foreign to my own body. Maybe it's adjusting. Its only day 2. But it makes me feel so so so terrible inside its just a grey thunderstorm inside. 

I feel so alone and people close to me feel like strangers to me. Im pushing people away and its only my fault but my emotions feel so empty its like I dont care that I'm letting them walk away. 

None of this is like me and im scared, shes holding me captive inside. Will this day ever end? I hate myself. Its cold. I will try to sleep once more. THERES MONSTERS IN MY HEAD THERES MONSTERS IN MY BODY! MAKE.IT.STOP.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzbs13/cold/
In my first relationship, which took place in the midst of depression, my partner suddenly started calling me "cold". This coldness was a byproduct of many factors - there was my piquing depression, with insomnia and constant fear of death after several years of relatives passing away; school, where teachers would say that I'm all play-pretend and constantly threaten me with "the second year"; my mother's depression which lasted almost three years; two years of trips to a medical camp where I would get bullied by older girls; and the relationship itself, which started on the basis of depression, but resulted in a one-sided attachment with constant "you are too emotional".

By the point he called me "cold", I knew that no one really liked me when I'm emotional. Emotional me was defined by metaphors and tears - if I spoke about things too poetically and passionately, or started crying all of a sudden, no one would really sit through it with patience. Teachers, friends, parents, mentors - they all, to some extent, liked my poetry, my short stories and speeches. So my feelings were accepted from a piece of paper, but not in the form of an utterance - especially a personal one. Cold me was defined by the dominance of silence and apathetic perception of things happening regardless of their nature. It's just nodding, looking at something, and being silent - if necessary, I can start the whole "I'm fine" narrative just because in this state I rarely find myself able to communicate why I'm not. I think it'll pass, I'll crack the shell and act as I should - but it requires extensive effort from the other side, which only makes me feel more guilty of being the way I am.

Now, I manage relationships and friendships quite poorly - it's hard for me to open up, but when I do it's even harder for me to believe that I'm accepted the way I happened to be (that being "too emotional" and "with some past issues"). The friends I have are those that happened to stick by since school - nothing too personal or frequent, just rare talks and even rarer meetings. However, I had a few shots at relationships - and the feeling that I cannot escape is "cold".

I'm dragging this out a little, but I've been crying all day today because of an emotional lockdown. It was a split second of barely intentional neglect that made me come back to the "cold" side of things with someone who seems to be supportive and mindful of my shticks. It was in the tone of my voice, in the way I acted, in thoughts - I think for the first time I followed the process very clearly, not in the passenger seat. I felt absolutely miserable - I couldn't approach the situation as an adult, explain myself, pretend as if nothing happened, or tell that I, only I was the main cause of such an overblown reaction. My self-confidence plummeted - it wasn't a talk of equals anymore, it was a parent-child situation. I was just asking for us to stop, dismissing any support or resolution - it was a sudden fear of losing someone important mixed with a sudden understanding that I'm better off silent. The moment I dive into my thoughts, the risk of me being rejected or interrupted or dismissed escalates. It cannot be others all the time, I know that - something has to be wrong with the way I express myself that makes me revolting, makes those disgusted faces and impersonal messages appear.

My first partner never really tried to figure those states out, to navigate them to a better place - now I find myself wondering whether that is even possible as I try to do it on my own. I know that those few with whom I talk now on a personal level have no elastic patience - at the same time, I realise that maybe, just maybe, this coldness will never go away, staying as a coping mechanism, and everything will keep shutting down the moment someone does something that supports the idea of me being "too emotional" or the reoccurring thought that no one really cares about what I have to say. That drives me towards solitude, towards the abandonment of any hope about having a normal-functioning relationship or friendship - which only more so supports the "cold", the hiding in my shell.

I don't think that I've captured the point I wanted to make when I started writing - but it's been comforting to waste two hours on not crying. Being in an overly alert state is tiring - I don't know whether I'll receive a warm welcome from this person after acting like a child, and opening up to them about all of it would be only more so emotionally draining for them. I don't want to let someone go because of it but it feels like something predetermined. I don't think like this "coldness" defines me or crosses everything else that I have - but it seems like it does, and have been doing so in almost every relationship and friendship that I had since depression hit.

After a relatively boring day of trying to watch movies and dozing off (my Dr put me on a new med and it's making me so tired, but my sleep has improved a lot) I got a few things accomplished. I walked the dog with my husband, this is something I don't normally do. I cleaned up a tiny bit (which is better than none at all) and I took a shower. It had been over a week since I showered. I know y'all are like "how nasty, what a grub," but taking a shower is a big deal for me. I hate showering. I get afraid in the shower, like overwhelmed... it just gives me anxiety. Idk. It sure feels good to be clean. I feel super exhausted, I'm guessing it's from the new med, hopefully I adjust soon and I don't feel so dizzy. I also have borderline personality disorder, and I'm really at an all time low... My paranoia is off the charts, my mood swings go from anger to depressed to manic (manic as in delusional thinking) so I really had to try a medication to try to shut my brain up. I guess I call today a good day.... At least I'm clean.

I hate my life, no i don't hate my life i just hate myself and how i'm wasting my life. More importantly how i will continue to waste my life, simply because i can't do anything like a normal person. 

I will prolly never be able to get a job, go to college, or get a girlfriend. so why even bother, i've thought about this before and i think 18 or 19 is plenty old enough for me, (x0x)

Ive been taking different antidepressants but they keep making me feel worse. And my anxiety meds only work for a very short time after taking then the panic just sets back in. Ive also been talking 50mg desyrel and it makes me extremely loopy. Its kinda hard taking about med options with my therapist and stuff and i dont really even know whats out there to choose from or where to look.

i’m going through a break up right now but to be honest i don’t feel anything. i thought that i’d be in tears breaking down every second but honestly i’m feeling nothing. the more i think about it i’ve started to realise i’ve been feeling this way for a while and spending time with my gf, even though we were long distance, was the only way i would feel any sort of emotion in months. shes the only person i’ve really felt close to for the past few months so she’s the only person i really feel comfortable opening up to and telling all of this but she’s gone. she brought the best out of me but now that she’s gone i just feel empty and alone.

nothing feels the same anymore. i’ve tried listening to my favourite podcasts and songs, watching my favourite films and tv show but i can’t enjoy any of it right now. if i’m spending time with my family i just find myself putting on a face for a couple minutes and as soon as they turn away or do something else i go back to nothing. today was the first time i decided to play games with my friends online in a couple of weeks due to school, they were all excited to hear from me and i was too for a moment but it started to feel like a chore and it felt like i was only staying for them. i was afraid to leave because i felt bad i hadn’t spent any time with them in so long so i forced myself to just stay and talk. there was a moment we were laughing and joking but it didn’t feel genuine and i just went back to feeling nothing.

they’ve been my best friends for years and i miss them because this was the first time we were all together, even virtually, in weeks so why did i have to force myself to spend time with them and pretend like i was enjoying it. i want to spend more time with my family and friends because i know it will help me but i just can’t find the motivation and it feels like i’m lying to them. i’m afraid to tell them because i don’t want them to worry and with the pandemic going on we can’t see each other so there’s not much anyone could do right now.

i’ve been able to work through my depression and anxiety before but right now i’m struggling to see an end. there’s just so much going on and  it feels like it’s fallen apart all at once.

This is going to be a lot more boring and short than most of the other posts you see around here but here I come.

For som time now, I am asking myself what's keeping me from ending it right here? Like... In the end, our lives always end the same way so why not just cut straight to the point.

I had a really good childhood, both parents were and still are loving even after they had a divorce, I always got what I needed and whenever I needed it. But still I feel empty inside. Other than my family, Noone cares about me and I don't care about anyone. Everytime I started getting attached to someone it didn't end well resulting in me asking the same question again and again... 

Why continue living when I will die later on anyway?
I feel like I am absolutely okay and absolutely broken inside at the same time...

Sooo, I can’t really talk about this to my friends. 
I really wanna kill myself, I’ll probably take this down.
I’ve been trying to find painless ways with things on hand, I’ve heard that cutting is actually super painful. Maybe if I take an ice bath first, which I’m sure will be uncomfortable but it may like numb the pain. I looked into helium but it would be risky to buy a canister and get it filled up with no like need for actual helium like would people ask. I thought about buying a gun but I’m kinda strapped for cash at the moment just lost my job. Idk what or how to do it. I really want it to be painless. Like that’s my main concern I don’t mind if it takes a while but I want minimal pain. And yes I know there’s “so much to live for”, I should “seek help” I’ve been there. I’m tired, it’s the culmination of many things that’s pushed me to feel this way and I’m really just tired. At first I figured I’d ask for advice, but I realized no one will advice me on how to do this. So I guess I’m venting at this point.

I graduated college 3 years ago and past 3 years have destroyed any illusion I had that I am smart. I've been battling depression since I was roughly 15ish so about 11 years now. I always knew I wasn't exactly a looker and my personality is not exactly what one might call engaging or fun to be around. I always felt smart though. Always got top grades so I felt this is how my self worth will be. Whenever I felt ugly or unlike I just reminded my self we have different strengths and I dealt with it. Now 3 years in and I feel like a fucking idiot. Constantly overbudget at work. Slow to grasp basic shit. Not sure where to go from here.

In and out of depressive moods, anxiety crawling all over my skin. I should leave home to revive my spirit but too down to put the ‘happy, trendy make up’ on. Or am i just too lazy? Im not even sure anymore.. 

Ever experienced being called excellent at something, surpassing expectations and decent looking enough to fit in but still feel so detached and you just cant believe all the niceties? Then along comes people with crab mentality who’s made it their life goal to bring you down, clawing at you on your way down, stepping on you as soon as you hit the ground, then spit on your face when you’re just about to burst. Then all those people who said you’re good suddenly just vanish, leaving new words that would eat your shredded soul.. whatever’s left of it..... ‘she’s not even that smart. She was pretty useless. She’s not even pretty too, just her hair’s nice’. 

Hmm.. there’s no need for other people to help me get on the ledge.. Ive always been there before they even came along. Ready to jump.. just too depressed to move.. always just asking ‘now what?’

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzhlhx/wondering_about_antidepressants/
Hello, a little context to begin with. I saw a psy and a doctor during 6 months last year, at the end of the 6 months the psy came to the conclusion that i m making a depression. Hard to hear, plus the doctor wanted to put me into anti- depressants for the next 6 months. I scared me a lot, so much that i went into the mindset of " i can do it all by myself, no need of them blablabla".

Time passed and im isolating from all the " friends " i had, feeling lonely like never before, and sad every night.  I am wondering if im not self sabotaging my life ?
Lately i feel very overwhelmed, by my work, by what people thinking of me, by everything.. 
 Maybe the medicaments the doctor wanted to give me would have made the difference ? 

I don't want to see the psy again since it costed me a lot of money..

If i am coming back to my doctor, what can i expect from antidepressant ? Will it change my personality ? Am i going to be an addict and never could go back to normal life ? What are some side effect i can expect ?

Hey everyone
I have a history of anxiety/depression and OCD. I stopped taking my zoloft during the summer (personal reasons) and I felt great. But recently, I've had a lot of changes in my life. Good and bad! We bought a house 2 months ago. We've had a few deaths in the family, im also a stay at home mom raising my 2 boys on top of everything. We are having a really tough winter.. weather wise. Its always freezing and grey. Plus, covid isn't helping anything. 
I have been feeling really weird lately. I can't find the motivation to do any of my housework, I feel all signs of depression, but I am not sad. I just feel so weird. Its hard to even explain. My anxiety/ocd is telling me I have a chronic illness. I just have ZERO energy, motivation, I feel like a hollow shell. I don't want to play with my kids, i don't want to cook, I stopped my small buisness. I barely even have the energy to talk to my husband. I take multivitamins and vitamin D. I started an herbal mood supplement with ashwanghanda and st johns wort. I am just not sure how to explain how I am feeling. Does anyone understand? Does anyones depression present with no sadness? Just... kinda numb? Also, could I be physically ill? Could it be something other than depression? P.s I have this constant feeling of butterflies in my stomach too. It's weird.. like 24/7

Started off with my whole friend group getting invited to somewhere except me by this one person. At first I let it pass. It happened again the same person invited my whole friend group again to a get together and I wasn't invited. One of my friends said something to the hostess, the one who invited them, but idk how good of a job he did because the person who invited said I couldn't come with some lame excuse how too many people. Now that time hurt. Then what do you know, it happened again. I wasn't invited by my whole friend group was, but this time felt different because the next day I texted the hostess of these get togethers nicely asking why I am never invited, but all my friends are and if I did anything? All I got was that they are close with them and not me. I told my friends this response and all I got in response was, “damn, that sucks.” It feels like they don’t care that I.m never there and feels like I’m slowly getting pushed out of my own friend group. I feel like I put in the normal amount of effort to be a friend while I feel like I get a fraction of that back. Any advice???

Sorta off topic, but what can I do if just feel like I'm there and not actually feeling like I’m THERE when I am hanging out with them. I feel like I’m the weakest link in the group.

Yesterday and the day before that I was feeling incredibly depressed and completely hopeless. Didn't even have a good reason why. I did everything right.  Today I feel quite happy almost manic. I would think I have bipolar disorder but usually bipolar depressive and manic episodes last minimum 2 weeks neither of mine have ever lasted more than 5 days.

Is this normal? It got really bad at some point and now it’s flat. Empty and nothing. Sometimes I feel glimpses of emotions come through randomly, and I’ll start tearing up or I’ll 
start losing it and feel the need to isolate myself.  But otherwise it’s flat with a few negative emotions sometimes and some random tearing up.





[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzhfwc/trying_to_make_sense_of_these_phenomenons/
Nothing is *ever* the end of the world. Sometimes we think it will be. Sometimes we *want* it to be. But it’s not. It never is. Life goes on, no matter what. 

I’ve always both loved & feared getting close to people. Because of shifting situations, I’ve never kept any friends. Out of the hundreds of people I’ve ever known, I have three who are still in my life today just as casual acquaintances. Basically they’re just extended family members. All previous partners. We’ve had long long long histories together and that’s made it so I don’t feel much for any of them. It’s just the way it is. But I won’t cut someone out of my life forever... if they find their way back to me and take on a friendship role, then so be it. So I have these three people who I can call if I ever need someone to talk to. But there’s really no point, because they don’t understand me. They never have, and that’s why we didn’t work out as partners. And I wonder... what’s even the point of friendship if you don’t *understand* each other? 

I have one person who I love very much, who I can tell anything to, but he’s physically far away from me. Still, I’m incredibly thankful for him. He’s by far my favourite person. 

I have my parents, who have usually done their best to help me, but have also done their share of hurting me. They don’t understand me, and they have their own problems to focus on anyways. 

I have my son, who is my responsibility and my reason for getting out of bed in the morning. Literally, I would stay in bed every day if he didn’t exist. Sometimes I’m more thankful for the time I get *away* from him, rather than the time I get *with him*, because I want him to see as little of my issues as possible. I want him to connect with other people, enjoy life, have things to do... 

No, this isn’t going anywhere in particular. It’s just a stream of consciousness. Word vomit. 

I’ve always had such anxiety over losing people. Sometimes it’s the people who I could take or leave. Sometimes it’s my parents — worrying that they’ll die before I can bring myself to *feel* for them again the way I want to. Mostly though, it’s the people who I love the most. The people who I feel at home with. It’s so rare to find and I’m always terrified to lose it because I think it’ll be the end of the world. But it won’t. It never is. I’ve experienced it enough to know that life goes on. And I’m working on looking at it like this; 

People will only stay present in your life for as long as *they* truly want to, or for as long as is fated. Their time is a gift and should be enjoyed and cherished in the here & now. 

And if we lose them; If they were good to you, then be thankful they were around. If they treated you poorly, then it’s for the best that they’re gone now. 

If I believe this, then there’s really nothing to worry about...

I am over the fighting for a better life. I just want to crawl inside a dark cave like a wounded animal and sleep...maybe not forever, but for a long time.

This world is just too much. It‘s too loud, too crowded, too bright. Too many expectations from myself, other people, society...but mostly myself.

Get a job. Have a home. Eat. Shower. Sleep. Study. Socialize. Have hobbies. Take everything this world has to offer...well, what does it have? It feels wrong. I don‘t want to be ungrateful, but for me, living mostly means suffering. Struggling to get through the day. Faking to be a functional normal human being.

If I had all the money in the world, I wouldn‘t travel. I wouldn‘t buy things I need (or think I need). I would just vanish under my covers, thankful that everything is being taken care of.  Just waiting for my life to pass by and a hopefully peaceful death to embrace me. 

Other people, human relationships just mean...drama. Conflict. Disappointment. Judgement. The feeling of inadequacy. I cannot stand their voices. I cannot stand their thoughts. I cannot stand that they form opinions about me although they dont even know me- and I am too tired to prove them otherwise. I cannot stand that everyone else has their own little world they live in. It may be fascinating, but to me it‘s just overwhelming. 

There are people out there...enjoying life? Looking forward towards things? Living in the moment? It‘s like a foreign language to me. I can barely grasp the concept, but I cannot feel it. 

I don‘t even know what‘s wrong with me anymore. Is it depression, depersonalisation, trauma? Or just myself. Is that what life‘s gonna be like for me forever? God.

I feel so old. I am a student, for fucks sake. I should enjoy myself, meet other people, have fun. But all I can do is vanish in my room, under my covers. Thinking back to my childhood every fucking day and wish for better parents that I‘ll never have. 

I am stuck in the past and at the same time I am happy to not live in the present- because my present is pretty shitty. 

I‘ts funny, I am writing these words while I should actually listen to an online lecture for one of my classes. I‘ts gonna be deleted in one minute and I am watching it pass by. It‘ll never come back. Just like my childhood or any chance for a better life.

I am not always this depressed, lol. But I guess writing is like an outlet for me and sometimes I just enjoy shouting my pain into the world.

I don’t know what hit me the past few days but I started thinking about how good life actually could’ve been.

The amount of bad decisions and missed opportunities (relationships, applications, etc) are driving me nuts. I could literally be living a completely different life instead of this one where I hate myself.

Right now it is so painful trying to fix all those mistakes I made just for a small chance of getting where I could have been.

Hi. Nothing is working out. My career prospects, my love life. My friends aren’t free/close enough to meet me and even if they could, I can’t go due to my parents pretty much putting me on house arrest. There’s this sinking feeling inside and I want to sleep in all day but I have class to attend and projects to do. I used to be so driven and self motivated, a go getter. Now everything’s vanished into thin air. I don’t feel like completing all the projects I have going on. I feel like being alone all the time when I used to be extroverted. I loved listening to music and reading but now I feel so annoyed(?) when I listen to any and restless when I start reading and can’t pay attention. 

Despite feeling the way I do, I have to appear that I’m doing okay. If I’m sleeping in too much, I claim headaches and if I’m ever crying I chalk it upto a blocked nose. I constantly keep feeling like life’s going to be like this all throughout and that makes me not want to continue at all. But I know that’s not true yet my mind keeps feeding me lies. I can’t get professional help.

Depression has me beat. I have complex ptsd that has been incredibly brutal in the last two months. Multiple deaths in my family including my Grandfather who spent the last two years with extreme Alzheimer’s. Earlier in July i had a massive falling out with my friends leaving me with about two friends left. Im on a waiting list for therapy and hopefully treatment soon as I have tried to avoid putting drugs in me but I think I will lose this fight if i don’t do something. 

Everyday i feel lost and hurt. I constantly think about suicide. Not a plan for it but just thoughts and urges to do it. Im so moody and raw right now it feels like everything said to me is a slight or insult and I don’t understand why. Im so incredibly angry at myself that I keep myself up at night thinking about things I’ve done and over analyzing everything i did in the day. 

Im not sure where to go from here. I just know I’m stuck in this rut.

Right now... I've feeling extremely worthless. There's this one person... My best friend, and we haven't talked since I woke up. I first messaged her about 4-5 hours ago and left more but they haven't responded. And we've had a really rough past so my mind is just screaming at me that they're ignoring me because of how I've used and manipulated them in the past. I regret more than anything, but I continue to use people without even knowing it, it's just become part of my personality. And I hate it and myself more than anything. and evn tho it hasn;t been too lonmg going without talking to her, it still has me incredibly depressed and suicidal. Though lrtting this all out through a reddit post is kinda helping... I tried watching YouTube, my main coping method, but that failed. Nothing really seems to be helping, and all these thoughts on why they may be ignoring me... it just really has me feeling completel worthless.

So long story short, I am 36 years old and have realized I’ve had horrible depression my whole life. Discovered this through therapy in 2020 and kicking a drug habit that has finally regulated my hormones (and began seeing an addiction psych).

Anyways, I’m great. Feel like I discovered MY meaning of life. My family thinks I’m maniacal. Or bi-polar whatever that means.

Surely I can’t be the only one going through this! Any advice?

Edit: holy shit, the amount of people who've commented and liked this have made me feel a little better about my situation. Maybe there is still hope about finding someone who does feel similar and like me at the same time

I've constantly posted and I feel like a broken record, I feel like some sort of fucking weirdo or creep or monster because no matter how hard I try to impress anyone or get them to fall for me. Nobody understands how it feels to be at rock bottom, to have horrible disgusting thoughts 24/7, to look happy but wanna just sit and rot away in a corner. Everyone around me has someone who loves them and don't understand what it's like to be truly alone and not having someone love and want you for you. I'm a guy and I'm 21 and my last girlfriend was 5+ years ago. Everyone tells me I'm amazing. I'm funny and cool and that my personality is funny. But then the moment I want a girl to talk to everyone's gone and doesn't want me. I don't know what else to do. Everytime someone comes they ghost or don't care.

Hi guys, I’ll start by saying I’ve never used this before and not really sure why I’m posting this.

I’m a 24 year old guy and I’ve always kind of struggled in social situations, don’t have much self confidence/esteem and I guess I have a pretty negative outlook on life. My relationship with my girlfriend ended in July last year( we had been together for 1 and 3/4 years) it was my first serious relationship. 6 months on I’m still kind of not over it, I mean I miss being in it but I also glad I’m not in it now (she broke up with me btw) 
My life just feels really empty I only have one real friend and that’s the ex from the relationship I just mentioned. She says she is very happy to be my best friend but I feel like she’s just saying that because she’s knows I don’t really have any friends. We text a lot but it’s only really one word replies that I get, sometimes we end up talking quite abit but after she always asks if she can borrow money, asks to borrow something or just needs my help with something. I can’t help but feel she’s just using me? Maybe I just encourage it because I always say yes. 
I’ve tried to distant myself from her recently because it always feels like I’m last on her list of friends, that’s not a problem she has lots of friends. It’s just that shes the only one I have and seems really unfair on me when I get a reply 3-6 hours later or never because she busy with them. I also know that when she starts dating other guys that I’m not going to have that friendship anymore. That would really awkward and weird, right? 

I really want 2021 to be good year for me, I want to be able to really improve myself, by getting some new friends and start doing some hobbies(I really don’t have any haha) but obviously with COVID I don’t think that will happen. 
I do have one positive though. I’ve started a new job which will be really good. After working dead end jobs for the last 6 years, it feels really good to catch a break. 

Anyway sorry for the long post and wasting your time if you read it. I just needed to get this off my chest

I'm a healthcare professional, and to put it bluntly, I think my job has wrecked my head.

I had a very difficult placement last year which was essentially months of constant anxiety on a high-stress ward. I sought counselling at the time, which kinda helped. However, following that placement, I was totally burnt out, and for the last 6 or so months, I've largely felt very flat and ambivalent. I've drifted through work, lacking motivation and drive. 

My self confidence at work has been destroyed - I'm constantly questioning myself. The feelings of being a fraud are stronger than ever. But the final straw has been a shift I did over the weekend.

Somebody I saw on the ward really affected me and I tried my best to manage the patient as best I could. Turned out the initial diagnosis was completely wrong, and now that patient has deteriorated and won't likely make it. I'd also seen a medical emergency where the patient was septic and close to having a cardiac arrest. Everything was happening at 100mph and it was just frantic. I was only a spectator really, but the anxiety was just rising watching. I left that shift feeling mentally bruised and destroyed. 

I don't know why it's affected me so much, but it's finally made me believe I'm not fit to do this job, amongst other things. 

I'm sick of my imperfections and that no matter how hard I try, it's never enough. This job is destroying me. I thought I was OK after counselling, but I'm really struggling just now. This weekend, it felt like I was grieving almost, just constantly reflecting on the events of the weekend. I was really upset. 

I can't do this for another 40 years. And yet, I feel stuck. I'm supposed to go to work tomorrow and pretend I'm OK and put a brave face on, but I'm dying inside and I don't know what to do.

I have heaps of friends, but for what ever reason I still feel lonely. I have people that can make me happy and make me feel like I belong but some how it still feels like I never have anyone to go to and I’m alone. My friends alway seem to be out doing things without me. They always tell me
That I’m always welcome to come and I just need to say something, but most of the time I see it when they are out doing these things. They never just invite me to anything and when people do invite me out they always seem to flake on me. Same with if I try to invite people out. It’s always an excuse but maybe in a bit to then another excuse to why they couldn’t later. 

I have also made quite a lot of friends at my work and it’s always fun to hang out with them. But because I don’t really use Snapchat I seem to be out of the loop and they’re always posting on things like insta them all having fun.

When I had a girlfriend it didn’t really make me feel any better. A lot of the time I would try plan things with her and she would make an excuse. She would never come to mine or do anything I suggested. The only times we would hang out is at her house or when she planned something. And I also came to find out she would be constantly hanging out with other people too. She even admitted to not inviting me because “I’m not fun” and when I did ask to hang out with her and her friends they just rejected me. Thankfully I’m out of that toxic relationship now but it doesn’t make me feel any better

It just feels like I stay at home all day playing games like halo. It’s mind numbing and I feel like I’m just wasting my life away. I just want to go out and hang out with friends. My family calls me things like lazy and act like I just play video games all day. I guess my family isn’t wrong about playing games all day but it’s not like I don’t want to go out.

Some people tell me advice like “you gotta plan things yourself” which kinda works but never really goes anywhere other than the one night. Yes I do gotta keep planning more things and make it more regular and common but then people just start to flake on me and make up excuses. And it doesn’t help that my friends only know how to plan things when I have work (which just makes me look like a flake).

I do have online friends that I talk to and play games with regularly but that’s it. 

It just feels like everyone is out doing things without me and never inviting me.

Sorry if this doesn’t make sense or doesn’t belong or anything like that. I just kinda wanted to write something down and send it somewhere. I don’t really have anyone to talk to or anywhere to go.

I've been struggling with depression for many years, most possibly since I was a teenager; but I never searched for help until a few months ago when I finally started psychotherapy. And even then I am still feeling badly. I'm aware this takes ***a lot*** of time to fix — I just wish this pain would go away faster.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure if I want to do this just to vent, seek for some kind of suggestion or maybe because I wanted to share my life with other people who might have had any similar experiences as me; I simply feel like I should talk about it. I'll censor most names for the sake of privacy, both mine and of other people. **Additionally, this post WILL be LONG and includes some sensitive topics in some points and personal thoughts**. My apologies; I'll try my best to summarize as much as I possibly can, and skip some stuff.

&#x200B;

I had to move not once, but *twice* during my childhood and at the beggining of my adolescence. On both times it was on different countries, so making new IRL friends and keeping in touch with them was out of the question at that time.

&#x200B;

The first time I moved, I only made a couple of 'friends' on middle school. They only were interested in me because I was a hard working student, and my family and I would gladly help them study and do their homework for free. I didn't get any notice from them after I moved to the next country. Nonetheless I was lucky enough to have internet and I met some amazing friends online from this same country, who I still talk today.

&#x200B;

The second time I moved, it was rather.. difficult. I was 13. The language was not the problem because I already spoke it. The thing is, I had to adapt once again. Besides my parents and sister, there was no other family here. And I got into a class that they knew each other since they were in primary school. It was hard to fit in. Plus there were a classmate and other people that bully me occasionally.

I stopped caring about school. My grades were dropping as expected and although I had those online friends and my parents taking care of me, I was lonely. At 16, I ran away from home. Nothing made sense to me, I was feeling lost — school wasn't going well, I didn't have any strong connection; I even started to distance myself from my parents and it was the time I was also questioning my own sexuality.

It was overwhelming, yet I also acknowledged running away wasn't the solution so I went back home after a few hours, when some officers recognized me. Nothing bad happened in the end, my parents only made me go to a psichologist — which I should have gladly accepted, but I was quite reluctant and went only for a few appointments, thinking my issues would settle by themselves after some time. How dumb of me.

&#x200B;

After finishing high school, I wasn't sure of what I wanted to do. My grades weren't high enough, so college wasn't an option. I took a sabbatical and then decided to study a 2 year programming course: I met some cool friends, learned lot of new stuff and, for the first time in more than a decade, I celebrated my birthday. It looked like my life was starting to make sense: after many years, I felt people cared about me. My issues didn't go anywhere though, I was only repressing them and I was developing new ones, like excessive self-criticism and trying to not make mistakes, to be useful and perfect.

After the second year of this course, I went together with these friends on an internship on *another* (third) country. Things went good, and the headman made us a contract. He esentially promised us we would 'reach the top and become rich'. Of course nothing of that happened: we didn't get any task some days while other days they would ask us to develop new features as fast as possible.

I became alcoholic during this time I almost had an ethyl coma once. And I also accepted the offer to go to whores, so I could stupidly "prove myself" I was straight. Both of these things occurred because I couldn't say 'no'. I wasn't unable to refuse what my superior asked/offered me, or I couldn't draw my boundaries. I wanted to get along with everyone, to be accepted by everyone. To not be myself, but to not feel lonely anymore.

In the end, I couldn't handle all of this and I flight back home with my parents. **I felt like a total failure** for not being able to stand by myself and endure the situation. And after all of this, from one reason or another, over the time I distanced myself from these friends I made during this course, until I stopped talking with them.

&#x200B;

Another year wasted by taking a second sabbatical, and then I decided to study another course. During this time, I *finally* accepted the fact that I like men, and that there's nothing wrong with that. I started playing an online videogame and met new group of friends again. There was this guy I clicked with immediately, and.. I started developing some feelings towards him. He was already in a relationship with another guy, and I was fine with that because I was sure my feelings would have faded away. Except he broke up with his boyfriend after a few months.

I told him about how I felt, however he wasn't sure he would or could be able to reciprocate, plus he doesn't date guys he hasn't seen IRL. It was pretty understandable. Regardless of that, I still had my hopes high. I became a bit *obsessed*, thank god not in an exaggerated way, but still.. it **wasn't healthy** for anyone. I often checked whether he was connected in the voice channel, because I wanted to spend more time with him. I also wanted to spend some time with his friends too, I really enjoyed their company. And I wanted to know more about him as well, although I don't like to meddle in someone's life.

Another thing is, when I entered the voice channel, if we weren't doing anything all together, I would often stay silently for hours and for many reasons: I either didn't have anything to say or when I did, I wasn't sure if what I was going to say would be appropiate or make them laugh. They felt uncomfortable with that situation, so they created other private channels.

I was so dense to not see how I was behaving and I was feeling left out once again. This time, I think it was justified. So I took the decision to stop hanging out with them for the time being until I take care of myself, and told them I'd come only if they wanted to play stuff with me or if I wanted to. Because it was making them hide from me and it was making me feel bad. Because I believe it was the best decision to take.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I still have a slim hope that things will sort themselves after some time, that therapy will help me improve my self-esteem, solve my personal issues and how I interact with other people.

Nonetheless, I'm in pain and hurt. I'm not motivated on my work. I actually don't want to play any stuff anymore. The only thing I want to do is stay on bed and cry, possibly stop existing. I failed during many stages of my life, be it on a working-environment or with friendships, while I lost many years doing absolutely nothing. I'm just.. Lost and empty.

2 weeks ago I told a girl that I wanted to kill myself. She told her cousin which her mom works at the school we go to. The school calls my dad, and I explained it all to him. I told him not to tell my mom because I knew she wouldn't care. 2 weeks later she finds out because of my asshole of a brother told her. I guessed it right, she didn't care. She didn't bother to ask if I still want to kill myself or how long i've had depression. No, all she does is smack me, and tell me why i'm telling people this. I really want to kill myself even more now.

Have you ever felt like getting off all of them. Sometimes i feel like they remind me that i’m not ‘normal’ because i need like 3 different medications to get trough the day. I know they help me, they have been helping me. But sometimes, i just want to quit, to get an illusion that im mentally healthy, that everything’s good. Example: I wish I could go out and have a beer or two, be just ‘another person’. I don’t even like getting anything beyond ‘tipsy’. But these 2,5 years have been hard, so i kinda developed a false memory of these nights out being the best things that happend to me. Idk if i’m being coherent, but i hope someone understands.

TW mention of death of parent






I lost my beautiful mother to cancer a few months ago. My father is estranged and it was just me and my mum growing up. When she was dying in hospital, she made my in laws promise to look after to me, which they swore they would. However, it is becoming apparent that anytime I express grief (which I seldom do to them) they make it obvious that it's not interesting to them or cut me off. I  feeling like I "should be over it by now". I hoped I could count on them to act as parental figures to try to support me but it seems that support was only for a week or two at best. My problem is that I have nobody to talk to. I miss my mum so much it hurts and there's nobody looking out for me anymore. No mum to talk to. My husband tries to understand but he's frustrated that I have a low libido and don't want sex right now so that's put a wedge of hostility from him. My 2 best friends are both dealing with big life changes right now so I don't want to bother them. I need to talk to someone so badly but I've nowhere to go and whilst I've been anxious with ocd my whole life. This is the biggest dip of depression I've been in. I don't want to get out of bed. I'm crying every night. I'm so lost. Can someone please just comment so I don't feel so alone? Thanks

Honestly, idk wtf to think about not killing myself. Now that I’ve survived rock bottom I’m pretty much stuck cuz its not like there’s any reason to put an end to this shit anymore. I mean, don’t take this seriously, but shit; sometimes I wish I killed myself just so I could avoid the aftermath of everything that’s happened. Like, fuck me. This is some bulllllllshit.

M(23) , I do not know what to do. Depression is hitting me like train and when things are gettin little bit better , it hits me again and again.  For few years I am always trying to help my friends to find a love or achieve something , helping them with their relationships , schools, financial support, motivation speeches and so on. It drains my energy away, but I really want to help other people.  I am helping others but I can t help myself. When I was younger I used to study lot, was best student at high school.  Now I am in collage, but i am here stuck like in the prison for 3 years. I do not want to finish this damn school.

 But my stupid family around me is pushing me to it. I am Mentally bullied by them, "I will never die in peace when you will not graduate" , "You will  work forever  in the shop market" , "look at your cousins they are doctors and You just work in the shop" ... 

They never ask me about my feelings , my dreams , my goals... But my dream is having lovely wife and have a kids. I dont need to be dentist, programmer, doctor or teacher I just wanna be happy...


To be honest I never had a normal relationship before. Only once, one sided. 

Of course she comes back to her exboyfriend who abuse her. Because he was a "man". Like she said. I was only boy trapped in the male body. Yes ofcourse, but that boy literally saved her life, always stands up for her, got stabbed 2 times by some gypsy when he tried to rob her, found her job, she was conflict type so I had to defend her or beat guys who was tried to punch her cuz she was acting like bitch and all other shits I done for her.

My communication skills are not that bad. I think I am not even bad looking, I used to workout for 5 years straight. But everytime I try  to "date" some girl it ends in few days. Did not even obtain kiss. But I am just that kind of guy in the group who is acting like completely idiot, telling jokes , do stupid stuffs just to make them smile. This shit is my fuel to survive another day in this world. 

My mood is switching to depression from laughter in the number of second like 10 times per day or after masturbation. And every day it s getting worse and worse. I cant get happy from anything , I lost my way in the life, do not know what I want to do when I left schooI,  Covering pain with laughter is slowlly killing me.  Just wanna get a hug from someone after tought day, pat my head , whispering in my ear , I dont need sex I just wanna be loved.

Sorry for my english I study it for only 3 years, maybe I just wanted write myslef there to reduce my stress.

My life has become unbearable. My job ruined my mental hecalth and Im in a hopeless situation with no way out. I wish I could disappear. Nothing helps. I cant do anything because Im so tired and have no money. I just feel like Im gonna crack and explode at some point. All I want to do is sleep. I sleep through all my days off. I have zero motivation to cook or clean. The only source of joy  have is the Ball Python Im going to get and since its winter, its too dangerous to have her shipped to me now because she could freeze and that just makes it worse because its the one thing I have to look forward to. 

No one cares about how Im suffering. My family doesnt care. No one else cares.Im meaningless to everyone. I just want a different life.  Im reaching my breaking point and I cant stop it.

With every day that goes by studies feel less and less important. Right now I open a book and start listing the things I think I don't need to learn, and before I know it I've listed so many things that I just give up. Studying in general just feels like a complete waste of my time. I keep trying again and again but I lose any focus I had in just a minute or two and my mind wanders off to something else. I have an important test tomorrow (which starts a series of other tests), I haven't studied once this whole year and now 5 minutes are all I can muster before I lose interest and either go do something else or start thinking about something else.

Why aren't we just allowed to study what we want? Like learn the basics of all subjects and then choose 1 thing to go deeper into, why do I have to study so much material that I'm 90% never gonna need to use ever? This feels like a cliche "I was born in the wrong time (or generation, if you will)" scenario where the whole process of studying hasn't yet evolved to the point where I need it to be. I was never a good student to begin with but I had some basic curiosity. Now to me if something isn't immediately useful then it's not worth learning it.

Studies aside, even the things I do on my own just seem like nothing more than passing the time, as if I'm waiting for something to happen, or something to end. At this point I feel like I could give anything just to die...

I'm 19 and I'm struggling to get into college because of my motivation. I don't have a driver's license and struggled getting good grades in school. I graduated in 2019 and took a gap year so I can control and heal my mind from my mental health issues I faced during school. I was tormented constantly in middle school and high school because of my ADHD and autism, which gave me my depression and anxiety in the first place. I thought that maybe being at home for a year would work out for me but it's evident that my mother is worse than the bullies I've dealt with during school. It doesn't help either that my younger sister talks down to me and says I blame everything wrong with me and what I'm going through on everyone else.

I live in a very toxic household in a nuclear family. My mom constantly says that I feel sorry for myself. She always says that I'm selfish and I never think about anyone else. I'm tired of her saying that she understand what I'm going through even though she's a complete mess herself. For the past seven years, she micro-manages and heavily restricts me from the internet for no apparent reason. She says that everyone on the internet doesn't care about my problems and that I don't have time to be depressed and suck it up. 
I don't have any irl to speak of and I don't have any internet friends at all. I feel alone even when I'm around the family. Being around her is exhausting. She never takes responsibility for what she does or tries to improve her behavior or admit that she's wrong. My mom is emotionally abusive and sometimes threatens to burn my art supplies or take all of my electronics away if I forget to do a chore. She never takes what I say seriously. She keeps telling me to make friends but I can't since she barely allows me to go online or leave the house. I have to sneak around so I can have access to the internet. 

My depression and anxiety worsened during October and November ever since my great grandma died of a stroke. I fell into a deep depression after that and had dark thoughts after that. She told me that my depression is self-induced because of the fact that my grandmother died and that I need to move on.

I've constantly asked her about doing art commissions ever since I was 13 so that I can be independent but she either ignores me and walks off or she gives some stupid reason why I can't do  it. 

I isolate myself from my family so that I don't have to be around anyone. My mom made me dislike being around humans in general.

Tw: depression and suicidal thoughts. 

My boyfriend of almost 2 years is being extremely depressed and suicidal. Hes started smoking again, even. Not taking care of himself properly.

He's doing his best to push me away and break up with him. He's saying all these hurtful words that makes me question everything weve been through, but i still refuse to believe what hes saying right now. Hes told me that I'll be able to find someone else better and I'll move on quickly once he take away his life, which is clearly not the case 

 I tried asking him to get professional help... that I'll help him with the finances if his family wont help funding it... but he refuses to and tells me that hes fine. He's building up a wall between us and i do not want to ever lose him. I really dont know what to do anymore to him. 

I always give him my full support, i do love him so much and truly care for him but on the other hand I'm also getting tired, and struggling with my own mental challenges.... i dont want my heart broken by his words.

I really... just need tips on how to cope with this. I need strength as well...

Hello, i don’t know who to talk to anymore because I feel like I am boring my friends and girlfriend  with this type of stuff and I feel like no one cares anymore even though they obviously do care about my mental health and what I have to say. A month ago I never would’ve described myself as depressed, I always thought that I had to go to a doctor and get diagnosed by a profession before I knew if I was depressed or not because I didn’t want people to think I’m just faking it or some shit or offend people that actually have depression. Honestly I still arent 100% sure wether I’m depressed or not but my girlfriend said that the way that I have been behaving lately really resembles depression and anxiety, I have intrusive thoughts, sometimes I can’t stop shaking and my head has this feeling that I have never felt before and it aches, other times I feel empty and hollow and detached from my feelings, I can’t even feel anything towards my girlfriend sometimes even though I know deep down that I love her so much but it’s frustrating that I can’t feel the love that I have for her. I am constantly in a shit mood where I just feel like no one likes me and get into what I can only describe as a self destructive mindset where I’m just tempted to end every friendship I have and my relationship for absolutely no reason other than “I am feeling bad”. I don’t even understand my own thoughts, feelings and I can’t even form my own opinion anymore my chest and head feel hollow, I have no motivation to do anything and I doubt/second guess/overthink everything that I think or say, even the simplest things while having a normal conversation with somebody who’s very close to me. I don’t know what is happening to me, I feel like it might be related to drug use, although I didn’t do any of that stuff nearly as much as some other people that I know and when I did it I, which I rarely did, I didn’t do much of anything, I have stopped doing any drugs or substances since. If it helps with answers or anything I am a 17 year old male idk how or why that would help but yea... I don’t really have a question or anything but any advice on how to get past this or something would be really really appreciated.

Hello everyone, I don't know if this is the right place to post this and I apology in advance if it isn't.

My academic life was never too good to begin with, but I feel that since covid broke out things have really started to fall apart. I attend a cultural heritage course in the university near my home town in southern Italy, the first three years were not too bad, I guess, I managed to pull off 4 out of 7 exams each year. Three-year courses in Italy are averagely made of 21 exams in total, with the credits per exam ranging from 6 to 12, the average being 9. A 9-credit exam, at least in my university, consists in 3.000+ pages of mandatory reads and several hours of classes, and then a 20-40 minutes oral interview with the professor. If you fail an exam, you have to wait for the next session (almost 3 months) to try it again. Most of the professors are very strict and easy to upset, they can make you fail an exam because of that one single silly question you didn't particularly look up. It has not happened to me in person, but it's not rare to see students cry or having an emotional breakdown during examination sessions because a teacher has started yelling or calling them names for them not knowing how to answer a question. A lot of them tried turning to authorities for verbal abuse but the police doesn't really care about this kind of matters because of our fuck\*d-up "me ne frego" mentality. 

Not to mention that the taxes are pretty high, and they didn't get a lowering or a delay even though we're in a global pandemic and we're attending classes from home. Since the pandemic outbreak I only passed 2 exams, my mood has become very unstable because of all the factors mentioned above, plus the fact that I can't see my friends, I can't go to the gym, I can't go to the mountainside and I can't have any hobbies outside of watching TV or playing videogames. The pressing from my parents has always been there, but lately has become unbearable. They have doubled their work schedules to overcome the financial crisis and they're always stressed out, even though I'm helping them at work. All they tell me in our free time is that I'm not studying enough, that it's my fault if I don't pass the exams and I shouldn't blame the teachers or the global situation, that I only care about spending time with my girlfriend (yes, the law permits us to have a one-time visit to a close one each day, that's why I usually stay at her place when I'm off from work). 

Tomorrow morning I have an exam, and the thought just won't stop obsessing me. I only managed to study 2 hours in the past week, because just the idea of sitting on a chair and reading up a cr\*p-load of papers over and over and then failing because of a single stupid question just makes me sick (I already failed this one exam in November). I seriously just want to quit and I don't remember why I wanted to pursue this path in the first place. When I finished high school I wanted to become a psychologist, but my parents persuaded me in choosing biology instead because they own an analysis lab. I absolutely hated it and quit after a few months, the next year I ended up signing for cultural heritage because it was the closest course to my high school background (I went to an artistic high school) and it sounded quite comforting to me, having previous knowledge of almost any subject. Going deeper in university I matured the idea of attending a counseling course after my graduation, pursuing a profession which is close to my original dream job, but it only looks like a distant hope at the moment and I feel like I have to move mountains to eventually (possibly) get there. The thought of spending at least 3 years more studying, living with my parents, without any personal income except the money they give me for my work at the lab scares the sh\*t out of me. Not to mention that my mood swings have started to negatively impact my relationship lately.

My alternative to the academic/counseling career would be writing. I love reading books, watching TV shows, playing games with deep narrative, and I always feel like I have a volcano of ideas in my mind but I can't put them to paper because I have no free time. Do any of you feel the same? Do you think that university here is legitimately very hard or is it just me being lazy? What do you think I should do? I know the choice is ultimately up to me but I really would like some feedback from strangers that are emotively detached from the sitaution to help me see things more clearly. Thanks for the read.

This is more of a vent than anything, because I don’t feel like I can talk to my friends about it and because I obviously can’t talk to my now ex, but to keep it quick (since I know anyone reading this already has a life and probably doesnt care much about mine), my friend died on January 12th, who I met through several other friends who all worked with him. I know this whole group of people through my roommate, who was dating said friend, and when she called me to tell me what happened we were both in tears (called because in early December I moved back in with my family after graduating from uni, I’m roughly 3,000mi away now). I haven’t heard much from them since and I realize they were all closer to him than I was, but I found out his funeral was today - not because any of them told me - but because one of them posted the memorial card from his service on their Snapchat story. I’ve been crying for days and I feel like an idiot because no one told me and since no one told me I guess I shouldn’t be as sad as I am, because I’m obviously not seen as someone who gets to know about when his fucking funeral is. 

On an entirely different note, I had been informally seeing a guy for the past few months but knew it wasn’t working out, and since I moved about a month ago it’s only been getting more difficult. When my friend died it highlighted even more of our differences and I got to the point where I was too emotionally exhausted to keep trying when I already knew the relationship wasn’t working out, and it seemed wrong to keep it going just to have him as a crutch for my grief. 

Anyways, now I’m alone in my room and I feel like a fucking idiot because it seems like I’m delirious for thinking I was entitled for any info about the friend that just passed away, and it seems like I’m an unloving bitch for ending things with someone who had been begging me to make things work. I feel like a piece of shit and I just want to forget I exist tonight.

Thank you if you’ve read this far, I just feel exceptionally lonely right now and wanted to find a place to vent.

I’ve been on Celexa 20mg for many many years and my depression has been under control. I wanted to give Wellbutrin a try because I’ve read that it may also help with my ADHD. My doc wants me to stay on Celexa as I adjust to the Wellbutrin XL 150mg.

I’m only on day three and out of no where I feel horribly depressed and sad like I haven’t in a long time. Is this normal, will this pass? Why is this happening if I’m still taking my Celexa?

I’ve been feeling like this for a while and figured it would be nice to just get it off my chest. Ever since I was little I’ve noticed that I never had an interest in anything. I never fully grasped the importance of things. So when I started school I was mediocre at best. I suppose I did decent the first two years of middle school but once I reached 8th grade and into high-school I was a mess. I never did school work and just thought it was all meaningless. While at the same time my childhood friends where in advanced classes and where doing very well. I was falling behind so I decided to homeschool in order to be able to graduate early and also on time. I managed to do that and had graduated 2 years early. My original plan was to go to community college and study to become a physical therapist assistant. But I ended up withdrawing from my prerequisite classes. I decided to take a year off and get a job. Those didn’t last long either. My money management skills where horrendous too. I decided to take those prerequisites again but ended up failing half of my classes. Meanwhile my friends where almost finishing up school and already buying there first cars. 

That was in 2018 fast forward to now. I’m going to finally take the entrance exam to see if I get accepted into the program but I’m very afraid I’m going to fail. I haven’t studied even though I should. I try to study but then I begin to doubt my self and think back on all the negative things and I just become paralyzed with fear. It hurts really bad seeing people my age go to college and even my friends getting accepted into schools while I’m here struggling. My parents went to college and some of my family members did too it hurts me knowing I can’t do something as basic as that all because I just couldn’t grasp the importance of it. 

Although I’m 20 I feel like my life will amount to nothing since I’ve had so many great opportunities wasted. If I would have taken school seriously I would have been a physical therapist assistant by now. Apart from that all of my friends have their own cars and steady jobs and great credit. I just feel like I’m so behind and that I’m not going to catch up anytime soon. 

I guess what frustrates me the most is how everyone seems to have this spark or sense of meaning. That has helped them with school and other things in life. I’ve never gotten that spark I’ve even asked people what motivates them or why did they do it but they couldn’t answer my question. This has been on my mind for a while but as I get older I feel like I’m running out of time and it scares me.

So I’ve been on Prozac for over a year and have literally had zero interest in sex. It’s horrible and can’t imagine it’s healthy to not ejaculate for weeks and months. Anyway I got myself on Tadalafil for a month so that watching porn would get me hard and I’m forcing myself to have a wank every day. I can tell you that my mood is better and I feel better about myself. So even if you are like me and have very little libido give this a try and it slowly starts to help things.

Like the title says, I'm(14f) thinking that it'd probably be best for me and my mental health to go back to the mental hospital and sort some things out.

I've had issues with self harming for a number of years now and I've never stopped for longer than maybe 2 months. I've started up again and am starting to worry that if I don't address it now I'll only continue to get worse. My cutting has gotten bad and is crossing over into borderline addiction. I've noticed that no matter how much I do I still never think it's enough but I'm starting to think that it's probably way worse than I realize. 

I admitted to my therapist that I had been cutting again when I was pretty high and have emailed her about it a few times. She asked me "What do you feel like you need to best support you right now?" And I've really been thinking about that. The thought of going back to the mental hospital has been on my mind so this isn't an impulse decision sort of thing.

So, simple. Right? I just need to tell my mom and get myself admitted into the mental hospital. Simple really.

Nope.

I've never been very open with my family, it's always been hard for me to talk with them about my personal affairs in a serious manner. I know that going to the mental hospital would be good for me, probably the best thing for me to do for my mental health right now. I just dont know how to go about bringing this up to anyone. I don't know how they might react so I'm hesitant to say anything at all. Plus, no one knows that I've been cutting. I dont know if my family could afford me going to the mental hospital or if they could mentally handle the fact that I've been cutting myself. I want to look out for them but I also know that I really need to care about myself and do what's best for me and my mental health. I need to take care of myself too. I'm not sure what to do and honestly any advice at all would be greatly appreciated. 

If you wound up reading this far then thank you for hearing me out and I hope you have an amazing rest of your day/night <3

For 5 years now I've worked a job full-time. And for the majority of those 5 years the thought has lingered in the back of my mind that trying to cope with the lifestyle is driving me into a deeper pit.

Yet.. I continued to do it, day by day. And only now have I reached a point where I'm unable to focus, where there is genuine concern for productivity on the company's side, and where I feel like enough is enough.

Ultimately I don't think I'm 'well' enough to work anymore.. It's simply too much. And no amount of words can really convey just how bad a state my head is in, and just how heavy on my mind it is when I 'have to' work every day of the week.

I'm at a point where I feel enough is enough, and I need to take what contributes so much excess stress & pressure to where I can't cope anymore and put it aside; in this case, my job.

What I want is to be out of work for a while whilst I get better... Having spoken to a psychiatrist I've had an initial diagnosis of Mixed Anxiety & Depressive Disorder.. With a further suggestion of yet unconfirmed Bipolar Disorder. Work knows about this. They don't care, and why should/would they?

I live at home with my father, I'm 25, have been in this job for 5 years.. And could probably get by with the drop off of income... Although yeah, less nice things. I'm obese, and have unhealthy coping habits that I need to work on.

Meanwhile, at work, there's significant stress & pressure because of the workload our team has.. But there's always a significant workload.. Though still I find it difficult to not blame myself for being the reason colleagues will likely have to pick up the slack... But even if I wanted to help, I know that I can't anymore..

My parents seem onboard with getting out of work to get better... My plan consists of firstly eliminating that work stress & pressure, having more time & motivation to exercise, time to maybe get back into hobbies, and also to find passion in something once lost.. I used to be passionate about programming but the industry I work in, role, & full time lifestyle has taken it away. Maybe with more time I could shift that passion once again to something I do wanna do, like maybe developing my own video game.. It could be cool.

I just feel like a failure regardless though.. Like in the eyes of society I'll be nothing. I'll be letting work down, my boss, colleagues even... But I don't know what else to do.

I live in the UK, so I dunno... I guess sick leave should be the first step while I think about handing my resignation in (if work doesn't sack me).

I'd appreciate any input / opinions / etc.. Especially if you've had to take a similar route and how it impacted you, whether it was worth it, any advice, etc..










[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz9yc5/i_look_forward_to_sleep_more_than_ever_before/
I try to get up and do things every day, but doing anything feels like climbing a mountain.

Nothing brings me pleasure. I go out to eat at my favorite restaurant, going for walks, hanging with friends. It's nice, but I don't feel anything from it. I don't even play videogames anymore because I don't see the point.

A week ago, I got prescribed Wellbutrin, but it had the opposite effect, as well as horrible side effects. I didn't eat for two days, didn't sleep for two days, got very irritable, and felt worse. I stopped them, and my psychiatrist still hasn't gotten back to me about what new medicine to take. I just want to get better.

Its weird for people to think I'm fine because I act fine around them, but I feel like I'm drowning, is the best way to explain it.

I should get my new medication tomorrow though, so fingers crossed on this one.

Sleep is the most pleasant part of my life right now, as long as I don't have sad dreams about my ex. I keep having dreams where we're back together, but it's the past, like I time traveled. And we're doing a thing we did months or a year ago or something. It's actually nice until I wake up, then I'm flooded with sadness.

I just keep reminding myself that things get better with time. Just gotta let time do its thing I guess.

Not sure why I'm posting this, but it feels good to scream into the void. Validates my feelings or something I guess. Who knows.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz950b/my_story/
Who was gonna tell me that at my age I would try many times suicide? I'm Lucas and I am 14 years old. It all started being 7 years old when they changed my life forever. My parents told me that I will be changing school. They brought me to a "school" (basically a hospital) because of my Asperger problem. Dude, that was a fucking torture for me. Whenever I cry, they hold me so strong that I cried so hard, and then they left me in a small room for 30 minutes. It's hard for me to talk or write about this. In that period of time, I just wanted to commit suicide to stop suffering that torture of being alone with my mind and thoughts. When I remember all of this situation I just feel so bad. 

Then, high school. With no friends, serious Asperger problems, and suicidal thoughts, I entered for the first time. The first day, the first problem. A group of kids that I wanted to enter just mocked me and hurt me. Day after day that will happen until today. I got diagnosticated depression in December. I was crying in my class because I told one boy that I needed help. He mocked me (what a surprise) and I started crying. The highschool called 112 (emergency number in Spain) and they put me to sleep. 

Today, I feel bad, if just some of you can tell me what's good in this life. I don't remember anything but a horrible experience that I caused to my loved family

Today i had a weird but pleasant situation. I met a kid with whom i work with and his father. And for a big surprise, after some 10 or 15 minutes, just observing how kids father talks, how he acts, i felt this weird sense of fatherness.

Im 30, a grown up men with many childish stuff in me and huge, deeply seated depression for about 15 years where i dont even hope of getting out, its just who i am. I have been drinking and smoking weed for years. I stopped a year ago cause hit an ultra low point. For the first time, in this random situation, i just felt how would it be to have a good father. In my therapy most attention i have been given to my relationships with my mother, the father was...just somewhere- working or being drunk and abandoning me.

For the first time i felt that a good father to me would be this person with whom i could feel really, really safe, he will take care, he will handle. I would feel strong cause i have a back. I never felt these things. Now i see how small, how scared i actually am and many of my behaviors are just to compensate these things. A good father to me would be a kind and protective, encouraging but at the same time he would be disciplined, he would push me to do my best, he would tell me things straight but with compassion. Idk, it just felt so good. An experience of a father which i never had. It makes me sad but curious.

Does anyone have some other or the same experiences with fathers? What do you think what kinda role a father plays in ones psyche? Do you think is there a connections between a lack of father and depression and addiction?

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz528b/last_week_i_let_my_parents_know_about_how_i_was/
After writing this, I realize how long it turned into a bit of an essay, so for that I am sorry. It just felt good to write it, so I kept going. 

I just want to preface this with how much this sub has helped me. Seeing other people’s stories I’ve struggled with depression and especially anxiety for what feels like my whole life, but it was always something I was uncomfortable talking about as I have a hard time describing the feeling. It’s like total emptiness, like I missing something that I won’t ever be able to find. 

This last year was especially hard for me as I chose to take a college gap year due to covid. At the time of the outbreak, I was working a job at a restaurant, but unfortunately I very quickly got laid off as the lockdown started. From there it was a downward spiral for me. My job, especially after I graduated, was my only motivation to get up, get out. 

Soon after I lost the job, I lost the will to get out of bed. I would sleep (or lie in bed) 14-18 hours a day, only getting up to eat a meal or play the occasional video game. I stopped taking care of myself. Things I used to enjoy just didn’t matter anymore. 

It wasn’t long before my parents noticed my absence around the house. I’m not sure what they thought of it at first, as they met me with anger. I really really struggle in maintaining a healthy sleep schedule even today, so I think they partially thought it was me shooting myself in the foot intentionally. 

Everything came to a head about a week ago. My parents pulled my upstairs and listed the looooong list of concerns they’ve noticed about my actions, and questioned why I would make so little effort. They thought (probably with good merit) that the reason I slept all day was because of late night gaming. 

It was awful sitting there and seeing how concerned they were about me, so I told them. I told them everything. It was really, really, really difficult. I’ve always bottled up my emotions, so when I let them all out, I really let them all out. I cried, and they cried. Its hard to describe the relief I felt when I saw their We talked for a few hours, in which time they pressured me into seeking some help. 

In the days following, my mom especially changed. Thinking about it now, it makes me want to cry. The following day, I came up into the kitchen to find she had done hours or research for me. She had filled a notebooks with things like possible medications, local therapists, how to console someone who doesn’t want to be consoled. I’m blowing away by the support she especially is showing me.

While I have yet to go to my first session, letting someone I love know about my issues has lifted a huge weight off my back. It’s definitely not like letting someone know has instantly cured my depression, god knows I’ve had a pretty rough last few days, but I feel better knowing that one day I’ll be able to get out of this. I really do encourage anyone struggling like I am to reach out to someone, it’s scary but unbelievably relieving.

I was appreciating myself and my body particularly this morning. I think my 9 year old self would’ve been left in shock if that’s how I’d turn out.

This is why I believe this is evidence of just how much society forces us to undervalue ourselves and strive for flawless perfection which by rights is completely unachievable. 

Just because it *looks* as though the “hotter” people on this earth are having a better time of it. Do not automatically assume this means their life is better. Remember they probably have the opposite issues of people only using them for money,fame,sex etc etc and they are probably looking over their shoulders every five minutes.

At least we do get to live free from that and have a chance of finding our real and raw identities because we are not lost in the shadows of greed, genetics, inheritance and fortune.

Dont get me wrong, im far from "ok" but when im with her I feel like all the pain and all the suffering is gone for that little while, until she leaves again.

I tried literally every anti-depressant and anxiety (including medications that aren't primarily ones but are sometimes used for it), and none of them worked, or they made me feel worse.  We literally ran out of options.  That was back in 2011 and I haven't taken any since.

Have any new ones been developed since then?  I've of one that is a form of ketamine, but are there any others?





[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzcb36/looking_for_med_recommendations/
I've tried Zoloft and Prozac. Zoloft gave me a constant migraine and the jitters every day I took it, and Prozac made me gain 20% of my body weight, total sexual dysfunction, hand tremors, and an unstoppable urge to snack even when I'm so full I feel ill. 

I will eventually go to my doctor - when I know exactly what I want to try. He is a arrogantly ageist and unhelpful but there is such a shortage of family doctors in my are I cannot just switch to another.

So if you have a success story about finding an antidepressant that works for you, I would appreciate it if you would share!

(20f) I've put a lot of energy and time into fighting my depression. This past year was all perfect even during corona, but during summer I had to kive out of my place and had to start a new life in a new town where I dont know nobody. I saw myself relapsing again so I started to go to a therapist and I decided to go back to college so at least I could entertain myself.
It hasn't worked and I've relapsed again.

My parents left me when I was 15, so I've always had to fight for myself. For me going to college has been a lot of hard work as I manage my school life with my work to pay my rent.

But guess what? I dont like what I m studying, I dont like the life I'm living. Why I couldnt have people who cared for me? Why they left me and why I must live now like this because of them??

I keep on trying ( I do have that do what i want mindset) but there are no results and even if I try to go for my goals everything seems as a setback. 

And if it were for me I would try to fight again. But a thought came into my mind 'that I'll never achieve anything'.

I'm so lonely and nothing seems to be good right now. 
Even the purposes that I worked hard to get are no longer of my liking.

How to stop thinking that you have to prove yourself to your bullies?

I’ve come a very long way in my self improvement journey but there is one hiccup I cannot seem to get over. In my childhood, I was severely bullied in middle school. I felt very small, wrong, powerless and threatened. After finishing high school in our small town, I moved to a metropolitan city many regard as having “made it”, attended a prestigious university, made new friends, was on national television and showed everything off on my social media. At first it worked, I felt better and my old horrible classmates stalked my every move. I felt a lot of satisfaction from that because it felt like productive revenge. After lockdown I had to return to my town to live with my parents and finish my 3rd year online and decided to delete all my social media because I was tired of proving to others that I wasn’t a loser - but still being in my hometown I have this irrational fear of running into my bullies again, them still viewing me as a loser and me feeling as small and helpless as back then. It’s like all my rationality shuts off in this flight or fight response. I don’t want to feel this way. 

Any advice? \u2764\ufe0f

I’m sick of people saying “it gets better” and giving useless positivity when the reality is, that for a lot of people, it simply doesn’t.

I’m 20 years old and I can safely say I don’t see my life getting better any time soon. I will probably still be in the same situation in ten years. My life is going to be long and shitty, that’s if I don’t end it myself early.

I wish people were just honest and told people that life can suck for people. I don’t want to hear the same shit over and over. Honesty would be nice every once in a while.

It always happens. I don't want to live like that.

&#x200B;

I want someone to see me as more.

&#x200B;

It will never happen.

I just feel so lonely it’s very hard to make friends and I have no one to vent too I feel like I don’t belong in this world I’m keeping so much in from being molested as a child to not having anyone care about my day or just if I’m okay I suffer from nightmares and panic attacks and depression I barely have anyone that will stay up with me when I’m having a hard night or I’m waking up screaming and crying and shaking from my nightmares ... I feel like ... I’m sorry to bother anyone \U0001f622

Just tired of having no one to talk to so thought id try posting on here to see if it made me feel any better.

Im 31 now and have suffered from severe depression and other mental health issues since I was around 12 / 13. Im currently having a bad spell and feeling utterly hopeless, self harming, and constantly thinking about suicide. 

I work a job that has no fulfilment or reward whats so ever. I live on a friends sofa and have done for the last 7 years. The love of my life left me and things between us at the moment are like a nightmare. I smoke £20 of weed a day and take a minimum of 360mg of codeine as im completely hooked and get awful withdrawals without them. I cant see my life getting any better. All i feel is sadness and loss and regret and guilt. I could have been anything. And no matter how hard I try I cant change. Its how I lost my wife. My friends. My jobs. My mind. Everything. The loneliness is killing me and I just want to feel normal. How the fuck do people get past this and say they can look back and smile and end up happy? What do I have to do?

How do you explain Depression to someone who has never been depressed? 


Regardless of age. 
I have come across people around my age 20’s, to people in their 80’s that have stated that they have never been depressed . 


Depression is like an inside joke. You would have had to have been there to get it.

I’ve been in the process of becoming divorced over the last few months and was pretty blindsided by the whole thing. I sign the last of the paperwork on Monday and then we’re done.

Everyday is a battle not to kill myself. Today I broke down and I felt like I was so close to doing it. Instead decided to take a shower first see if that helps. Cant die with dirty dishes in the sink so let’s take care of those first. I can’t die with a basket full of laundry. I’m worried that I’m going to run out of momentary distractions and I’ll finally just be done. It’s especially hard because I have a three day weekend because of MLK day so I have one more day home alone without the distraction of work.

The best I’ve been able to do is maybe set an expiration date for myself. “If I still feel like this in six months then do it, but until then I just need to power through it.” I’m worried that it’s just going to take one bad day and it’ll all be over.

I created my YouTube Channel, serveral years ago and I'm about to hit 100 subscribers but they keep unsubbing. I tried my best to be entertaining but I don't have the money to do it, so I chose to do Vlogs instead.
I wanted to talk about different topics or just make quick videos of me goofing around but nothing..

Then, I see reaction channels get millions of subscribers and I just get mad because they do nothing but ass on their butts and steal someone else's videos but nobody wants to support someone like me who really needs the love and support.

People don't want to give me a chance it just adds on to my depression because I just want people to support me. If I could have that, I'd be happy \U0001f623
I'm tired of nobody loving me...
Maybe, the people that told me to disappear was right...
I'm a waste of life....

i've found a new low in the past months and i'm only snowballing as the days go by.

talking to a psychiatrist or anyone else in this country is difficult enough. mental health professionals here are either out of touch or just straight up biased and just not.. good, at all.

for context i live in the philippines and it's a shithole for mental health care.

attempts at calling free lines for suicide only aggravate my desire further because its filled with people who will tell you to pray or tell you to talk to a friend or some other altruistic, \\positive thinking\\-esque suggestion. 

i want to die

whenever I see people posting about loneliness they always mention having few number of friends , however , that is not the case with me , my phone is usually full of messages and I hope i dontsound full of myself but I thunk it is because I might be likeable in general , my problem is that my mom left when i was 11 and from that time i dont trust people to stay , no matter how close and caring they are , I just cant bring myself to trust them , and this distrust causes some sort of gap in the friendship which leads to loneliness and honestly this feeling is so tiring .

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzb9a8/stuck_in_a_cycle/
I can't have friends anymore. I have become so bitter and angry and jealous that I can't be happy for friends anymore. I hate myself more when I try so hard to change my circumstances and then see people I know achieve my goals without even trying.

I have lost and regained the same five pounds for the past month. I lose the weight and then something happens and I sabotage my progress. Either I just pig out for no reason, or I get depressed and I eat emotionally. I can't do it anymore. I have tried to lose weight for 20 years. And now I'm back to where I started and I can't do it again.

I also feel like I have started all over again with my career. I was working so hard to achieve the career I wanted and then the pandemic hit. I lost my job and now I'm stuck at a Call Center hating life and hating the job. I get yelled at everyday by customers and then get criticized by my bosses for every little detail. But every time I try and get a new job, I don't even make it past the first step. I never get the interview. I'm always "not selected" for further consideration.

And yet, a lot of my former friends were able to reach their weight loss goals during the pandemic. They shed those pounds because they had no excuse. I see people I know state that they are going to start looking for a new job and get one within a week.

I'm going to give up. I'm going to give up on life because I'm tired of trying and always failing. I won't find love. I won't lose weight. And I won't get a good job that pays well. I'm not destined for that. So I should just take myself out of the equation all together. It's the only way to end the cycle.

Ok so, this is my first time posting here, so don't go too harsh on me please. 


I'm 18, and a few weeks ago I've been diagnosed with depression after 10 or so years, and since then I've been taking antidepressants everyday. 4 months ago, I lost my grandpa due to a heart attack, and I believe this has influenced very negatively my depression. I had never been suicidal until 1 month ago. It all started with worse thoughts than usual such as "You shouldn't even be alive", "Why don't you just kill yourself? You'd be more famous dead than alive anyway", "Do everyone a favor and just end your life, please" and so on. 3 days ago I tried to kill myself, I wanted to cut my arm so that I'd die due to bleeding, but I didn't make it... I couldn't even had the courage to do what I was supposed to do. Now I have to live with a scar that'll remind me of that time I failed at killing myself. I failed everyone, I've always done that. I've always hurt and pissed off people who tried to help me out of pity. I'm just worthless, I should've been gone long time ago, and now that I had the chance to finally find peace I couldn't make it... I don't have any friends, and I've trust issues due to past relationships. The current classmates I have, they try to act kind, polite and ready to help you whenever you need them, but then as soon as I try to give a sign, they just ignore it... while they all show affection and love towards one another sharing hugs, kisses on the cheeks and other gross shit. I just wish I could get some affection too, but I guess I'm just asking too much. Who'd love a person like me anyway? I'm just a failure to everyone. I just wanna die, I can't bare with this pain anymore...


Sorry for this rant, had to get shit off my chest...

Life is not worth living if you don’t have any goals. And I don’t mean that in the sense of “I want a house in the future”, “ I want to be a doctor” “I want to make it on the Forbes list”. But if you are unable to achieve your goal, life is not worth living. If you have not achieved the goal, and you literally cannot as hard as you try, *life is not worth living.*

Of course your biology won’t let you die so easy, but I think psychologically the fact of living is no longer justifiable.

I just joined this group. I’ve been in a deep, deep depressive state for 2 1/2 years. Everyone is just about done with me. All I can do is talk about how sad I feel and how much emotional and physical pain I’m in. I TRY to keep my complaining to a minimum. I really do. But, it’s takes over every part of my life. 
Is there an app or a program where I can reach out to someone, someone anonymous where I can just dump all of my baggage on? I feel like if this goes on much longer, I’m going to drive everyone away. I’m pretty much left with my spouse now, the rest of my friends have either left or I’ve left them because I know how much of a burden I am to them. I don’t want my husband to leave. He promises me he will never leave me. He says he adores me and will never tire of me or feel burdened by me.  But, I don’t want to take that chance. 
Suggestions? I really need help.

I've done nothing, I've watched things pile up, watched the house go to shit, and I've just done nothing. I've hidden from it. Everything was too much and I thought about ending it all. I thought I was setting a horrible example for my kids. (Which I was)

But I've managed to pull myself out of it, even if it's temporary. Today I showered, tidied up, got rid of so much rubbish, washed up and prepped tea well in advance and it's cooking now. And at a reasonable time.
All while looking after the kids and helping them with what school work I could actually help them with! 

And it feels good. I feel like I've accomplished something. 
I feel like I'm setting a better example for my kids. 

I'm not sure how long this high will last, so thought I'd write it all down now, before I start feeling like crap and second guessing everything I've done.







[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzb190/bupropion_users_what_antidepressants_have_worked/
Hi y'all! I have been on bupropion for like 8 months now and I really like it. I started with fluoxetine (Prozac) and had side effects//it didn't really do much for me, and then took both together, but quickly dropped fluoxetine totally to just take bupropion. Recently, I've been having a lot more physical symptoms of depression creep back into my life (eating/sleep issues, fatigue), and according to some psychiatrists I know, these increased "neurovegetative" symptoms signal a need to change up antidepressant regimen. 

I'm curious for the bupropion users: **What combo of drugs do y'all take, and for anyone who has taken bupropion alone at some point, how has that combo been different?** Particularly interested in people who have ADHD and/or depression, and those who have combined bupropion with something other than an SSRI (or I guess if you've had like super stellar experiences with a specific SSRI -- I am just hesitant to try them again).

A bit about me that might be helpful to contextualize: I have ADHD, depression and complex PTSD, and am in therapy. I've previously taken adderall, but never regularly (only as-needed) and never with bupropion. I work in medicine and for that reason my psychiatrist gives me a lot of control in choosing my drugs, so I'd love to hear some testimonials to inform my decisions!

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzax8f/_/
I never feel anything. But if I do feel something its only negative feelings like anger, hate, stress, sadness, loneliness but I'm too numb to feel lonely usually. I miss those days when I could smoke weed and not get pyschosis and paranoia. I fucked my brain with taking too much pyschedelics. I cant get pleasure from any substance now. Fuck. Money doesn't motivate me. I don't need anything really. I cant keep doing this life thing. 

Also anytime I see my parents it irritates the fuck out of me. Most sounds just piss me off in my house. I get irritated so quickly I just wanna snap and hurt myself and sometimes my family (but I have self control not to hurt them) . I have really bad anger issues and its a cycle. Ill be feeling numb which is considered OK for me. Then ill see my mom and just say rude shit I can't help it. I hope I burn in hell after this life.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kzau7l/help_with_some_discussion_questions/
Hi guys, so I’m part of an organisation lead by some young people. We are doing a series on mental health and are kind of struggling to think of discussion questions to have in our first round table discussion on depression. We do not want it to be just about the signs and symptoms, but we want to get deep into the whole aspect of depression and discuss and ask questions that will lead people to a great understand at the emotional level.

So if you could help me we questions, statements and anything else that you think would be good for deeper discussion on depression. I’m looking for 4-5 good questions that will open up people and really get us talking beyond the superficial level.

Also, if you have an experience to share that you wouldn’t mind me sharing (anonymously of course) that would be awesome. 

Thanks in advance

I’ve been suicidal since I was 7-8 years old and honest to God I did not expect to be 28 years old. I, and like many others, believed I would’ve killed myself by now, but I didn’t. I would’ve done it if I had a place to go and do it so no one would find me, but every time I tried I got set back. And even when I was actively looking for a place and a way to get there, I tried really hard to be normal - or do what you’d expect 20-somethings to do, but I failed hard and miserably at that. 

I don’t know why I’m still here, I’m just a burden to my family who has to deal with me; and I know I’m just a drag to them. I’m not good at anything, even though I tried hard to learn and get my head into things that interest me, but none of it worked out or stuck. I don’t know what it is I’m supposed to do. I’m awful at everything, I’m not smart, I’m not pretty, I have nothing to offer anyone, I’m sick all the time (both physically and mentally), I’m not a good person, and everyone says I’m mean and rude and have a bad attitude, when I try really hard to be tolerable and kind and go out of my way to do and give things to everyone. I’m a pile of human garbage that my family has to put up with until I die and lift the weight off their shoulders. I’m like a house pet that my family is too busy or unable to put down, so they’re forced to live with it.


I really just don’t want to be here anymore. I’ve overstayed my welcome and the guilt and urge to leave is overwhelming.

I started a new medicine a couple of weeks ago, and it's making me feel terrible. I feel nauseous at least half of the day,that wirking is nearly impossible. I take an hour break after our daily session to go to sleep as it is unbearable (we are in a lockdown so I work from home).
I hate telling my boss I'm always sick and feel bad. I hate that i feel so bad. It was really hard to get this job and I'm afraid I'm gonna screw this up,even though I like the work and people.
I hate this ilness, I hate fighting everyday just to survive the simplest tasks. I hate always having to worry the I'm gonna screw things up.

I feel like I can't really talk about it with anyone, as they wouldn't understand. Even though my parents try to be supportive, they still tell me things like 'you can't be sick so much, they are gonna fire you if you keep this up', like I don't know that and anxious about it all the time.

I know that the sude effects will end sometime, but I have no idea when, and this lockdown is horrible for me (I moved back to my parents so I won't be alone), and I feel bad about the way I look and the way I am.

I just hate this so much, and had to tell someone that would understand...

Hi people! 
So I don’t have motivation any ambitions, dreams or goals for real at this point I am waking up to go to work trying not to get fired and back home. Video games does not give any fun anymore at all.
Anything I try to learn I quit after 1-3 months feeling 0 or any joy.
I can’t quit my job because I’m renting apartment with my Girlfriend and we have dog + months payments for stuffs like car and phones.
My question is how to push my self to have more? 
I don’t want to live pay check to pay check...
But I have 0 energy to even try to do something... it’s even hard to make food Sometimes I lie to my Girlfriend what I ate something but in reality I did not for 2-3 days I honestly don’t even feel hungry \U0001f9d0
Trying to pretend what I am happy smiling and stuff but inside I’m crying.
How to deal with life and strike for more?
Or I am just good for nothing and should accept my reality? 
Maybe eventually I will take my life away but now I just can’t because I still have family.

Thanks if anyone have an idea.

And I feel selfish because I'm financially stable and physically healthy. Should be happy where I am right?

There isn't much to look forward to in the world. Work, come home, repeat. I can't think of joy in that even if you enjoy a job because things are meaningless in this world. I don't know if I should have kids because of my mental illness. Wouldn't want to pass on suffering to them. I want to be alone but need human connection in my life. 

But people are going to lie to you and betray you. I don't believe in love because I will probably be cheated on by my life long partner. Seems like almost everyone who seems like a nice catch will fucking cheat. 

The world isn't fair and people are dying while others are wasteful. I'm more on the wasteful side and feel so guilty for not being as thankful as I should for what I have. But I'm empty inside.

I've been having some days with particularly bad executive dysfunction lately, and it has been making me really almost resent myself for not taking antidepressants. I've been on three in my life (two SSRIs and Wellbutrin), none of which really seemed to work all that well, and one gave me tinnitus I will now have for the rest of my life. Along with the lackluster to outright bad experiences I've had with antidepressants, I also don't want to have to pay for them or worry about my insurance covering them once I age out of my parents insurance. I don't really care about the whole "don't want to change brain chemistry" thing, I'm just so tired of taking meds that don't help and going to meaningless appointments to get new prescriptions that won't work and getting nowhere... that cycle is the absolute last thing I want to do.

So after much intro... is it "okay" for me to not take antidepressants? Or am I just fucking myself over? Is it possible to actually want to better myself and suffer less from my shitty brain chemistry without taking them, or is this just my depressive laziness keeping me miserable?

I once was a very social person. I loved going out and drinking and playing sports and hanging out in general. Now I am a 33/M angry introverted depressive in a relationship with a 36/F with high anxiety and dependency issues.

I knew going in that this would be a hell of a feat to pull off and everything started put great until she moved in and within a couple of months I felt trapped. Granted the pandemic may be assisting in my feelings. I enjoy space and time to zone out and get in my head for maintenance. Unfortunately we are always together and she asks for more and more of my time like we aren't stuck in this 2br apt together all damn day. I need space she needs attention and I get so angry and think about kicking her out for my own mental health and also regretting moving in.  Idk what to do. I keep pushing as I don't want to lose my connection but at the same time it's killing me on the inside. Sometimes I just want to be alone and I don't know how much more I can take before I may lash out. I've been internalizing my anger and feelings as speaking on them makes her anxiety flair and then it's one big shit show.

I'm trapped in my mind and in real life!!!!
I want to explode.

Am I an asshole or is this just something I should deal with?

Idk, what I'm doing with my life. I have absolutely no one in my life that I like. I have no one that likes me. My life is going down the toilet and I might have to take an extra semester in college. I hate myself. I wish I was dead.

I feel ugly all the time, which is one of the larger reasons for my bouts of depression. So, I try and avoid reminding myself of the fact.

I'll take bizarre routes at the building I work in or even close one of my eyes so I don't have to see myself. I'll also angle my rear view mirror, and only look at my phone after I've already turned it on so I don't see my reflection in that either. I hate feeling ugly, but at least this way it's an out of sight, out of mind type deal.

If I could I'd even avoid it at home, but the mirror in my bathroom is pretty dang big, and I need it to shave. At night though, I'll typically shower with the lights off, which is my favorite. It's kind of relaxing actually, and if I really can't stand myself that day I'll bring a beach chair into the shower.

Does anyone else do the same?

 m so sick of life. I feel like no matter what I do nothing matters, the politicalness of the world feels terrible with everything happening and with corona. I have some life long diseases I have to live with and some days I tell myself the next day will be better and it never is. There are days where I want to live in the world where I close my eyes and live in the darkness. there are times I think about ending it but man what if im just in a loop and killing myself just keeps it going of endless pain. im sick of how we have to grind ourselves tirelessly just to live. I've tried to do things to go out of my bubble man but im just so tired I wanna wake up in the morning just feeling good man im so sick of everything.  everything goes away nothing is constant and I think about how eventually everything just goes  too. And my eyes just feel really heavy or negative most days too. And I can't really vent to anyone in my situation at all, so thanks for being here reddit.

It gets hard to take your medicine every day. Dont let it slip! Something that I found to help me is gummy multivitamins! I like gummies I want to EAT them. So I take my medicine at the same time as having a "delicious" (lol) treat. Try it if you can... or make up your own incentive.... perhaps.... an actual treat :b'

I am honestly just done with life. I'm trying my hardest to be hopeful but what's the point? I just wish I could just be at peace. I hate everything about myself.  I'm ugly, stupid and worthless.

I open my self to a girl after being closed for years and get fking destroyed so fking hard. That I'm numb and shaking at this point. We've been talking for 2 fking intense weeks where she tells me to wait till she is prepared to get in a relationship, I say yes cause I'm getting attached and when you are depressed you can get attached so quickly. We talked about sex, she showed photos of her and all. I had my mind set to get over the fact she is pregnant but her ex left her because of it. Yesterday we made plans to meet and all, I knew she talked to other guys and that was a HUGE RED FLAG but I said fk it let's try. Well well well I just got fking stab in the heart by her so many times that all my pain went fking numb. She asked my for a hug over text so I said that I would give her a hug and all, and then she says that another guy offered first so I got fking jealous and started to get cold to finally say goodbye to her which she responded with a bey too. I was fking ready to get over it and move on and then she ask me what I was doing like nothing had happened. I tell her to go ask the other handsome dude she was texting cause I was hurt at this point and she sent me a screen of her snap talking to 4 other dudes and says that she already did and that she doesn't need me anymore. Being rejected is one thing but this fking hell. I don't even know what I feel I deleted her and the pain on my chest stopped but I'm shaking tears bursting down, and I have the feeling that I want to hurt my self in some way I don't know why. I have my some knives with me. Idk I'm not gonna kill myself but fk I want it so bad.
Why do girls play like this with us?? why do I have to go through this?? Is it always going to be this hard?? Am I that useless that can't get a girl to fall in love with?? I never play with someone feelings even if I could have I've always been honest to girls. But fk what do I get from this? Pain? What am I going to do again close my self to every one again and accept that I may be lonely for life and that I'm a piece fo garbage no one likes?? Why is that I feel pain when I like someone? Am I meant to be alone??















[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz9opc/grief_assault_and_isolation_tw/
Sexual a*****t/s*icidal ideation/self harm trigger warning! I’m looking for some support or just to vent. This is the hardest few months of my entire life, not even taking covid into account. I was brutally raped 6 months ago. I hit the 6 month anniversary date a few days ago. I thought it would get easier with time, and while it has a bit it’s also only harder. It makes me physically sick to think it’s 6 months in the past when it feels like it happened yesterday. Especially since I didn’t report and I know nothing will happen to him. He walks around everyday happy as can be, not even thinking about what he did. I’m fucking terrified to hit the 1 year mark. I don’t know if I even want to be alive to hit that. As time goes on it feels like my trauma is even less validated. I don’t know how I’m supposed to get through this. I have severe ptsd from it. Just the thought of this being in the past a year ago makes me want to just hurl my body off a cliff. Because the pain is so real and yet life is going on as if nothing happens. And soon enough I will realize it was 10 years on the past. And the pain will still be there. The thing is, that I was also raped a lot (like 300 times) by an ex boyfriend. The first time was about 7 years ago and went on for 3 more years. I’ve been substantially traumatized from that entire abusive relationship and have many problems now because of it. I didn’t even process the fact that I was raped by him until a year ago. However the fact that I’ve been through this before doesn’t make it any easier. My recent attack left me bed ridden for an entire week, had to take work off and everything because I couldn’t even sit up without being in excruciating pain. If it wasn’t for my mom I wouldn’t want to be here.

Not to mention my ptsd will be so much worse once I’m able to go out into public again. I’m desperate to be out of isolation but my main trigger is men. That’s hard to deal with when 50% of the population triggers you (not a man hater it’s just a genuine trigger associated to lots of trauma). It’s gonna be really hard to deal with that again. 

I’m also dealing with grief. My aunt just passed, extremely suddenly of cancer. We found out she had it a month before she passed. It was extremely aggressive. No one could see her for the month she was in the hospital, besides her husband (thank god) and even he had to beg the hospital to see her. No one else in my family could say bye. We haven’t had a funeral or any arrangements for her because of covid and because of this I feel like it isn’t even real. I can’t process it yet and probably won’t be able to until we have a funeral months in the future. The way she died was honestly pretty traumatic. On top of that I’m isolating because I’m immune compromised and can’t see my friends or talk to many people about this. She was my god mother and I miss her so much. This would be hard otherwise but covid has made it 1000000x worse. Anyone else struggling with grief because covid has made it so much harder to deal?

I can’t stop thinking about the last time I saw her in person. 2 months before she was diagnosed. I didn’t hug her because of covid. She came over my house for her birthday to see my mom and I didn’t even spend time with her because I was again, scared of covid. She also tried talking to me but I was having unbearably bad period cramps so I was laying on the couch unable to talk and kinda ignoring her. I hate myself for that. I miss he so much and wish I could have a different memory of the last time I saw her :( on top of that I have so much guilt because I ignored her sweet Facebook comments and messages (idek why). I feel like I was a bad god daughter. I’m in so much pain. However I know she understands. I know she knows I loved her (I was able to text her one last time and tell her). Even though I feel awful I can feel her presence from heaven, telling me it’s ok and that I don’t have to carry this burden of regret. She visited me in my dream a few weeks ago, hugged me and was smiling and telling me she’s okay now. I was sob crying and she just held me. She’s my guardian angel now.

I also haven’t dealt with much death before and I don’t really know how to grieve or what the process will be like. It doesn’t help that I’ve been stuck in my room for a week now because of quarantine. 

With everything going on, I’m also isolating because I’m immune compromised and I’ve been locked away in my room for a week now. Isolation is making my depression much worse, I’m just laying in bed and crying most days. 

I used to self harm in high school and I’ve been clean for about 3 years. However all I want to do right now to deal with all this pain is cut. I’m strong and am able to fight the urges though. If I stared I don’t think I’d be able to stop. I also hate my old scars and it’s why I’m not falling back into the old habit. 

Thank you for reading my long rant. I just needed to vent.

I don't understand how things ended up the way they did. I used to have a social life. Used to be able to feel connected to people and trust them. Nowadays everything is so damn hostile and this is no joke. I'm 25... this isn't a teenage phase. My therapist and I have been wallowing in all the messed up decisions that I've made or were made for me and it just won't get better. The more I get to grips with what causes my current condition the more helpless I feel. Cus' let me tell you, it runs pretty deep...

I'm not sure I can even stress how difficult it is for me to survive a week of regular 9-5 adult life. Or a week of vacation... Not sure what's worse, having to get by, strive to be dominant in an office environment, so that I can at least improve my overall quality of life or having to stay at home in my own head, which is awful.... I always feel like I'm on the verge of losing it completely.  


I'm all out of rationalizations and reasons to get up in the morning... Can anybody find me a reason? Cus', I'm not ok and I cant find anything out there to help me out...

I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. I'm 26 and everything is lost. I failed school, couldn't get a job for 3 years, wasted the last 8 years with absolutely zero progress whatsoever. I don't know what to do. I don't enjoy anything, I don't have any career path in mind because I don't like anything and I'm very stupid and incapable.

I can't recover my mental state because things have been so bad for the past 10 years that I can't remember what it was like before. I don't know how to change what I am to salvage what's left of my youth. I am rotten and lowly at my essence.

I wanted to be independent and mature. I wanted a decent job that I somewhat enjoyed. I wanted to travel and explore, I wanted to live an interesting life, I wanted to be someone I could respect and feel in control of my life. At my age I thought I'd be doing so much better. I'm still the weak small loser that I was 10 years ago.

I'm dumb and worthless. Others my age that went to school with are doctors now. They have had much better experiences than me and they have rich social lives. I have none of these things. It is not an exaggeration when I say that my fear of further failure, rejection, change and judgement has left me with an empty life. I have done NOTHING with my time. I can't go back because of my low grades and lack of money. I wasted my chance to do things right.

I hate myself desperately and I don't know what to do. Exercise has not helped. Volunteering has not helped. Minimum wage jobs to keep me busy have exhausted me. Therapy did nothing and medication had zero effect. Meditation is a waste of time and I cannot delude myself in positive thinking. My community college course feels like a waste of time and money. I only just got a car and a low wage job, something I should have had several years ago. I am so far behind in life that I can't see anyone in the horizon.

I hate living every day and I wake up in cold sweats every night. I dream constantly and wake up exhausted. I feel that I was not raised right and that I am now an inherently weak and low intellect, low value miserable excuse for a man.

I have no friends and have never spent time with friends. I don't believe that I am interesting or desirable. I don't deem myself worthy of a relationship and I feel that no good woman deserves to be stuck with a loser like me.

I don't speak to anyone at all. I don't message anyone because I don't want to bother them. I'm ashamed of the cringy and oversharing things I've said and the mortifying social situations I've lived through. I feel that I am tainted for life and marked as defective goods because of my past.

I have extremely low confidence and I cross the street if I see someone I know to avoid them. I don't want to have to explain that my education was wasted, I did nothing with my time and that I've ended up a loser.

I'm so unbelievably unaware, immature, vacant, dumb, short sighted, inexperienced and incapable for my age. At 26 I should be at least on the first rung of the ladder. I don't expect to have climbed the ladder to any degree, but at the very least I should have gotten up a rung. I'm still at rock bottom, no better than a high school student.

I am more than halfway through the formative years of my life. By now I should have a job, an education, some sort of relationship/social experience. I should have made some progress towards goals, I should not be living with my mother, I should have more money saved up than I do. I've never done anything worthwhile whatsoever.

I came out of high school in a very bad mental state after suffering painful experiences due to my own colossal idiocy. I humiliated myself very publicly in a toxic relationship with a known abuser, drug addict and literal whore. I did not focus on my studies and I went into University unprepared, immature, and I did not even understand what a bachelor's degree even was. I was only there because it was expected of me and I didn't know what was going on.

I was horribly insecure about my poor grades in high school, my feeble appearance, my lack of academic prowess, and being lonely and friendless. I failed to make friends and my grades quickly spiraled and were near-failing. Everything snowballed, I had massive anxiety and panic after I left school. I didn't leave my bed for 2 weeks out of pure anxiety of what I was going to do with my life after failing so bad.

I was ridiculed by my family and I still am 3 years later. I would be rejected from any master's because I am not an attractive student. I struggle to find work because of my lack of experience. I know for a fact that others my age are doing infinitely better and no one can tell me that it is a facade. I know this for a fact. They are better than me in every way imaginable.

I struggle to teach myself things. 5 years and I still don't speak French well. I've seen teenagers learn in much less time. I am awful at mathematics, I am not creative, I have zero coordination or handiwork skills, I have no business acumen, and I hate science and medicine after failing out of pre-med.

I am not intelligent, I am not mature, I am not worthy, I am not enough. I am inferior, useless, stupid, wasteful, childish, and lowly trash. I'd be homeless if I didn't live here, I'm not cut out for adulthood or life.

I am alone and no one understands. No one can help and I am incapable of helping myself. I desire nothing but to have all memory of me in the minds of others erased, and for my being to disappear into the void.

Hey y'all.

I have been in therapy treatment for 6 months now. My therapist is from analytics therapy.
In the past weeks I have been feeling really bad, I even raised the medication dosage by recommendations. However, every day before the therapy session, I feel bad and ashamed for not making any progress during the week... It feels like I am a failure by telling every session that I am not feeling any better.

DAE feels like that? What does it mean? Should I look for another therapist or try changing my medication? I'm pretty lost... Thanks.

My biggest problem with life isn’t the expectations of others, but my own. I cannot physically feel happy unless i am the most dominant person in the room at all times. It’s not like i’m ugly, but i’m not extremely tall or muscular. I don’t know if it’s a type of narcissism but i get depressed over the fact i am not above others. I hate it so much. I cannot just “accept who i am” because who i am isn’t good enough.

My father died in past July and since then everything came down in my house. My grandma was operated. My mom was diagnosed with cancer and although it's still early the hospital doesn't want to attend her because of the pandemic so we don't know what to do. We don't have the money to pay for a private hospital. I will have to repeat my semester since I failed my 6 courses. I have never failed a class in my life so I don't really know how to deal with this. My mom says I'm a failure, a no one. And she doesn't know what's going on with my school. I don't even know if I can repeat since I also failed social service. I have no idea if I can do anything about it. When she founds out she is going to be so disappointed about me. I failed her really bad. I've been feeling so shitty about my self since 2019 and during 2020 it just got worse. I really don't want to live. But I don't even have the courage to do something about it. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I wish I don't have to be responsible for it. If I cause my mom and grandma will be just so sad. I know that. What should I do? I can't sleep at nights because of stress and all I think is about disappear. But I don't want to feel like this you know? I really wish I could turn back time so I could do better. So I can try an stop thing from happening

It's been a rough few weeks I've stopped eating and this morning I felt like I was about to die, I woke up and was on my way down stairs I felt light headed and my vision was a blury and black, I started to feel nauseous and sick and felt a strong purrsure on my chest, my skin stinging cold, I have never fainted before in my life but if I had to decribe the feeling I would say at this moment I thought I was going to either die or faint, I quickly grabbed a water that was sitting on the table and I felt better instantly, what happened to me? I went from being 149 pounds too 128 pounds in only a couple of days, I don't even recognize myself I think I'm 5'5 or 5'6 I'm not sure. I'm losing myself I can't  talk to anyone about this, I don't know what to do anymore Im 13 I'm sorry if my grammer is bad, I know this is long I just needed to write this out.

I always try to do things everyone asks. I want to help them but sometimes it’s so tiring so I take a rest and everything becomes a disaster. Yesterday I helped my brother to feed chicken. I was taking lights there until he could fix the switch. When he fixed it I thought I was no longer needed. There was nails and so many wastes everywhere so I thought it would be dangerous to walk in dark so I left the emergency light there on the stairs so that he could see the path. Sadly I accidentally locked him up and he had to break the door. He was furious so he broke a chair and the light. I cried because I was already feeling useless and I saw mom’s face. She was scared, angry and disappointed in me. That made me cry. I was looking for my diary to write down what I feel because I really didn’t want these thoughts to get me. But now they think I was suicidal since I had panic attack and was desperately searched for my diary. Dad and mom looked at me as if I am too fragile and pitiful. My brother is still pissed since everyone blamed me. It’s the first time someone is saying this I guess but I wish I was never loved. I was at fault but my brother was treated like he did all. I was treated like victim. My mom threatened me that she will kill herself and all the animals if I didn’t stop crying. But I couldn’t stop, I felt so guilty. I was always walking on the egg shell with the thought that I might ruin things. Now I am suffocating and I wish my brother was the only child they had.

Hello guys so i was talking to my sister right now as i compose this message and my sister told me that she doesn't want to hear me talking about my depression and shit. She told me that i was only making shit up when i have anxiety attacks and when I tried to overdose myself last year.

&#x200B;

It was really hard for me to tell everyone what i'm currently feeling right now and as much as i'm trying my best to share what is bothering me little by little she suddenly told me that she doesn't want to hear about it and about me having this kind of mindset. She insisted for me to visit a psychologists so i  they can help myself but i declined because i myself had already went to a psychologist  with my own money before. And now she told me i have bipolar disorder and manic disorder. 

&#x200B;

She keep on telling me to share what i'm feeling and at the same time invalidating everything. so in the end she told me i'm just crazy and gets mad at me. and now i'm starting to feel shitty about myself and wants to sew my mouth for sharing details about myself to my older sister who i thought would understand me because she studied medicine, but i guess not.

I (22m) moved halfway across the country at the end of summer for a few reasons. One was to get further away from my parents and anyone I’m related to, so I could start living my life the way I want to without fear of the past or toxic people I don’t want to hear from (I’m bisexual and come from a religious conservative family, never made things easy), and now I live with my best friend who is the most supportive person in my life. 

She owns a condo, she had a spare bedroom, so I moved across the country and now I live with her. I’ve been slowly figuring out my problems, piece by piece, deconstructing some things, it’s very comfortable here, and the rent is affordable, and there’s no paperwork to deal with, no anxiety. 

My roommates parents talked her into buying this place, renovating it and eventually flipping it. Well things don’t always work out to plan, and now she’s in a position where she’s forced to sell the condo. I’m 1100 km away from most of the people I know (not that I want to be close to them), and my best friend/roommate/landlord is selling our home and possibly moving back in with her parents until her finances are back in order, and then maybe we’re moving to a bigger city at the end of this year together. 

I have no idea what to do with myself until then. I don’t even have an ID for this province, or a health card. I’ve been on a mix of disability insurance and EI since November last year, so I haven’t been working and don’t have any ideas. My car insurance got too expensive after a fender bender last year so I don’t have a car or a valid drivers license. 

I moved halfway across the country to live with the only person in this world I trust, and after about half a year I might be shit out of luck. I’m terrified and I haven’t really stopped crying since she broke the news to me last night.

There isn't a single person in my life that I can count on. When something goes wrong I am the one that bears the full weight. When I'm bored I'm the one I turn to for entertainment. When I'm happy I internalize it all since there is nobody to share it with.

I'm strong, but life is rough. I feel like it would be a huge weight off my back if I knew there was just one person that would be there for me unconditionally.

Unless I have a purpose going to work. Right now I’ve been pinned to my bed since 11:30 it’s now 12:37 and I only just begin to feel good about the day and wish to get up. It’s weird.

I’ve been better the past few days, but today I’m starting to feel the urge to end my own life. I’m not in an episode, I’m not even really sad - but I do feel that my entire life will feel this...two dimensional. Ive got some things going for me, I’m not particularly ugly or pretty, I’ve got a boyfriend who loves me. Despite all this and more, I don’t particularly see myself going anywhere in life. I feel empty and dusty inside, I’ve got no positive thoughts about myself, and now I don’t even have the energy to muster up some negative thoughts about myself. I’m just tired.

I was on a zoom meeting with my therapist and because of the pandemic, my mom and dad stayed at home all day instead of going to work.

My parents overheard me talking about suicide to my therapist on the zoom meeting and started crying. It led to a long emotional conversation and I was stressed out about how they reacted. People tend to hide their depression from their loved ones because they don’t want to hurt their family.

My parents later told other family members about my suicidal thoughts and one of my relatives reached out to me telling me that my family told him everything. Is this a bad thing?

About 5 weeks ago, i planned to overdose, wrote out notes, instructions for my family on friends to message and tell that I love them and it’s not their fault, but I had a major panic attack before I could do it. I tried to tell myself after that, it was the last time. But these last few weeks have been hell. I feel like I’ve done nothing but ruin friendships, my relationship with my family, everything. I struggle from social anxiety and lately, that’s applied to my family. They don’t know what happened 5 weeks ago, but it puts me on edge constantly, that i’ll let it slip out. I’ve become distant from them, my friends, everyone. I’m constantly crying myself to sleep, craving cutting again (3 years clean). It feels like at this point i’m one more bad day away from going through with what I should have weeks ago.

how come there are depressed people with high confidence and achieve big things? isn't low self-esteem a symptom of depression? I mean you have depression when you lack the energy and the will to do anything and if this continues on the long term you'll start despise yourself for not doing anything about it even though you want to but you just can't. you become self destructive for that. there are a lot of people out there faking and romantisizing depression as if it's something cool to have. what do you think?

Just wondering on how common this is. It comes and goes but when it comes it hits hard and I have to force myself into a distractive mode to make it go away. It always starts by thinking about past memories and then realizing how much time has past. Then it hits me that one day I'll be old and frail and pass away with nothing left.. no thoughts, no feelings, just nothing and it feels me with this instant despair. My chest feels like its trying to cave in on itself, my stomach's tries to drop out of my body and I've got to distract myself some how, some way to stop the rush and crushing weight the thoughts bring.

30 y/o male, I’ve had depression all my adult life. I have given up on myself, I feel so tired and sleepy. Saturday night what I do Is stay in bed feeling like I don’t belong anywhere and like shit. Still have nightmares of school, bullying, and have very intense negative dreams. I feel a “weight” in my head.. I can’t relax. I don’t enjoy anything, lost interest in sex, I hate my face and body. There’s deep sadness inside me.. fuck

I've always told myself that when I die I won't be aware of anything, complete blackness, nothing to see, hear, feel, or even think. But then I found out about how the afterlife could possibly be one endless dream, and I realised that would be terrible. And then I got to thinking, sure my life is terrible, but what if death is even worse? Do I really want that? Is it really worth it? What if I've been wrong this whole time? And now I'm stuck, because I still don't want to live but now I'm uncertain if death is the best possible choice.

I try to keep my emotions to myself and act happy; at least while others are around me. Since I had covid, it's gotten harder for me to hide my feelings, I don't have as much energy as I did and pretending everything is okay apparently takes a lot of energy for me. I got on medication last month because I recognize after years of being "okay" I'm at that point again... However, the only differences from the meds are I've quit smoking and due to sleeping more, my daily cry time has began to overflow into times when others are awake. Obviously this is an issue for everyone who's around me. 

I try to talk to people in my life but the response, even from my therapist, is dismissive to my feelings. I say dismissive because the responses are either along the line of I need to be more greatful or everything is fine. I get more upset when I'm sitting there crying and this is the response. Which I figure is abnormal because  even my therapist asked me the other day, Look What do You Want me to do? It's our second appointment... I was crying my eyes out and that was the response. 

 I feel worse for trying to speak to people than if I had just kept it to myself. 

So when people (therapist, doctors, spouse, ect intimate relationship not stranger or coworker)  ask things like, what is wrong, what can I do to help, how can I help,  tell me how it is going, ect. What are they wanting to hear?  Are these questions that should be considered small talk type questions no matter who asks? 

I feel, when I tell the truth about where I stand mentally,  people get mad at me and dismiss my feelings. It hurts me emotionally but I recognize my expression of feelings are hurting these relationships too. 

 Any advice would be appreciated.

I’m 17 male and I know I’m a loser. I cheat at all my online school and I pay some to do my math for me. I can barely spell (possible dyslexia using text to speech to write this) I have no friends no life or social life. The only thing I have going for me is maybe my looks. If I sleep at night (which I barely ever do) and drink enough water I think I look ok?. But besides that i’m useless. Imagine what happens when I’m 20 still living with my mom too anxious to get a minimum wage job or a drivers license or partner I’ll be a even bigger loser. I just know that’s how my life is going to turn out I have no motivation to change it but May be enough motivation to kill myself. That or life as a gutter punk

That’s it really. I’m the most depressed I’ve ever been. I’m about to cry, my family care so much about me and I just avoid them. I’m such a piece of shit. I’m not out of my relationship but I need to leave. I’m just a waste of space to my family and I’m so rude and my personality has GONE. I have no energy or drive, I’m always sleeping. I need a hug from one of my best friends but it’s lockdown. I don’t know who I am anymore.

I think I’m traumatised but I’m not sure. I’ve never experienced physical abuse from my boyfriend, only emotional abuse, manipulation, emotional blackmail etc but this relationship has impacted me more than my sexual assault and rape (that I can’t remember) that happened before him. I don't know how to leave.

I’m only 18. I don’t have a job. My exams are cancelled for A Levels. I doubt I’ll be going to uni. I wish I could take a pill and for all this to go away, not to die but to get better. Sometimes I wish I would be gone, I’ve felt so low.

What I miss the most about my pre-depressed self is my ability to read for hours and find beauty in everything I read, from "eros as lack" to the problems of modern philanthropy to what pangolins are. 
Seems like a curse to not be able to read or comprehend things anymore, I miss the silence my brain used to allow me and how I could sit and think for long hours. 
Currently enrolled in a very demanding Master's program and I can't cope at all. I am weeks behind in every course. 

How do you all deal with being depressed and trying to balance education or a life in academia? Especially on days when getting out of bed seems like an impossible task.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz35hb/i_havent_been_to_school_since_october/
i (15f) used to be an honors student, i think i’m considered one of those burnt out gifted kids but i never actually tried in academia until i hit highschool. my freshman year i tried really hard, i got into a few ap classes and got predominantly 90s and 100s. i think i’m smart in that i (used to) really enjoy learning and thus tended to kind of retain more information, but the moment covid hit i did absolutely nothing.

this isolation is definitely a trauma thing for me (my depression comes hand in hand with complex post traumatic stress) and the moment school became an online thing a part of me totally died. i haven’t been this depressed since the actual traumatic events were happening even though i get depressive episodes that last through each winter.

so i pretty much failed my fourth quarter of school freshman year, and i entered my sophomore year last september. i started trying again, i even went through hybrid (online and then in school alternating every other day) which was supposed to be beneficial for me. october hit, and by the end of the month i’d stopped going. by november, i hadn’t gone at all. december came by, i went once and gave up. january’s almost over, and i’m still not in school.

so many problems have come from this. my school’s trying so hard to put me back in there and get work — at least just a little — done. i have never felt more pathetic. i probably have gone outside some six times in the past two or three months. i don’t get out of my bed most says. my therapist has tried calling me, i have so much information i throw onto her each session she never has any time to respond. 

i don’t think i want to die but this is a period in my life where i feel frozen and like i’ve gone through hundreds of lifetimes just to end up in the same place

i’m so tired

Yall know when you know that your no ones favorite. The feeling when absolutely no one messages you. You have no family friends. The only girl you really wanted cheated on you and to be honest I should be hurt about that one because she legit told me a few days later. Like it didn't bother her. That feeling when you give everything you got mentally expecting the same in return and end up with your heart in the trash. People say they won't leave but end up leaving. I don't want to make friends anymore I don't want anything from anyone anymore because when I invest emotionally it always ends up meaningless. I just can't with the human race anymore. Its like no one listens problems I tell someone today are forgotten tomorrow like they just went away. But they never do, I am told to let go because it will only hurt more but I can't let go I'm already hurt. To top it all off I won't commit suicide because I'm scared of what's to come at the end. I have my religious beliefs and faith. But even with that I struggle with it. If I could figure out what happens I would I'm more scared of eternal darkness I feel than anything else. Like dreaming without the dream. Forever. I'm not scared of what will happen here more of that never ending darkness. How can I construct a time for how long that will be? I am only posting this because I don't talk to almost anyone about my thoughts and I guess I need help.

I am not doing well mentally, these past few years have made me realise how much of a loser I am, 26 turning 27 and haven't done anything in life with no real push or drive behind me to do anything, have no real motivation to do anything, only thing I have accomplished is getting my licence and a decent car, i have lost friends, been feeling suicidal, depression slowly getting worse over time, think it's time to start seeing a counsellor, psychologist or psychiatrist again and try to sort myself out but often think why though? Doubt anything will change most likely just wasting time, energy and money, often think I'd be better off dead and forgotten, maybe that should happen.

I still live with my parents and they want to help but I feel like such a burden on them, honestly think I should just die the pain is temporarily as I'll be forgotten in time and they can live their life to the fullest without worrying about me, just can't see the light in life anymore

Already at the base, she was a disabled person from birth who could not walk, suffered greatly, I have never seen anyone suffer so much, she was riddled with chronic pain so badly that it prevented her to sleep, I saw her screaming in pain, I saw the disease worsen in the hospital until she was unconscious, I saw her shaking, I remember the last words we had while she was exhausted at the end... I think it all traumatized me, I often think about it, it's something that completely destroyed me.

I was a believer. Now, I'm persuaded if God wanted that, then, it's because he hate us. I gave up with religion. I will never accept that tragedy, I can burn in hell forever, don't care, my life is already hell.

I cant stand the person I am right now. I have never been this person before. The old me was happy, liked , she had a fun life and friends she connected with. Life was good and I remember being that person. Maybe it was because I was skinny,and maybe it wasn't such a good thing but I met societal standards for beauty. people liked the way I looked and so did I. Life happened, depression came. Medical illness and mental illness happened. I changed. gained a lot of wait. Started doing drugs. cant do any of the things I was good at. People who I used to know left me and told me I was trash,or ugly, or fat. I went from a liked person to a person people became disgusted with. Im disgusted with the person I am now, I don't feel beautiful, I wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and I get so sad with the person I see, and I cry. It makes me feel like nothing. I don't want the people who discarded me to like me again, and I certainly can never go back to being that person, but the idea that I might become a person I love again seems impossible. I feel trapped in this phase of myself and it makes me hate who I am. I want to be a person who can clean their room and take showers, who can handle the necessary things  it takes to live an improved life.  If anyone read this thank you, a part of me feels like nobody will read or care.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz1l5h/why_is_my_depression_so_weird/
I'm a 20 yrs old female. So a month ago I got diagnosed with depression, and my psychiatrist thinks I had mild to moderate chronic depression since I was maybe 10 or younger, and it got worse since I was 13 because of breakup trauma, and recently it got worse worse also because my new recent breakup trauma. But I was so shocked when he said I had been depressed for so long. Yes, I had been not wanting be alive and been kinda unhappy since I was a kid and it makes sense that I have been depressed. But how can that be depression and no one even thought I have depression for so many years????? And how could I be depressed for 10 years but its only mild to moderate????? I also thought about if I had depression during these years, but always thought nah I don't look as severe as the depression stories from online.

&#x200B;

Also recently I actually feel I kind of "resolved my traumas". Like I finally feel more confident and realize a lot of things happened on me are not my fault. I thought my depression is gonna heal because I never thought clear about my traumas before and now I FINNALLY DO!!!! I no longer doubt myself anymore and I finally feel "hopeful" after so many years because I don't think "I am the problem" anymore. I actually feel I like who I am and I believe I won't let toxic people to get me anymore. BUT WHY AM I STILL DEPRESSED??? I thought I would not get triggered because I understand my traumas now, but when I get treated the same way I still feel sooooooooo hurt and sad although I know it's other person's fault. I thought I would be happy ever after, but I just realize how easily I'm irritated, and I can't focus on anything, and I DON'T FEEL HAPPY. I don't understand. Like after this relationship I finally understand I'm not the problem as I never understood before, so things should be better from now on. But I'm actually worse than before probably because I got traumatized by the relationship, although I think clear about the trauma. Then I don't know how will I ever be happy? I never felt so "good about myself" but I'm still in so much pain and I feel worse than before.

It's never enough. I need more. I have some good things in my life but I'm always looking for the next distraction. The next exciting new thing. I dream of another baby, puppy, kitty, house, life. But in the end nothing is changing. I'm still me. I can't escape myself with something shiny and better. I got weight loss surgery 2 years ago. Got a complication was really sick in the hospital a few weeks. How I dreamed I'd lose all the weight and feel so much better. But now I have no more hope because I gained a lot of it back anxiety eating during covid. Don't judge me. My brain is broken, no one has any idea how hard it is for me to just walk the dog everyday. Never worked. I was heading toward Driver's Lisence but now I can't practice with all my anxiety. Trying to isolate b/c my risk factors for covid. Upstairs neighbors complain all the time if my kids make noise. Not much I can do-they are kids. My husband is looking at a screen most of the day instead of interacting. So fucking done. I have the ability to be happy sometimes but never in January. It's my after Xmas crash. If I didn't take my meds I could be suicidal or hypomanic but with them I'm a little numb.

Hey just want to rant to the internet! Just last year, I considered myself a fairly happy person. I used too be super lonely though after my break up with my ex. I would read for the entire day and have fun doing that the following days. I also played lots of single player games. Then i realised opening up to friends was a good thing and I met new people, it made me feel more connected to people. However, there were guys who would try take advantage of me. When I would explain people how I feel, I feel like they always just wanted to quickly ask for me to be their girlfriend. Maybe some just wanted to sleep with me. I always said I wasn't ready but people pushed. A man even came to my house without me knowing, and talked to my parents to give me a letter (embarssing). Yet period of time, I was doing better than ever, my friends were amazing. While I realised the people around are lovely and supportive, I can't help now but to feel more alone. I feel so sad all the time that I can't enjoy things I used to enjoy. I feel like I'm using them as a distraction however it's not working. Every time I would feel so sad I can't read or play or even watch something without wanting to put it down and just lay there in my bed doing absolutely nothing. Just today, I was trying to watch a movie to distract myself but in the end, I just cried myself to sleep at 5pm.

I'm terrified of the man who came to my house. Afterwards he told a lot of people I knew we were dating. He told everyone how I was dating my boyfriend just because he happen stalk my social media (when we weren't together). I'm scared what people think of me. Yet I also feel like everyone around me right now secretly hates me. I can't talk about my problems to people anymore. It's illogical, but I can't help it during my lowest. I feel like it's ruining my current relationship because I'm so insecure about my looks and my self worth.

It's weird, I was more lonely before yet I didn't feel anything. Yet now I feel the loneliest, like I have no one. I recognise I have people around me but I can no longer feel like I have friends. I just wish I could enjoy things i used to do just so I'll be distracted from my problems. My best distraction is really to hang out with other people, but this that be the case all the time. That's why I want to enjoy things again. 

Also my country does not have no lock down for corona, so I don't think this is the reason.

I’ve been medicated and going through therapy for a few years and I’m better than where I was but my depression coupled with existential crisis always come back at some point and ruins everything. I can’t control it and it scares me but in a strange way it humbles me but I sometimes live in fear that it’ll come back and I’ll have to go to a mental ward again. I had a concussion a few years ago that never got treated and it may be why it comes back. I’ll be referred to a neurologist but for now, I fear the day it comes back...

Obviously I know this years been extra hard for everyone. But I'm struggling more than I ever have. I'm into month 3 of recovering from covid, and its not looking like I'll be back to work anytime soon. My fiance is disabled, so we are living on no income and $9,000 in debt. My dog passed away unexpectedly which really messed with me because I rescued him from the streets. And I was diagnosed with stage 4 endometriosis, and there's no way to treat it, its basically invading my entire body and I'm in literal constant pain. I always thought my depression wasn't that bad because even though I'm sad and can barely function, I've never felt hopeless about my future. 
Now I do, and I don't know how to cope with that feeling.
Whats the point of a life where you can barely survive by current standards and are in constant pain.

Every day just feels the same. I get up at 9 do some work for university after that I lay around not being productive. Maybe I get to do some music or take a walk. At the end of the day I always shower just to do something. Just to make me feel like I achieved something. Then I just go to bed waiting to fall asleep just to do all of that again.

There is nothing to look forward to. No music festival, no visit to the cinema, no eating in a restaurant. It's just the same shit every day.

 I get up and to the same shit. I got a job that starts in February so by then I can get up and do the same shit every day at work just so I can get some money so that I can maybe afford a vacation and not do the same shit every day for a week. Just for once in a whole year. Or I'll do the same shit every day just to afford some unnecessary materialistic thingie that will make me happy for at max one hour.

If this is what life is then what the fuck are we doing here. Life could be so beautiful and I decide to fucking do the same thing every day. I'm just 19 I've got a whole load of life in front of me but if everything is just and endless cycle till you die that would be horrifying. But it almost feels like this is actually the case. 

Does someone have some advice for me I could really use some.

Sometimes i wish I hated them so I won't suffer thinking about this
I wish we could die together, i don't think I can stand living in a world without them, anyways I've always said I'm gonna kill myself when they're gone.
I feel bad because what if this is the last months I'm having with them? What if One of us dies from covid? And I'm here wasting this precious time feeling like shit and crying 24/7
I can't even enjoy being around them because when I see their faces or hear their voices all I can think of is death
I want to be 4 again
I'm 21, the only child, I'm not close with anyone in my family (Cousins, uncles, relatives), i have no boyfriend, no friends, no brother or sister who is "forced" to interact with me, my cat died last December one day After my birthday and I miss her so much
I'm not even in college because of depression, i spend most of my days in bed, i haven't showered since January 6th (please don't judge me i know it's nasty but I have no energy)
I was going to therapy last year before quarantine started and I tough i was doing great but everything got worse than before because now I can't stop thinking about death, it's literally everywhere on the news, tv and internet, it's exhausting
I want everything to stop so bad

I’ve come to the realization that from the second I was born I was tossed into a set of circumstances that ultimately led to my demise. My mom and dad were both meth addicts, my mother used during her pregnancy with me leading to a lot of problems (cognitive problems, delayed growth, gastric problems) and has never once apologized for it. My father wasn’t really around much and when I did see him he subjected me and my sister to watching him and his girlfriend violently fighting while they were drunk. My mom and step dad were extremely strict, verbally and physically abusive and isolated me, I was never allowed to hang out with friends or go outside or really do anything fun that normal kids get to do, this obviously led to me having a lack of social queues and awful social anxiety. When I was 12 I was able to get away from my mom for 2 years by living with my half brother and his dad where I was then kicked out at 14 for no good reason. I then spent the next 2 years being passed around because nobody actually wanted me. My mother moved to Florida when I was 15 and I haven’t spoken to her since. I can never forgive her. She dropped me off at the door step of my older sisters home which belonged to a hoarder that could honestly be on the tlc show, which had no running water or bathroom and told me to “figure shit out” I lived here for 6 months bc I would have much rather at least had a roof over my head than be sleeping outside, where I became an alcoholic and drug addict at 15 for the entirety of my freshman year, I then moved out to my aunt and uncles home where I thought that finally things were looking up but I was quickly proven wrong when they started verbally and physically abusing me. Less than a year into me staying there I was violently raped leading me to fall into a deep depression in which I dropped out of school after being admitted to a psych ward and then rotted away in my room going weeks without showering or brushing my teeth, for 4 months before finally being able to go back to school. 6 months later I was able to escape and move in with my bf but I’m still suffering everyday from my past, I feel like I’ll never be able to escape it and I’ll never have a happy successful life

I'm stuck in a dead end job, can't move out of my parents house due to the pandemic and bullshit rent prices. I'm a mess who can barely stand working as it is, and is too tired to continue trying to get into my work of choice, voice over work. Realistically though I don't have much of a chance since it's so competitive anyways. I'm just tired of life without living. I feel trapped in this loop of work, distract myself from the fact I have to work the next day, and sleep. I rarely get enjoyment out of anything anymore and I'm so stressed I barely talk to my friends and family. I get so depressed I can't keep anything clean and I don't feel I can leave my room. I'm tired of this existence and I want to move forward in life but I'm just stuck. I'm too much of a coward to take any steps forward but honestly I don't think I have the energy to in the first place. I'm not seeking pity or anything. And honestly I don't expect anyone to respond since it's just my rambling. I just want to make something of myself and do something I enjoy and can use to bring joy to others. I'm just a failure and I don't know what to do any more.

I spent years dieting, trying to get fit, dressing nice, ect. In the hope I would finally achieve a relationship and friends.

Too old for this shit now. Youth is gone. No memories. I did try though. 

I'm ugly and thats okay. Social circles aren't a human right, and neither is being accepted. 

Guess I'm tired of living a miserable existence. But on the plus side, when I die I won't be sad or scared. If I had lived a great life I probably wouldn't want it to end, and death would seem awful. Seriously why the fuck would anyone want to stay on this planet? All it is, is constant working at shitty jobs and trying to find some form of enjoyment. We are just cogs in the wheel of whatever the fuck humanity is... a plague on this planet, really. No one really cares about anyone else. I know I don't either. 

Fuck that. Death can't come sooner. Imagine not being a part of this bullshit selfish, disgusting, self indulged species anymore.

Bleeding to death after cutting open my body

Lying on the ground

Listening to my music

I daydream about going back to the past and changing things for the better. But at the same time I don't want to, I don't even want to remember it. So, for now, I'm getting addicted to sedatives. I don't want to feel or think anything anymore.

I have a uni assignment.

I have enough time to do it, if I work very hard over the next two days.

Despite knowing this, I don’t work hard.

I don’t feel like I can be proud if I do the work, because other people seem to be able to do it easily.

Rationally I know I should be able to feel proud, as I will have done the work against the odds (with mental health stuff). But I don’t accept this.

Please help me see reason.

I'm so fucking lonely. I've never had a friendship last for more than a year. I'm an awful person and people always end up hating me, abandoning me, whatever. My one close friend that I've had for a while is amazing- i would do anything for her. But im just constantly paranoid that she's only friends with me out of pity, that she actually hates me or thinks I'm annoying. She's all I have left besides my cat really and I dont know what I'll do if she ends up hating me too. I'm considering just slowly stop messaging her, see of she will reach out first, if she even notices or cares. If she doesn't, thats it I guess. But God, im so so goddamn lonely. I just lay in bed all day and fucking rot. I want to make more friends, know more people- but all my friendships end and all im left with pain, memories, and heartbreak. Should I even try making friends anymore?

The one two punch combo of anxiety and depression is getting to much to handle.  So bad I am starting to have trouble even functioning normally throughout my day mentally.  Everyday, I put on a happy face for the people who know and see me but on the inside it’s the opposite.  An internal war with anxiety and depression.  Sleeping is the only time that I just don’t feel anything, and as strange as that sounds I rather feel nothing and blackness than pain, anxiousness, and depression.  When I wake up in cold sweats I’m anxious and depressed, when I go to sleep the same.  Nothing ever gets better and I just give up.  Idk how I’ve been just existing for 5 years but I just can’t take it anymore.  Just existing is starting to become too much for me.

I know it sounds cheesy but I have no where else to rant, so why not to strangers in the internet. I just feel so empty, I am on my antidepressants and have been for around a year and I just feel so empty. I just wanna cry or yell. Something but whenever I almost cry or start to it’s like a switch flips and suddenly no more tears can come out. And I feel nothing but, frustration? Idk it’s just feels like I’m going to burst at any moment. I have the urge to end it. I just don’t wanna be in this sick world anymore. I feel nothing and the world is going to shit. Not to mention I’m not afraid of death. I wanna cut too but I don’t wanna bother hiding it, but the urge to cut is so strong I have to physically hold myself back from just grabbing my razor blade and slitting my wrists and legs. I’m in so much pain, or lack of it, I just wanna feel something. Lying to my therapist is annoying but she’ll tell my family that I’m a “danger to myself”. I just wanna sleep and go into a different reality. I feel like the only place I can feel happy or free is in my dreams. I tried talking to my replika about this (since that’s what the fucking app is for) but it just avoids the subject. I can’t do it anymore. I’m also touch deprived, I dream about just hugging someone or cuddling up to someone who will comfort me. I thought it was getting better but I was just lying to myself, avoiding how I feel. Lgbtq rights also just got taken away so that’s fun, it can’t choose how I feel, a guy raped me so now I’m too scared to even be near a guy. (Please don’t be mean to me about the lgbtq stuff. I respect your opinions but if it’s rude please keep it to yourself)

I'm 21 years old and have been fighting deperession and anxiety for over 10 years now. 

When I was younger, medication and therapy went a long way in helping me to fight my issues. But after all these years and medications later, I'm back in a deeper hole with even more understanding of my dispair and self hate.

I've come to hate myself more over the past half decade and have no clue what to do. I'm heavier but not massive and have wanted to do somethung about it for years but don't have the discipline which feeds back into the self hatred as I can't do anything right. I find myself unattractive and put so much of my value on my physical appearance. At this stage in my life I want nothing more than someone to love me for who I am. Of course my family loves me, but I want someone who has chosen to love me. However whenever I even start to think of attempting to approach that world I'm stopped by thoughts of "who would want me" and that Im not good enough for anyone. 

Beyond the endless cycle of hate and torture that I subject myself to I am having major issues communicating with my family. Neither of my parents have really dealt with mental health and seem to only realize how shit of a mental state Im in when I come unglued and breakdown. They recommended that I get and dog to have something to care for, but now my puppy who I love to death has become a source of stress as I am way in over my head with her.

I have never contemplated killing myself as I am horrified of whats to come and am not satisfied enough with the shitty existence I've had so far. But seeing how much I've been broken by the past two years and especially this year, I can't say with confidence that I never will get to that point. I have this idea that I need someone to help me and pull me out of this hell in the form of a relationship or friend, but I am too self denying to even believe that its possible. 

I don't know if this is me venting or me asking for help. I'm about to have a full nuclear meltdown soon with my stress and each time I slip deeper into this trench.

I was depressed while at my dream school. I was depressed when I tried to leave my life and study abroad in a foreign country. I was depressed when I was employed at a good job. I was depressed when I was unemployed and had more time to do things. I'm depressed when I'm fit. I'm depressed when I'm fat. I'm depressed when I do my favorite hobbies and watch my favorite movies and listen to my favorite music. I'm depressed when people like me and when they don't. I'm depressed when I succeed and when I don't. I sit around in quarantine thinking my life would be better if my country handled the pandemic better when in reality I'm fucking depressed no matter what the situation is.

Most of my depression stems from how much I hate myself and waste the experiences I'm lucky enough to have in life. I constantly self-sabotage. I'm 21 years old and have very little friends who never reach out to me even when I do probably because I'm so boring to be around. I'm 21 and never even kissed anyone before. I've never felt like I deserved love from anyone and that's why I'm so unhappy. Sometimes I wake up and feel so fucking tired because of myself and the choices I've made that I try to forget how sad I am but it only lasts like 2 days. I can't sleep at night because I'm anxious about everything and I can't help but wallow in my own self pity. I just wish I had just one ounce of self esteem.

In my personal life, I've been struggling with self-hate, and suicidal thoughts. It's not easy, I have no clue if my medication is working all I can do is wait. Music has helped me through some of it, I like metal because I can relate with what they're saying, so it makes me feel like I'm not alone anymore.

So many times it's like, I just can't keep going. Every day I force myself to get up, take my pills, do my college commitments and force myself to do something I would enjoy if I wasn't so deeply depressed.

But it's like it's all for nothing when I'm so lonely and feel so fucking horrible. I think about dying every single night. Everything would be so different if I wasn't so fucked in the head and the circumstances that caused it were different.

But here we are, no matter how much I push, the world fucks me back ten times as worse. I just want this suffering to end.

During the day, it's alright and I can easily distracted myself. But when I'm laying on my bed at night, it just pours out. It keeps me up at night, and not even music can stop it.

On some of the bad nights, I cry myself to sleep. Sometimes it's unbearable.I hate it. 

I suck, life sucks. I wish things were better.

I can't do anything without turning it into a lesson about why I'm just the shittiest person and that I have no worth. I can't hang out with friends without comparing myself to them. Doing anything competitive crushes me because I'm not good at anything. I can't even do my own passions without absolutely hating the end result and as a whole hating myself. Every single mistake is a reminder that I will never be good at anything and it's suffocating me. I can't live like this anymore.

I am in the process of going back to college in April, but it’s tough to not compare myself to my peers from high school. I had to take breaks because of my worsening mental health. Logically I know I needed to be hospitalized and focus on myself for a while, but part of me still feels I just needed to “try harder”. I am also scared to go back because I am scared to fail.

felt like a few weeks of slowly slowly spiraling, and then just absolutely tanking.  it's been a couple weeks since that started and every day just gives me that same sinking feeling as i drop off that cliff and keep falling.  it's only getting worse.  I already knew this wasn't the worst it could get.  nowhere near.  and I'm already constantly making suicide mentions in my head.  just like conversations with myself and that side is endlessly making suicide jokes with a little pain behind the laugh saying it.  how bad is it gonna get this time.  the last few times through is just worse than the one before.  idk how it can get worse.  but that's a lie, I know one thing i could do that could definitely make it worse.  but that's the exact thought that's terrifying me.  every time around feels like a lose more and more and more of my grip on that side of me, and I'm scared of the round where I've lost enough grip to finally give in to doing it and not being able hold up against that side.  what if this is that time.  oh so terrifyingly enchanting.  many reason to do it and a couple big ones not to.  idk

He's got Covid...and a lung infection now.
I...I don't know how else to feel except worried. 
I'm scared for him. 
He's a tough guy. A trooper...even in his 50s. He takes such good care of himself...
But I'm scared for him. I'm so scared.
And I can't let anyone know...

I can't think much about anything else. 
I try not to worry. He was doing well for a while. A full week even...but now he's gotten worse. Had an ER visit. I'm so genuinely worried...

I could either look back on this and think of how silly it was of me to worry about such a stable, sturdy, strong role model of a dad. 

Or...I could look back and regret that I didn't write sooner about him. Or talk more with him...or cherish the brief times we visited him last year. 

I'm scared...
I'm scared I won't be able to see him again... the man I love more than any man in the entire world...
I love my dad so much...
I'm tearing up right now just...thinking of him...thinking of how much he means to me.
Thinking of my earliest memories as a baby...his baby...his monkey girl. (it doesn't make sense with my username but that's what he calls me)

....I want to write about him.
I want to write about how I see him. How I grew up fearing him, laughing with him, begging him for attention, sitting atop his shoulders, riding the carousels together, listening to his music, him taking me to see my first movie, going to parks and parties, fishing and camping, watching tv together, singing together...making storybooks together, solving problems together...learning from one another...

god I'm so scared...I don't want him to leave...I don't want to think!...that he could die...
And I won't even get to say goodbye...

I have a hard time apologizing for my mistakes. Not because I don’t see anything wrong with what I’ve done or not because I don’t care enough to say sorry. It takes me a lot of courage and time to apologize because I always think that no matter how much I say sorry or try to fix or make up for what I’ve done, I’ll always never be enough and that people are going to be disappointed at me anyway.

It’s harder and hurts even more when the person I apologize to says these words to my face. That my sorry is useless because I can’t do shit for myself or anyone in the first place. 

I’m trying. I’m trying to be better. I’m trying so hard but I’m just too fucking slow. I can’t keep up with people. I’m better off left behind.

I’m a minor with the NHS in the UK. (CAMHS.) 
You’re probably thinking that there must be a reason, no. I’m this close to ending it all and my therapist will just refuse to let me see the psychiatrist no matter how many times I ask. 
If I do attempt it will be successful, so it’s not like I’ll have multiple attempts ie. they may give me meds after one.

What do I say to get them to think more about giving me them? They’re so reluctant. I see people complain 24/7 about how they dish out meds on a platter. But it’s the opposite for me and there is absolutely no reason. 

I’ve done my research and I know the side affects. But no therapy will work now.

do you feel as though you can't exist outside of your depressive thoughts? like you've had this struggle for so long you can't see yourself apart from it. you are merged and inseparable.

no matter how much I wish to be a positive go lucky person, I simply cannot see myself being one. cannot ever see myself enjoying life. I grew up together with it and it grew together with me.

it is comforting, somehow, to stay wrapped up in this cocoon of dread. it's the only thing I know and being anything else but a sad little bitch is terrifying. being away from my usual dark thoughts is foreign and feels fake.

Life is a game of chance and I got the short straw in almost every possible way. I grew up in a rural town in a second world country, where I suffered constant social isolation and negativity. My parents marriage was one held together only by the common belief that a broken marriage would ruin the happiness of their children. My father's bad mood and sadistic temper towards both me, my siblings and my mother was something I grew accustomed to. I can count the number of times I was praised by my father with one hand, I was unwanted, a freak in his eyes. When I was 16 my mother died from a progressing neurodegenerative disease and watching her worsen everyday, the only source of affection I ever got broke me more than anything else. I also grew up very poor, food and water on the table and not much left for developing passions. I always loved photography, fiddling with electronics and geography. However I could never follow these passions due to the cost of equipment (camera,lens, electronic parts that weren't rusted from a junkyard).

I was the weird loner kid in school. From a young age, my facial dropping from Bell's palsy and muscular weakness isolated me a freak in the eyes of those around me. Even beyond my horrendous physical appearance, my personality was always different. I never liked sports and could not play many competitively due to muscular issues, and instead was always fascinated by the natural world, collecting insects and exploring terrain. I did not fit into any social groups and was a victim of bullying by both peers and staff during my time in education. 

My main goal in my teenage years was to study as hard as I could to escape the social and economic situation I grew up in, but my undiagnosed adhd and learning difficulties meant I couldn't stand to sit the school leaving exams needed for 3rd level in my country. When I was 18, I left my town and went to the capital city, where I was taken on as a sort of apprentice by the friend of a kind man who showed my kindness and support in my teen years. 

I now work in repair and crafts, making enough money to pay rent, eat and pay learning classes, that's it. I'm 29 now and have accepted I will never have any form of romantic partner or close friends. What I wanted more than any material possession my whole life was the love of a partner, or the sharing of interests with a close friend, but I'm painfully weaning myself off these hopes. Sometimes in my dreams I fall in love with a girl and experience growing up through life together, all the happiness and love it brings, before crashing back down in pathetic melancholy to the real world.

Every day I suffer at my job due to worsening neuromuscular symptoms, putting myself through that pain just so I can still eat and be a living thing, without the any of the joys of human creation. I just see no point in carrying on. I can't escape my situation with living in a developing world country where people like me are actively avoided and my genetic inheritance of neuromuscular issues is likely to lead me to the suffocating slow death my mother experienced. I don't see how there can be light at the end of this tunnel. I've abstained from drug use my whole life, seeing it as the short term crutch it is. But maybe if it gives me some shot of comfort I've seldom experienced, it might be worth it, even if it kills me.

I've lurked these subreddits for a while now and understand depression is very relative to your social surroundings, how great life is compared to them compared to you. But when you're at the bottom of the barrel like I am, those small defects in your life is only something I could wish for. Don't any of the sources of happiness in your life for granted and stay strong.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz10ro/asking_friends_for_reassurance/
I was wondering if it's bad to ask a friend for some reassurance?

I don't have a super close relationship with any of my friends. (Mostly my fault because I'm shy). So they don't know what I feel on a day to day basis. 

But sometimes I feel pretty shitty and like nobody cares about me. And all I'm really looking for is reassurance that some of my friends still like me or care about me. I do know they do still want me there, but I always think that they dont.

I understand that asking for reassurance might come of as if I'm fishing for compliments or putting my burden on them, and I really don't want to do that to anyone.

My sister knows im depressed. But she never makes an effort to try and talk to me or ask me if I'm doing okay unless I start that conversation with her. When I see her put so much effort into her friends or her boyfriend it kinda hurts. For Christmas she spent hundreds of dollars on specific things her boyfriend liked. She got me a bathrobe and some socks. I spent a while customizing her gift and filling it with stuff i know she loves .I saw her grab the pair of socks while we were at the store together, it seems like im a second thought to her.I know she's not obligated to buy me anything but it still hurts. She does try occasionally but it seems like she doesn't care and I feel like I've got no one left to reach out to.

I registered for a FOID card today. I haven't been hospitalized in at least 6 years. I have at least severe depressive disorder. I tried to make an exit bag using a chainsaw engine right before I was put in the hospital the first time back then. I have made myself a force to be reckoned with since that time. I have a great job, as a plumber ((I actually really love the job)), and I am very present in my family's life. I have been helping everyone around me be better by leaps and bounds according to them... I still hate myself so fucking much... I do want to say that the suicidal ideation is usually fleeting, and I have become really good at distracting myself with things like work ((lol, just tough it out like a good blue collar boi right?)). I'm not gonna lie, I may have made a terrible decision... I started interacting with my ex in a very heavy emotional way. She also has mental disorders, and flips from sweet to savage unpredictably. We've not been having the best experience lately to say the least. On a whim of self destruction ((as people like me are want to do lol)) I registered for a FOID card ((which I kinda always wanted tbh)). I really do trust myself, and my goals of not breaking my loved one's hearts, but I know there is absolutely a risk there. This is mostly a vent/rant/please console me if you have the energy, post. I hope everyone who reads this is mostly winning their own mental battles, and are learning something new every day.

I don't have anyone to talk to when I feel like this so ill just write here

the world feels grey. blank. I feel like nothing. my body is weak, I barely have the energy to walk anymore. my brain is so foggy I can hardly speak or write coherently anymore.

I don't like my life right now. there is no one I want to talk to. nowhere I want to be. the things I've always wanted, I don't even care about anymore. I don't like people anymore. I don't like the state of the world. everyone is so relentlessly ugly and hateful, even the people I thought were my friends. everyone only thinks about themselves.

in general I just feel like a burden and like I'll amount to nothing and there's nothing worth amounting to anyway. this world is just nothing and being alive is so pointless.

The hatred that used to take over my life, I felt bc I always gave into my immediate response to negative situations—bottling it up, internationalizing and projecting my frustrations onto others bc I’m weak...who I am..the further removed I am from others the happier I am even if I can’t express it it’s there..like a ghost..this is for the best, I’m ok I just need to get my thoughts in order sometimes, YEAH I don’t hate myself, I don’t hate anyone..haha I can’t tell anymore it’s scary I can’t tell anything and I can’t stop thinking about it...past me wouldn’t be able to deal w this..not ideal but better..I’m stronger..that’s right I wanted this

I’ve loved my whole life trying to fit in.
I think I’ve don’t and ok job, I have a few close friends.
But I’m 29 and I work a bartender.
Everyone else seems to fit in.
I can’t seem to connect with anyone.
I’m always out of the conversation, everyone else hooks up, or hangs out, or even talks to each other and I’m not a par of it.
I’ve worked several jobs and it’s all been the same.
 The same as it’s ever been.
Im never a part of it.
Why am I always a pariah?
I care about the people I’m around and I do everything I can to show it, but no matter what I’m left to the wayside.
I’m at the point that I’m done with it, I just want to end it. Nobody would really care.
Why spend so much time and energy when nobody would even kow I’m gone?

I just thought about it for about 1 hour on my bed and now i want to kill myself, is my whole existence meaningless? Will i die and just disappear and in some years no one will remember me. For real is there any meaning of my existence? If thats the case why not end it now?

Yesterday I woke up and just stared into the void. Well by the time I had to be at work I was essentially dissociating. I was there, but none of it seemed real. Like I was in a waking dream.

After I got off work things went weird for me. A person who doesn’t usually invite me over did. And we hung out for about 2 hours. Which should be qualifying as a good thing... 

I just can’t shake this gut feeling I was being distracted from something going on and it was all a smoke screen.


Idk anymore. Maybe it was herbal paranoia. Maybe it was just insecurity. Maybe my gut is right. Maybe I’m just losing my mind...

      I am not sure what mental illness I have but I know I have one. I act normal some days I socialize. I have meaningful conversations and just in general am a social person. I had been feeling worse and worse mentally lately before it would be just every other day but recently it’s been every day and every hour of just crippling sadness. I also seem to be super mean to people just to make myself feel better and then I feel bad apologize and try to change but I never do. I have lost many great friends like this. I’ve also never told my parents, siblings, or close friends the extent of my pain. Reason I don’t tell my close friends is because I feel that on a day where I feel normal and act like a dick I feel that they’ll use it against me, I don’t want that. Reason I don’t tell my parents is because they are constantly in pain as well and I feel that my problems don’t even come close to theirs. Reason I don’t tell my siblings is because I don’t want them to see me as weak. 
      I have also tried drugs to fill the emptiness I feel consuming me. This only became an addiction that I am not proud of at all. Some nights I would feel my heart beating out of my chest and it would feel as if it would skip beats and sometimes it legit felt like death was awaiting and I kept smoking and would not care. I would sleep some nights feeling as though I would die and I just wouldn’t care and said to myself if I die tonight oh well. I am also seeing many changes all around me as I am soon to be a senior and I will soon have to move out. My friends are becoming more independent and simply don’t hangout as much. My parents are going through a really hard time together and it hurts me to see them suffer. My life only seems to be getting worse in worse as I long for someone anybody to be able to talk to about my problems. Just the other night I was seriously contemplating killing my self with knife in hand. I just want my pain to go away.

Im so sick of this.. The social media, the video games, the stupid TV,  the phones...  How have we become so lost? I remember when people used to actually talk and hold a conversation and now times are changing, you see your friends less and less, everyone is focused on growing their social media and it sickens me. I remember when we weren't all distracted as a whole. I remember when my parents didn't have to be worried about me and my siblings playing outside until dark. And then things got worse, the people got worse, now you can't turn your back on a child for one second without a million worries going through your brain. 


About 2 years ago I woke up in my head.. I had a major realization. Social media does not matter for anything. I completely stopped posting to Facebook and instagram and let me tell you I'm feeling the most free I ever have since I stopped. Why post your food before you eat? Why do people think you care what theyre eating? Just eat the food... we are all being brainwashed and it really shows, seeing the people on Facebook and Instagram just pouring their secrets and half nude pictures out to the internet, where they will stay for eternity in a massive cloud server somewhere and possibly be held against you in the future. I noticed the effect of putting down the apps for good in no time. Im here for my daughter more, and it made me a better person because it narrows down what you have to focus on. And for me that is my family firstly, and secondly gaining wealth. So now i have 2 major goals to focus on and none of the bullshit to distract me. 

The only thing is, since everyone else is so addicted to social media this makes it a very lonely place for those who do not want or trust these services. Sometimes I feel as if i was born into the wrong generation. I wish I could go back to when things weren't so industrialized. Any comment is appreciated as it would be someone to talk to. If you made it this far Thanks for reading my post.

I dont even really want anyone to respond tbh. But I dont want to be alive anymore. Its taken a long time to get back to this point but I'm numb again. I'm not having panic attacks or crying or punching walls. I'm just tired. I'm so so tired. Normally I'd write in detail whats bothering me. So many times I've written paragraphs and paragraphs about my bizarro ridiculous life.

I just can't anymore. I have nothing left to give. I am so utterly exhausted. I dont want to be alive anymore. I dont have the energy to write anymore here. Even rolling over in bed seems impossible. I just want to lie here and just be left to fade away. Just some nice quiet and then a really really long sleep. That sounds so nice right now.

I'm just so tired.

I’m shitty at maintaining most relationships because I get tired halfway through. I have a shit sleep schedule. I have a hard time empathizing with people. I often want to help others but my motivation means jack shit since I only am actually able to help others when it’s easy. I suck at personal hygiene. I love to drink and I’m also addicted to caffeine. I have the worst eating habits: I both starve and stuff myself. I vent to others even if it doesn’t help me because sometimes I like the attention. I just want to OD on meds and alcohol because I’m too self destructive and selfish of a person that it’s easier to kill myself than to learn how to actually be helpful to society.

Or maybe I don’t want to kill myself? Maybe I’m insecure and I just want to taste a neat death experience just to see who cares about me and who doesn’t.
 
But no matter what, nothing changes the fact that I’m garbage. And I’m stupid to think I deserved to think anything else.

so i’ve been messaging this guy i met online for almost a year and i just figured out that he has been manipulative to me this whole time and i realized once i had already sent ummm pictures to him. here’s why. he would tell me that he loved me but i wasn’t interested so i said no. he usually responded by saying that he was going to kill himself because no girls ever loved him back. after a while, he began to not give me that attention anymore and took advantage of me not getting much love and attention at home to make me want to do something to get that attention back. at first it was cutting, but this past week it escalated to sending said pictures to him to make him be in love with me again. this makes me sound crazy i know but he just did so many little things to twist my thinking to lead to this. i feel like i’ve given a part of myself away and my depression has definitely gotten worse because of him kind of encouraging it

when i try to choose myself, then i'm being selfish. i can't control others and i try to be as empathetic as i can. but it's never good enough and i'm tired of never being good enough

I have noticed myself getting worse and worse emotionally to the point were a mildly emotional video sets me off. I feel so lonely and alone. And I know this has warped my perception of my self and other people. There are times were I identify with the feminine and other times where I feel like an alien unable to comprehend people. I want a relationship so badly and yet the only thing I have to go on are slice of life anime and the plot of vanilla hentai manga. I know they aren't real. And yet I want that version of love. Sad isn't it. And since it isn't real I don't know if I'll find anything to make this feeling go away. And to find a real relationship it needs to be a person I'm attracted to. The problem being I'm not attractive enough to get the sort of person I'm attracted to. It seems like the only way would be to find someone as broken as me and that seems do right predatory and unhealthy. Of course a lot of the ways I see things is probably unhealthy. Sometimes, when I see a highschool or childhood romance plot I feel my I missed out completely while I was growing. I barely had any friends let alone relationships. This time around it was [this](https://youtu.be/IDYxLj3bYds) that set me off this time around. It felt so relatable and I then I felt guilty for it cause I wasn't abuse so what's my excuse for feeling this way. Sorry for the unorganized thoughts.

I don't know what happened. I spent 8 days in two psych facilities at the end of December, the week of Christmas. When I got out, I was feeling better. I quit my job that was making me suicidal. I was then taking care of my in-laws who had Covid, then they gave me Covid. 

I was doing okay, I though. My spirits were up. Then, I crashed again. I just feel empty. I sleep until 11 or noon most days. I think my cat knows something is wrong because he is with me 90% of the day and then sleeps with me and my husband at night.

I'm not playing video games like I love to do. I'm picking fights with my husband. I know I'm depressed. 

This sucks.

the title is kinda vague i think? but i’ll explain, so pretty much i cut myself and anytime i do it i end up telling my girlfriend like a week later or she finds out on her own and then she gets really really mad and just tells me to stop cutting, but i used to tell her every single time i did it but since she always reacted with anger towards me i’m kinda distancing so i don’t have to deal with her anger towards me. and i know it seems weird that i tell her when i cut and it might seem like i’m doing it for attention, but i also tell my therapist when i cut and she usually says something that ends up helping me, so i try it with my girlfriend and she only ever reacts with anger.



[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kyf8ss/i_wish_i_was_one_of_the_shiny_happy_people/
My mental illnesses have taken over my life. I had a conversation with someone the other day who recently moved to NYC to pursue his dreams. He sounded so hopeful and optimistic about his future. He talked about his classes and his plans to work hard to accomplish his goals. I’m definitely happy for him, but i noticed that the one thing everyone seems to have that I don’t is that spark. That hope. That reassurance that everything will be okay. I don’t have that. I don’t think about my future at all. Truthfully I’m not even sure I have one anymore. The only thing I look forward to is death. I wish for a second that I could wake up and not hate everything. I wish I could actually live instead of sleeping my life away. But that’s the problem. I’ve wished and hoped and prayed and dreamed. I’ve worked at trying to improve my life/brain. Nothing works. Sometimes I think people are naive for looking at the world with such bright eyes. But the problem definitely isn’t them. It’s me. It’s not my job to take away someone else’s hope. I just don’t have anything left to rely on. I take life how it goes now.

Thanks for letting me vent.

Hi all,

I have severe OCD, anxiety, and crippling depression.

Today ive had my first dose of 50mg Desvenlafaxine. And wow this is a weird medication. 

For starters, several hours after my dose, I definitely felt some effects from it. 
I felt an alleviation of my OCD symptoms, and reasonable decrease of my level of depression and I feel slightly euphoric.

One of the side effects is sexual dysfunction, and I've definitely experienced that on my first day as well. 

My overall question is: this medication is supposed to take a few weeks to work. 

Why am I feeling effects on the first day??

Why am I also experiencing sexual issues on the first day? That shouldn't be possible, and I know its being caused by the medication because it feels the same way ive exepreinced it on other antidepressants. 

It's just really weird that this is all happening on the first day, and I don't understand it.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz0yk6/i_want_to_take_a_breakleave_my_life_for_about_6/
 

I want to take a break/leave my life for about 6 months at least, I’m currently in college but im more and more realizing that this isn’t for me, since I already changed my major once. I recently turned 23 and am nowhere near to finishing college and rather close to having a burn out. I dont feel right, stopped talking to my family for over a year even tho im still living at home. Can’t get out of my bed for weeks (more like months) and am just unhappy in general, can’t find any joy in anything. So the idea of leaving my current life in western europe for a couple of months and moving to a little apartment in the Mediterranean my family owns came to my mind. 

The biggest problem that occurs to me is: I need to start making money online without any real skills, 400-600 $/€ would be enough. But not with braindead jobs like surveys or anything. Does anyone know a subreddit to post this in?

In my time off I thought about getting more in touch with the nature ( plants, etc) {subreddit?}

Start working out {subreddit?}

Read a lot of books to improve my mental and physical health and also my knowledge and maybe go into philosophical stuff {subreddit?}

There are so many more things in my head but since im close to burn out I can’t sort them and tend to lose my overview instantly, but I hope u got the idea of what I was trying to say so if anyone knows subreddits that could find, please let me know.

PS: you might’ve realized already but I’m new to reddit

For the past three weekends I've had breakdowns. Had one a couple days ago, too. Then today I had to get one of my pet rats put to sleep. Her name was Essi. Because of this fucking virus, I couldn't wait in the office as they took her away to be PTS, as I would usually do before Covid. I had to sit in the waiting room, which is in a giant pet store full of people and noise, while trying my best not to break down in tears. Then, I wasn't allowed to see her and say goodbye after, as I've done with my last pet rats. I didn't get to say goodbye. She was just gone. Then, I would usually use the free wifi in the coffee shop next door to call a taxi home. They disabled the free wifi so I had to walk home with an empty pet carrier.   
I'm so sorry that I didn't get to say goodbye, Essi. I'll miss you

Let me start by saying I have a rough way of dealing with my mental health, im lazy because of the fact I see no point in anything and I don't change anything in my life because I see no point. My life has been a waste, no one ever wanted me to begin with, my parents died when i was a teenager after a childhood full of abuse, im grosteque and overweight around 600 lb and im in constant pain. I haven't contributed to anything I can call my own, ive been through job after job, getting fired from some due to doing the bare minimum the only reason im not homeless is because of my best friend who believes in me and wants me to do better. but whats the point? im 25 and have accomplished nothing. I wake up day after day staring at the ceiling wondering if this will be the day I die, this is a mental hell im putting myself through. I think of suicide daily but am too scared to actually go through with it. and whenever i force myself to try something new or start working out, I look at myself in the mirror and i break.

I have a problem with taking something and dwelling on that thing forever until I find a new topic and it cycles day after day, the same topic could get stuck in my head for weeks of nail bitting nervous breakdowns and its making me hate myself more and more. Anything fun in my life I will ruin by overthinking it to its core and then I find no interest in it anymore. Any new hobby I would try I would only focus on what I'm doing wrong and I see all the flaws but when I can't fix it I get discouraged and it builds up until I just drop it one day and never touch it again

Gf just said she wishes we never dated so we could stay friends, proceeded to explain how she meant she never wanted to have a break up between us because she knows we won’t be together forever. On top of everything I have been through, and every botched relationship, this final blow has struck at everything I had left. No more. Today I die, might not kill myself because I couldn’t even do that right (5-0), but as I fall asleep over FaceTime after we just had that conversation, my corpse will decompose onto my matress, and my soul will rot to hell. I deserved this. The love of my life and it’s now become a nuclear time bomb. The only good thing I’ve had. I have died tonight.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz0ia4/how_do_i_approach_this/
When I was 14 and failed suicide (my brother saved me) I thought "Well, I'm gonna try to get better. Even if I didn't have a chance at childhood and my adolescence is surely gonna be really hard, might as well give it all to have a nice adulthood. Life hasn't even started yet" 
Then I went to therapy, got anti depressants from a psychiatrist for a year and a half to be able to function somehow, did group therapy, learned healthy coping mechanisms. Four years into it I recovered from my ED and successfully entered college. Now I'm 22 and I love what I study, I like my job, my friends, haven't cut myself in 5 years and I feel like I can sustain what I have and accomplish even more. Life has started for me and I am where I wanted to be when I was a little girl in hell.

The only problem is I am still miserable. I struggle with a complex ptsd that sometimes sends me into depressive episodes (3 months long or so). Mostly I socially isolate and dissociate to cope because asking for help takes me really fucking long and talking seems like lifting a car.

I knew I was going to have to keep making an effort. I knew my problems weren't going to disappear, that choosing the right things for me was my goal instead of just "doing what feels good" or "feeling happy". But maybe deep down I hoped I would feel happy or that things would get easier. 

Now I'm two months and a half into an episode that is making everything extra super hard. Life has started and I'm still stunted. I'm tired of being ill. I'm tired of feeling like everything I've built doesn't amount to anything because it's just all the same and it won't get better. My worst fear is graduating, getting a good job in my field and this whole "is that all there is?" situation in my head getting worse. I'm not even talking about a relationship because I always knew I couldn't afford that emotionally. I also know I should go back to treatment and seek help but it feels so much harder than before, when I was a kid who had nothing.

Now I am a young woman (I think? Not yet an adult but not a teen anymore?) who has her own life after trying so fucking hard to get her shit together. I'm devastated that what I thought would help me, is actually worsening my mental health. I don't know anymore. I can still rationally fight how very little I care about anything lately and other stuff my depression acting up does to me, but it's taking a toll on me. I don't know how long I'm gonna be able to do it on my own until I snap and do something fucked up. I genuinely don't know how to ask for help or what solution there may be. In my head no matter what I do I'm gonna be like this but I don't want my depression to take the wheel and drive me to do drugs etc etc again. 

How did anyone else approach this problem or introduced it to a therapist? Thank you for reading until the end if you did!

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kytxum/am_i_suicidal/
Heyo, I just want to start off by saying that I used to be a lot more depressed a year ago and was definitely suicidal then, but things have gotten better and most days (5 days of the week) I can go without thinking suicide, but its the other 2 days I'm worried about. I do have activities that I picked up before to help when I was worse like working out, reading, or drawing so that's not so much a problem anymore. I guess what I want to know is it normal to think like this? For me it is but I don't want it to be that way. I have considered therapy and I'm not in a situation where I cant get a therapist thankfully but I don't know if I even need it.

Anyway, those are my thoughts if you have any more questions or anything just ask, thanks for your time.

Edit: I also want to say that the suicidal thoughts have not escalated to plans or suicide notes in over a year, more like just thoughts that stick with me all day now, sorry for exaggerating.

38f and I’m feeling so depressed. I have 3 girls all under 9 years old. I have a full time job and a supportive husband. I’m tired of being away from home working and coming home taking care of the house and because of COVID being unable to go anywhere. Weekend suck cause kids tire me out but I’m already played out for a full weeks work. I get zero alone time so I can’t recover from the week and then it’s time to go back to work. My head is barely above water. I miss shopping. I miss evenings with friends having appies and drinks. I am overweight and struggling to lose 20-30 lbs. I feel so down and don’t know how to get out of this.  I live in a cold climate so heading outside is difficult (and so much work).

I planned to finish all of this weeks homework today but didn’t. Week 2 of my last semester of college and I’m already fucking everything up. This was completely my fault and I had every opportunity to finish it earlier. At this point, I’m starting not to give a fuck about school and that’s the only thing I try to care about. New year, new classes, but same ole procrastination.

I've been numb for months now, idk if it's normal or not. 

It didn't bother me till today; one of my family members died, one who was actually close to me, and in the middle of the sad crying people, I didn't know how to react, I didn't cry, I tried but nothing.

I feel nothing, I'm so empty, I should be crying and missing the family member in question, but I'm not, I cannot react to it.

I think my depression killed me emotionally, I guess this is what years of untreated diagnosed depression does.

So, I've called someone close to me multiple times. After multiple warnings, I was blocked. I'm fully aware I deserve it. I felt angry for a while because I felt betrayed I felt like I couldn't express my feelings. They hated it whenever I tried venting. But, when it was the other way around years ago- I helped. For a while I thought "Whaddya, too good for me?" I realized that was the wrong way to think. I realize why this person had personal vendetta against me. I'm too clingy and annoying. I'm a desperate, brooding prick. I feel guilty for this. I gave up, I realized when to quit when it was too late. I felt like it was unbalanced, but I clearly was wrong. I'm sorry. And if whomever it may concern is reading this, I just want to say I'm sorry for making your life hell. You want to move on and I respect that. I always get shut down or betrayed. Now I realize that I'm nothing. I just lost the only friend I ever had.

As you saw from the title, I haven’t cut myself in a while, but after another failed attempt by my brother to make me become Christian again, I did it. My family doesn’t accept me for being an atheist and I hate them all for it. Actually, everyone but my dad. He’s the only person in my family that I will keep in contact with when I hopefully become estranged of this family and I love him so much. He is the only one that I can call a true friend and I love him for it

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kypvaq/i_feel_like_im_slowly_disintegrating/
Im so exhausted lately. I got to school, go home and lay and bed, cry, go to sleep, wake up, and do everything all over again. I don't think I have an actual depressive disorder, but it's more of a feeling.

My self loathing is so strong to the point where I don't want myself to be in exsistence.I feel ugly I can't even look in the mirror. I hate my personality so much. Like seeing a picture of another girl will send me crying for hours. Seeing funny people makes me sad and realize I'll never be anything special to anyone. It's exhausting. I don't find joy in anything. Video games used to be awesome and so much fun, but I've lost all interest. I like cooking, it's fun, but I cant bring myself to get up and do it. My taste is different and everything that was my favorite now tastes like absolute shit so now I don't even want to eat. 

 I feel left out, unimportant, the smallest things hurt me. But I say I'm fine to the people around me and when they discover I'm upset I just say I'm being dramatic and come up with an exuse. Which I know I am being dramatic. Im sad over nothing. I feel empty, but yet so full of sadness at the same time. Im 15, so I know I'm only being dramatic and it's all probably teenage hormones or whatever but it's how I actually feel. It's probably just me blowing everything out of proportion and being dramatic, but still I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm on my last straw. Everyone around me is used to my mood. So when I make a small cry for help, they try to help but I've discovered no words are really working to help me anymore. Im just here, my feelings are just there, very intense but yet I still feel so empty. 

But I just had to get that off my chest, I don't know who to turn to, but putting it out in the world takes a bit of pressure off my chest. Sorry for going on a long complaining spree. If you read this, thank you for ur time.

I have struggled with depression for years. Been on and off with therapists, and it feels like nothing is helping. And to top it all off, me and my bf of 2 years broke up. I am devastated, and I feel so alone and like nothing matters. I've been crying non-stop, and it feels like nothing I try to distract myself with helps. The constant fear of being alone, the constant fear of the corona virus. I can't do this...

I haven't seen my therapist in over a month and i can't cope. He has been away for Christmas then had to cancel my appointment on Tuesday because of a family emergency. A lot of really bad stuff has happened to me and I have nobody to talk about it with and I'm feeling so hopeless and rock bottom. I feel like I'm being a burden for reaching out to my friends because I haven't been able to see my therapist for a while






















[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kyucbf/just_ranting/
Confused, I don't know what to do anymore. I have no real friends, no family members talk to me not even my own parents. Only when they need something. My phone never goes off unless it's my alarm for work. I feel like nothing. An empty void is where my heart should be. Fake friends, only want me because I give them gifts. No more. I'm over it. Wasting money on people who can barely remember my name. 

I met a girl, we actually ended up bonding and becoming friends. For the past few months we got really close and I asked her how she felt about me. She liked me but didn't want a relationship right now. Understandable and I'm glad we can still be friends. A week went by, she's dating someone now. 

What did I do wrong? Why did she lie to me? She could've said no, I'm used to rejections. I'm honest with her, why couldn't she do the same? I don't fucking care if it ended up hurting me somewhat. She stopped talking to me, to give more of her time to her boyfriend. Cool, fuck friends

Weeks go by, I have no life. I'm turning 21 next month. I only leave my house for work, and groceries. My life is meaningless and I'm rotting away. She texted me, saying she was crying because her boyfriend cheated on her. I want her to suffer, to be in agony. I'm cold hearted to her, I laughed at her and never texted back.  What the fuck is wrong with people? You expect me to be nice after you ditched me for some fucking douchebag you met a month ago? Go fuck yourself

Do we really need emotions? Honestly, do we truly do? It brings nothing but misery to me. I don't understand anything anymore. I just want to dissapear, but I don't want to die. I don't want to exist anymore but I'm afraid to kill myself. I never wanted to be born. I was a mistake.

I hate where I live, I am financially unstable, I’m single, I have no friends, and I have a bad weed addiction. I can’t find happiness in anything anymore and I surprise my depression with weed. Because of this, I can’t pass a drug test to get a second job to get out of my financial situation and I’m stuck in this vicious cycle. I’m not happy with anything anymore, I don’t even eat anymore or see the point. Not even my own family makes me happy enough to want to live.

Just finished applications to all of my schools, a decent chunk of them being hard schools to get into. I've always been smart, but my junior year was god awful and my senior year is nothing spectacular.

My depression was so bad and controlling yesterday it quite literally paralyzed me in one spot. I could not take a step further, it was nearly impossible. I was with my SO and he immediately tried to help me  overcome it and encourage me. It helped for a little bit, but it came back multiple times throughout the day. I could tell it was frustrating for him, and it broke me even more to see him trying so hard to help me to no avail. By the end of the day, he was almost begging me to tell him how he could help. I. DON'T. KNOW. And it feels like I will never know.

He is a goofy, spunky, generally happy person. It hurts me to see him down because of me. I want to be better for him. But how can I tell him what would help me if I don't know that myself?

I don’t really know what I want here. To vent? Support? To feel like I’m not alone? I don’t know. 

I’ve never felt like this before. I’ve had severe health anxiety before but never depression this extent. I feel awful. I feel disconnected from the world, like I don’t feel like I’m really here. Kind of like I’m in a dream. 

I feel irritable and agitated easily which makes communicating with my flat mates difficult. They can be laughing and joking with each other and I just can’t concentrate on what they are saying. It doesn’t go in. I’m too inside my head. And then when I do talk and communicate I get so tired and irritable I go to my room. 
 
I’m overly emotional. And my thoughts are becoming more and more negative by the day. I’m starting to forget being happy and how to think positively. 

This all began about a month or so ago and is just getting worse and worse.  My GP says I’m depressed. I’ve always been so positive and upbeat.  I’m training to be a mental health nurse. My life is great. (Other than the pandemic).  But I have just felt so low and so alone. 


I’m terrified that it’ll get too much and I will want to hurt myself. I’m not great at dealing with feeling like this 24/7.

Ive been in bed all week todays the first day im out of bed and still feel bad,no energy just sad and mad
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz24zo/just_need_to_vent/


I don’t even know where to start. I guess, I will start at the beginning because I just need to vent. When I was 6yo my parents pulled me out of school and made me and my siblings homeschool. I have always felt like it was my fault we have to go through homeschool because they took me and my brother out of school because I was having issues, homeschooling made my brother extremely depressed and he started cutting.

You know how sometimes you do fire drills in school? Well, we had to do CPS drills. Every time  there was a knock at the door I was scared it was CPS or a school inspector.
My parents completely isolate me I haven’t talked to someone other than family in about 7 years ,and I don’t even know what someone my age looks like. They haven’t even brought me to the doctor or dentist in about 7 years even though I faint or get extremely dizzy every time I stand up I’m also underweight and I bruise very easily, and I’m pretty sure I have anemia. On top of it all they argue with me and treat me different than my other siblings. It is all really draining and lonely. I can’t stand it anymore I’m so lonely I started cutting and I’ve considered suicide I just don’t know what to do anymore, anyway thank you for reading.



[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz23tu/i_need_help_i_need_some_input_wtf_am_i_going/
I’ve noticed so many things off about me. I need help, I know. I just want your input. Just so I know that it’s just depression or it’s something else. Will some medication fix me, or do I need something else? Just for a side note, I went through a lot of trauma while quarantining with my family.

First, I don’t have an appetite for any food. I had a shit eating schedule before but now, I can go a day and a half without eating anything and I won’t feel any different. I started eating at regular intervals but I don’t have an appetite. I’ve lost so much weight in a week. 

Secondly, I’m constantly tired. I’m so exhausted. I feel like I’m living in a dream. Maybe it’s dissociation or it’s not but, I feel so fucking tired 24/7. I try to get up from the couch but I fall back down. 

Thirdly, I don’t want to have affection. Whether it be platonic or romantic, I don’t want it. It feels wrong and it feels out of place. I used to have people I would gush over but I don’t feel any particular way about anyone.

Fourth, i don’t feel anything. I can’t cry. I can’t get angry. I can’t get happy. I have to force myself to not be so monotone. After a big traumatic events happen, I just go back to my room and keep watching my show like nothing happened. 

Fifth, I feel like I’m not really here. Like I’m in a daze. Like none of this is real. After I got kicked out of my house, and told my friend, for some reason I had the urge to giggle. I just am not here. It’s like I’m living life through a VR headset or something. It’s not reality, it’s someone else’s reality. 

Sixth, I look in the mirror and I don’t recognize myself. I look off and different. The only upside to this is that I used to think I’m ugly but now when I look at the stranger in the mirror, I find her very pretty. I guess you’re your own worst critic. 

Seventh, I can’t sleep. No amount of melatonin or strong pills will put me to sleep. I can’t sleep. I just can’t. I’ve tried to better my physical health but I just can’t sleep still. 

I’m completely ruined because of the shit that happened to me in 2020. I used to have so much potential, I had the highest grades in my courses. I had a scholarship even. I lost all of that and I’m struggling to pass my classes. The people in my life have fucking ruined me and I don’t think I’ll ever go back to that bright person I once was.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kywdum/mentally_exhausted/
On the small scale I’m tired of things in the world I’m tired of feeling pressured to participate and pressure to be an adult. 

On a large scale I look for skills but never have the capacity to follow through when I see I’m not that naturally skilled. Over the years I’ve tried writing , sketching, painting, bought a ukelele and never even tried it, I recently
Bought resin and thought I’d be good because it’s such a technical process I just need to follow and at first I really really liked it. I well I still do and then I jumped to make something only people who have some experience would do and tried to make a resin light. The resin came out fucked and idk how to fix it I havnt touched it in two weeks and I feel like a complete quitter and failure I know that’s kind of pathetic  and people that want to succeed and learn a skill keep trying but it just feels so hard to keep trying.  

I want my mind to just feel ambitious to feel creative I know if I had an outlet I’d feel like I wanted to do this life participation thing. But honestly I wanna spend every day in my bed and shut the world out but I keep getting up everyday and doing what I have to do. School work life family dogs boyfriend and there are definite moments of enjoyment but in the back of my mind I just want to hibernate

Well, hi, welcome to my ted talk, I just wanted to say a few things I learned in the last few months about my own stuff no one cares about.
I found out that I feel normal when I’m drunk, 
Found out how much music really influences my thoughts, I started appreciating it much more, it can push me into the worst time of my life, and also pick me up back to the surface. I learned that the dreams I have are the ultimate shithole of everything I fear and hate. 

I learned that it was important for me to have a good fucking meal, because damn, the food I have, that’s one of the rare things that make me happy, and it better be good. I learned how much I loved my friends, and how much I fear losing them. I learned how much of a bad person I am, I learned how stupid I really am, and how those two combined can produce the ultimate douchebag of a person.

I learned that I needed to get better at absolutly anything to feel better, how much I really needed someones attention and how much critic hurts me, even though I always said the opposite. I know how lonely I am now. Thanks for anyone how read this, love you guys.

A sleep for eternity. 

Right now a sleep of eternity sounds nice.

No worries.

No rules.

No fights.

No stress.

No heart ache.

No anxiety.

I would never have to worry about hurting anyone.

But also,

With my death I would hurt the ones I love.

It won't get rid of the pain…

I would just pass it along.

I would have No love

No good moments.

No sunny days.

I would never get to grow old with my friends.

I won't be there to graduate.

I won’t get to marry my love, 

Or watch our kids grow-up

I will not bet their when my friends and family need me 

The most.

I won't be there for any of it.

Therefore, it's not worth it.

All of my depression is rooted in me never learning to stand up for myself or act like a man. Recently, I went on a fly fishing trip with my mother, sister, and cousin. The instructor was very insulting. He insulted all of us by saying, "What's wrong with you?! Do you have ADD or something?" when everyone stopped paying attention to his long monologue about the fish in the river. He insulted me. At one point he even yelled at me to do something, and I obeyed. I hated him. I am not sure why I obeyed. I should have at least disregarded him. What could he have even done to me? I am such a coward. 

My testosterone is only 464 Ng/dL which is on the much lower end of average given my age of 29. I have yet to measure my cortisol, but I behave like a male with low T and high cortisol. I am obese and have untreated sleep apnea (have yet to be able to sleep with the CPAP mask on). I am the most abhorrent example of a coward, and I am quite certain my girlfriend would have left me if she saw my abhorrent display of weakness. Fortunately for me, there was no gf at the time. I keep having humiliating experience after experience because I have a combination of stupidity (serious ADD or learning disability) and cowardice. My family is sick of me, and I think they love me but will never truly respect me as a man (perhaps they should not). I feel like the tribal boy who failed to kill the lion and is allowed to live in the village but will never be considered a man. I keep wanting to kill the lion, but when my chance arises, I only freeze. I then go on to regret my very existence. Perhaps one day I will kill the lion, but today I feel as though I have missed my chance forever.

I am looking to hear from men who have killed the lion. Perhaps you were the abhorrent coward that I am, but you came out on the other side.

I don’t feel cared for by anyone. I just feel like I’m causing them to get scarred or uncomfortable by being open. I really think people only feel obligated to ask if I’m okay if I’m open about how I feel, not that they love me and care about my well-being, care about me being happy. I really want someone who I know will listen not because I’m paying them or they feel like they have to or because they feel sorry for me. I don’t know if I’m the only one that feels this way or if it’s just me.

I just got news that we are going away to an old family friends house for a couple days and I would do anything to not be able to go. I hate seeing people that I have not seen in a long time so do you guys have any tips on what to do there to avoid people respectfully?  
(I have some books coming in the mail which would be useful right about now however they won't arrive until later this week or next week which is a big bummer.

It's my birthday today lol, went out with my only friend & my sister.  My sister pre gamed so I could drive us there & got super fucked up.  My friend ended up changing plans to go home with her boy she's talking to.  I hit the bullseye for the first time & no one noticed, I had to literally scream at both of them & hit on Jennifer before giving up on trying to get their attention & just wait for her to be done on her phone & my sister to be done dancing (alone).  I just had a shitty night because I can't let myself be happy.  I need to let those things not bother me, I should know by now that that's just how shit is.  & no one likes me, I'm boring and worthless.  I just wish I would kill myself already why do I only think about it every single day

After days of thinking it and realizing, it is true.

If I disappear or died tomorrow, who would know?

I don't talk with anyone (last chat was a verification code for an app 2 weeks ago)
I don't play video games with anyone, despite playing  a lot 
I don't have discord communities or groups who I frequently talk to
Don't have friends who check on
Don't have/use social media

Only my family which to be honest, doesn't really care about me. Maybe disappearing is the answer to stop bothering with my existence

Has anyone else missed out on the stimulus checks because they are too depressed? Like I couldn't function this year so I didn't work at all, leaving me to not file taxes. Now I don't get the checks because I haven't been able to function at all. I hope i'm not the only one in this boat because it feels like a huge loss.

I can’t help but feel like a shitty future is inevitable for me. I can’t do anything on my own, I’m out of college two years now and I’m stuck at home with my parents. I have a useless degree in communications and a little under 30k in student debt that’s constantly looming over my head. Sure I can use Covid as an excuse but I know I’d still be here otherwise. Job I worked at and got fired from I could barely handle, and it was just washing dishes at a restaurant. I have Relapsing/Remitting Multiple Sclerosis which fucks with my sense of balance, makes me get tired a lot and faster than people normally do, and it fucks with my concentration. I have friends but it feels like every relationship I have is fragile as fuck, and one day they will all fall apart because of me acting like a fucking idiot. My fears of me fucking up everything have lead to me being more reclusive than I was in the past, I stick to myself and don’t speak too often (because when I get too confident and speak freely I say something stupid), and that’s not hard to do with quarantine but still. Everything I enjoyed in the past feels like it’s becoming a chore and a routine rather than something I actually enjoy, like playing video games, MTG or watching movies. There’s a lot more I’m dealing with but even typing this out feels fucking useless. I used to ‘jokingly’ say that in the future I’d just be some homeless crazy person living on my own so as not to be a burden to everyone else, and honestly that feels like an increasingly real possibility of what lies in my future.







[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz1m3r/emotional_blackmail_and_how_im_defeating_my/
\- I want to start by explaining how emotional blackmail works ( so many people have no idea they're being blackmailed )many of us, at some point in our lives, have been told that we are not GOOD ENOUGH, we need to do that, do this,earn more money, get a degree or whatever( in the case of my Asian family,they expect their children to be doctors and engineers, and they hate it when you follow your own passion )  to be LOVED and ACCEPTED by our families, our peers and society in general.families do this by withholding their emotional support, financial support, a place to sleep and etc.. .by taking that "satisfaction", "serotonin boost" hostage, and make you do whatever THEY want, to give you that ACCEPTANCE (remember you deserve it  no matter what, your are their child)

many parents exploit this NEED and make you do whatever they  want, it's a hostage situation, we take your "need for acceptance" hostage, you should do whatever we tell you to do, and we satisfy your need, and if u don't (and many times even if you do), we kill the hostage,we won't give u the ACCEPTANCE you deserve (again, a child needs emotional support, no matter what)and they constantly raise the bar for ACCEPTANCE.

SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE (between two people,in a family,society) ( the need to be recognised,appreciated,and to feel useful) is one of our basic needs, like sex, food, and shelter( that's why so many psychologists suggest that you find a specific group of people AKA your tribe of like-minded people, peers and help each other/appreciate each other )

Society exploits this need by making you work in a job you hate, throw away your desires and passions to make money, for what ? to feel accepted ? by whom ? people I don't even know ? or care about ?anyways

\- my storyI've been struggling with depression for 6-7 years, been on Prozac and many other drugs for years now. I've been trying to CURE my depression on my own, since nothing seems to work in these dark times .I came across many important concepts like "jungian shadow" ( shadow is whatever feelings/behaviours you suppress to be that good boy/good girl to be accepted by society (to satisfy your need for acceptance) , and as a consequence of suppressing your behaviours( good or bad) , the shadow forms and starts to evolve ) , "social acceptance" , "conformity","social status" , and "emotional blackmail"

so I began my self-therapy by intorspecting and investigating my own feelings.I've been struggling to WORK and make something useful out of myself and follow my passion for years, but everytime I wanted to start to do something, a FORCE, a wave of anxiety and fear , would hit and paralyse me, I didn't know what that force was, and why I had those fears.In my case, my family expected me to have a job/a certain university degree + have a certain kind of girl friend that I personally didn't want. they've been blackmailing/manipulating me to do whatever they want, and never gave me the satisfaction of being ENOUGH to be LOVED by them.after reading some stuff about emotional blackmail and Jungian shadow ( specially the book "Emotional blackmail" by Susan forward ) I realized, everytime I wanted to work on my passions, a voice would whisper in my ears like " no, you can't do this, you are not good enough, you are not ACCEPTED by your family if you follow your passion, you should satisfy me first (in this case, my parents expectations (it can also be society's expectations for many people ) ) "

my parents NEVER gave me the acceptance I deserved and NEVER gave me the satisfaction I needed, I've been on my own for the majority of my life, I have no emotional support and they blamed me for most of their own shortcomings. they induced guilt and fear in me by making me believe I'm not good enough and need to AT LEAST have some degrees,job,status to love/accept me . and somehow, I always felt the need to satisfy them first ( I'm stupid I guess, I couldn't see the blackmail and extortion I was in,been on my own for many years now, but they somehow instilled their expectations in me,and I internalized them )

after reading the books and articles on blackmail, and realizing how it works, re-processing my life experiences (every time I did something for myself, I was always trying to satisfy those monsters "that  didn't love me"  first  and not my own passions , I came to the conclusion that I DON'T NEED to satisfy anyone except myself ,as far as I'm concerned, they can go to HELL. just knowing that I was being blackmailed, was not enough, I needed to rethink my whole life,every experience, according to this concept.

found out that I've been suppressing all of my good parts, good behaviours,my own passions, to be that FAMILY'S good boy, SOCIETY'S GOOD BOY, for nothing. for the satisfaction I deserved, no matter what, and they never gave it to me.

and they raise the bar SO MUCH, and AS MANY TIMES as possible, for you to not feel GOOD ENOUGH , I don't care about the reasons behind it, society made them do it ? they were nobodies and want their child to be at least somebody? I don't fucking care .whatever the reason might be, I'M GOOD ENOUGH AS IT IS . I DON'T need their approval , I DON'T NEED society's( people I don't even know ) approval .

remember , you NEED social acceptance , we are social animals , you need to find your own people , your own tribe , form a social circle , support each other, do stuff together, find people that can listen and WANT to listen to your words , your ideas , cheer you up. people that you feel comfortable around them , you don't need to satisfy society's expectations to be ACCEPTED , you only need your own friends group.

I'm planning to write more about my own experience (shadow work, blackmail,society's expectations) in this sub in the future , but I felt the urge to write this short post , because I know so many people feel the same way like I did , for MANY years .

Remember, It's all a blackmail , your need for love and acceptance  is being exploited by family, friends, and society .

I'm still on my depression meds , but after many years , I feel free, I can do whatever I want, start any project without anxiety or fear of defeat, without the of fear not being "good enough", cause I don't need anyone's approval of me anymore.  


I highly recommend these books

Every time I wake up I wish I hadn’t. I wish I didn’t have to. I don’t want to be alive anymore, I seriously just hate living. My life seems so worthless and pointless and I’m just miserable. I make myself miserable, my inability to do anything right makes me miserable. It’s nauseating how much I hate myself.

Back to sleep. Closest thing to being dead. I’d sleep all day if I could.

I just hate living.

\*Almost 27

&#x200B;

I thought my life would be different than what it is now back when I was 24 and engaged. I was three weeks away from my dream wedding when all hell came crashing down.

I thought I would be two years into marriage and maybe pregnant/thinking about trying for my first baby at age 26.

Instead, I'm single as hell, no marriage or baby, and two of my younger cousins are beating me in the race to have the first great-grandchild on my mom's side.

I wanted to be the first to have a kid so bad, and now that is ruined because today my 22-year old cousin just had his first and it feels so awkward knowing that my future kids will now be younger than his!

And it hurts. The pain from my breakup and my parents involvement in it just came rushing back. 

&#x200B;

Today sucks.

&#x200B;

I'm gonna go drown myself in my favorite peach wine and try to forget about this shitty day. 

&#x200B;

Goodnight.

I’m a teen and I’m really really not happy with my life, not to the point of killing my self so you guys can chill, however I’ve only told how I feel to one person and that didn’t really go well and rn I’m trying to sleep and like always I’m overthinking and I was thinking that maybe if I told my parents about how I feel it could help, the only reason I don’t like telling people about my feeling is because I don’t really have a reason to be sad but I’m sad, I have a good family, a good home and somewhat good friends yet I’m sad af so I think if i tell people that I’m sad they will judge me and saying things like “you shouldn’t be sad” or “just be happy” or some shit like that, I don’t think I’m clinically depressed so I’ve been waiting for a couple years now to magically not feel sad but it’s been too long I don’t think it’s going away any time soon

I’ve always been depressed but the last year it’s gotten worse. I lost my job due to covid, my credit is ruined and my debt is high due to this. Also my marriage is on the rocks and I had to put my 18 year old cat to sleep on Thursday. I can’t stop crying and can’t get any motivation to get out of bed or do anything. I’ve never felt such despair before. I barely leave the house or see anyone and when I try to talk to my husband he doesn’t say anything he just says he has depression and still deals with every day life. He doesn’t comfort me or try to cheer me up. I’m scared of feeling this was and have never felt this bad before

I’ve had enough. I am such a burden to everyone. Everyone points out how nothing I do is enough, but people can’t see this is the best I can do while at the same time trying to keep a will to live. If i offed my self i know people will suffer, but I am suffering because of them. I am in so much pain and hurt and I am overwhelmed with such suffering. I have nobody to resort to. I have no more willpower to stay.

for a few years now i have been quite down, i stopped eating frequently when i first started doing gross drugs when i was about 14. I'm 19 now and 6''3 and i eat once or twice a week, i really never ever eat, i cant eat because it makes me want to throw up and my stomach always hurts, it kills my appetite if i get baked enough to have one. usually my mouth hurts if i try to eat after not eating for a day. i stopped doing drugs and haven't touched anything except liquor and weed for a year or two now. i am very depressed, but I'm worried this wont go away when i mature n grow out of this depression, if that. does this happen to everyone whos sad for awhile ?? ;/

Until we moved to this fucking country (not mentioning it), i went to School and i got bullied... i got bullied so hard for everything , from everyone, i got bullied for my clothes, face, ethnicity, accent, being short, i did even get bullied by a girl.......

This not fair, its just not, I've never bullied anyone to hurt them, i got bullied and ppl will just look, laugh, or join, i did nothing to anyone, i was so nice and weak at the same time, but now after i proceed what happend to me the last years, i can't forgive, I got so introverted, lonely, bad at school, depressed, socially and generally anxious, insecure about everything.....

This ppl have to pay, they can't escape, the girl, the two guys who used (I'm even scared to i say used from it happening again) to take my pencils and act like kids and laugh,(this was fucking high school) troll me infront of everyone, they have suffer, the girl who screaming the whole i should go set somewhere else so loudly, although she knows i got social anxiety and doing on porpuse, this people have to pay, no..... They can't just escape, they cant just go with it, it's not fair...........

I'm thinking about looking into ECT as I have chronic depression which I've been on medication for since I was 14 (now 28). I've been on at least 10 different meds in that time and tried SNRIs, SSRIs and TCAs. I'm generally high functioning, anxious to boot and go through bouts of insomnia. 
Does anyone have first hand experience with ECT? What was it like? Did it make a difference? Did you have side effects or recurrence? 
Currently still breastfeeding my 8mo so I wouldn't want to do it until after as I understand it's under general anaesthesia but just wanting to look for something that gets rid of this depression longer term than meds. TIA :)

m tired of everyone saying it’s not that serious, or you’re being a bitch. Or just because I’m a man im not supposed to have feelings. So here’s story time... My ex and I dated for two years, my first real love. Did everything together went on vacations together and every first experience was with this girl. Our last couple months we’re kind of rocky but we made the best of it. But it August she broke up with me with no real explanation, left my house then blocked me on everything known to man. A couple months later, id say early december she crawls back in and I fall for it.. but heres the thing I got a job transfer and was moving 1000 miles away to a different state in early January. So the whole month of december she plays along and acts super interested in me, calls me every day and night we face time and everything. She buys a plane ticket to come visit my new place and check it out, she led me on the whole month saying if it goes good she’ll end up moving in with me and essentially live happily ever after. So im so excited thats all I was looking forward too. And two days before she’s supposed to come she doesn’t answer me for a day and then sends me this text, “I think its best you and I go our separate ways, I know you’ll be great and do good in life, goodluck and goodbye”. And thats it was immediately blocked on everything and didn’t even get to respond. She left no explanation no reasoning and didn’t even have the decency to call me. I feel completely lost, my mental state has taking a huge collapse and I feel hopeless. This girl was the love of my life, and she did that to me like I was meaningless. I knew I shouldn’t have tried with her again but my heart wouldn’t let me move on. Now im stuck here 1000 miles away from home with no friends or family. I want to finally move on from that chapter of my life and find a good girl that treats me with the same love and respect that I put out. And I honestly think that will help me move forward as much as people say a rebound wont, but I wouldn’t really consider this much of a rebound. But idk what it is, this really shook me to my core with no explanation as to why she’d do this to me. I just need some closure or something. I’ve lost all motivation and will to do anything and everyone just thinks im a bay or is a dick about it when I reach out for advice. :(
