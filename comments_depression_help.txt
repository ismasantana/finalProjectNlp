I lost my grandma, "Ahna," many years back. But I still miss her. My mother was very physically and emotionally abusive when I was a kid, but Ahna was a saint.  It helps when I think about her to recall some of my best memories of her.  What's one of your favorite memories of your grandma?
I know things are tough now. I lost my father to cancer and it took me four years to move on. You need to think that she wanted you to have a happy fulfilling life She loved you and would hate to see you in pain Surround yourself with friends that can lend you a shoulder to cry on and let it out of your chest It'll be over soon  Hang on and live for her your best life
i lost my grandma last year too. we weren't the closest, but she supported me in everything i did. now that shes gone, ive felt, without her support, very unsuccessful in everything i do.  i dont know your exact situation and cant say i understand how youre feeling but i want you to know that the saddness will end. i promise. everyone takes thier own time to grieve, and you nee to accept that you are doing the best you can. you're going to be okay. your feelings are valid and understandable, but they wont last forever.
I also lost mine a while ago. She was the only person who cared and hugged me when i was crying. My father runs away and dont give a shit, my mother yells at me to stop crying or else shes gonna break my stuff and my friends left me. Because of emotional abuse i got into depression but it was mild and over time it went severe and now im suicidal but i still dont have the courage. I read so many articles about people who have the courage and with painful methods, not searching for a painless method like me. I miss her alot

I started seeing a therapist along with a psychiatrist in the summer because i was feeling suicidal. It took months of nagging but they finally agreed to let me see them.  The therapist was nice but it was only 6 sessions because it was an acute session for ppl in crisis and I didn’t have time to get everything out. While it wasn’t life changing it was nice to talk someone who would be empathetic to the issues in contrast to my parents (who would just tell me to grow up and stop whining) and some of my friends (who would probably not understand and mock me)  The psychiatrist visit was what helped the most due to getting access to anti depressants. When I started taking them I felt a lot better. Before I used to have random mood swings where I’d feel miserable and suicidal for hours triggered by thoughts of my past failings (you can also look through the previous posts on my profile to see what are some of the things that cause this). I would brood for the rest of the day and not want to do anything. With the antidepressants the impact of this was reduced significantly and if I did have negative thoughts I could push them aside. It wasn’t perfect but it was much much better than what I experienced before.   Now come to January I’m almost out and haven’t had an appointment in a couple of months to get a refill. My parents stopped paying for the appointments because they said it was a waste of money. I can’t get a refill because I need to take an appointment first. I asked my mom what I’m supposed to do then and she just said, “Deal with it.” She went on the say that “other ppl suffer from depression and they aren’t whining and are learning to push on.” I got into a fight with her after that and have again fallen back into the same misery I had before taking the antidepressants. It pisses me off too because my parents are a good chunk of the reason why I’m very depressed and suicidal (again see previous posts for context). I would pay for the appointment but I don’t have much money (and I’m trying to save up enough to move out of this shitty family and get my own car). I offered to pay for an appointment but she refused to let me, and I don’t have access to insurance stuff and other aspects so I don’t know how to book one.   I don’t know what to do. I was doing much better under the antidepressants but now I don’t have access to them anymore. My parents don’t care about my depression, so I guess I’m stuck waiting until I make enough to pay for an appointment. If anyone knows any ways to get easier access to anti depressants or ways to fight of suicidal thoughts and misery lmk. I only have one pill left which I’ve been saving.

And yet im too scared to suicide. Im a coward. No one cares, not my family and not my friends who left me. My parents emotionally abused me and thats how i got depression but it was mild... now its beyond hope. They wont even let me get sleeping or calming pills to make it easier. When i cry im just being yelled at and then threathed that i will get my stuff broken if i dont stop crying. I wanted to talk but ive kept being told to shut up and when they would finnaly listen they would make fun of me or not take me serious. I used to daydream and it helped alot but a month ago i lost the ability to visualize. I dont know why or how but i want it back, my depression got was almost severe a few days before but i wasnt suicidal. No one cared and no one cares. Of course no one will care too. Its painful but its just the truth. There is no hope and no better. Then why am i still scared of suicide? Why when i feel sick i get so scared? I shouldnt, i dont diserve to. I am a waste of space, ive been told and ive been proved

I think I've had depression for my whole life or at least early in my life, I was on the path toward depression. Now I'm an adult and I feel like I'm only getting worse as time goes on. Each time I get low I'm going lower and it's lasting longer. At about the end of the lockdown in my area, I had a breakdown. I had a panic attack that lasted for far too long and then for weeks afterward I would have them multiple times a day and for hours. It's not as bad as that anymore but the anxiety has been worse since then.   I don't know how to describe the severity of my problem. Examples I guess could be; I quit my job five months ago in large part for my mental health (but also a myriad of other reasons of course) and have not returned to work since. I had an injury that will likely require surgery and I've been avoiding the doctor for going on seven months now and It's getting worse as a result. I also spend most of my days doing mostly nothing but find distractions from doing anything meaningful and have consistently failed to break that pattern.   I want to live my life and I don't know if I'm qualified to handle this on my own anymore but I don't know what to do. I don't want antidepressants and things like that. The thing is, I know what the things are that help me. Having a schedule and sticking to it, not smoking weed and fasting. Like, I remember what it was like when I was feeling better than I am now. I'm just struggling to not keep falling.  I feel like I'm beginning to ramble so before this becomes a rant, can someone offer me some advice?

Do you have a close friend that could be a reliability partner? Like you said, you know what you need to do, you just need a little help and support to get back on your feet.
I feel for you, and totally relate to your mood and low motivation. We’re in a similar situation except I was using alcohol not weed to feel OK - I just finished a 3-week stint at a private (aka pleasant) psychiatric hospital after doing nothing about my depression for months, so my advice would be to take it seriously & take SOME action no matter how gruelling it feels at first - it can get much worse without treatment. These things helped me  1. Call Lifeline and explain your situation honestly, write down what they suggest  2. Force yourself to take a walk twice a day 3. Listen to motivating music or anything that makes you feel something / alive  4. Open your mind to seeing a psychiatrist - antidepressants saved my life!  5. Mindfulness/meditation/grounding exercises (I hated those but they worked, so did colouring in) - distraction from the negative thought loop really helps! Good luck and please update!!
I've lived with depression my whole life, and have been on and off antidepressants through all of it. When I was younger I struggled with not wanting to be on antidepressants because I thought it made me weak, or they didn't work. I found that the thought that they made me weak came from "friends" and when I moved away from that, I was able to examine that the antidepressants didn't work because they were the wrong chemical for my brain and when I got a doctor that actually listened to me I was able to get onto something that worked for me. That said, I see your comments about not trusting them, not wanting to be on them, and knowing what works for you when you have the motivation. Reaching out like this is a small step that shows you WANT to get better and moving from that to taking action is the hardest part of getting out of a depressive cycle (I'm in week two of that very situation and it's so fucking hard). Find your support. Reach out to a close friend or family member if you can, or find someone you can go to for accountability or who can be a walking buddy to get you active. I know that having a schedule is stupid hard right now, but if it works for you, make some kind of routine. Weed can act as a depressant so if it's affecting your motivation, consider adjusting when you use it. I have been very intentional in only indulging in getting stoned on weekends. Keeping a regular sleep schedule is my personal war against depression, and making sure my bed is a sleeping space only. I hope this helps some, and that you feel better soon.
I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was sixteen. I wish I could tell you it goes away.  You’re not alone.  Life is good, even when it doesn’t feel like it.  You can do this, be strong, be successful, happy AND depressed.  Sounds crazy doesn’t it? Our normal isn’t everyone’s but it has a serious purpose. Hang on to the end of the rope, there’s always someone there anchoring it.

Okay first of all, can you list 1-2 simple things that you like, for example ice-cream, or a pretty keychain anything simple easily available? Maybe just a cup of coffee with some songs in a quite and nice cafe? I think you should have a glass of water and just for a hour or two, just for a little while give that body a little love, maybe sit down all one in dark and very long and slowly think about yourself, nothing bad because everything bad about you can Amie you a absolute god in some other culture some other time, are you good at heart? Do you seek to give pain to others? If the answer is no then no, your not a bad person, think deeply of the body, the body you have is just like mine, or someone else's; cells, protein, intestine, stomach think of the work they do, think of the work the brain has been doing all your life constantly, give it just s break,. Just a couple of simple easy hours, anything you like just nice and easy and take care of yourself in that time, of your body, of the things that have always helped and supported you. I guess It might help slightly
When I was in your place I'd set small manageable goals. And find people to talk to about my feelings. Also chocolate and working out releases naturally endorphins that could give you a temporary boost.  Find a small routine that you can look forward to everyday Taking it one step at a time will surely help! Lemme know how it goes. Here for ya!!
I have considered talking to someone about something like a reliability partner thing. I think some accountability would do my a great deal of good. Thanks for your reply.
Thank you for your reply. My aversion to the antidepressants is largely caused by seeing people taking them doing so badly. They weren't doing well in the first place but the drugs didn't make them any better. They were actually much worse by the time our relationship was concluded. It's anecdotal I know, I just don't trust the drugs i guess.
thank you, u/kierki. It does help.
Hey mental health professional here who's also tried a buncha depression meds (for my own depression).   - Do you also feel kinda numb? as in you're not interested in doing all the hobbies you use to like to do? - Most antidepressant medications use your bodies natural hormones and make them work in your favor instead. So it's not like antidepressants are pumping you full of dope. They've been shown to improve thousands of lives.  -  Mental illness is like diabetes. Sometimes lifestyle changes work (diet/exercise). And sometimes, like with juvenile diabetes, you have to have insulin. Yes insulin has side effects but not having insulin also puts you in trouble. - if you start it though DO NOT ABRUPTLY stop. It's better to wean yourself down. I've been there and it was like dropping off a cliff and may be where your friends are running into issues.   One thing I can personally say is Depression is a deadly disease.  It took therapy/lifestyle changes, trying different meds, and about 3 weeks to kick in but it's soo worth it. I'm not cured for good but I have some reprieve from the guilt and anhedonia and intense sadness. I hope this helped man. Good luck!
Thank you, I really appreciate it.

That with 16 yrs old was a typo im 12
oh hi, i was like that a long time ago.  Now I brag about helping prep and sending stuff to space.  Also got married (twice!)  Don't fall for the first woman that comes along.  Got thin and was able to even run at one point.   (I never really did enjoy it, even when I got semi-decent at running I still hated it - but I'm fat and out of shape again now).  What about a bike, if the physical stuff matters to you?
I have a bike, broken. Need to sell my psa10 pokemon card
Psa10?  I'm a Pokemon noob, but I do have a deck.  I need to tune up our bikes and put the kid's back together.  He jacked it all up....

I won't bore you with why I've come to this place after years of struggle depression and medications .  Yesterday I heard someone laugh on the street and it was such an alien sound I stopped and stared.    Please to whatever God is listening let my final moments be quick. I have been so lonely, numb and deeply sad that I don't even know what it means to be a normal human. I've forgotten. Like I've become a new raw version of my self   But I do want to name someone who pushed me over . You my boss. You know what you did. You just don't care how humiliated and threatened you make me feel everyday . You were the nail in my coffin and I hope you rust and fester in your own hate.   You won. I hope you're happy.   I have nothing to give , because I have nothing left except regret. That and the pills I take to dull my brain every night to face another day.   I have made a choice for this to be over. My family, please don't cry for me. Throw my things out. And please spend the rest of your life happy. Let me go..

Get to know him, what he likes and see if you can share time doing that together. Spend time with him, give him time to open up to you about stuff, if he is depressed that may be hard although your constant presence will surely alleviate that feeling. Best of luck to you both.

I have had MDD for as long as I can remember. I started meds about 3 months ago, felt great, and then had some issues that have kind of screwed me.   I am stuck at home and a fulltime student trying to finish out my degree. I am in the final hurdle and have slipped on my studying, hard. The dirty house around me and what feels like constant demands to care for our puppy and clean the house are making me a lot worse.   Where are some places I can go to get out of the house? I really need to leave and study but obviously with Covid being a concern I dont want to be super near people. I can use my phone as a hot spot but i cant think of any places that would me just chill for like 3 hours anymore.

Hey,  I'm not asking for medical advice, just for your personal stories and opinions.  So, I've been diagnosed with persistent depression, social anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Last few months I've felt (actively) suicidal. It's a little better now.  My last therapy was pretty fruitless and I'm at a stage in my life (have to write my thesis) where I can't afford to just break down. I talked to a new therapist today and she said it would be useful to get on medication, considering my current state of mind.  I'm currently on a very weak plant-based medicine my GP gave me, but I'm thinking about getting real, effective meds.  I'm anxious and sceptical about it.  How have your experiences been? Did you get / stay better after taking it? Would you go for it, if you were in my spot?

Medication has helped me but it’s not a fix all solution. And sometimes meds mess things up more if you don’t get the right ones.
Hi, I am on antidepressants since I was 17 years old, I am almost 31 now. During that time I finished school nad then graduated with bachelor's and MA degrees with quite decent GPA.  I am now having hard time because I am not having job and I have only little above than 1 year of relevant work experience.  However, what I would like to say is that being on medication which is well adjusted for depression / anxiety will not impair your mental capability to finish education. It actually could improve your capabilities, because depression is the most debilitating thing I have ever experienced in terms of intellectual performance.
I meditate daily on my own, I even have a meditation group which I meet up with every week. I also work out and eat decently healthy. It doesn't help.  I know it can make it even worse. That's my worry.

Hey, congrats on your academic success and sorry you can't find a job.  That's reassuring to hear. I find that it greatly impairs my academic performance as well. I might as well give it a shot.
Well I got out on medication because I had to be. Don’t let it get that far. If you think you need it go ahead amd get it while you’re still able to make that call and if it messes up you can always fix it

Hey everyone, I wasn't really sure where to post this but if you know of a better subreddit to do so please let me know and I will delete it from here. Also English is my second language, if there is anything that doesn't make sense please let me know.   I (22f) as an only child have had a really comfortable and somewhat sheltered childhood, my parents love me and have done (and still do) their best to give me a good and comfortable life and I'm forever grateful for this. Despite this I'm not sure why I have thoughts and feelings that are this way.  I just finished uni and have had this overly critical and verbally abusive 'me' in my head ever since I can remember but it got more prominent and vocal over time. When I studied abroad and I had the chance to get free counselling in uni for a very short while, however, since im back in my own country I don't have that option. I brought it up to my parents that I wanted to get counseling but they insist that a majority of counsellors/ therapists in my area are usually just in it for the money and they will just prescribe me medication. My mother has went to several councellors/ therapists due to health reasons and she says this has been her experience.  I find myself one minute feeling fine and next when I'm not around people and don't have to appear happy feel really numb, tired and exhausted. I find myself saying things to myself like 'you're an idiot, you're worthless, why are you here, your parents would have been better off with someone else's child' etc. When I have these thoughts I find that slapping myself in the face helps me and I feel as if a load is taken off of my shoulders.  I also find myself being anxious of doing things to the point where my hands are sweaty, my heart speeds up and I have this feeling of dread and fear that doesn't go away. I usually experience this when I have to make phone calls, do public speaking or if I'm in a social environment with people I don't know. In these situations I sometimes feel like im not really in my own body, even looking at my hands seems foreign to me. Several times I was afraid of even going to a nearby supermarket to buy food and took nearly over half a day of getting ready and making sure I look presentable to go outside.   Sometimes I worry that I'm just making this all up, that I might be just fooling myself, im okay and i should just move on with my life.  I usually just try to push myself through these things and ignore them. The counsellor I went to suggested I keep a journal of sorts but I don't really find it to be helpful. Has anyone else dealt with this? If so what has helped you? Any other suggestions are welcome. Thank you for your time.

I eat more when I’m depressed and less when I’m anxious.. but I’ve literally been in a depressive episode since October 2019, and covid lockdown has definitely made it worse. I’ve also been inpatient a few times in the last 6 months and they fed me well. I’d like to lose some of the weight I gained which is definitely not helping the depressive episode, but I also don’t have the motivation to exercise (I just tried to do a YouTube work out and made it like 5 mins), and I struggle with eating a bit so I feel like I’m always hungry, especially if I’m eating really healthy. Any advice appreciated please.

Could you try taking walks? It may help you feel better.
First, congrats on trying! 5 minutes is better than 0 minutes. I was in a deep depressive state 2 months ago, and each week has been better. Something that has worked for me is committing to the bare minimum. Something so small that you may laugh at how ridiculously easy it is. Ex: "I commit to working out once a week". This of course varies person to person depending on their personal threshold. This creates a feeling that you can attain it, and be consistent. Once you are able to master this, you can up the stakes. Maybe you can commit to doing 5 minutes of exercise every day. There are plenty of youtube videos with just 5 minute workout. It doesn't matter how small you start. What matters is that you started!
I would talk with your doctor and see if there is anything medicaly they can do to help (anti- depressants), see if your vitamin D is low, get your thyroid checked (this can cause depression, hair loss, muscle loss, lethargy, etc), see if intermittent fasting would be beneficial for you, discuss nutrition and exercise plans... etc  I would also recommend finding a support group for fitness to help keep you motivated/accountable.  Set small goals for yourself, everyday go for a one minute walk (more than likely   one minute will turn into more, and if it doesn't  at least you went outside and did your one minute).   Things that help me:  - a S.A.D. lamp - having a morning routine - having an evening/ bed time routine - discussing my personal health goals with my G.P. and getting advice - getting a support group - taking my medications consistently  - doing workout programs that are free on youtube (because then I don't need to think about it,  I just need to do it...I liked the Chloe Ting Summer Shred challenge because she does low impact versions of the workout...and currently I'm doing the Heather Robertson  12 week program) - doing yoga before bed at night (even if it was a light stretch or bed yoga) - going for a walk daily - setting up goals for one month and doing them for a month and reviewing the effectiveness of those initiatives at the end of the month  - using a bullet journal style page to check in on my goals and Journaling daily/meditating to check in mentally with myself - eating more fruits, Veg, plant based protein, fiber, and attempting to avoid sugar (this one is a Battle because I like sweets 😋)  - drinking plenty of water - engaging in some sort of self care routine (consistent teeth brushing, shower, hair care, etc) - staying away from social media when I get overwhelmed   Etc etc etc
Maybe try excersing with friends, that may help, like just running outside while talking can really help pass the time
Even talking walks in the mornings or evenings is a good first step if you feel you can manage it. I was in the same headspace regarding working out a couple weeks ago so feel free to DM if you need someone to talk to about it ☺️
Picture yourself being a healthy weight, looking the way you want to look. Do this often and especially when negative self images come to mind. You may be surprised.
Bike rides / walks. I started pushing myself to do these as transportation for necessary outings such as groceries... and it's helped a lot.  Also, I understand this may not be an option for you, but if it is, fostering a dog, was really beneficial for me. Having to go outside twice a day and give the dog exercise made me indirectly exercise as well.
I’m no expert, just a gal that lives with depression and anxiety and has battled weight gain and loss my entire life. What I can say from experience is not to beat yourself up. What would you say to someone dear to you in a similar situation? Try to be kind to yourself in the same way. It can be hard, but it’s a habit worth developing.   One way of reframing the situation that helped me was developing a red light, yellow light, green light system. If you are similar to me, you don’t wake up everyday with the same confidence that you can get everything done that you would like. Sometimes it’s depression making me lose desire for productivity. Sometimes it’s that I would rather eat glass than go jogging. But, in these situations it can be unhelpful to expect the same output no matter what.   So, if you’re having a green light day, a good day, what can you reasonably expect yourself to do? If we’re talking exercise, jog a mile? What about a yellow light day? Maybe something less intense, jog around the block or a relaxing walk. But on red light days, maybe just walk to my mailbox. No matter what scenario, you aren’t failing. You’re doing what is reasonably expected of you.   This helps me fight the impulse of beating myself up for not doing enough because I’m depressed...which makes me more depressed.  May not float your boat, but I thought I’d share.
I’d suggest 10 times water in the morning,if you have a stairs,walk down and up as many times or running around the house,would be simple,and   Start it out by thinking up a strategy on finding the source or the weakness of your depression,hit it right where it hurts! Keep going and take care! :).
Hey u/kiizzababy   Well I am one who needs to take his own advice so here it goes, I am in the same boat as you are in October 2019 I had a stroke and on Christmas eve that same year I had a heart attack.  When I had my stroke I thought I was the healthiest I had ever been, I was jogging 5 miles a day, working on my photography business and bang I cam back from a run was puring water and started to get dizzy and unbalanced.  I ignored it for a couple days like it was just a bad hangover (I don't drink) finally my friends housekeeper asked me one morning if I was drunk so early in the morning.  I said no and asked why; she said I was wobbling all over.  My friend took me to tje doctor and he confirmed my worst nightmare, a stroke, started me on meds and sent me home to bedrest, I started light activity again in mid november walking trying to get my left hand and foot to do what my brain was telling me to.  I felt I was back on track again but I was broke, just doing some online marketing work and social media promotion for a few pesos a month. (I am an american living in Mexico) My landlord was understanding and gave me a break and didn't toss me out on my ass even though I couldn't pay rent as Christmas was coming and my 62nd birthday had just past.  As most who do suffer from some form of depression like you and myself the holidays are particularly difficult.  I had been diagnosed with depression as a teen and again about 10 years ago and I was taking anti depressants and anti anxiety meds for 7 of the last ten years.  in 2017 I was dating and living with my 20 year old model girlfriend and she convinced me to talk to the doctor about weening off the meds which I did.  After my Christmas Heart attack which I recovered from with meds and rest at home since I had no money and no insurance to get into a hospital I followed up with my cardiologist in January and he started me on an excercise plan to go along with the meds.  I was suffering from High Blood pressure but labs showed my cholesterol and all normal which surprise him and I was diagnosed with stress related hypertnesion for the second time.  In March I was ready to work and had booked a couple events for May and June Weddings but then COVID19 hit and all events and gatherings were cancelled.  So I was back to the only income of about $50 USD a month to buy meds and food.  My GF was helping me out until she got deported back to her home country in September 2020 and I fell into a deeper depression.  Some of my long time Models came to visit even some with the whole family but not working is slowly killing me.  The only thing that has kept me going and trying is my 10 year old Labrador Retriever she needs the physical excercise as much as she needs the emotional stimulation.  If not for her I would have offed myself at Christmas time as I was just laying in bed watching the computer and nothing more, no more out jogging or interacting with friends.   I have been trying to get out of Mexico and back to the US but because of the economic situation my passport expired because I had no money to renew it and I don't have a work visa here anymore for the same reason and I can't even afford to get an exit visa to leave the country.  But even though I feel and have felt really desperate I would never do that to my dog who I rescued when she was a pup and have trained and worked with constantly to keep her healthy and I personally believe if not for her I would have thrown in the towel of life.  I really think that she has been my therapy keeping me at least going day to day and with a hope that soon something will change for the better.  Dogs are great motivators, I know she is what keeps me alive today and trying because she is no different than a child who needs to be fed and nurtured.  Try to keep positive, start slow, try going out and walking, even for 20 minutes and slowly increase and if you can adopt a dog, labradors and golden retrievers are incredible rescues I have done 2 in the last 15 years.
I second this! Walks have honestly saved my life this lockdown even though my dumb anxious brain is like “you should be exercise MORE” but you know what, walking is amazing exercise and so good for the mind! I hope you find some peace soon
I have two dogs already, but thank you for the idea!
>my 20 year old model girlfriend   Super relevant.

I'm a 27 year old female and I've been struggling with depression since I was about 12 or atleast that's when I first learned that I was depressed. I'm from NOLA, hurricane Katrina came and basically wiped away what was left of my childhood, I was 12 when it happened. After our home got washed away, my family moved to 4 different cities in a matter of 5 months. When we finally settled in Houston I laid on the floor of our newly built house and cried like it had finally hit me that the life I knew was no more. Growing up in New Orleans we had lots of family around and friends that I grew up with. After we moved to Houston I watched my parents work extremely hard to rebuild and start over(contrary to what others believe not everyone got handouts or assistance) Fast forward to 2016 my dad died, completely broke my heart...a few months later I moved to a different state to be with the "love of my life" and things continued to go downhill from there.  Since my dad passed I've eaten myself to a dangerous weight which in turn has caused health problems some visible and some not. My marriage is complete shit and I'm actively planning my way out and filing for divorce. I live alone in a city full of my husband's family, I have 1 good friend, a job that I hate but can't afford to quit.   I'm just tired. I don't know if my life will ever get better. I don't know if I'll ever get a grip and stop eating myself to death. I don't know if I will really be happy when I leave my husband and move out on my own and I'm scared. I keep beating myself up about mistakes that I've made, red flags I ignored when it comes to my failed marriage and friendships. Before my dad died I was in good shape, dieting and losing weight, working out. Now that I'm so big and anemic from my irregular periods, I can't take a few steps without feeling winded or like my lungs are collapsing. I don't have health insurance, I've been turned down because of my size and what I do qualify for, costs more than mortgage for a 7 bedroom house. I feel completely alone

Oh my friend. None of this is your fault. These are very traumatic events and we all struggle to deal with trauma. You are not alone and I am so glad you posted your story.
You are not alone. The divorce will most likely be difficult for a while but it WILL be worth it. You will make new friends. You will find other jobs. You can improve your health too. Before any of this happens you will have to learn to forgive yourself for getting to this point. Everyone ignores red flags sometimes. Everyone makes unhealthy decisions. None of this can't be undone, and it's not your fault.  I'm sorry that you are feeling this way, and I'm sorry for the loss of your father. I want you to know that it's okay to hit rock bottom at 27, or 37, or 47 for that matter. You already know what you have to do to start turning things around.   I believe in you <3
I have eating problems myself so believe me, I know what your going trough. I assume you’re not in the states? Only reason I mention it is that business are required to offer health insurance so it’s possible to get it through work. Honestly it sounds like you need help to deal with things and that is nothing to be ashamed of. Anyone would struggle with living through what you have. However, no insurance kind of makes that difficult so maybe try self help books. It’s not the same but they can be a very good place to start. Just remember that you are worth the effort.
I'm so sorry for your losses. It sounds like you do have hope that things can change. I'm not sure if you can try to find a job with health insurance and then see a nutritionist? Small changes each day. You will get there.
I live in the states and my job offers insurance but it's expensive. It would cost more than $500/month for coverage. I'm about to be on my own, I can't afford that.

I'm 38, I'm feeling suicidal and numb. Nothing to live for.  I have been unemployed for 1.5 years, since then no one contacted me for an interview. My skills are as a researcher without an MA. I gave up looking for a job. I live with my parents.   My last relationship was 6 years ago with my friend, lasted 3 months, she did it out of pity. Before that I only had 2 same length "relationships" with years in between. Before that my childhood and teens were in Saudi Arabia, so nothing.  My motivations in life were to support financially and psychologically my cousin and my single mother friend, first got into a relationship the other leaving country soon and I'm not working to support her. Now the only thing keeping me from taking the exit is to not hurt my mom.  I don't have close friends but my blessing in life are my cousins, who I can't see because of covid 19 and they aren't enough to fulfill my life or from committing suicide.  Please help!!!

Hang in there, young man... As the years go on, we learn that every time life knocks us down, we just have to pick ourselves up and carry on. And believe me, we all get knocked down from time to time.  Certainly your career situation is difficult. Sometimes we just have to take a few steps backward before we can move forward again. But the longer we're out of work the more of a red flag that is with potential employers. Take whatever work you can possibly get that is even remotely a first step towards your ideal job. Then work your butt off to climb the ladder. And in the mean time, use some of your off-hours to advance your education, as that will certainly help you as well.  It's not easy. But you can do it. I've been where you're at and found a way to dig myself out of that hole. You can too.  Good luck!
Don't give up.  Look for new friends, you have a whole internet worth of people you can connect with. You seem like the type of person who needs people in their life. It doesn't have to be a romantic relationship, friendships count as well.   Always, talk to a psychiatrist and a therapist. They can give you tools to cope with your view on life. The scariest part of that is just going the first time.   I personally studied philosophy, it helped me concentrate on something else, and gave me good insights for how to live differently.   I hope you find what light you have left and feed into that. I wish you well. I hope the darkness lets up for you.
Hang in they're bro. are you in the US ? I am Canadian.
You can do it. I know it. The fact you care about mom and cousins shows you have some focus beyond your own reality. Not everyone can say that.  You might want to get creative on jobs. I was a reporter and ended up in radio and then in health care. Like most things the stuff appears more when you least expect it. What sort of thing would you want to do is all options were open?  I would recommend digging into health care. There are tons of jobs in that field that might fit your skills and it’s a field that is always growing. Some systems have career planning services. Ours does. I had no clue I could end up writing for them until I did.  Relationships are hard. Lots of lonely married people and the like. It’s a lot like life though in that it takes at bats to get hits. Same with friends. Gotta do stuff to meet folks.  The option you mention is not a real option. As a researcher you know everything is driven by evidence. There’s none to show the exit offers anything at all.
You have a lot to live for. Your life is precious. You deserve to live and stand to see what life has in store for you. You may feel that everything is pointless and that nothing is in store for you but it is. Do not give up hope, friend.
Never give up, suicide is a 1 choice thing never going back. I would strongly reccomend medical help and try to enjoy things. Do more hobbies. If you like cooking, try cooking more. Video games? Play more. Try to enjoy yourself and deffinitly tell this to a close friend or family member, or just tell a therapist. I hope you will improve!

If anyone has had experience breaking up with someone because of their depression or can help me with how to try and help him in the hope he’ll want to come back to me when he’s feeling more himself it would be greatly appreciated!  Do people with depression often say things they don’t actually mean? Does it cause them to be quite short tempered and lash out?  Long story short - My ex burnt himself out at work which I believe caused his depression, the burnout started around feb/March when Covid happened and his job he’d just got became so busy and there was lots of pressure on him. He wasn’t aware of the depression until a few days after he broke up with me (that was when he suddenly realise why his brain drastically changed on the day he broke up with me). On the day he couldn’t understand what was going on, he loved me but he wasnt in love with me it was tearing him apart and was as if his feelings for everything were just shut down. It’s not only affected the relationship but he’s also got short/low-key shouted at his friends and family and things because of it. So now he’s completely retreated from everything deleting some of his social media and removing me from things where he’d see my name all the time like Spotify and discord as he doesn’t want to be reminded of what he’s had to let go I think.   As it was a long distance relationship we relied heavily on communicating via text and social media. We never had any problems with distance at all and our relationship was absolutely fine. He said to me the relationship and me were the only things keeping him going sometimes and he’d always loved spending time with me, it made him feel so good and feel as though nothing else matter kind of thing like all his problems went away, it was the same feeling for me too. I can’t get my head around the fact that he’s let go one of the things that makes him happiest in life? Why do people do this please, I’d like to get an insight into it.  He did say it was a better idea to break up when we did before the depression could have potentially got into the relationship, causing us to end badly and bitterly which I completely get. He’s thought about me in that sense which is nice. He wants us to stay friends and I do too, we’re meeting in June to have a catch up with everything (obviously providing we can with Covid) and it will be a test to see if we can be friends.   When I met up with him before Christmas he wasn’t himself, I could see how sad and fed up he was it was so upsetting to see. He wrote me a letter with things like ‘I’ve never deserved you, you’ll be better off without me in the long run, I’ll hold the guilt of this for the rest of my life’ and also saying how incredible and valuable I am and that whoever I decide to settle down with needs to count their lucky stars to have me and things. It so upsetting to see someone who was always the life and soul of the party cracking jokes who is always happy become so so sad in an instant.   I’m not going to contact him much at all (even tho I drunkenly called him the other night which was a huge mistake), he said he’ll update me on how he is with his appointments and things as he is getting help which I asked him to do. But every now and again I’ll probably send him a text or possibly a card of some sort just to let him know I’m thinking of him and that I hope he’s doing well. Is this okay to do? It will probably only be like once a month so nothing too full on.  Sorry I feel like I’ve ranted but wanted to give a bit of an insight into what’s happened. I’ve let him know I’m always here for him and that he can reach out at anytime, I understand that I’m probably the last person he’ll reach out to at the moment as we know we’ve both got to heal. He’s also got to concentrate on getting himself better which I completely understand.   Any comments/advice, anything would be appreciated! I want to try and understand what he’s going through and the typical behaviours depression can cause. I hope this was okay to post!

About 2.5 years ago I was diagnosed with depression + anxiety: no biggie. It runs in the family, it's a biological depression as one side of the family doesn't produce enough serotonin, so nothing actually happened to me to set it off. But it affected a lot of things that I wanted control over, I wasn't living my best life.  I went on medication (Venlafaxin(effexor)), and it helped dramatically. Though I gained 15kgs in the 6 months. So I came off. I've been good for 2 years, I got the weight back down, and I'm hovering between average and athletic. But recent changes in my life have stirred the pot.  Mirtazapine is a recommendation that *should* work differently and not cause the weight gain.  I don't want to go on the meds again if I'm going to gain that weight back so fast. I don't want to be on meds my whole life like my family members. But nor do I want to stay like I am currently. So how do I decide? Flip a coin?  My psychologist and psychiatrist haven't been able to help me make my mind up.   Anybody been on mirtazapine? Does it cause weight gain and kill libido? Not that I have a libido at the moment anyway, thanks life 👍

If depression "runs in your family" it's entirely possible that you're inheriting it from nurture, not nature. Emotional neglect and loneliness caused by depressed parents is absolutely a cause of childhood trauma, which can manifest as anxiety and depression. Since you grew up with depressed parents, it's very likely that you can overcome your childhood trauma and that you are not genetically predetermined to suffer.  Please check out my reading list, with recommended reading order.   https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/kpd36h/top_10_books_ive_read_for_healing_with
There are so many medications that can help and not all of them will induce weight gain. As an aside, part of self care is making the harder choice when it’s the responsible, healthy choice, even if we don’t like it.  If the correct, safe medication helps you be functional and whole, the right choice is to love yourself enough to take it, and to love yourself 15 lbs. heavier.   This question could also be something to explore with a therapist, as mental illness has both nature and nature facets. Depression may run in your family genetically, but it also runs in your family through generational trauma and the best way to treat that can be with an excellent therapist.
Yes mirtazapine can affect weight when taking it for depression. However, I asked my mom (she’s a pharmacist), and just because it can cause weight gain, doesn’t mean it will. I’ve been taking it for 2 years and haven’t had many issues. Granted I’ve only been on it for sleep so my dosage is minuscule. The only depression med that I don’t believe causes any sort of weight gain is Wellbutrin so that may be one to talk to your doctors about. As for libido, I have no idea. I’m on other meds that kill mine and that’s not a question I’m going to ask my mother. Always know that you can talk to your pharmacist and they should be able to help.
Thank you for answering this question but does anyone know how to tell your parents but not have them freak out or think there’s something wrong with you?
How much does ASD affect this? As emotions have never been an issue for me until I got a dog, which accidentally taught me how to feel.   Did not consider or recognise that it could be a behavioral learnt issue.  I'll go through your list.  Thank you
15kgs not lbs. Nearly 3 stone. It's a 20% increase of my bodyweight.  I've never considered a generational trauma, just easier to do bloods and see that I'm lacking.  I'm not sure if I've brought it up with my psychologist before so she may not even know about my family history.. Thanks
I'll ask the psych about it, see if it might work for me.   My pharmacists are usually under a lot of pressure and don't have time to talk, they just throw brochures and paper copies of info. But maybe I'll be the annoying customer.   Thanks for the info  Side note, "that's not a question I'm going to ask my mother" - actually got a laugh out of me, appreciate it.
Apologies, I misread.    I at one point was on Seroquil which caused a 15% body mass increase in under a month.  I stopped taking it and worked with my psychiatrist to find a better solution.  There are solutions for you. But I know it can be daunting. Keep on seeking the best solution for you!
Glad I got a laugh! What kind of pharmacy do you go to? Big chain or small town? Legally, pharmacists are required to go over the side affects and risks of you medications. Mom vastly prefers small town pharmacy’s as they generally have better patient service and are more willing to help you out.

i was diagnosed with depression when i was 12 and im 18 now. ive been in and out of therapy, and tried and stopped medication many times. i survived an attempt last summer, which kept me from going away for college. i fell into a deep depression while doing college online. all of my friends were away and i felt like i had no one. i forced myself to go away for college this semester and im starting to think it was a mistake. prior to going away i had felt completely fine and my depression felt like a distant memory. i was excited to finally live; this sense of excitement overshadowed my depression to the point that it felt almost like a distant memory. i transferred to a school 2000 miles away and ive fallen into a depressive episode. i have horrendous social anxiety, so i havent left my dorm. i don't have a roommate and i dont have any friends. i keep ordering uber eats because im afraid to sit alone to eat. i know i need to put myself out there but it's getting so hard. i never anticipated id feel suicidal again but here i am. i just need someone to talk to because i feel so alone.

I can't offer a chance for permanent communication, but I just wanted to say that I'm wishing you luck. Finding people online is how I managed to stay "sane" when I was your age, as I also had that crippling anxiety. Sorry if that's a little grandpa-ish "kids these days!"  I attended college only a few years after high-school because everyone else was doing it, and I honestly should have waited.  I'm turning 30 soon, amd am only a year out of school from a technical program. There is no shame in "starting" life a little later. Remember, you are alive and have been for 18 years! Everything you do, every success and failure is a step towards improvement.   That feeling of newness and the thrill of something intense and exciting, driving you forward is something I'm super familiar with. I have always felt like it's one of the major aspects of my depression. I need new stimula, I want, crave, new and exciting experiences, and when I get them I fly high. That is often tampered with a lot of internal self reflection. I have found that getting that balance of fear and engaging in new, novel activities to be really difficult.  Something that "might" help, is having a part time job that forces social interaction as part of its labour.     *** THIS MIGHT BE TERRIBLE ADVICE ***   I started as a delivery driver when I was 21, because I was basically forced to, and the first year, I had to get comfortable answering phones, talking with co-workers, learning how to handle customers. It was scary, amd horrible. But the people I worked with were funny. They were smart, because it was a college town, and they accepted my quirks and 'weirdness' as just being a part of someone who works in the strange world of food service. They helped me grow and gave me a real sense of "turns out, everyone is too busy to judge you!", that has helped my anxiety.   If you're already feeling to stressed with college, this might be a bad idea, and certainly considering the global pandemic, there's no reason to put yourself at greater risk.   Idk!  Sounds like a rough time and I can't think of any other support to give. Just know that there are other people that know what you're going through. I hope you can find someone to talk candidly with.  Everyone deserves a friend and, at least from this post, you sound like a fine young person.    Man I feel old saying things like that. "I've got some hardcandy in that tray over there, help yourself! Don't mind the cat."

I don’t understand. People are impossible, and I can’t understand how living life is possible. I’ve tried so desperately, so immensely hard to do the right thing; to be a good person. It’s soul-crushing, but I believed that the outcome would overcome the pain. I was wrong. Not only have I been broken down only to be built back up and destroyed time and time again, but now I see that it’s never going to be fulfilling. I will never get the peace and satisfaction of friends, family, or love. I am, and always will be unbelievably isolated. Humanity is a broken race, and for some incredibly angering reason; I can’t help but help others. I hate myself for that, and everyone seems to hate me for that. I’ve been hurt too many times, and I don’t think I can trust anyone else; I don’t want that anymore. I just can’t keep this in anymore. I used to be suicidal, now I just want it all to stop. It’s like being in a white room, the agonizing torture of the constant bland, desaturation of existence. I’m so angry, but I can’t be because of the moral hypocrisy, I’m so sad, but I can’t be because humanity won’t allow such displays, I’m so hurt, but I can be worse, because my pain brings peace and pleasure to others. I’m too afraid, too angry, and too hurt to live. But I can’t die. I’m broken, and I know I shouldn’t be, because I know others have it worse, but I’m just as selfish as everyone else who hurts me. I can’t do anything but hate myself, even when I hate those around me, my self hatred always makes me serve them, because I know I’m worse. Despite everything that I do, I will always be the worst villain humanity sired, and maybe, just maybe, everyone knows it, and they act on it.

I understand your pain I'm also lost and confused by everything life is throwing my way. Start over, re learn how to love you If do good!! Find new things to get into, bring different kinds of people to you're life there is no easy answer ( haven't found it myslef). What I am learning is the deeper you try to question it I'm afraid the more lost you'll be , understanding that things will and can happen is the first step as far as human behavior I found it best just working on my own terrible traits. You can't change everybody nor will every body change for you pick what your willing to tolerate around you and if those who you are connecting with really care they will also start to change. Its a never ending process but hang it there for you're sanity for you're sake and a peace of mind

It’s been one of them days today and at work someone asked me a couple of times what’s wrong. I just said I was tired. Thing is it didn’t get any better all day to the point where I ended up answering back with some attitude when I’d normally just put up with people nagging and being funny about stuff. Then he called me over and asked if somethings gone on and I just said no and I’m just feeling tired. Then when my sister picked me up she asked as well, I just said I’m fine but she could tell I wasn’t. Was just wondering what I could say if anyone asks again

It took my a long time but I'm now very open about my depression and anxiety. Covering for it with excuses just made me feel worse and now I'm a big believer in destigmatizing talking about mental health. If I'm having a bad day and someone asks I now freely tell them I'm have a bad day. The more open I've been the more supportive the people around me have been.
That you are having a bad day/week/month, everyone is allowed to, openness and vulnerability are great tools for educating people abour depression and its consequences. I begun doing it at the end of 2019 and I've had fantastic responses to it. People seem to be kinder when you are profoundly human and sincere, it resonates with something within them.
Ever since I heard about the spoon theory, I just tell people that I’m low on spoons.
I’m usually just honest. Almost everyone I work with or talk to knows I have major depression problems. It’s nothing to be ashamed of and I personally like being open about it. I can tell my coworkers “hey my depression is really bad today. Please don’t take it personally if I seem distracted or distant. I’m sorry I just can’t help it”. Most are very supportive and helpful. It also does wonders for changing peoples perspectives on mental health issues and can take away some of the negative views that people have.
Thank you. With most people I can, but at work it’s pretty hard (I work in a garage so it’s pretty much all men and there’s that whole thing about being masculine and stuff) and with being the youngest as well any time I say stuff like just having a stressful day or whatever it just gets the stuff about wait till I’m older and actually have hard work to do and stuff
I like it. I’ll just tell them I don’t have many spoons left. Thank you
I hate it that men's mental health is so much more stigmatized. I live in the South so I know exactly the kind of environment you mean. I hope that it gets better for you.
Thanks
If they insult you for not being masculine just return the favor. I’m not great at this but maybe something like“ wow coworker, I’m sorry I thought we were friends enough to be able to talk. I mean you kept asking so I thought you were cool but I guess not.”   Take it with a grain of salt though. I’ve never met your coworkers and they could all be asshats.
Oh they are all asshats. Thanks for the advice tho, I appreciate it

Hello everyone ! Lately I’ve been crying almost everyday, triggered but really small details... I’m not sure what is going on. I was on the pill and I decided to stop it a month ago to see if it would get better but it’s actually getting worse... I have outbursts of sadness and I have this tight chest feeling as well.  I don’t know what is happening to me 😩

You should speak with your doctor about new or worsening moods as a result of changes in medication!  I am not a doctor, but a sudden shift in your mood that you associate with getting on or off The Pill is probably due to a hormonal shift and your body trying to compensate to some extent.  They might prescribe something to help your brain find a better balance and return you to a more positive state. Remember that there's a certain baseline of neural activity, amd medication can have a really powerful effect on how active or suppressed your mind is, in a general sense.  Don't be afraid to discuss things like this with your doctor, they want to help you lead a long and enjoyable life!

Chronic depression feels different than situational depression, in my experience. (Chronic is the kind that lasts for a long time and often reoccurs over a person’s life) Chronic depression isn’t just feeling sad, a lot of time you feel numb. There’s often a lack of motivation, and you don’t enjoy doing things you used to do. Sometimes you might be telling yourself to get up and do something but have a really hard time doing it. You might be more forgetful, be sleeping to much or not enough, and either over or under-eat. This kind of depression can be passed down genetically and someone with it might manifest symptoms in childhood that carry through to adulthood. Situational depression is more like if someone without a history of depression or who has only experienced isolated incidents of it goes through something that triggers depression. This is if feelings of sadness kind of persist until you don’t know what its like to not feel that way, and you get kind of numb to it. This can happen if you don’t get help if you’re feeling consistently sad after an upsetting event. You can actually train your brain until « sad » is the default, strengthening those neural pathways in your brain. Also, if the triggering episode persists or keeps occurring and/or  you continue to strengthen those neural pathways without finding healthier coping mechanisms, situational depression can turn into chronic depression. Overall, regardless of whether you are just sad or if you’re depressed, if these feelings are getting so heavy you’re having trouble functioning normally, get whatever help you can. Therapists, school counselors, library self-help books, forums like this, try to find people who understand what you are growing through and what techniques they’d suggest to cope with it. Also, whether is sadness or depression, you can work through both, so get whatever help you need.

I’ve been dealing with depression for years but stubbornly held off seeking help because I thought I could self-manage/power through/was afraid I wouldn’t be able to get a good job because there’ll be a record I needed mental health help/etc. pure foolishness because I ended up having the WORST mental breakdown ever. The combined from not finishing my thesis on time to graduate this past fall semester, family, depression, pandemic blues all just caused me to snap and my brother called my sister to come over because he was scared for me. They had an intervention and it was brutal and my mental state was effed uuuup. After my mom got involved a few days later, I agreed to make an appointment to see a doctor and ask to get put on something.   I only slept for a few hours last night and I’m anxiously waiting for my appointment. This is me actually getting help and I’m so scared. What if I say the wrong thing and I’m taken away? What if he ends up not giving me anything? I’m not a big fan of medication in general and am afraid it will really mess me up more (being on hydros after wisdom teeth removal gave me horrendous mood swings). I also know the doctor is going to comment on my weight gain (pandemic weight+depression) and that’s just going to make me feel worse. Idk. I’m just kinda scared and nervous and want to cancel, but I just wanted to vent.   Any advice on what to expect going on meds the first time?

Firstly, we applaud your vulnerability in both expressing this unmet need to your social circle and yourself. As to your question, in my experience medication can be used to efficaciously address some symptoms, but it more so helped me coast along on autopilot through life. It dispensed with my intense self-loathing and pervasive thoughts of worthlessness, but at the expense of simultaneously mitigating any positive emotions. Of course biochemical individuality may play a variable in your experience.    Typically medication is used as a bridge to a more consistent lifestyle change that addresses causes in the first place. It may give you the necessary courage to dive into your conditioning and past trauma / experiences that led to formative stages of depression and other responses.    Hope you find your strength in this war! Rooting for you.
You would only be hospitalized if you have a plan to harm yourself or someone else. Don't think about the stigma of mental illness meaning your life is over. By getting help you can have a productive and more importantly a safe life. I've dealt with this for the last forty years. I may not have accomplished everything i wanted to do, but I've found a meaningful job with the handicapped and the families I've worked with don't notice my illness. Don't be afraid. It's worse to do nothing.
Hey good job man   I don’t have any advice to give but there’s plenty of helpful people on this sub   good luck hope it gets better soon

So I'm laying in bed after a long day of feeling sorry for myself and cry my eyes out. Im not sure why I'm writing this but this isn't the first time this experience has happened and I'm afraid it probably won't be the last. I always think I have concord my depression but then I end up back here in this spot. Lost, empty, and alone. I always think I have learned the appropriate coping skills to deal with this but when I get triggered I just always end up back to the old habits pushing everyone away, not allowing them to help. I always end up shutting my self in and wallowing in my own pitty and the worst part is I never have a fucking clue why the fuck I get this way I can never exactly point out what triggered it. I feel like I do it for attention but I never let people see me like this expect for in moments like this where I just can't force a smile as much as I want and the harder I try to smile the more I want to cry. I really have no reason to feel this way neither. I have a pretty great life with amazing parents who are supportive and some pretty great siblings and friends who would love to be there for me but yet I choose to sit here in the dark crying and feeling like I'm just a waste of space like I'm just a bother and like I got them all fooled into thinking I'm this great guy but one day will see through what I believe to be a facade because I don't see myself as a great guy

Yeah, I get these moods too, but like twice a week now. In my case it's triggered by a general feeling of having a crappy life and being worthless. Well, it's not really a feeling but a fact, lol. Anyway, I know how crappy it feels, and how the self-pity can swallow everything, sorry you are going through it.   I suggest you read your last sentence again and think on it hard. I hope you find the strength to open up to someone, and let them help. I have a feeling it wouldn't be as bad as you think.

I don't study the major I realized I want half way through, I can't switch now cuz it's imposible here, I don't like where I am living, I am not living the life I want (not about money), I don't like back 99% of the people that like me, I hate almost nobody tho. I can't reveal my ideologies and beliefs with 99% of the people around me at all (I am an agnostic atheist). I barley enjoy any moment in my life if any in fact I don't even remmeber the last time I really felt happy. I just started dropping tears writing this which is good, I think. I literally have no idea why I haven't commited suicide yet. Thank you.

Hey, I understand how you feel. You feel as if you are stuck and can't seem to find an end to all this right?  I am not an expert but I suggest taking a break school wise. Take a year or 2, explore new things and see what makes you excited again, even if it is a little bit. As for the people around it can be hard to find good people but something you need to do to is change that if surround yourself with new people by meeting them online or even face to face after the pandemic of course. Also if you don't like the people in your life don't keep them around. Its okay to break up friends or any other relationships.  Also maybe try to be not only true to yourself but others too around you. You mentioned you don't like sharing and that is totally understandable but at the end of the day I learned that if you don't then one can help you. I suggest Journaling if you don't already do so of course this is a good platform to get it out too.  About the sucide thing it seems to me like you don't wanna die you are just not happy with your current situation. I can't promise that shit will get better but I speak from personal experience when I say you will differently get stronger from all this. I really hope you live the life you want too.
Thank you,a lot!

I’ve spent the last 30 minutes trying to make an appointment for therapy. Researching providers, trying to find out my copay, trying to find out which providers are accepting new patients.  I finally find a provider (after no luck with insurance by the way but whatever) and finally decide to bite the bullet and make an appt. I get her lengthy voicemail explaining what info to leave, write it all down so I know what to say on the message and her voicemail is full.  I don’t have the energy for this or life in general rn, I feel so defeated. Why is it so hard to get help?

I know EXACTLY what this experience is like as I have been through it many times. It is completely ridiculous that mental health treatment is so hard to come by.  Have you tried the website 7 cups of Tea? They aren't professional licensed therapists but they are (in my experience) great listeners and everyday people who can relate or atleast just lend you a shoulder. That might be a temporary support until you can get access to the professionals.
I have had issues making appointments too. And frankly I agree, for those of us with phone anxiety it’s painful.
I was just thinking about this! I called my insurance provider and asked for a list of therapists. She said oh a physical therapist? I said no like a psychologist. She just kept going on and on about a physical therapist so I hung up. I really need to find a good therapist. The last one I found, whom I actually saw, sucked. Then I tried contacting another and left a few voicemails but no response. It really shouldn’t be this difficult!
No I haven’t but thank you so much, I will definitely check it out!   Yea its crazy to me how many hoops you have to jump through to get treatment when for a lot of us just picking up the phone to call someone and make an inquiry is a huge ordeal in and of itself. It shouldn’t be this hard.
Ugh that’s so frustrating!

My depression and anxiety have been pretty bad for a long while. I don’t do school or work or eat or anything really. My parents keep asking me why I don’t do my schoolwork and they tell me to just get over it and do it. But I like can’t, I don’t know what is wrong with me. I can’t focus I can’t do anything and I definitely don’t want to do it either. So what am I supposed to tell my parents?   I got an email from my school telling them that I should go to in person school because I’m failing my classes. I can’t do that either. I’m fucked. I’m scared, they’re going to yell at me later, I know it. My mind feels kinda fragile recently so idk what I’ll do when they yell at me:/

Info: how old are you? Can you go to the doctor by yourself and pick up a prescription by yourself? If so, do it. Medications can be great and it sounds like you need something.   Otherwise you need to talk to your teachers ASAP. Make them and a counselor know what is going on. Make an email and rsvp them all so you don’t have to do it more than once. It will be easier that way.   Also, just remember you are not alone in this. I’ve had this problem many times with school. It can and does get better with the right support and health plan.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/l09kiq/depression_vs_bipolar_ii/
I was recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but I am genuinely concerned that I might have bipolar disorder. It’s nothing I ever brought up because I didn’t know that bipolar II existed and I thought the only way someone could have it is if they had extreme mania. Thing is I have very bad depressive episodes and have been hospitalized before because of it, but every episode has been broken up by shorter periods where I either feel on top of the world or feel like I’m going to snap at everyone around me, not including all the stupid and weird crap I’ve done during those times too. Is this something I should be worried about? How would I bring this up with my therapist?

Just say you heard about bipolar II just recently and you relate to it. Your therapist can test you further to see if you have it. If so there might be a better medication you could be on which would make bringing it up worthwhile.

It's not about not being able to afford stuff for yourself, it's about not feeling safe, not knowing if you'll afford to live and always having weight on your shoulders. I'm 18 and my mom kicked me out of the house half a year ago on my birthday. I've always worked for my own money but since covid situation here in Europe is really bad I can't find a job with not even finished high-school (I'm a straight A student but that won't matter since I'll probably have to focus on work not university). I'm barely scraping with help of friends but they are struggling too at the moment so I'm kinda alone. I'm on a 10$ weekly budget for food and I'm really at my edge. I'll figure something out when covid passes but I have to survive to that point. I can bearly pick myself up from bed every morning and I feel stuck.

I feel u man. Literally most of my problems could be solved with money
Not having money makes u depressed and having money doesn't make you happy, but you're not stressed as fuck and have time to work on yourself. Better to have money then to not in every way.
People who say money isnt improtant are simply naive or have not lived in poverty. Money is absolutely EVERYTHING in life the argument,money wont save your health or what not yeh right money isnt gonna buy me medicine huh? wont buy me better food to not get sick huh? wont allow me to get checked up yearly from blood work to physical therapy or what not huh?     I litterally stop talking to people once i hear something along the lines of money doesnt matter they are some of the stupidest individuals out there,i even remember my ex calling me some sort of douchebag for saying her job is more important at the moment than getting that degree to make comics all while her pops was about to lose his job and her mom already worked half the days she used do during first covid shenanigans.      I kinda vented here doesnt really concern you but i had to get it out there considering the matter of the post is feeling unease during low budgets. As for you things will defo pick up dont worry try eating filling foods to get by for now.
Money has diminishing returns at a certain point mind you that point is somewhere between 100k-200k a year. Up untill that point every increase of 100 dollars or more improves your life. This in itself doesn't remove depression, however it does greatly improve your life leading to ways to improve it. Can't go to a therapist without money. Can't eat right without money. Can't take care of yourself. Does the uk not have food stamps, or assistance for individuals in your current state?   When my father died I was the only one working in our household. Our income went from a couple thousand a month to like almost nothing. I remember the steps and stuggle of that time. I remember having to go to family and friends asking for help. I remember trying to get more jobs. Its sad but money really can make your life easier and better.
I was there. Studied electrical engineering with 50€ budget for a month (for everything). I used to spent hours thinking if I should buy deodorant  for 1€ or better one for 1,5€. Or I walked 8km a day because I could not afford 8€ student monthly ticket for s bus.  Being poor destroyed the best years od my life,because I let it so. State of you wallet might change overnight, state of your mind can not. Getting out of depression is not easy and please try asap.  Google for some online jobs, try translating, English tutoring. If you are not working, try to learn new skills. Straight A student can learn basic programming and start earning on freelancer.com in several months. Explore your options. Do not give up.
Hi friend, I’m not sure what resources are available in the UK as I’m in the US. Here we have a public aid welfare system, that it sounds like you would qualify for. It’s in no way perfect, but can help give you a little relief. I’m sorry for your home situation and the stress you are in. I’m grateful for your friends that can help. If you have a counselor or advisor at your school, I would start there to see what’s available.
I can’t agree with you more Try having three disabled kids no father in the house he abandoned us 12 years ago and being dirt poor
Hi OP, I get your point. Having no money, no source of income was one of the things that absolutely stood between me and recovery. My depression got way better once my financial stability improved even a little bit. You can’t focus on your mental health when all you think about is „How do I pay my rent, what can I eat to spend as little money as possible, what can I invest in to help me in the future“. It's the ultimate breeding ground for anxiety.  You seem to be in a really bad situation in life right now. This incident with your mother sounds horrible and the pandemic gives a lot of people a hard time. I'm glad you have friends who try to look after and support you though. You're right, you gotta survive this weird, difficult situation but I don’t have any doubts you will be okay in the end. You already got through hardships and it sounds like you’re really adaptable!  I don’t know where you live and what the social system in your country looks like but if there are any supportive options for you, don’t be ashamed to ask for help!
but all you gotta do is pull yourself up by your bootstraps, says the boomer.
In Italy luckily for me the parents must provide sustainment until the child is economically independent. Why have you been kicked out of the house?
This is 100% correct. Im in the states, a college student absolutely struggling. I would gladly take the money that everyone claims doesn’t buy happiness. It may not buy happiness, but it would damn sure buy me a peace of mind for a while. I cant even afford food some days, a nice bottle of water and some sleep does the trick.
Have you tried “Go Fund Me”? If you do, add the link here. I’ll help.
I couldn't agree more. Also I'm sorry you went through that and are going through it currently. I can't promise things will get better but I really hope they do for your sake.
Look into getting disability.
i hope it gets better for you, don't give up
How is that even legal? At least in our country (Czech Republic) and many other European countries your parents can't kick you out unless you are able to provide for yourself. Fingers crossed for you buddy! Hope you'll be able to get a job soon.
Money won't buy you happiness and you can learn to be happy without money (a lot of people in developing countries are happy so the lack of money isn't an excuse). But money certainly helps, with everything.
I'm not in the UK, I'm in eastern Europe which means no social system at all. But thank you so much for advices.
Bro, I don't want to be that person, but Europe is like 800 millions people... It is not only UK, but anyway thanks, your advice is actually pretty good, and it may help me because in Italy we should have something similar
I'll make a GoFundMe but I have no where to reach out to, I can try on reddit?
Do you have money, or are you speaking from a place of extreme poverty and lack and have figured out how to live with hardly anything?
Churches. Temples. Mosques. Great places for obtaining basic resources or connecting you to someone that can help. Most Abrahamic religions practice almsgiving to the poor. At the least they may give you a meal or two.
Interesting. The purpose of the sentence was to preface that I couldn’t solve his problem without the knowledge of his country. If after reading his entire statement I didn’t realize exactly where it was, the sentence is still the same. I don’t know the resources in Nigeria or Italy or Poland or China. Try to look at the big picture kindness.
Dm me the name or title you put on go fund me and I can search it
Poverty.

I'm just another person on the Internet. Who the gives a shit about me right.  I'm feeling extra shit today so here I am, typing away.  Hi, my name is Sam. I've been living with depression for 13 or so years now. My doctors say it's Major Depressive Disorder. I've got a few doctors that work with me. And two psychotherapists.  I'm 25 years old if anyone gives a fuck.  I've been on medication for 4 years now, they keep trying different stuff on me, different doses to. Nothing really works.  Ever since I was a teen I've wanted to kill myself, for no exact reason. I just came to the conclusion that I wanted death. That life wasn't for me.  I've been to 20 different countries, tried so many new things. Nothing brought me real joy.  I don't really know where I'm going with this story. I'm just typing.  I've never made an attempt on my life. But that is going to change soon. I live in a tall apartment building. My family won't care, they already ignore me and last I heard from then they told me to leave them the fuck alone. My few friends... The girl I like. Won't stop me.   Thank you for reading. I doubt I'll reply to any comments. If there will be any. I'm going to go for a nice fall soon.

Fell deeply in love with a married woman two years ago and she came over to my place and her husband found out. I have been drinking everyday for 1.5 years after we had to break contact. I have also stalked her several times each day looking on facebook who she likes and who likes her. Have talked to her when I see her and how much I love her and how much feelings she has for me.   I broke down this christmas after I quit watching pornography and realized she has found a new man behind his back and she is most likely trying to start a relationship with him. I ask her when I see her but I also push her further away.   Today I told her I will leave her alone.  All that I can think of is ending it. Any hope left?

Yes, young man, there is plenty of hope left. I've been where you're at now. And clearly it's time for you to move on...  There are countless single women out there.  And you only need one good one.  So the odds are very much in your favor.  Not to sound trite...  But in baseball terms... Pete Rose set the record for most career hits in major league baseball 35 years ago. Guess who has the career record for most outs...  Pete Rose.  Connect with women every chance you get - smile, say hello, crack a joke, start a conversation, make a new friend. Some will respond and some will blow you off. But you aren't gonna get any hits if you don't swing the bat.  Things are hard now with Covid. But the Internet has - again - countless chat rooms, message boards, dating sites, etc. Reach out and make connections. Not out of desperation to get a date. But just to meet new people, make friends, learn about their lives, have some laughs, and have some fun.   Do all the right things, and the right friendship - at the right time - will blossom into a good relationship.  Trust me.  I've been there. And I know the way out.   Keep the faith...
Thanks. Feels like hell right now but I guess I Will just have to suffer through.
Hang in there... The girl is obviously bad news. She's doing you a favor by pushing you away. In the long run you will be so much better off... In the mean time, maybe you can get some help to get through this difficult time. I see a counselor every month and take anti-anxiety medication as well, which helps take the edge off. Highly recommend both... Also he got me reading this book, Full Catastrophe Living, by Jon Kabat-Zinn. The author treats people with severe back pain. But through meditation and the proper attitude, these people are still able to have positive, productive days. Recommend this as well...
She obviously does. I started nofap aka No porn or masturbation.. Been 3 weeks thats why i got this intuition. I Just met her 2 hours ago and instead of blaming her i Just was grateful she is happy. Have you recently gone through the same? And is the reason for your medication the situation?
Some years back, I was in and out of a bad relationship that wasn't good for me. I was so wrapped up in her that I lost all perspective of all the better options out there. Once I finally got out of it and got my bearings straight, I put her in the rearview mirror and started casually dating a lot of different women. I felt so free and had a really good time. I kissed a lotta girls. Haha. And it was then that I met my wife...
Damn good to hear. I wont give up..
Keep the faith. Do all the right things and better days are ahead...
i havent jacked off for 4 weeks now and finally got out of the flatline. Went to the buss and popped erections just by looking at good looking girls. I think this will help me get over her and find a new girl quick.. :D
Yep when you're ready to move on, there will plenty of better options out there for you than this one...
>Connect with women every chance you get - smile, say hello, crack a joke, start a conversation, make a new friend. Some will respond and some will blow you off. But you aren't gonna get any hits if you don't swing the bat.  Gotta say this is the best advice! I have been doing it the last few days and the feel good chemicals when women smile back is amazing. I dont need to have sex but just to see they are happy makes me happy
You have had that super-power all along. Who knew??  Haha!   With each smile, you have everything to gain and absolutely nothing to lose. Smile, chat, make friends, pick and choose. The world is your oyster, young man...

I have been in depression for already 4 years (I am taking meds but I am trying to stop them slowly)    Lately I feel like my communication with people around me is really bad. I'm always in defensive mode, always trying to go against what people say to me. I feel bad for it but I realise after my conversation..I feel like my childhood and my relationship I had with my father is the reason but I feel it's getting worse, and I just feel like I want to stay home alone and see nobody..i don't know how to act and why I communicate this way, I always feel "guilty" but I can't stop myself while speaking..

I have found that the secret to good communication with other people is to take a serious interest in them and ask them questions about themselves and their lives.  People like to talk about themselves.  Bit not many other people want to listen.  So I can have an extended and interesting conversation with someone, without having to say anything about myself or my own thoughts and feelings. That takes a lot of social pressure off of me.  Keep trying to reach out to others. Isolation is not good for us, especially now during Covid, and only pushes us deeper into depression.  Hang in there...  : )

Today was supposed to be a great day for me financially. I got the good news that because it's been a year since I last donated, that I would get new donor pay at the octapharma center. After 2 hours of waiting and filling out stuff I am informed that I cannot donate again because of my history of suicide. last time I was never asked about my mental health and they only asked relevant questions.  But because I told the truth when the physician asked I am now banned from ever donating again.   How the hell is this supposed to help my suicide urges?

May I offer my own personal experiences with this exact issue?  Here goes: I'm moderately good at everything I try. Songs I write are catchy. Plants I grow are healthy. Work I do is always adequate.   However I never stand out as better than others at anything I do.   I've come to realize it's an issue of focus. I don't focus all of my strength on anything. This one thing gets 10%, and the next, and the next.   Through playing guitar for years, I've become better than most of my peers. I've realized that it just takes focus and determination and not giving up even once you are "as good as you need to be". Keep pressing on.   You've got this! Keep going!

Overthinking friend relationships  I constantly have this struggle that when friends say they love me, appreciate me, and say I’m never a bother... I still think I’m annoying person. I get anxiety when friends don’t text back for a while and I think I did something wrong. Yesterday I saw my friend let him know I was going through an horrible episode of depression and I was thankful he was there for me. Fast forward to this morning when I let him know it’s another bad day.. I get no response. Logically my friend is probably busy and just can’t get to me. We are always helping each other out and my mind constantly thinks I’m a bad person. How do I stop thinking irrationally?

This is a frequent pattern I've observed in my past as well as many people who have depressive episodes ; an issue with the self-image conditioning.    Our self-image determines what we believe we are worth in life, and we always operate in strict accordance with this. If we receive or are endowed with something we don't innately "feel" is right for us (ie imposter syndrome, guilt, shame, constant apologizing, always being the one taking responsibility for all relationship failures) - we act in a compensatory manner.    The beautiful thing here is that nobody is born with a self-image, it's formed and molded through our evaluation of experiences.    A good place to start with this realm of psychology is on youtube, simply search "bob proctor self image" or "earl nightingale self image" - both of them have insightful comments and observations on this phenomenon.    Hope you're looking for the right thing, because we always find what we're looking for.

I hate myself so much. I completely fucked myself over last semester and even though I was depressed, I got poor grades and managed to tank my gpa. I don't know what was going on when I ruined my grades and people keep saying to mov on but I don't understand how you just move on from your poor grades. I kept thinking about how you can't fix it and I keep dwelling on it to the point where I forgot about everything else that I had to do. I hate this. ):

I’ve always felt that people that say “Move on” or “if you fall down, get back up” mean well, but if that’s all they say, it’s not really helpful. Figuring out what happened is good, because it might keep you from making the same mistakes again. Hating yourself for a mistake is not helpful though, find a positive action that you can do today that will make you feel like you accomplished something.
It’s ok. Sometimes we let life get in the way of life, and there’s nothing you can do to change it. Refocus on why your focused on holding onto this mistake. Currently the only pay off is a painful reminder. Think about this as more of a lesson in what not to do in the future, or even to learn what lead you down that path to begin with. You will recover, I believe in you.
Sometimes life is just really hard. I know you’re feeling the extra weight of it right now, but as soon as you can forgive yourself and give yourself grace for this.

I cant forget what she said to me I am usually very forgiving but I cant forgive her. I was crying last night and she said she heard me crying and didnt want to do anything about it. I was crying and I thought no one cared about me. I tried strangling myself with a belt. I don't know why I stopped myself. But today I learned no one is truly there for me.

I feel isolated from all people even though I am not, I feel isolated even when I talk to people, or among them, it's like there are walls or kind of barriers between me and people, which make impossible to be close or even be interested. I almost don't talk to people it is neither possible nor appealing for me. I feel like I don't love anyone I should so in the end of the day my family, my friends are just strangers to me. I don't even get if I feel lonely or isolated

i want to kill myself because i feel so sorry for myself, all i do is feel sorry for myself. all my thoughts self pity. i feel emotions so intensely. i get severely emotionally attached to people i hardly know. i cant stop my brain from thinking things i dont think i really even believe. i want friends. i want to talk to people. but i also do this to myself. i feel it's inevitable one day i will kill myself, because its the right thing to do. id be doing a good thing, maybe the only genuinely good thing in my entire life. whats it like to be in a group of people, or just one person, who both mutually like talking to each other? i miss knowing what it felt like to believe that my friends actually liked me. i havent had any since i was 13, im turning 20 soon. my dad said it was normal to go through periods of loneliness, im making a big deal out of nothing. my dad is 60 and never had friends. he had one relationship, with my mother, which lasted 5 years. i will grow up to be just like my dad if i let myself live a full life.

Yes of course you can feel sad. Though I may be 16 and I don't think my situation is as bad as yours I do see some similarities. Like the how my own thoughts and emotions hold me back from making any deep bonds l. But unlike you who has a father that resembles you(though I'm not sure if that's good or bad)I have always felt alienated from my own since I was little I had much different preferences from them. Even more so now that I'm 16 since I haven't bin able to create any deep bonds with them other then being related to them. There's also thr fact that I haven't had any close friends since 6th grade and currently the people that consider me their friend I don't even talk to them.   Though I want to help you because I can kinda I feel really reluctant and don't now how I could even help but still if you want to talk to someone you can try me. Maybe we could even have some other similarities other than the fact that we both feel lonely.

I hardly get out of bed anymore. I can't do basic things like cleaning my house or doing laundry. Everything feels empty and pointless. Time is completely muddled together. I can only handle zoning out all day long watching movies or sleeping. It's been months. I don't see a way out. I'm so tired.

I am from India and with covid it's got a little bit harder to get jobs. But after trying a lot I got a job in a IT company, it's neither too small or too big of a company. Things were good in the beginning, but slowly I feel like I can't cope up with the pressure. I have hardly got sleep in a while and it's taking a toll on me. Also I feel like I am not good enough and I am just not as smart as everyone, I am not achieving much. Even though I am just in training but I can hardly understand a thing that's going on. The leads who train us are nice, they try to help but I feel like I am just disappointing them. I feel like quitting but it's the only job I got, I am not even smart enough to just secure another job. It's getting frustrating and I don't even have anyone to ask for help.

A person who I thought was always going to be there for me. Just told me that they don't expect anything from me and aren't speaking to me anymore. This person has been my rock for all my life. Going through depression was already hard with their support but now is seems impossible. I don't how to continue life without them (This person is a family member, not a romantic partner) . My suicidal thoughts got worse over this period of time but i have managed to keep myself at bay. Does it ever get better?

I have lost my third job since October. I do not have a home of my own but instead am staying with a friend. Aside from this one friend, I really have nobody in my life. I have no hobbies, no interests, nothing that I am good at or proud of. I am supposed to be graduating this year from college, but now my school is trying to find discrepancies with my degree progress that might push my graduation date back even further. I feel absolutely worthless and useless, like I'm not contributing anything meaningful or good to society.   I have spent the last two days in bed, mainly. Haven't been outside or showered. Barely eating. Drinking at least half of my usual water intake. Sleeping far too much. Entertaining suicidal thoughts and considering reverting back to self-harming that doesn't really work for me anymore but maybe it could snap me out of this mess. I have been submitting my homework, for whatever that is worth.  I have never had a depressive slump so intense like this before, like the ones that I've experienced since October. I feel kind of hopeless, and I am absolutely disgusted with myself right now. In the past, self-harming was capable of bringing me out of similar slumps and low days. What do I really have to lose, is what I keep asking myself at this point. Might as well try it again, in my mind. Because I can't keep living like this. This isn't me, and I hate this version of myself so, so much. This version of me is embarrassing, and I feel such intense shame for letting myself get this bad. I hate myself.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Im mostly copy pasting this from a recent mental health journal I did. I wanted to sit down and articulate what I was feeling to try to make sense of it. I figure maybe someone else who has had comparable experiences may be able to help me out. If it comes off as really rambly I apologize. I was just brain dumping all of this the other evening.  It's hard to pinpoint any one major problem right now. I guess my biggest struggle is constantly feeling bored or dissatisfied with both work and hobbies. I feel at work as if I'd rather be playing games or watching shows, anything but being at work. At home I become bored quickly, or I never even bother to start playing or watching anything, and wait it out until im back at work again. I feel constantly locked in a battle between finding worth in my life through work and hobbies and neither one actually helps fulfill that. I'm constantly feeling as though I'd rather be doing something else, regardless of what I'm doing, but I never find what that something else is. Exercise, work, games, shows, making music, listening to music, reading, writing, ive tried anything I'd remotely enjoy. Fucking nothing. I do tend to enjoy playing some games and watching some shows. I rarely listen to just music outside of work but sometimes I can enjoy it when im off work. Oftentimes with games I'm reminded that they're only temporary and eventually ill be back at work. Or ill feel like I'm wasting time and being lazy by playing them. Ill rewatch the same shows constantly because I don't wanna try to emotionally or mentally invest in something new. I never feel like I have the energy or desire to. Same with games. And God im so sick of work sometimes. I work two retail jobs. So many people. So much lifting and moving and constantly cleaning up after people. People without masks and people that get too close and make a mess and I gotta keep cleaning and fixing and moving. And even when physically I feel like I can work just fine, I always feel so drained. Like I can't focus or remember what needs to be done. And god my mood changes so easily. I go from so friendly to indignant or stoic so quickly. I can't keep energy or positivity in me long enough for it to matter. I always feel like I'm falling behind. Like im not trying hard enough. It feels like I have to make a great effort some days just to try at all. I barely know what I'm doing some days. Like all I have is autopilot. I dont know what it is. I don't know how to stop it. I don't know if im truly lazy or if something is hindering me. I know im often anxious and moody and tired and I dont wanna be anymore. I dont wanna always be in a bad mood whether I'm home having "fun" or at work. Idk what I'm gonna do from here. I dont quite know why I never feel like I wanna be doing anything im doing even when I'm enjoying myself. I dont feel like I enjoy anything like I used to. If anyone has any input, anything to add, anything that may help me figure out what's going on id appreciate it.

Variety my friend you need variety! Certainty (doing same things or love for someone/ good works) are also somthing or body craves too much of one thing and you’re out of wack
Its definitely a sign that you stop to enjoy things you used to like, I can relate. Maybe there are some problems you cant see for yourself right now, for those a therapist could certainly help to figure out more. You dont have to commit to go, you can also just book one sitting. For me personally, it helped. Also going out into nature and appreciating the world helped me to feel better.
The difficult thing is that I've attempted to break up the routine a bit. Tried incorporating exercise, went on walks, cant do much recreational activity because of covid, if I was playing games I was trying to enjoy new things but couldn't because it felt like too much energy to invest in something new. I don't know if that's simple laziness but I used to love trying new things and having new experiences and now I feel anxious about anything new, mostly I just don't care to try anything new. Its difficult to shake out of my daily routine because I don't really have anything else to do. Even within my routine variation is difficult because, as I mentioned I never feel any strong desire to try anything new and even when I do I rarely keep any interest in it. It didn't used to be a problem.
The walks definitely helped a bit. I was definitely debating a therapy session but I figured I might could get a second opinion on my current state and potentially save a trip. But I probably should go anyways. If nothing else if there isn't something wrong at least I might get some insight as to whats going on with me.
If you wait for a feeling it will take a lot longer. Doing things that you don’t want to do is a learned skill. I always wanted to wake up at 5:30am and do yoga and a workout. I about cried I hated changing my routine so much and many many days I failed but persistence got me there and now I don’t see how I ever started my day without it. Having your mind right first thing can really set tone for day

I am a 17 yo male, who comes from an extremely abusive household, and I’ve recently noticed that my feelings are almost non existent. I also can’t feel any pain, some might think it’s a gift but it’s a fucking curse. I’m numb to the core and I just want to be normal again. I haven’t eaten in 3 days because if I try to I throw up. I’ve been getting 4 hours of sleep regularly and can’t physically sleep longer than that. My father used to beat me and force me to torture rodents with him. I remember one time he made me drown a possum in a garbage can and hack a squirrels limbs off. By the time I was 8 years old I had already known how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble a .38 caliber pistol. My father was a narcissist, and I was his golden child. If I ever did anything wrong I was told I was making our family look bad. I’d get a hell of a beating if I even said anything out of line, and my mother was constantly in and out of hospitals from her “accidents”. I believe my father is a large part of why I am feeling the way I am recently. I noticed I stopped feeling emotion when I had a stroke last March. I wasn’t scared, or worried, I was calm, and didn’t even feel anything. Even after I had almost lost my ability to play guitar, I wasn’t sad or scared. Ever since then, it’s just gotten worse and worse. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and all I had to say to her was “ok”. Honestly it was probably best for her, I don’t know if I can feel love anymore, so what’s the point of trying. I recently noticed I can’t physically feel pain when I was trying to fix the shingles on my roof. I missed with the hammer and smacked my hand right on the thumb, but I didn’t feel anything. Just to test my theory, I smacked the back of my hand full force. I heard the crunching of bone, but still felt no pain. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’d say I’m terrified, but I’m not even sure I can feel terrified anymore. I just need help. I’m sorry for how long this paragraph is. I know most of you won’t even read it all, I know I probably wouldn’t. If you did read it all, thank you. I just need help, and at this point in my life I could use any help I can get.

Interesting. I’ve heard of losing emotional pain to numbness but not physical. I’m sorry about what you’ve been through, and about your girlfriend. Do you think there would be a way to knock some emotion loose? Did you love her? Does anything hurt you?
I believe at one point in time I did love her, but I don’t know if I’m even capable of it now. I have tried everything to feel pain, just so I feel the slightest bit human again, because at this point, I don’t feel human. I made a long cut down my forearm and literally poured salt in the wound, and I felt nothing
That seems abnormal. The physical part. Idk why you’d lose feeling in your body
I’ve looked up reasons for it and the only thing I could find was an extremely rare condition where your nerves don’t work properly, but I don’t understand why it would just suddenly start working
Maybe your nerves do work, but your brain is so closed off from trauma that it blocks certain things? I’m not sure if that’s even possible. Kind of like when you go into a rage you are stronger and don’t feel pain
I’m not saying that’s the reason for me not feeling pain, but it’s the only explanation I could find
Either way there’s nothing wrong with you. You’ve been through some things and as such would probably benefit from therapy in some way
I’m currently seeing a therapist, but even she doesn’t know what’s wrong with my nerves

I think my college debt just got sent to collections. I had gone to the college in person and they said they wouldn't do it and we could figure something out later as I had submitted an appeal and they said they'd wait for the appeal decision to come in first. So yeah. They lied to me. I just know I'm fucked. I feel some peace in knowing that if I die the debt goes with me.

Hello! My good friend and flatmate (23) is crying almost every day in her room since we started to live together 2 months ago.  I dont want to ignore that since I like her, cant stand seeing another human suffer and... I study psychology. (I am also 23). The difference is that in theory i get the point but in practice I am feeling so helpless to a friend who is getting into depression every day even more.  Today I tried helping again by texting on messenger if I can help but she answered that she is useless, bitter and old. I know that her parents are very toxic and dont give her feeling of safety. She also broke up with someone she still loves half year ago, she cant find a new job for a long time now due to pandemia and she quited university again because she felt she does not follow and she does not like it and studying online is not for her.  Its a complex situation. Or maybe actually its very simple... I dont know thats why I would be very happy to get from you some advices since I know how reddit community is experienced in such topics. Thank you a lot in advance!

To add to the other comment, talk in real life but don't make it "come out here and let's talk". Set up like a film night with popcorn and ice cream or similar in your flat and invite her to join you and be there to listen, do this regularly and in time hopefully she'll open up. It's also a good way to get her out her room and thinking about something else (film, game etc) and help stop the spiralling thoughts :)
Maybe try to talk to her in real life, it’s way better than writing online. But more importantly lister to her, most of the time I also don’t want people to just sweet talk everything and give a rational explanation to all the things I say. Listen to her and give her the feeling of you being supportive. At least these are the only things I can think of.
Its very sweet of you to be looking for ways to help her.   I agree with the previous posters who said to talk to her in person. Take it a step further than messaging and invite her for walks or something, try to get her up and out. Little distractions can do wonders, especially if you’re cooped up for days on end.  In any case, I feel like you’re doing a great job so far in keeping communication open. Showing her you’re there for her is the best thing you can do. She can open up and share when she feels comfortable.
Just have a chat, say you've noticed they haven't been themself and that you want to help. I've been in this situation a few times with housemates, and while I'm a guy, I usually started the conversation while opening a few beers for both my male and female housemates which seemed to help.  As an aside, I'd avoid mentioning any of your psychology studies. You don't want them to feel like you are practicing on them, but rather you genuinely care and want to help.
I suffer from depression myself and I can only give the advice that helped me. She needs to feel needed, like she needs to feel that she has a purpose in life. I only can say this Because I was diagnosed with depression when I was 19 years old and then had bipolar tendencies when I was 30 medications to help some what but I didn’t really feel much happiness until my friend at first really needed me to help care for her but then my daughter also need me for more reasons than one no I help care for her and her kids and help with the house. Now my depression is not nearly as bad and like I said I can only speak from experience. I don’t know if this will help, there are lots of people out there that need help in their homes. It also made me happier being a CNA I was a CNA for 30 years and I was really happy at work but when I went home I became miserable as soon as I pulled in the parking lot it hit me. But I absolutely loved being in caregiver and still do.      It’s really very sweet and obviously you’re Cut out to do type of career you’re looking for. Obviously you were meant to be there with her at least at this time of her life. I wish you all the best.
Be there for her when she wants to talk but don’t push her.  When people are depressed they usually struggle with daily tasks because depression sucks all the energy out them. What would have helped me during my depressions was someone who took away some of those tasks like for example cooking - if I was able to eat that is. On days that I could hardly swallow (one of my symptoms was not being able to eat) I would drink chocolate milk for the fat content.   Make some tea and bring her a cup. This could be an invitation for a conversation, but make sure it’s an invitation not an obligation.
Just listen to her as often as possible! It's almost impossible for anyone with depression to take any constructive advice, so the most helpful thing you can do is simply be there and let them vent out all of the negativity that's in their head
Ask her to do little things with you. Like say hey do you want to walk in the park for a little bit? I don’t want to go alone. Or ask her to go shopping with you or help you with a project or something like puzzles or games. Just little things to help her feel needed. I know that helped me a lot when i was really depressed. If you have a local animal shelter a lot of the times you can go just to pet the dogs and cats so take her with you. The days i was happiest is when my roommate asked me to go do things with her. At the very least, it’ll help distract her for a few hours.  Also let her know that you’re available to talk if she wants to but don’t push her to talk. Just let her know that you won’t judge her but you’ll be there for her.

There's this app called habitica where you have different lists for to-dos, daily checklists, and habits. When you get something done you get XP, coins, and prizes like pet eggs/ food/ quests. You can set custom rewards, some people do an hour of an activity they like but for me personally I'd just do it anyway unless the cost is really low. What works for me is spending $1 for 5 coins, $5 for 20 coins, $20 for 80 coins, $50 for 140 coins, $100 for 250. I have things like schoolwork, daily routines, and goals that I get points for, who j for me translates into spending money, and a shopping spree is a big motivator for me, I still spend less money this way than I would if I didn't have the app, but now I don't feel bad about it. There's quests you can go on and complete with other people, there's group challenges you can win coins for completing. Each task is 0.5-4 coins depending on how difficult it is, how often you complete it, how long it takes but you usually get 1-2 coins. With this app I got all my grades from D's to A's and B's in a week because I really want that $100 shopping spree. I also have stuff for taking care of myself, and today's the first day in years (if ever) I've done everything on the list (I got the app a week ago), stuff like showering, brushing my teeth, skincare, cleaning piercings, going for a walk, completing an assignment, working out, doing duolingo. I have goals like staying awake in class, not missing the bus, no missing assignments and I get a lil reward for doing those

It depends on the root. Are your troubles rooted in the mind (self-hatred habits, past trauma, identity issues...) or body (anemia, brain chemistry, genetics...)?
Cured, sadly no. But you can learn to handle them better over time.
I've had both diagnoses for the last forty years, so the answer is no. But you can control the symptoms with the proper medication.  I've managed to work and get married (for fifteen years) and be productive. You can too...

This is more of a career-related post. I'm a 29 yo single male. I have been feeling so down in the dumps about my career for the past couple years and it's just so life-force consuming.   &#x200B;  I don't know what I want to do with my career anymore because I dropped out of grad school a few years ago and thought that I would have something else figured out by now. I used to be so driven that I would read scientific journals for fun in my free time. I dropped out because 1) I was a bit depressed after breaking up and moving away from my SO, and 2) studying science for some reason starting giving me panic attacks. It started to feel like I was becoming existentially aware of what the point of any of it was. So, I dropped out and moved back home. Everyday I feel anxious. When I don't feel anxious I feel numb or depressed.   &#x200B;  It's like, the only thing I wanted to do in my life has been stripped of all joy and excitement and I don't know how to get it back.  &#x200B;  I have been trying to find a relationship since then, but I feel like other people can sense that I am totally lost and don't have any idea what I want to do with my life.

First time here. I’m not really comfortable enough to talk to anyone about this so this felt like a good spot. I’ve been trapped and imprisoned by my thoughts for years now. I’ve lived with crippling anxiety and depression for roughly 10 years now and I’ve been trying to help myself improve for about 2 years. I don’t know what to do where to go who to trust who to talk to. I’ve had professional therapy and such I just don’t think it really helps me and with covid and working a 38 hour a week retail job I haven’t had time to even go to that therapy. I don’t like what I’m doing and i don’t like where I’m going. Everything feels like it’s all piling up at once. I’m 23 and I graduated college 2 years ago and I work a shitty job and live with my parents because i don’t make enough money to do anything else. I don’t know what i wanna do or where i wanna be or anything. I know I’m not the only one who’s been in a spot like this but I’m stuck and I can’t find my way out.   Thanks to anyone reading.

I'm not a pusher of meds, but some antidepressants might do you good in making you feel better more quickly, I suppose you did only talk theraphy?
Correct just therapy as of now. I had made the choice early on in my mental health journey to try and not use meds although I have spoken to a few doctors about them.
I understand because I had that the exact same attitude, but what I realized is that there are some things that cannot be fixed by talk theraphy alone. E.g. I have mood swings, for whatever reason, and it's just something that happen regardless of my intentions, and the worst thing is I don't even notice it until the damage has been done due to my erratic behaviour.  If you happen to have a similar problem where the issue happens regardless of your best efforts, then it may be something to do with your "brain" and not just psychological, i.e. a matter of attitude. In these cases holding to no-meds attitude won't be productive no matter how you approach the situation. Then you might hit the wall and not be making any progress, and the reason might be you are using a wrong tool for the job, or lacking the right one. I don't know if that is the case for you, I'm just saying because I've experienced it.

I'm 32 years old. An INFJ type. I work for a film company. (mainly as a screenwriter) A dream I've had since my late teens that I am suppose to make great movies to touch people's hearts. But I've been having this mild depression-like feeling for the past 10+ years now. Every time my idea gets rejected by the company I would have rage and sadness. I never had a girlfriend. I have been in bed with two girls in the past but I never had sex with them so I'm still a virgin. The only thing I am certain at the moment is that "I am searching for love." However, I don't even understand myself completely and I certainly don't know how to love myself.  I had a serious crush on my English teacher back in my teenage hood, and it didn't turn out well, an ending sort of like the 1967 American movie *The Graduate*. Every time I had ruminations about such a memory I.... I weep.  I am very much into science fiction and fantasy films. I feel like at my age right now, it was supposed to be the time when a director releases his or her first feature film but I am way behind. And I am not interested in anyone else's story except my own, may be selfish, and it does make difficult and a pain in the ass for any film company. I am actually lucky that they keep me here.  Every time I go see my parents and have dinner with them I feel guilt. (I have a better relation with mother than father). I don't even know when was the last time I look deeply into their eyes. And you know Chinese culture can be quite suffocating sometimes. Maybe I was brought up as a spoiled brat and I have this excessive and unhealthy need to be recognized by other people, I wanted to make everyone happy so they will all like me but... people would usually think of me as awkward and annoying... I don't know what's going on.  I feel like something inside is eating me away and I can't control it.  I wish I could go back to when I was 5 years old but that's just a fantasy...

Hey y'all. I was always a fat kid ever since I can remember. When I graduated high school I decided to lose weight. I lost about 120 pounds over a span of a year and a half. I then decided to join the Army. Well no one ever told me being skinny and being in shape weren't the same thing. After waiting 6 months to dep in and 8.5 weeks of basic training I was finally pulled. I was sure I would make it through OSUT that being kicked out wasn't even on my radar until it was. It was crushing. After I got home people noticed I was different, which was to be expected. I didn't want to do anything I did before. I didn't want to go to the gym or play basketball or play WoW. I didn't want to go anywhere or see anyone. No one in my family ever thought anything of it. After 2 years I met my now wife. I was with her for 2 years before the excitement wore off and I started drowning again. I say drowning because that's what it feels like now. At that point my anxiety and depression came to a head and I had to make a choice. I was either going to lose her and after a while probably end up taking my own life or I could move back in with my parents. She decided to stay with me and move into my parents with me. I told them about how I had dreams about getting kicked out of basic training all the time and the not getting any sleep and the sudden anger streaks. They had no clue me getting kicked out had that kind of effect on me. I didn't either really. I thought that's just how people lived. My wife told me I needed to see a doctor. I listened finally after a couple of years. We had been together 4 years at that point. So I finally told th doctor what was happening snd they said. Yea sounds like general anxiety and depression and ptsd. They put me on celexa for a little while. It worked for a couple of months then stopped and I switched to Wellbutrin that didn't work at all. Then I took lexapro and had to stop because of the side effects and  now I'm on this new one called trit somthing. All I can say is if if you are thinking going to th doctor won't fix anything please please try to go. I didn't think the medicine would work either but it makes 100% the different for me and me and my wife are so much happier together. I know it's scary but it is worth it. I now have a child on the way a house and a wife!

Hi all, first time posting here. I found this subreddit today and was reading through some of the advice from others. Unfortunately it's not really helping me much at the moment. I've been struggling with anxiety in social situations for years and dealing with occasional depression, but I don't think I've felt as low as I do now.  For the past few weeks I've felt an intense loneliness that I haven't felt for a long time. I feel I don't have anything to look forward to except sadness and loneliness. While I have accomplished many things in my life, good job, house, car, things to do, it means nothing without someone to share it with. Why have all these things just for myself. All the times I've travelled, I travelled alone.  I've done so many things alone I don't want to do it anymore, so I don't do anything. I just sit here, thinking about what could have been if I didn't fail with past girlfriends and friends in general, while watching the people around me get married and do something with their lives. The past few weeks I've been consumed by it, dreaming about spending time with someone who is more than just a friend. I just feel like such a failure. I'm 34 and haven't had a relationship that lasted longer than a month and it was me that screwed it up every time.  Sorry that my thoughts are all over the place. I just feel so sure of what I'm missing in my life (a significant other), but at the same time feel so selfish and ashamed for it. I just don't know how to deal with these feelings this time. In the past, trying to improve myself seemed to help with these feelings. But this time I just have this nagging feeling that I've failed and my time has passed, sentenced to spending my life alone. I'm not that old, why do I feel like time has run out and I'm just to old to have that happiness?

I’ve been suffering with severe depression for quite some time now. I’ve written everything down if you want to see it but I’ll just talk bout the now. On top of my depression I am struggling in my job. I am 17, male, and started a part time job late November. I keep making mistakes. Really simple things like not stacking stuff properly. I feel like such. Failure . I struggle even with the most basic of jobs. I have ASD which probably explains it. I have no social life. No girlfriend. My family are there and support me by paying for therapy so I’m grateful for that. I acted on impulse and tried to jump off a bridge. At work I feel suicidal. I just want it all to be over.

I know the feeling. All the "external" things you mention are excellent reasons to feel like crap, but unfortunately depression just makes them harder to change. Vicious cycle.   One idea that I've found helpful was that when we want to "die", what we really want is to "escape from our (current) life". Which is not precisely the same thing. I dunno, maybe that doesn't resonate with you, but it can sometimes help me to see other options than the Big Delete Button, so to speak.   The most eloquent expression of this concept was in a book by Augusten Burroughs called "This Is How: Surviving What You Think You Can't". It's part autobiography, part self-help book (and quite funny, he's a humorist). As a teenager he got so desperate to escape his life that he ran away, changed his name, and started a completely new life. Completely reinvented himself.   I've somehow found just the *idea* that this is possible inspiring, although I don't think I ever could.   Female aspie here btw.
Sounds interesting - can Aspergers affect how you do jobs and how receptive you are to instructions out of interest?

I'm 22, I suffered of anorexia from the age of 18 to 20-21. Because of that, i didn't enjoy my college years and i didn't do the studies i wanted (medecine), my mental health was way too brittle to handle the pressure of these studies.  So i'm now doing my last year of studies (after 5 years), that i don't like at all, i'm feeling useless and i feel like I screwed up my entire life to come because i won't be able to do the work I want. I also want to do another master degree which i'll have more interest for, but i think that i'll be disappoint anyway  i'm afraid of death and i can't stop thinking about this last week, like I'm going to die having done nothing with my life. The covid situation does not help, i can't travel, i can't see my friends etc. The only person I see other than my parents and my boyfriend  I feel useless and I find that life is meaningless. We are all going to die one day and I feel like I'm wasting my time doing anything since the end is the same: death  I don't know what to do to recover my naivety without spending my days thinking about death, i don't know why it came suddenly in my mind like that but i'm not enjoying my time this past week, how can get rid of this?  (sorry if my post is not appropriate in this category, i dont think i am depressed but i dont know where to post this)

Same!! I’ve had this problem for the last 8+ years of my life and I’m at the point of planning to commit suicide in a year or two because I can’t improve my life successfully and nothing ever works out properly. I’m sick of lowering my standards and changing my goals to still not even get to those.  I don’t know if you’ve tried but sometimes talking to a therapist about this can help. Maybe tell them you want to change your life but aren’t sure how. I’ve found at least for small stuff adding a lot of structure to my life helps. Moreover, writing down specific, realistic goals and following through on them helps immensely some of the time. Breaking stuff down into small pieces and going over the process of how to achieve them can help.
So, I know this sounds cliche, but you CAN be someone else if you want to be.  At 18 I attempted suicide, I was unsuccessful and still miserable. So I "killed" the person I was, developing a new identity and personality along with a new name.  5 years later, moving a 2 hours drive away, and $500 for a legal name change -- and no one knows the person I was at 18. Even my Daughter only knows me as Kenji.  If you are feeling suicidal, may I suggest instead becoming someone entirely new.
Same....poverty sucks hopefully will live like I always wanted in near future
Be happy cause you have a SO in your life. I think that i would have been feeling much better if I had someone to hold and love.   The thing is, i want a different life too, but i like doing nothing also.   A miracle will happen to both of us and we re going to love our lives happy and fullfiled, I'm sure about that.
I do this a lot too
Right??!  Are you on discord; we can discuss if you like
my advice? start building that dream life right now. eventually it wont be a dream anymore.
Dude i definitely feel you on this! Ive felt stuck for the past 5+ years and everyday its harder and harder to push thru.  But recently i kind of had this realization for me personally that ove become super complacent and i need to fight harder to get out of my comfort zone to actually experience change.   You got this! Keep pushing 24 hrs a day we r all in this together!   I started to work up a sweat to release frustration and anger while simplifying my goals.  Ex] finding a new apartment nearby in time vs trying to move out of state with not enough time.   Idk if this helps, but just know youre not alone in this painful struggle
Why am I part of this even tho I can’t solve stuff on here
This is more common than you think. Don't be embarrassed (easy to say, hard to do) you must discuss it, as it's miserable to live with. Write it down on a list as a topic, hand the list to your therapist. That may be an easier way of bringing it up.
Bro I am in the same boat. But stay strong.
Please read The midnight library by Matt haig. It will make you see things from another perspective.
I have an appointment with my therapist this coming Wednesday. I am thinking of talking about this, unless I get embarrassed about this within the next 3 days.   I am just overwhelmed. I spent hours imagining another life instead of doing what I needed to do. I didn't answer the phone, because I didn't want to come back to this life. And now I am really disappointed, because I was forced back to my own life 😅
Hey sorry you’re going through this! I see a therapist for my mental health issues. I strongly encourage you to be vulnerable with them instead of hiding your experiences out of embarrassment. They’re there to help but how can they with a problem they don’t know exists? Just some food for thought, good luck :)

Ive struggled with depression for quite a while now, and certain times I find motivation comes easier than others. However, for the past three months I have been at a very low point, I shower once a week and I struggle to brush my teeth and hair. That’s where I’m at.  Last July I started seeing a personal trainer for the goal of weight loss and I haven’t seen her for 6 weeks now. My mom is encouraging me to go back, for my mental health’s sake, but right now I have no interest in exercise. Also, I fear that if I go back my goal of weight loss will prioritize over my goal of benefiting my mental health. I know I inevitably kick myself for not going back, but the dread is over powering my rationale. I would prefer to just to 10 minute workouts on my own in my pyjamas, but I know I probably won’t.  Personal training just seems like a lot.  What should I do? If you have been or know someone who is low-functioning, has personal training been helpful? Or exercise in general? Is it better to start small when you’re low functioning or just throw yourself in?  I appreciate any thoughts and advice as really I only have my mom’s perspective right now and she doesn’t totally understand the depressed brain. Thank you :)

Personal training sounds like it’s a mental drain in addition to a physical one, so maybe that’s just too much right now. I’d focus more energy on actually doing those short exercise sessions. I’ve also been low-functioning, and a couple things that help me are 1: getting in the habit of working out first things when I wake up, when my brain’s sleepy enough I can trick it into working. I also usually look up a youtube video to follow, because it takes a lot of the thought out of it and encourages me to exercise the full twenty or however many minutes. Also, I try to choose interesting or fun exercises, because at least until I start breathing heavy, i look forward to and enjoy the workout. Depending on my mood I’ll look up a yoga video, bellydancing, self defense techniques, whatever seems interesting and keeps me moving. And yes, it definitely helps me feel better overall, even if I’m really unhappy during the workout because my body is unused to the activity, but it’s always worth it if I can coax myself through it. Promising yourself some sort of healthy treat like a long bath or strawberries (or less healthy ones like chocolate too tbh) or something doesn’t hurt either! Oh, and if you think it’d help, ask your mom to hold you accountable to the at home workouts or do them with you
For me starting slow is a much better way. It seems better to ease in rather than burnt out. One thing that helps me is, motivation follows action and it rarely happens the other way around  You kind of have to act now, think later while keeping the action something you  can achieve - small achievements that may take even as little as 5 minutes at a time  Also another good one I keep in mind is, feel the fear and do it anyway. Learn to accept uncomfortable feelings and be ok with that as it is all part of the process. Bit by bit.
When I'm that low, I definitely have the most luck starting small.   I also look up youtube videos. Usually the ones for "absolute beginners", or for people with e.g. MS, or old people (I don't have MS and I'm 39, but hey, if that 80-year old on the screencan do the movements I probably can too, even if I've been mostly horizontal for a month!)   The other day it was one on how to [exercise in bed](https://youtu.be/3B8m3mXUTfY). A nice physical therapist, demonstrating gentle movements for around 10 minutes; super low pressure. I watched it partway through once, and then put my laptop aside (I was, natch, in bed) and started from the beginning and actually did it. WIN.  I've also been trying to do 5 bodyweight squats a day. I've always had terrible squat form, so I watched a bunch of videos on that, I use a bench behind me (I try to just touch it with my butt, but if I fall backwards it's there) and go super slow, focusing on feeling my muscles work and my ankle flexion and not tensing my shoulders and so on. Great thing about squats is you can do one any time, any where!   My house is a horrible mess right now, so I really really don't want to do anything that involves having to clear off and clean a length of floor and then getting down on it, even on a mat (from which I would still be able to see the rest of the filth). Okay then, I tell myself; one problem at a time. Look up exercises that I can do standing up. Or sitting on a chair, or maybe, (for core work), on my hands and knees - that feels a little less yucky than being prone/supine.  ANYTHING is better than nothing!  I've also, at various times, had some luck with tai chi/qigong, yoga and pilates. Including classes, when I'm in a better place. I did go to a gym for a while, focusing on strength training mostly with machines (I am obese, but getting stronger motivates me a lot more than losing weight, and my nerd brain liked tracking the numbers. Also, most experts seem to believe that weight loss is primarily a nutrition thing, even if exercise can help.), but moved away and haven't been able to establish a gym routine since (also, covid).   At one point I taught myself to juggle. If you have zero arm strength, guess what, that's an arm workout. Core, a bit, too. And it's a pretty good activity for the restless type of anxiety, and sleeplessness. Rhythmic and sort of hypnotic once it becomes automatic.   For a while I had a very basic (cheap) walking treadmill set up with a plank across the arms, as a very rudimentary "walking desk", and I only allowed myself to watch certain TV shows (on my laptop) while walking. (Pro tip: If you try this, WEAR GOOD SHOES.) You can do the same thing with simple bodyweight stuff or stretching, although a treadmill/bike/rowing machine/etc takes less willpower, you just have to turn it on and get on.  (Maybe check if someone you know has an exercise machine they're not using, and if you can borrow it to see if that works for you?)  Going for walks with an audio book or podcast is another go-to, but feels a lot more challenging when I'm at the point where I just want to hide away under my duvet.  I would love a personal trainer in theory, but I'd have to find one that could help motivate me in the right way. "Tough love" or rah-rah style motivation (\*cough\*TonyRobbins\*cough\*) has always just made me feel worse; incremental, measurable goals and LOTS and LOTS of praise will work.   So: Get to know yourself, EXPERIMENT, keep notes, and repeat what works (= here: whatever will result in you actually getting some form of movement  in most days, no matter how 'silly' it may seem initially).

So I'm a 29 year old male, and for the past 10 years I've felt like i just want to cease to exist, if that makes sense. I don't want to cause any hurt to my family or friends,but I try to hide from them as much as I can. I feel powerless and alone, even when I'm with other people. On the outside I'm very manly (foot long beard, alot of large piercings and tattoos), but I constantly feel like I'm not good enough. Whenever people message me I hide and don't message back, I always think they won't care of i do. I miss certain people so much, but I can't tell them or even message them at all {even after they do), because I feel like they will think I'm talking shit or lying or trying to cover up why I took so long. My gf moved away for studying and I miss her so much, but I feel like if I say I do then she'll just tell me to fuck off and get rid, it's the same with my best friend, I constantly worry about messaging her back and now it's been 12 months, and I feel like she'll just tell me to fuck off, even though I just need to talk to her and cry and tell her how much I miss my gf. I live on the 6th floor of my building and constantly wonder if I could just go out the window, but i worry my family would be hurt to much. I just don't want to feel like this anymore and I'm scared everyone will just tell me to man up and deal with it. I don't know what to do.   I created a reddit account to post this, simply because I don't know what to do and I feel like any forum for men will just tell me to man up.

I'll be honest, it's very tough for men, even though you'd like to think there would be some acceptance in 2021.  I felt the same way for a long time. I was a husband and a father and depression wasn't something I thought I was allowed to have.  I resisted all initial attempts at medication and therapy, too, for basically the same reasons.  Bottom line is that you HAVE to go see a dr to see if meds can help you (even if it is just to get you past this time in your life). Therapy may also help.  Unfortunately in the beginning it is very "hit or miss" as certain things work differently for different people.  You have to stick with it and keep on fighting. Just the fact that you created a reddit account shows me that you know you need this help and, most importantly, that you WANT help.  That truly is the 1st step. Don't give up, I never thought I'd survive this, either, but I did and so can you.  Keep fighting!

It just seems like all my friends are in loving relationships except me. And the thought of never finding someone that truly loves me pains me greatly. I’m considering suicide and actively looking for buildings or train stations. Every time I feel remotely happy a few seconds later I’ll remember how sad I am and go straight back to my depressed state. And I don’t think my suicide would impact people that much. My friends tell me that it gets better and of course I want to believe them but it’s so hard to. Talking about these feelings to friends or family just makes me think I’m an annoyance. I’ve thought about it a lot and I’ve even written the suicide note. The only reason I’m not committing fully is due to some plans I have with friends but if my mental state doesn’t get better after that I’m not sure how long I’ll last.

I don't know what to do. I broke up with my long term partner 9 months ago when I was in a really dark place and I have been struggling ever since. I am in a panic all day. I can't live the rest of my life without him. Each day is worse than the day before. There is no light at the end of the tunnel for me here. He was my whole world. I cannot live without him. I've been trying but it just keeps get worse the more reality sets in and I know we aren't going to be together.

It’s gone on longer than what’s considered acute. I think it’s time to consider a professional/medication.
I am not sure if you have had such a big break up before but there is hope and it does get better. It really is truly one of the most painful experiences and your feelings are not unwarrented.   I was in a similar situation and what helped me is time, it does start to ease off maybe a little further in time from where you are now and most importantly I started  to build a new life, new goals, work on myself.    It doesnt feel so great at first and you may resist as you feel like you are  pulling further away from them which will strengthen your longing but.. it is not the end of the story just this chapter and one day you can take with you the good from the relationship and the lessons and it can always be a part of your story.  You can start a new chapter and you can be happy again  Hope this helps.  I am a guy so an insight from opposite sex here. Hope this helps in some way.  Good luck
Thank you. I have been through a big breakup before (10yr relationship) so this is my second and far worse (7yr relationship). I messed everything up in one minute because I was in a dark place and lost myself. I didn’t want to live this person, my person. It gets worse every day...I just want them back.

It's not your job to fix it.   This is what I was told when I was a kid and calling S.O.S.   It's not your job to fix it.  If they are violent, figure out a way to hide the guns and knives. Then lock yourself in your room.   Just remember, it's not your job to fix this. Stay safe.

I've (18m) been staying with my girlfriend (19f) lately as she's been struggling with her depression. It's been over two weeks now where she can hardly get up and stay up for more than a couple of hours. She has opened up about feeling guilty for the smallest moments of happiness or relief. Her counsellor has told her that she would recommend she gets on antidepressants. Things have gotten worse to the point now she seems determined to get even worse; she won't even have a drink of water because she thinks it makes her weak and therefore unworthy of any help. She's had years of being invalidated by peers and professionals (cahms here in the UK) before and I believe that may be a contributing factor to this.  Despite telling her strong I know she is being and how her current counsellor, mum and myself all see her and think she needs help. It's almost impossible to get through to her. Advice on what I can do before her next appointment (Thursday) would be much appreciated

If the main problem is that she doesn’t feel like she’s “sick” enough to get help, try reminding her that there’s no baseline of bad to need help. If there’s something she could do to make things easier, why not do it? If help’s available, take it, that’s what its for, doesn’t matter how much you need it. Like glasses, (you may have heard this but this helps me) i can see pretty well, I can function fine without glasses. But my sight’s not perfect, i can’t read captions on the tv well and my depth perception suffers a bit. But there’s no reason to just put up with those things, because I can get glasses, so why would I? Furthermore, it might help to remind her *everyone* needs help right now, its been a year. People who have no history of depression are seeking help right now, because none of us were ready to cope with this, and we shouldn’t have to try to just deal. So try whatever you can to feel better!
that's great to keep in mind! many thanks

I've been married for over a year now and I knew he had depression but he never let it out until he met me. I have bipolar and am struggling with not only mine but I'm struggling to help him. I have depression but it's bipolar depression. I know how to help myself but I don't know how to help him. I just get frustrated and irritated when the things I'm doing to help aren't helping. I don't know how to help him and its killing me inside.   I've thought multiple times whether it was a good idea to marry two people with severe mental illnesses. I don't plan on ever leaving him because he loves me and I love him.... but I don't know how to do anything for his depression. I'm at a loss and am now blaming myself for his feelings. I'm stuck and would like some advice. Does anyone have any ideas? I would much appreciate any help.

I'd encourage him to see a doctor and perhaps a therapist. You can offer heaps of suport and don't have to be the one who fixes his problems, particularly if you are battled your own mental illnesses, but you can encourage him to seek professionals who are trained in this kind of thing. This would hopefully leave you with much more energy to give him all the love, support and understanding he needs while the professionals handle the rest. 👍
Ya, he had one but now he works so much that he never has the opportunity to see her...I'm in a pickle....

Genuine question. Right now I can't even recall an experience of that. Like, how do you all walk around all day actually loving yourselves and actually wanting good things for yourselves? Does not compute.  I despise myself. I'm so tired of myself. I'm baffled by these people who say they care about me and that I'm good at things. I guess I've just gotten extremely good at pretending to be a functioning human being.  I know there's no logic to how I feel. But I don't know how to stop. I don't know how to stop hating myself. I wouldn't even know where to start.

Not hating yourself? There is no feeling to it. Self hate is a burden and without it you'll just feel neutral.

I have been living with chronic depression (undiagnosed) for about six years now. I tried therapy for a short stint bc my university offered it for free and it was no help. it was too hard to get out of bed to even make the appts and I always felt bad explaining why I was rescheduling so I eventually stopped going all together. My mental health has not deteriorated but it has not done any better either. I want to be happy. God knows I try. Especially bc overall I have had a good life (supportive parents, a small group of friends, even a good bf) I have a good future ahead of me, currently in grad school. and just overall should not feel as sad as I do. I feel like atp something is wrong with me. Since the pandemic my depression has been harder to hide from my spouse. My bf doesn’t get why I’m sad bc I have a good life. I don’t get why I’m sad bc I have a good life, which just makes me more sad bc I feel unappreciative. I don’t think therapy will help bc what will I tell them? “Hey I’m here bc I’m sad for no reason all the time” or “Hey I’m here bc every little thing sends me into crying spells”... I’m just really starting to not see a way out of this dark hole I’m in. Every time I dig up and find light, I manage to sink deeper into the hole. Does anyone else have similar feelings/situations and if so, have you overcome them? Thanks for reading if you got to the end.

Sounds like it might be time to consider trying medication. I know it doesn’t work for everyone, but there’s a chance it will help a lot and exploring that chance is better than waiting another six years feeling depressed.  I relate to what you’re feeling. I’m also in grad school and haven’t had a ton of luck with therapy. I know I have no right to be so down on myself, but that’s how my brain tends to operate. It’s high time for me to stop blaming myself and just accept that it’s a struggle I need to deal with every day. Time to find someone who can help and get into a healthy routine and give myself the best chance to start feeling better.  Remember, depression doesn’t have to discriminate because you have a good life, whatever that means, it can hit anyone at all for reasons unknown. You don’t have to justify it to yourself or anyone else, you just have to fight it.

I lived with my ex boyfriend for 8 years and was totally immersed in his life. I loved him, his family and his friends and I took care of his family members when they were sick. I genuinely loved these people and took care of them as though they were blood relatives. When my ex boyfriend broke up with me it all happened very quickly. The love we had shared for 8 years vanished in an instant.  In the blink of an eye he changed into a person that I never knew and never imagined he could be. He went mute and stopped talking to me and even to this day he, his family and friends are mute and will not speak to me for unknown reasons.   How can someone go from being your best friend to your worst enemy in the blink of an eye? And they feel no guilt about it? They don't think they've done anything wrong.    My sister says, "<my name >, these people don't care about you!"     I don't understand why someone would pretend to care for 8 years then abandon you on the side of the road like a piece of garbage tossed out of a car window and seemingly not feel an ounce of guilt. It's unconscionable  to me.    How can I recognize an impostor in the future to prevent myself from being hurt again?

I can’t answer your question about how to recognize because my ex did something similar after 9 years together. We don’t talk at all anymore and it eats me up inside.  I don’t think anything I can say will be of much help, but I know how much it hurts. How devastating it is. How trusting doesn’t makes sense anymore. I know it doesn’t lessen your pain but you’re not alone in that feeling.
Thank you.

That’s the best I could describe how I’ve been feeling for almost 2 months. I’m just overwhelmed with everything that’s going on in my life and the world to the point where it’s hard to keep up. I’ve been hearing nothing but negativity that’s been happening in this world and it caused an overload to my brain. It’s been difficult focusing and I’ve been feeling more apathetic. Nothing brings me pleasure anymore. One of the things that helped me cope with my depression has made me lose interest in it. It’s bothering me a lot because it happened so abruptly. Has anyone overcame this? If so how?

It may be dissociation
Yes. My wife stole my kids and took them across the country. I haven't seen them in almost a month. I cannot process anything anymore. My brain doesn't work, and I spend three hours doing shit that should be done in five minutes
This happened to me.   The sense of emptiness. I felt "where are my thoughts?". But sometimes i still feel the same. I react instead of respond.    It affected my focus and performance in a way i needed to learn how to focus by meditating.
I feel that way on and off, I think what you're describing might be a combination of stress and depression or depression due to piled up stress  Either way, what I found works for me is to take it one day at a time when it comes to my personal life, and to try and think of 3 good things that happened to you or made you smile that day every night before you go to bed, no matter how small those things may be, it could be something you read or a comment someone made or a little act of kindness you did, or even just a pleasant thought   Whatever it is, it helps you focus on the positives and push the gloomy thoughts away even if it's just for a bit  I know the world can be depressing and bring you down especially with everything that's going on today, but there is always something good happening around the world  One final tip, there are sites that only publish good news no matter how small they are, I suggest starting your day with that instead of the usual outlets like social media or the news. Here are some that I know of:  - Positive news - Good news network - The optimist daily    And a subreddit called r/upliftingnews   I hope you feel better soon, I'm sending you a virtual hug and positivity :)
You could both have experienced trauma. Go see a dr
I have and still dont have any solution. But ill be seeing a doctor soon, hoping he could help me out
This is called "collapse" and it's a response to prolonged or inescapably stress. There are ways to overcome it, they are detailed extensively in Polyvagal Theory by Deb Dana.
Maybe you need a new hobby or something, do too much and you get used to it and its not fun. It also sounds like you're bored. Try to communicate more often, play new games, or maybe just sleep more. Thats all I can reccomend. Best of luck for you!
yeah for sure. I always just feel in between tasks. Things don't get done. I can maintain the house/food at the very least. I blame addictive news cycles and social media etc. It's destroying my focus. I have to use special apps now that block a huge blacklisted list of websites for the day.
yes..  felt that way for a long time  it only recently started getting better   from stress
One more strategy that has helped me:  Try to do those things you used to enjoy knowing they won’t make you feel good right now, because things are shitty and “good” is really hard, just do them to feel okay. If you’re starting from a lower point you can’t expect them to make you feel as good as normal. Do them to just feel okay. One thing that prevents me from doing this is if i know nothing will feel as good as normal i can’t pick what to do because its all equally uninteresting, so put sticky notes in a jar or something to have something else pick an activity for you, if that helps. And give yourself lots of time for these things, more than normal, maybe just one thing a day, and feel proud of yourself for doing it and forgive yourself if you can’t.
I felt at one point as if my brain was eating itself. The way I overcame it was by taking it day by day. Over time I wanted to get better more & more. It took years tbh. It just takes a tiny bit of want to get the ball rolling.
Bro. Everyday i felt this kind of feeling :)
Yeah it is like self defence mechanism. Actually there to help even though might feel uncomfortable. Good way to work with it is dont fear it, know it is just a natural defence mechanism, part of the fight, flight and freeze response. The trick is to let your body slowly realise there is no danger by gradually easing back in to usual activities. Sit with uncomfortable feelings until they pass by themselves. And obviously take yourself away from as much unnecessary stress as possible.   I came to realise there is bad stress and good stress. Good stress is motivated by a forward mentality and is achievable. Bad stress is unnecessary stress that has no end goal and is just reactive. Try to know the difference and ease in to things that are positive and good for you. This is how I have come to look at it all.

turn off the sad music/movie. but down the sad book. walk away from whats troubling you as much as possible.  put on something happy, light, and distraction. tv show, movie, music. whatever. if you have a hobby that makes you feel better, go do that.  remember that everything is temporary and things get better. remember that even if you feel like your life is pointless, its not. you impact other people, whether it be smiling at that person last night that lifted their spirits, recommending someone a book that became that became their fave. whatever. you deserve to be in this world as much as anyone else.  i love you and i care about you and i accept you for who you are and everything is going to be okay eventually. i promise.

I have been struggling with heightened depression this past week and any advice is greatly appreciated. I recently moved back to the US after getting my PhD in the UK. I hate myself right now, I've gained a ton of weight, can't get a full time job with benefits (I'm making some money as an adjunct lecturer but not nearly enough). I'm in my early 30s and for the first time dependant on my parents for my rent because my job doesn't cover the bills and I'm not even getting interviews for jobs my experience and education have qualified me for. I feel useless and stupid.   Worst of all, I was on sertraline while in the UK and even though I'm paying through the nose for insurance I can't get a psychiatrist to take me on because it's shit insurance. I've had to ween myself off because I can't afford a counselor or better healthcare. This has been my first week fully off the meds (I got guidance from my gp in the UK before moving here and have followed it) and I honestly hate myself so much that I'm leaning into destructive behaviors instead of using the tools I have to make myself feel better.   How do I stop the spiral? Sorry for the long post.

I'm so sorry you're going through this. Have you tried going to a general practitioner to start? That's where I was prescribed a low dose of sertraline to begin with (later when I could afford it, I went to a psychiatrist).   As for spiraling, I know how hard it is to get out of it. It's such a scary feeling & feels like it's all out of your control. What's helped me is realizing that's it's not insurmountable mountain or monster inside me. They're just feelings. Scary feelings, but just feelings. And it's so tempting to fall back on destructive behaviors because it's easy & it's comforting. Believe me, I totally get that. Try to remove any negative/destructive triggers from your environment & pick up something like a new hobby-- for me it was painting. So instead of partaking in the destructive pattern, I made something.   I wish the best for you & hope you feel better soon!

Hey guys, I feel like I lost the battle. The last thing that made me happy and gave me hope is gone. I don’t have anything to be excited about in the near future. I just live so the week finishes and another one can start. I don’t feel like fighting anymore. I think I’m disconnecting from life the next few days, as I’ve already pushed most people in my life away.  Wishing you guys the best of luck in the future.

I recommend it to everyone that has trouble speaking about their problems to other people because they don't want to bother them. I am in this situation and I used to write in my diary like 2 years ago. I started again just a few days ago because I felt really depressed and honestly I feel a lot better now. I feel a bit relieved and like I got something off my chest. It feels like I told someone about my problems, but I didn't. It might feel a bit weird in the beginning. I personally hat seeing my thoughts on paper. I cringe every time I read it, no matter what I write about. That's why I never read what I wrote down a second time. But it still helps organizing all my feelings and emotions.  So yeah, start a diary :)  also please stay strong, you are doing great and I'm really proud of whoever reads this. I'm serious btw. Living is hard but so far dou've survived 100% of your bad days. Good job!  (also I wasn't really sure what to flair this sooo sorry if it's the wrong one)

Im happy to find a sub that focusses on this problem. I've been working very hard to stay ahead of depression and anxiety during this pandemic. I'm a true extrovert, Im sensitive, and I live alone. With that, I've felt isolated a lot. I have a host of good friends and a very good self-care program that includes weekly talk therapy, daily mediation and exercise, etc. This has always kept me very centered and solid.      But this year I'm finding that these things are working for me for shorter amounts of time. For example, I'll be working from home all day and start to feel down, so I'll go outdoors for 30 mins of aerobic exercise with a friend, coming home feeling so refreshed and happy. Then the next day it happens all over again. I'm not really asking for advice per say, just wondering if other people have been experiencing the same thing.

I agree that this year has been so tough. I think it's awesome that you have such a secure self-care program to help you out. But I totally feel you on the daily cycle of feeling good & then just slipping back into feeling meh again. I feel confident saying it's pretty normal in this crazy world situation we're in. But you're not alone.
Thanks for piping in! It's taken me many years to learn what I need to do and not do to feel content. I understand that the pandemic is hard for most of us, but when it comes up it's a heavy feeling, deep and dark. Like I want to escape it. I've never felt this way before
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to downplay your feeling with my comment! I can relate to the heavy, deep feeling though. Honestly what's helped is therapy even virtually. I didn't think it would without the face-to-face meetings, but I was pleasantly surprised.
I didn't think you downplayed anything!  Yes, therapy has been very good to me, and also journaling

I’m a minor with the NHS in the UK. (CAMHS.)  You’re probably thinking that there must be a reason, no. I’m this close to ending it all and my therapist will just refuse to let me see the psychiatrist no matter how many times I ask.  If I do attempt it will be successful, so it’s not like I’ll have multiple attempts ie. they may give me meds after one.  What do I say to get them to think more about giving me them? They’re so reluctant. I see people complain 24/7 about how they dish out meds on a platter. But it’s the opposite for me and there is absolutely no reason.   I’ve done my research and I know the side affects. But no therapy will work now.

Well looking at your post history (sorry for snooping, but you didnt give me much to go on in your initial post) , you're kinda all over the place.ADHD, Autism, aspergers, Borderline personality disorder. That has probably not gone past your therapist. If you have any of those diagnoses, antidepressants will not work. Mood stabilisators will maybe help marginally if you actually have BPD, but dialectical behavioral therapy is what's most effective, because if it is BPD, a chemical imbalance in your brain isnt what's the problem, but a maladaptive pattern of behavior where you have very extreme and rapid mood swings and unstable relationships with both people and yourself.  If I were a therapist, I wouldnt give you antidepressants because you would get 0% of the benefits and probably a side effect or four. One of which is usually increased risk of suicidal behavior.  It just wouldnt help you at all. That's my opinion, but I would probably trust your therapist on the matter and rather ask for some help to deal with suicidal thoughts.
Sorry for not being more clear. Yes all expect BPD. It’s a thing in my family and my sister suspects me having it, and the way I find out more about a disorder is asking questions about symptoms myself to people with the disorder to see if they... get what I mean. So it’s a possibility, but I haven’t done anywhere near enough research to say I have BPD.   You said if I had any of those diagnoses? How would ASD/ADHD effect the outcomes of SSRIs?
As far as I know, SSRI's arent the traditional treatment for ASD/ADHD. True that low mood is often comorbid with both of those diagnoses, but that has probably more with the stress of having to deal with those diagnoses rather than a chemical imbalance, in which case, you're putting on a temporary bandaid that will fall off sooner rather than later and you'll go through every type of SSRI under the sun.     **Do note that I am not a trained proffessional, my thoughts on the matter should be taken as hypothetical at best. Trust your therapist, if you have some issues with your therapist, get a second opinion/evaluation from another therapist.**
I can’t get an evaluation from another therapist this is the NHS  Yes, but I’m not looking for treatment due to those. I am autistic, but that has nothing to do with it   I’m severely depressed every single day it’s a struggle to stay alive, YES my autism make that 10X harder. But it’s not my autism making me depressed. It’s a ‘secondary effect’ so to speak.  I’m just like any other suicidal depressed person, except this time I’m autistic

Depression will effect your affect, your expression that is.  It will make you look like your face is drooping since you don't smile. The other things like complexion and eyelids are from not getting enough sleep, which can also be caused by Depression. So you are not imagining it.

I really like the way seroquel feels but I dont exactly want to be on an antipsychotic with all the risks that entails. I'm curious if there is an alternative that stops rumination and racing thoughts the same way seroquel does?

Have you tried Sertraline/Zoloft? It's not an antipsychotic & it's helped me with rumination & racing thoughts.
I'm on Effexor(venlafaxine) right now which had helped with my mood, some anxiety, energy, and focus but hasnt done much for racing thoughts,etc. I guess I could bring it up next time I see my MD.

Often we don’t choose where we end up. What matters is how we deal with it. I hate to break it to you but people aren’t very helpful. The best you can do with help is go professional. Once you get a handle on yourself you can begin to find your way out
Obviously I don't know your situation or what you've actually tried, but in my own experience, the thought "I'm crying out for help but nobody listens" is usually... less than accurate.   Like... How many people have you specifically asked for help? In what way? How many times? Are you sure they understood you? What concretely did you ask them to do for you? Have you tried doing it in writing? Have you tried asking for meta-help ("could you help me find more help, or help me figure out what kind of help I actually need")?  Asking for help is REALLY HARD! Most of us hate doing it and avoid it as much as possible. (I certainly do!!) There can be good reasons for this, but if the truth is that we have mostly been "crying out for help" on the **inside**, or dropping hints, or just hoping really really hard that people around will notice \[symptom of depression and pain\].... then we don't actually get to say that "I tried, but nobody wants to help me".   People aren't mind readers. (Which is probably a good thing.) And depression lies to us - it makes us view the world with even more distortion than non-depressed people do. It can also play tricks with our memory.   Do you know what kind of help you need? If there was someone there with you right now who was 100% willing to help, what would you want them to do?
If someone here promised to give me any help I want I'd ask them to help me pack my belongings and move away from here.  As you hinted, it's hard for me to pinpoint what I want and what help I need.  In my mind, this is all I see: I should be in college studying mathematics, chemistry,  physics,  astronomy.  And in my spare time I should be reading books. I should have a home to live in and a yard in which to attempt amateur astronomy. What I just described is the real me.  But instead of doing those things I'm wallowing arrlound in bed crying all the time like someone who's been chained down to their bed with an onion held to their eyes.  Why I am I doing B when I want to do A. And how to I get from B to A. Those are the questions I can't find answers to.  As I said I don't belong here. I'm like Greta Thunberg giving a speech to the UN.
Definitely sounds like depression. (Which does NOT mean that is your only problem! Most of us have very real problems on top of our depressions... It's just that the depression part is Seriously Unhelpful when it comes to taking steps to improve our lives.)  The "not belonging" feeling, yeah, that's always been me as well. I've sorta-kinda made my peace with it.   edit: typo
If you want to come over on the selfDocumentation discord I'll chat with you about it, ongoing not passerby. I'm stuck too, but climbing. I believe in you =)

Things keep getting worse. I am not suicidal, I have always contemplated suicide but I know that I wouldn’t go through with it. Lately I noticed that I have been thinking about it more often though.  I am saying this because I don’t even know if things are actually getting worse. I can’t even allow myself to feel bad because I don’t really know if I’m supposed to feel bad. I’m trying to justify why I think that things are getting worse by saying that I think about suicide more often.  I don’t really know what I’m feeling. I’m feeling something but I don’t know what it is or whether or not I’m supposed to feel it. But I guess I can say that I’m feeling pretty hopeless. I did Beck’s Depression Inventory and it seems like I have moderate depression. Which is not a new thing for me, I’ve had depression for the last 6-7 years. I’m 23 btw. I used a lot of medications, I also went to therapy for about 7-8 months. I can’t go to therapy anymore because I don’t have the money for it. I can’t ask for money from my parents because they need to support my sister who is going to go to uni. There are no free therapists around either.  I also don’t know if I should go to therapy. Am I being selfish? Am I indulging in my thoughts and feelings too much? Other people have problems too, and I would be lying if I said that I have it worse than most people.  I also failed at school. In 6 years I was only able to finish the first years classes.  I am... lazy. Irresponsible. In the past and maybe even right now, I have acted without thinking about others. My parents worked hard to make sure I can get education. I am ashamed of myself for not doing what I needed to do. I am also ashamed of lying to them about my school. They still don’t know that I failed.  I don’t know if I can say that I tried to fix what’s wrong with me. I attempted to get better and fix myself, and every time I tried I failed. I tried understanding why I failed, and I failed at that too.  I also have gender dysphoria. It isn’t bad most of the time, I don’t know if I should try to do something about it, but it hurts me. I came out to my mum and she acted like I killed her son, so I got back into the closet. So I have no idea what to do.  I have a friend, but she is not really in a great place to help me, and since my friend is not my therapist, she can’t help me in a way a therapist might be able to help me.  I tried just ignoring my dysphoria and I guess it works to some extent but it’s not really insignificant. But it’s also not significant enough for me to make up my mind about fixing it. Also my parents are not mentally very stable so if I came out it could financially hurt my sister. Because my dad is the only provider and his mental state is hanging by a thread.  I tried thinking hard about stuff, and I failed. I tried doing stuff but I failed. Let’s say that I failed to try hard enough maybe.  I can’t help myself. I have no hope from the future, everything is going to get worse. I am also sick, some kind of bone marrow disease. One day it may kill me. Doctors aren’t really sure if I have it but they basically treat me like I have it, so it is likely that I have it.  And I have started to notice that I don’t really want to get better. I don’t know what a normal day feels like anymore. I dread the future.  I also noticed that I have an obsession with pain. I noticed that there is not a day that goes by without me thinking about all the horrible things that are happening in the world, all the terrible things that may (and will) happen to me, how I’m hurting my parents by lying to them, how I should be ashamed of myself, and after I go on about this for some time I start to think about how I am selfish for indulging in my own thoughts and problems so much.  I also have IBS. It used to be not very bad but these days I sometimes come very close to having a nervous breakdown because of how much pain it causes. I sometimes take almost freezing showers to stop the pain, because my body goes into “we’re dying mode” and blocks the pain from my bowels.  I feel ashamed of myself. I’m living a better life than 90 percent of the world. I don’t have to worry about food, getting ill, getting killed or not having a shelter. I live in a clean home. I can take a shower whenever I want. Both my parents are still alive and well. But I don’t feel okay. And whining about not feeling okay makes me feel very privileged. But I’m not okay.  I used to be very into electronics. I used to spend a lot of time into mathematics so that I can understand how electronic circuits work. I actually built my first shortwave radio when I was 12. I was dreaming of becoming an electronics engineer. I always had issues with my gender identity, but it used to be not so bad. It’s strange really. Back in the old days, people had a lot of life threatening problems. There were plagues, long and bloody wars, famine etc. I feel very privileged for feeling bad about my issues. And I’m not the only one with these problems, and majority of the people in the world has much bigger problems, I know that. But they still try to keep going, but I can’t keep going. I can’t help myself, I just can’t. There is no one that can help me either, and I feel cornered. I don’t know what to do. My confidence in my ability to make a plan and execute it is completely crushed. I can’t even stop myself from overeating. I lost the control of myself, I am like a train speeding into another train without a brake.

It sounds to me like you’re carrying way too much at once. And it’s all really heavy. And a lot of it sounds to me like you’re saying you’re ashamed that you’re feeling badly - and that feeling sounds really difficult to carry too. I’m so sorry.   I know you mentioned there are no free therapists in your area - is there any chance of a community clinic nearby? Sometimes they have low cost services of psychiatrists or primary care doctors that could maybe help you out.  In the meantime, I just want you to know that not finishing college, even when you’re quite bright, is not an uncommon thing for people with mental illnesses like depression, anxiety, adhd, and others. It’s not your fault school was so hard for you to finish. I’m sure you made some mistakes along the way & grew from them, like everyone does. But the difficulty you’re facing with getting things done now (and in the past with completing school) sound like a biological predisposition to depression or anxiety or another mental illness, to me. Maybe some unhealthy coping skills you learned growing up thrown in there. My main point being: you’re not incompetent or flawed, you’re dealing with a bunch of invisible cards stacked against you.  They’re invisible, so sometimes you don’t even know if they’re really there. But they are, and they make your life a whole lot harder than other people’s who don’t have them.   Give yourself a break, believe in the cards, get some medical help as soon as you can. Until then, hang on, look up mental health inspirations and tips online if you’re up to it.  Also, at some point, for your own health, to lay down that heavy burden, you’re going to need to tell your parents about not finishing school. That doesn’t have to be now, if you can’t do it or the timing is wrong with your parents and what’s going on in their lives. But that stressor is bound to tank your mood as long as it exists, so you need to get rid of it as soon as you can.  Also, try to stop getting mad at yourself every time you don’t achieve something. It’s making your brain chemistry worse. And it’s not acknowledging the invisible cards stacked against you. Things are really hard for you right now - that’s real.  edit: spelling typo “rank” to “tank”
Thank you, I am grateful for your thoughtful reply. I was having a bad day today, and that’s why I posted this here. Your reply helped my brain to calm a little bit.  I have medical insurance, and seeing a psychiatrist is free here, but I don’t think they can help. Not because I think I am beyond help or anything but because I’ve already been seeing them for the last 4-5 years. I used a lot of meds too. I think I used about 10-11 different antidepressants. I’m currently on mirtazapine. I could always try a new one of course but I think that medications alone will not be enough. I will have to put some effort into getting better too. Don’t know what to do though, or why I have so much trouble getting anything done.  I wish my medical insurance covered therapy.
I wish they did too. I’m sorry. :’/  Perhaps checking out some workbooks or worksheets on therapeutic approaches might help you start working through some things on you own, if you feel up for that. I know CBT is a common one - some libraries even have workbooks to check out (though you can’t write in those). Research shows it tends to be effective.  They have different workbooks for anxiety, depression, etc. DBT is another therapeutic school of thought to check out. I know there are others too, but I’m not an expert on the subject matter, so maybe do an internet search if you want to find more.   Regarding the meds, I’m sorry you’ve been through so many. Have they tried multiple ones at once to manage your symptoms? Like one for anxiety, one for depression, one for mood stabilization sort of thing?  If you feel the med route isn’t working, and you’ve exhausted your options there, maybe look into other treatments. I know someone who did TMS for treatment resistant depression. Then there’s another one, ECT, where they put you under anesthesia and induce a seizure in your brain (but not your muscles) to help with depression or bipolar depression symptoms.  You’re welcome. I hope things get easier for you soon.
I’ve heard about ECT, but I’m not sure my depression is “serious enough” for that. Also there aren’t many places where it’s done, and it turns out we don’t have it in my city. And there is also the coronavirus situation, and also I’m not sure how my parents would react to that kind of thing. They think my depression is cured. There is a lot of stigma around ECT too.  I’ve read “Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy” by David Burns but I guess self administered CBT doesn’t really work for me. My therapist used psychodynamic therapy, I don’t think that one was very successful either.  I can read a different book, like a DBT book as you said, but I am kinda prejudiced against self help books, it was hard to convince myself to read the book I mentioned. But I guess if I’m helpless I can’t really refuse to try something like this.  I tried multiple medications but like I didn’t try two antidepressants together or an antidepressant and an antipsychotic together. I am kinda sensitive to side effects (especially nausea) and my psychiatrists knew this so they didn’t try it on me. I would try it myself, because in my country you can just go to a pharmacy and buy whatever you want (nothing addictive of course) but it feels kinda risky.  But that book thing may be worth checking out.
Sounds like you’ve got a good sense of direction for yourself.   I totally get that self-directed work may not be a thing that works for you; I struggle with that too.  Regarding the ECT, it may not be a help now with coronavirus going on, but if you’re struggling to get things done regularly, I’d say you sound severe enough to me. Though if you have to get money from parents, I understand that being an obstacle. And if the treatment would have to be far away, that’s another obstacle.  The ideal would be you getting treatment, without having to disclose to others (except maybe a trusted friend or family member or community member who sits there during the procedure and drives you home) that you’re getting treatment. I’m sorry you’re dealing with so many obstacles.  Another thing you might consider is a depression support group in your community — many are having their meetings online with covid — and they’re sometimes run with the help of a therapist. The prices with a therapist involved can be much lower than a usual session cost. You could also google support groups from anywhere, really, and ask them if they’d be willing to have you on while things are virtual with covid.  Just an idea, take what you will from it. :)
Heh, nitrate hoarder.  I may not be up your alley because I'm basically self critiquing and therapizing, but if nothing else I'd love to learn more about the obstacles in CBT so I can navigate them myself.  And of course if you want to talk, I have a discord or reddit pm.  I'm proud of you for climbing mate. Even trying things that [don't work](https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/OnFailingG.html#:~:text=Edison%20replied) is progress.
I guess in a way online support groups can work better, because it is unlikely that there is an LGBT-friendly support group in my city.  If I see a psychiatrist again I’ll ask them about ECT. If I can do it without my parents knowing then I might consider it.  My dad gives me a small amount of allowance, maybe I can see an online therapist once a month or something. I can change my meds, and maybe with the help of therapist I can give the books another try.
Nitrates are hard to find in my country due to some bad things that happened, but they are extremely useful in chemistry and rocketry, and I have a small interest in these as well.  Anyways, I am not going to say that CBT was useless, because I didn’t received it from a therapist, it was self administered, so I don’t even know if I did it correctly or whether or not it would have worked if I receiver it from a therapist. My therapist used psychodynamic therapy, because of my gender related issues, I think.  Since I’m not a therapist and I didn’t receive CBT from a therapist, I don’t know how much insight I can give, but I will try.  I am not exactly sure why it didn’t work. I occasionally do a small amount of reading on psychology, and it seems to me that the patients willingness to help themselves and put effort into getting better is very important. I started reading the book, doing the exercises in it etc. I have a lot of bad thoughts, and the book starts by teaching you how to challenge your bad thoughts and how to avoid distorting your perspective. And I tried to do that, but I have a very low willpower, and I needed more than what I had. In a way you can say that I have very little motivation to help myself. And challenging bad perceptions/thoughts corroded my willpower until it was basically all gone. It actually increased my stress levels. And some of my bad perceptions/cognitions can’t be challenged, because they are accurate, which also makes things worse. So that was my experience with the book. I wasn’t able to finish it, so I wouldn’t take the stuff I said very seriously.
Movement in any one of those directions would be great! Even just brainstorming about these sort of things is positive movement. :)  Keep thinking about little things you can do to make yourself feel better, daily. Trying to feel better and healthier will help you get through tough times easier and faster. So: comfy clothes or blankets, nice scents, a walk or sitting outside for a few minutes, making something to decorate your room, reminders to yourself that you’re not bad (you’re good).
Oof, I identify with a lot of that my friend. Mental will power is the unobtanium of this decade, feels like.

You could try keeping a log of your sleep, nutrition, exercise and maybe feelings (how you felt about the day in general / 3 good + 3 not so good things) and see if you can spot any patterns.  Have you looked into your sleep quality, or tried to improve it? I tried one of those apps that record how much you move during your sleep (and if you snore), and the variations in how much deep vs light vs REM sleep I got were pretty interesting. (I should definitely go back to doing that....)  There are also phone apps that will try to wake you up at a good time in your sleep cycle. If you have any leeway in when you need to be awake, that could be something to experiment with. (You can always set a regular alarm as well as a failsafe.)  In my own case, I have found some factors that clearly *contribute* to how I will wake up feeling, but unfortunately most of them seem to be of the "5% greater chance of brain fog" or "10% chance of improved mood some time in the next 3 days" variety. Which is still useful to know, but it does mean that even if I try hard to stack all of them "correctly" - really it comes down to the old boring healthy habits, avoiding self-sabotage, taking my meds and vitamins, keeping up with some form of self-therapy, but a few are more specific - I don't have any *guarantees* that I still won't feel like shit the next day. Which is demoralizing.  So I also tend to think of my depression and fatigue levels as "brain weather". This implies, to me:   * I can't (fully, at least) control it * Can't always predict it correctly, but 'forecasts' a day or two out are easier than further away * Bad weather means that I will need to adapt my plans, but unless it's a full-on blizzard, I can probably still do *something* * It's very likely to change at least somewhat over the course of the day (often, though not always, I'll feel worse in the morning and slightly better by evening, or maybe after an afternoon nap)  I sort of alternate between those two approaches. When I feel up to it, I try to chip away at figuring out what helps/makes things worse, and practice better habits; when I'm already feeling low/hopeless I take the "weather" perspective in order to try not to blame myself (not helpful) and instead take my current condition as a fact (for right now / for today) and go from there: "*Given that* I feel like absolute crap right now, what would be a good idea to try doing?"  I've also sometimes used lists and reminders to help me remember what to do and in some cases "how to think" on shitty days, because that's exactly when I tend to forget everything I've ever learned about my depression. This ranges from "It's okay to cancel things, as long as you tell people!" (At my worst I've been prone to just not showing up with no explanations)  to "Very slow, clumsy and 'inefficient' work still counts. Try: Dealing with ONE email. Cleaning ONE dish. Doing ONE SMALL THING for your pets. Log it so you have proof that you have done stuff."  Conversely, when I do have a good day, it's sometimes very difficult to choose how to spend it. Part of me feels I should tackle all the most difficult to-dos at once, which is... not a great idea. So I write myself reminders to still keep my goals manageable and try to schedule guilt-free fun time. But there are definitely some tasks which are best done at times or on days when my brain weather is more clement.

I've been almost half a year clean and it's been more than a year since the last of my many attempts. I've been trying so hard to get better and feel better. I just want to do things again and work on myself and work. But I can't seem to do anything productive. I spend most of my day lying in bed and on good days, I draw. But other than that I feel and am nothing. I feel stuck in an invisible cage I can never quite get out of. As soon as I feel that things are getting better, I go back to being nothing and feeling nothing,  I'm not really sure what I need from here. Maybe some advice or just to vent. But if there's anything that can or has helped you, I would appreciate it if you guys shared it. Thank you.Note: I have MDD and Bipolar 2. I used to take Quetiapine and go to therapy but have stopped because of covid.

The only advice i can give you is to get back on meds and go back to therapy. Call around, lots of offices are doing zoom call things to help people. Im currently seeing the poor ppl doctor and a therapist remotely
I dont know if you might want to try this or can, but maybe try playing online games? Some can really kind of make you lose yourself in that game and can pass time quickly. Another thing is maybe something in your life is really affecting you in a way, and I would just vent to a friend. I hope you get better!
I’m so sorry you’re going through this. If you have insurance (or country-provided healthcare), I’d recommend finding a psychiatrist. A lot of doctors are doing video visits now due to covid, at least in the United States. Do the same for the therapist - and choose to look up/make an appt first for whichever of the two you think could help most right now.  It sounds like your depression / bipolar hasn’t been managed well enough by the med you’ve been on, if you keep having these episodes. Buckle in for the long haul on finding the right combo of meds (though you may be lucky & find it quickly!) & try to find a therapist you can really *trust* for help if that’s possible for you. Really feeling like you can trust your therapist makes a huge difference in the effectiveness of therapy, according to research.   As for right now, if you’re at a place where the goals of finding a psychiatrist and therapist are too overwhelming, do something smaller today. Drink 32 oz of water or put a few pieces of trash in a bag or change clothes or text a friend or family member or smile for 5 mins

Just wondering if anyone has had more relief from their depression/anxiety symptoms taking xr rather than ir? I am now on 50mg xr along with 100mg lamotrigine and I feel when I wake up I am very much distanced between myself and my chronic emotions/suicidal thoughts - just wondering if this will last long term? (Has only lasted for a few hours in the morning so far then the feelings come back).

My adopted parents, bless them, just let me know they can pay for a pretty expensive inpatient program for CPTSD and addiction. I’m so humbled and grateful but I’m also freaking terrified 😭😭 I don’t know if I can do this. My husband also struggles with mental health and has been deeply struggling. I don’t want to leave him but secretly I think we might be dragging each other down.

It’s going to be really good. 24/7 therapy. Change of scenery. New environment to recover in. No stress and nothing to worry about. Separation from your hubby. I think it will be a great break and it will help you recover x
It’s normal to be scared, but inpatient helped me a lot. Not only do you get a space place to figure out the medications/therapies that work for you, but it’s also nice to meet other people with the same issues as you. I’m still friends with my roommate from my last hospital stay. It may also be good to give you some space to consider the situation with your husband, if that’s what you need.
I've been in one for depression and they really aren't that bad and I like to look at it like going in an old you and coming out the same just with weight lifed
Please do it. It changed my life. What could it hurt to try? It is scary at first but you soon begin to feel stronger and more connected. I wouldn't give up my inpatient experience for the world.
You can’t help him if you’re drowning. Not having to worry about you may well give him the spoons he needs to take care of himself. Please take advantage of this opportunity
Hi sweetie, I just read your post and I’ve got a few little “live and learn” things that I highly recommend for you.   1. You mentioned that your husband was struggling as well, and I am so sorry to hear that. Depression is so hard and it can feel very isolating. I  don’t know how long you will be in treatment, but after you get discharged, you are going to feel as if you have changed because in fact, you have changed. You’ve learned amazing tools that you have to practice for the rest of your life in order to stay heathy. It’s kind of a harsh reality jolt after you get home and realize that nobody else has changed! They may have gotten worse. You are very vulnerable at this time and you must concentrate on YOUR recovery, and not your husband’s or anyone else. If you don’t, you have practically wasted your time and your parent’s money. Hopefully your husband will do the right thing and get help for himself for his benefit and for yours as well. If he chooses not to, that’s up to him. You know that old saying,” You can’t clap with one hand.” Maybe you will be a positive example for your husband and this will encourage the dysfunctional cycle to begin to heal. Just remember that you can only change yourself, and your husband is responsible for his own disease. Sure, you can be a healthy supportive wife, but you can only mend yourself and take control over your own mental health. 2. When I went to treatment, DBT, which stands for Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, changed my life! It’s a method of teaching you how to ride the waves of your emotions instead of allowing them to drown you. Please, if you do anything for yourself for the rest of your life, pick a center that has DBT as part of your wellness plan. You will not be disappointed for taking my humble advice.  3. If you happen to be struggling with addiction as well as mental health, please consider a Dual Diagnosis treatment center. 4. Don’t worry about leaving your husband. Whether we like it or not, the world still spins without us! 😜 5. Remember that you are about to embark on your own journey. Embrace it and learn everything that you can! I went to Michael’s House in Palm Springs, California and I would never take back that gift! I guess that’s all I can think of right now, but please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you need to! God bless you and you got this! Much love to you and your family! Julie  Portland, OR
Could your husband go with you?
Also many people who go through the same or a similar situation. That helped me see I‘m so not alone.
Thank you so much. I think I agree
Aw that’s so nice about your roommate. Thank you. Yes we probably need a little space
That’s a really beautiful way of looking at it, thank you
You’re so right. I’m gonna do it. Scared shitless but this half life really isn’t worth it... I want the real thing! I’m so glad you had a good experience
Thank you. I’m planning on it! Hopefully will be going on Monday.
Thank u so much for your kind words, encouragement, and insight. I really appreciate your reply! <3
No unfortunately not
No problem, hope it all goes well for you! ❤️

If I've learnt anything in my 37 years it's that things always change.  I've been through bad times that have ended when I thought they wouldn't and I've been through good times that have ended as well.  Just remember, this is your life.  You have a say how it goes. Don't compare yourself to others and don't let their expectations rule your life.  Take a deep breath and go at your own pace because only you can live your life.  Years from now you could be sitting with the love of your life, with accomplishments you would never of had if you just gave up.  So much changes with time, you just have to go with the flow and accept the experiences for what they are, fleeting moments.   If I'm having a great moment in life, I always remind myself that it will end.  Maybe tomorrow, maybe in 10 years. So I enjoy that time as much as I can. The same as when I go through tough times.  I know they'll end. Maybe tomorrow, maybe in 10 years. I just have to persevere until they do so I can soak up the good times once again.  Sorry for the novel.  Just know that there's at least one person out here who is thinking of you right now.  I believe in you
thanks man, if I decide not to end this I will definitely return here and read your message again and again, thanks once again, the past 4 days were good for me, but today I just exploded with tears, I want to do something with my life, but I don’t know what I wanna do. I can’t find any goal.
This is going to sound cliche, but sometimes things come along when you least expect it. Surely you like some things? Focus on those. Don't worry about what others think of them. Do what makes YOU happy and screw everyone else. (As long as you're not hurting others. Don't do that lol) If you have food in your belly and shelter you are already doing better than a lot of people out there. Find others with similar likes. Find a community. You never know what opportunities can arise by putting yourself out there.  Good luck.  Keep moving forward even if it's only at a crawl. You'll get there.
I have problems with finding new friends irl, only in internet. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, I try my best but I think I just don’t fit in? Also I want to find something that makes me happy but it’s hard, this state started like 3 years ago, I started falling apart, I think I need to leave my country and try something else, this was my plan always but I’m not sure about it. But still, thanks for the advices. They mean a lot to me.
I suck at making friends too lol.  In fact, I have fuck all friends.   I joined a few Facebook communities and i just make random posts and talk to random people.  I've been to a few events that they host and I've had a few good laughs with people but I'm still trying to find my tribe.  Years ago I left my home town and went to another state, with $50 in my pocket.  I got work on a mango picking farm and then on a prawn trawler.  Had the best experiences there. For some reason I came back to my home town though. Should have stayed away but I ended up having a kid here and I wouldn't change that for the world. The best thing about leaving and starting fresh is that you can shed your skin and start over without people having preconceived perceptions of you. If you want to travel, do that.  Get some seasonal work around the place and travel around. You'll meet many amazing people.  Backpackers are very friendly and accepting. It may just be the change you need
Yeah, I think you’re right, probably I need a change, but I also need some money for moving out of my country, if I can come up with a good plan of future I think I will finally be happy, who knows, like you said everything changes, I have a long time till my 18th birthday, I’m just tired of my life, I want to be successful so bad, I want to say one day that I made it and I didn’t let down my family.
It wouldn't matter to me if my son wasn't successful.  As long as he was happy and doing what he enjoyed he could never let me down. Being successful means making a lot of sacrifices and just because commercialized society says that it's the only way to be happy, it doesn't mean it is. Being a good person and having a good heart is way more important than anything.  Helping others gives me more joy than any amount of money could.  Don't live to work. Work to live
I wish you all the best, random stranger. You never know what tomorrow will bring
Yes I know, but I feel like I’m trapped in here, I want to have freedom, my family had a lot of financial problems, my dad is useless, I live with my mom, they are divorced, I’m tired of this, I want to do this for her.
Thanks for your time, I think I needed it. To talk to stranger who doesn’t know me. Thanks again.
That's very noble of you. Just don't let it bring you down so much.  You are not your parents and you are not responsible for their failings. I would hate myself if my son felt he was indebted to me and felt burdened by it. I suppose culture has a lot to do with how children see their parents as their responsibility, so I can't really comment I guess. All I can say from my experience is that I would rather end my own life than burden my child with my wellbeing. If I would say one thing to him, it would be, go free little bird. Live your life.  I wouldn't allow my child to sacrifice anything for me. I have a duty to him. He owes me nothing.  But hey, that's how I see it. Doesn't mean it's the way it should be for everyone.  If you can just do me one favour. Please stop these thoughts of ending it all.  You obviously love your mum very much.  The pain of losing a child to suicide would be unimaginable.  Of you are going to do anything for her, then live.
Anytime. It's helped me before in he past as well. I'm glad I could pass it along Take care dude
I think you’re right, I will try not to have suicidal thoughts, I dream big, but it’s hard to get out of this. I just hope one day I will find happiness, I wish I knew when will this day come. If it ever comes. I wanted to make music and inspire other people, help them, or I wanted to be an actor. But I don’t know how to start, I have no experience, I don’t know if this will work, but I guess I have nothing to lose.
Well if you ever make it big as a successful actor or musician, can you track me down and buy me a car? That would be great 😂  But really, when you succeed in life, do me a favour.  Pass this along.  Help someone else see there is more to life than what they can currently believe. You might not realise it, but talking to you this morning has done more for me than you know.  At the end of the day, we are all here trying to do the same thing, live. Be kind, be generous and don't judge others.  It takes more courage to help someone up than it does to put them down.  Good luck dude
Definitely I will haha, I will try my best to succeed. You see, here where I live it’s 11PM, i will go to sleep soon. You helped me a lot, thanks. I will remember your messages.

I'm feeling sick, im tired of everything. I feel Like i am to dump to Do simple Tasks. I hurt myself very Bad.I've often thought about ending things, but I haven't tried anything. I really cant describe how i feel. Not even in my native language. I've already talked to a friend about everything.  She says that I clearly need help and that I probably have depression. I really want help and so I have to talk to my parents about it, but I just don't know how.  I never talked to my parents about something like that and also hid my problems and breakdowns well.  In my family, this is never mentioned simply because nobody has such problems.  If someone has already been through something like that, can they give me a few Tips.

I think if you start with "I need help" your parents will listen. Sometimes parents can be blinded to their children's struggles, especially if you have hidden things. I hid things from my parents too, everyone thought I was happy even though I was not. Try to talk to them. If they won't listen or do not get you help then you can ask a school councilor or teacher.   Keep fighting! I'm proud of you for asking for help.
You may have thought of this already, but consider writing down a few things beforehand and bring your notes with you when you talk to them. Either as just a reminder to yourself, or you could let them read it directly if you feel comfortable doing that.  This could include something "meta" (things about the conversation itself) like "I've been scared to talk to you about this because...... My worst fear is that you will react by..... But what I'm hoping will happen is that you will....."  Often people have a really hard time knowing how to respond. Even people close to you. And if they don't have much experience with depression, they can say really hurtful things even though they mean well. (Part of that is also that when we're depressed, we tend to interpret everything in the worst possible way!)  There are resources online on "what to do/not do when your loved one has depression" that could help you put words to how you'd like them to respond, how they can help you (if you feel you have some ideas, or if not, then saying you don't know what you need is fine too) and to let them know that, just as an example, "Well, maybe you'd feel better if you \[did more of a thing you usually enjoy but have no energy for now, because depression\]" is not actually helpful advice, at least not by itself.  The point is not to dictate what they should do or how they should respond, no one has the right to do that and your parents will have their own emotional reactions which they're totally allowed to have. But sometimes it can help to be explicit about what effects some reactions or words will have on you, and it can be really hard to say that out loud in the moment.  Edit: Maybe your friend who you already told could help you write some things down, if it's hard for you to find the right words?
Thank you. I really needed to hear that. I'll talk to my parents in the next few days.
I want to say a big thank you. I had written down a few points (with my friend) and went to see my parents.  I also said that I'm afraid that they  won't react well.  But they reacted very well and said that they want to seek help for me as soon as possible. Your comment really helped me a lot.  Thank you very much.
You're welcome, hang in there!
Oh, I'm so glad it went well! And that my comment was helpful.   Best of luck going forward! You've taken a big step in asking for help. Good job.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kyhwwl/how_do_i_deal_with_this_emptiness/
Treatment-resistant depression has been tough. With medication, I’m slowly managing symptoms bit by bit. The lethargy, the headaches, the crying spells, anxiety, inner restlessness, bouts of intense agitation and sensory overstimulation, negative thoughts and life-ending thoughts, I can deal with. They have been worse, so now that they’re finally a little more manageable with being maxed out on 375mgs of Effexor, I’ve gotten somewhat used to feeling generally under the weather and they don’t jar me as much.   But the profound emptiness that feels so bad that it feels so physically unbearable (i always end up in tears because of how bad it feels), I can’t fix. I’ve only managed to push it off with being distracted with work and/or obligations, but the moment that I get a chance to breathe and give into the lack of energy that I lug around (after work / on the weekends / etc.), the emptiness eats me up whole. It’s terrible. I feel terrible feeling it. Even trying to get into hobbies and just trying to read or watch Netflix doesn’t help. I just end up crying about it in therapy and it doesn’t get any better because there’s simply no trigger to this emptiness. It’s just... there.   How do I stop feeling this painstaking emptiness?

I’m sorry for these feelings. I would say finding your purpose is missing from your life. Our minds and bodies need that else they tend to rebel . I really enjoy Tony Robbins, if you check on YouTube for six basic human needs it really puts into perspective all the areas you should focus on
I struggled with feeling empty and numb for many years. I have post- traumatic stress disorder. Individual therapy has helped. Effexor has helped. Group therapy for survivors of abuse has helped. DBT helped. But things really started to change for me when I started practicing self-compassion. I read 2 books that helped me: Self-Compassion by Dr. Kristin Neff and Running on Empty by Dr. Jonice Webb. I started a daily yoga practice and it has been life-changing for me.
It is possible we experience the same feeling however I would explain it for me as a sinking feeling that is feels unbearable.  I realised all my fear and energy was spent in avoiding this feeling, I would even go as far to name it a phobia, a phobia of this feeling. I would get the feeling then feel a sense of dread which resulted in despair.   This is what I did, I decided not to run and hide anymore. I sat with the feeling and I wasnt budging, I let myself feel that feeling and faced it head on. I was scared and thought something terrible was going to happen, like I would be sucked in by the void I spent so much every avoiding.   5 minutes went by, I was still here, I felt extremely awful but I was still here, I waited longer, I felt this feeling yet it became just a bad feeling that I could endure not matter what it threw at me. Then it hit me, nothing has happened! This subconscious fear of the void of depression and nothing happened, I am still here.   Now I do not fear this feeling as it is much more bearable, it is not comfortable but I know all it is, is a feeling and I can sit with it, I dont need to run anymore and I found it has a short half life once I no longer fear it.   I am not a profession so best to run it by a therapist etc. But by facing it, I kind took away its power. This is recent for me and I am still working on this  but it has been a game changer so far  Hope this helps in some way

So this is something that I have went through. It starts with me living with my bestfriend Arthur. I moved in with him and his family as I didn't get along with my mother too much. It was great I enjoyed being around him we had good times together. I was a very self destructive type of person which is why I always tried to hang out with people to not think that way. Regardless, I still was very down because I thought nothing was worth it. I kept thinking like that over and over. I had Arthur with me but even though I just never liked to open up to anyone (past experience ruined it for me) so I didnt keep him updated. Arthur knew I had feeling bottled up whenever it seemed major he would always try to cheer me up. It would be anything just chilling together talking, playing games or sitting outside with me when I smoke a cig. He was a one of the best friends I could ask for but of course my thoughts were always negative. I would tell myself even if I killed myself people would forget about me in a couple of years and continue living their lives without a worry. That is how my mind worked most the time but I tried to keep myself busy so I wouldn't think that way, which is why I enjoyed working. My job at that time was not the best but it kept me busy because I was a dishwasher in a very well known restaurant so I was always busy moving that I did not have time to have those types of thoughts it was nice. I also enjoyed my coworkers they were great people to work with. It was like this for awhile during the time I got into building PC's so I would save money on the side to build my pc. When I built my first pc I was pretty happy for awhile but of course my head started getting filled with thoughts like before. I started smoking weed more often around the same time I built my pc so I thought if I smoke more I would feel better but of course I did not. I started smoking cigarettes' and weed almost everyday it got very bad. I never felt like I needed to smoke I was able to go a week or 2 easily without smoking but I kept smoking especially because I would smoke with friends whenever they come over. I ended up wanted to upgrade my PC so I saved up and did giving Arthur my "old" parts. My parts were not old by any means I just wanted to upgrade so I fixed him up with a PC made from my parts. I didn't want to sell them and thought its one way I could thank him for taking me in and being there for me. Well it continued like that for about 2 years until something happened. Arthur's mother who was the head of the house of course started dating this guy which we did not mind of course, she has had her fair share of boyfriends. The boyfriend came in and at first it was fine then we started seeing shift in his mothers attitude, She use to be such a nice woman but then she started becoming more aggressive it made us really not like him because every guy she has dating never made her change. A lot of things happened but they ended up raising my rent to $800 for my room because I did not want to work for free at their new Cafe they opened up (as it would take me away from my actual job). They had told me to work their but still pay rent so I started trying to find a place to live. I started talking to my sister and all in all I ended up moving back in with my family. It was fine while I had my job and a place to live. It was nice talking to my siblings again but of course I still had that same mentality. This time though I got into drinking and it was fun drinking around my friend. What wasn't good was when I drank alone as my negative thoughts would get to me very badly and I would stab myself, cut myself, or just straight up hit my head against a wall. I had a friend who lived down the streets we ended up spending close to everyday together smoking and drinking. She would try to make sure I didn't drink alone because she knew what I would do to myself. It was ok until my Job ended up letting me go (not fired) because of legal reasons and thats when I started going down hill very quickly drinking a lot, smoking every day. I would just hate everything as finding a job was very difficult for me to do (legal reasons). My mother who had changed quite a bit since I was gone offered to let me stay rent free till I could find something which was great since I couldn't afford it. She also paid for my car insurance which made me hate myself because I hate when people pay for me. I was not able to find a Job for about 3 months which in my head I started feeling like a burden to my mother. I HATED MYSELF SO MUCH FOR BEING A BURDEN. So I kept drinking being supplied by my friend who lived down the street. Come the day March 14th 2020 I was drinking with my friend but I had the feeling to end my life and the way I wanted was to hang myself. While being drunk I made my friend leave my room in a way I wish I didn't and from there I pulled out my rope I had ready to hang myself and so I said my goodbyes to friends in a groupchat and proceeded to get on the ladder put my the rope around my neck. I was crying the whole time because I knew even though I would miss everyone. As I kicked the ladder my friend from the group chat came running to the back of my parent house and started yelling help while trying to hold me up and awoke my family which they all came out screaming for me. My friend was in tears as he was trying to hold me up my father got the ladder and cut the rope. He had to go throw up after seeing that and all I could say was sorry for being a burden to everyone. I saw everyone's face as they were shocked but the one that hit me was my friends face as I have known him for years but never once seen his face like that. My family was there crying and I got sent to the hospital since my older sister called the cops thinking someone broke in. In the Hospital my parents came to visit me I didn't know what to say but I apologized to both of them for doing such a thing. My uncle was the next to visit me and he started crying because well I was pretty close to him. Arthur then came to visit and I could see his face as he wanted to cry but tried to keep a straight face. Next was the friend who saved me, His name is Cruz. He came with another close friend of mine but he came on the last day of my holding as he was not ready to see me but he was really happy to see me either way. During the time in holding I thought a lot of what happened and I have to say I deeply regretted doing it. I realized how many people care for me and how many friend/family I had there to talk to. Once I was released I went home and started looking for a Job but no luck still but now I had massive hospital bills to pay but with no job. My parents payed them for me but of course I hated it. This went on until July where I finally got a Job and I started paying my own bills. I started feeling much better especially because I was able to pay rent, Hospital bills, and Car insurance while still saving up and upgrading my PC again. I stopped smoking and drinking all together so I started feeling much better about myself and was looking at positive side to things. I can say this proudly that I been loving life and all my friends. I now help every single friend that needs PC help for free because I enjoy doing it and I have built 10 PC's for friends as long as they buy their own parts. I helped a friend get a pc by getting others parts from them upgrading and building one like that. I did have to buy a couple of parts but to me helping my friends is worth the cost. I been helping people build PC's since for free since. I bought things for my parents for being there and helping me throughout the time I lived with them. I am very happy right now. I needed a eye opener and that was mine. Sorry for the super long story it is actually the first time I am sharing a story this personal online. It feels good. Thank you for anyone reading this. If you have any questions about it just comment or DM me either is fine.

NSFW; SuicideWatch; TherapeuticWriting  The only way I know how to compare this is to chocolate. I am an morbidity obese person, but in America I guess everyone is. This feeling inside me no one seems to understand so I will try an describe it to you. I feel like I am at the store. I see a chocolate bar from far away but I’m on a diet so I ignore it. I continue walking through the store and I keep thinking about this chocolate bar. The sweet feeling of sugar on my tongue, the relief from the world while eating the dessert. Slowly, this chocolate is the only thing that matters. The flavors. I obsess over how to get it. I will do anything. Slowly I give into my temptation. I grab mnms, Hershey, kitkats, Reese’s... By the time I am done I have three of every candy bar the store has. I go to my car and unwrap each one, savoring the flavors and letting the bliss wash over me. The pure relaxation of “this is heaven”. My next though becomes How can I obtain more and what different creations can I make with it. How can I get more relief. I start making plans. I stay up for hours planning out every detail. What the best time would be. When my family would be gone so I have proper access without getting caught. My main goal is figuring out who can stop me and how to avoid them. I don’t want to let my family down by them knowing the truth so I hide it and keep eating more. I know what I am doing is wrong but I can’t stop. Why is chocolate the only thing I can think about. After I get more chocolate I slowly start to feel guilty. I knew it was wrong, I’m on a diet. I knew I should’ve kept shopping in the first place. I should’ve never gave into my temptations. Now I have to throw away the trash and hide all evidence so I don’t get caught. I’m sneaking, lying, and hiding to keep my addiction a secret. I have overwhelming guilt, along with other emotions. Not being able to handle emotions well, I turn to more food. Fries, milkshakes.. etc. anything to fill the void inside. I realize it’s slowly harming me more and more but I don’t know what else to do. I love the feeling.   The way I view this chocolate bar is the same way I view suicide. I want it. I can almost taste it. I know it’s wrong. I know the temptation is there but the amount of relief that comes with the idea of dying is unspeakable, and the bliss that comes with is sounds glorious. Different foods to cope would be the same thing as different ideas for harming myself. Cutting, burning, beating.. anything to take the edge off. To try and control my feelings of wanting to die. The same want as a candy bar in a store. The same sadness comes when I am told “no” for either. The idea of dying sounds peaceful. The addiction is harming me, I know but i feel like without harming myself it’s killing me. I feel more pain without a blade to my wrist than i do with one. I feel more safe and secure with a knife in my gut then with my family around. I desire death but I can’t tell anyone because then I am “crazy”. I desperately want to fill this desire but for now I am holding off the temptations. The idea of dying sounds does almost sound magical however, some might even say like a kid in a candy store looking at a chocolate bar.

i feel insanely insecure about everything i do, every word I speak. i feel like a failure and I liar. when my girlfriend and family say they like my art or writing, when they say theyre proud of me i feel angry. like, punch a wall, hurt myself, angry. i feel so violent and sometimes i think of hurting other people too.  im scared the whole world is a simulation made to embarass and mock me and one day everyones going to tell me that all along all of this was wrong and that im a terrible person. i feel like i dont deserve the kindness and friends supply. i want to run away, or cut ties with every one i know, because im so scared im just going to dissapoint them in the end.  does anyone know and fixes/ways to help? can be short or long term...movies or books or music that would lift me out of this momentarily, a mantra to say to myself when im feeling low or even just some kind words. just, aything.

I’ve been through something kind of similar. I think looking up some resources on “how to trust others” might be helpful for you. Do it and see what you think.  Also, if you’re not a natural on picking up caretaking sort of skills, like supportive things to do or say to your friends or family members to make them feel cared for, or you didn’t have many of those skills demonstrated in your house growing up, then you may have trouble 1. believing people when they say nice things to you and 2. knowing how to receive that care.   Also, you may feel inadequate sometimes when you don’t know what to do when someone does or says something kind for you, or you may feel scared to accept their love.   Letting your guard down might feel difficult, and it’s okay for you to take it slow.   Pardon my guesses here if they don’t fit you - it’s very possible I’m projecting my own past similar struggles onto your situation. I hope some of it helps though - at the very least - know that you’re not alone with having these sorts of feelings, and it was very good of you to reach out for help with them!

I have friends and fam who reach out to me, but for some reason I usually don’t have the emotional energy to reply to them to start a conversation or catch up. Ill have little bits of energy now and then, but for the last few months I’ve had none. I’m worried I’m going to end up alone because I’m so bad at managing my friendships. I feel as though maintaining my mental health takes up most of my time; I feel overwhelmed by life often and sadly I see communication between me and my friends and loved ones as something I have to do rather than something I enjoy. I wish I could, but there’s something keeping me from it and I’m also worried they won’t understand. Why am I like this? Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome this and redevelop these relationships I miss?   Also, I deleted my Facebook and Insta a few months ago and while that’s helped my mental health in a lot of ways, it’s hard for me to feel connected with my friends.

I feel and am going through the same things. I also quit all social media and downloaded reddit for the first time four or five months ago now it has helped my mental health as well. Although anytime I see myself trying to connect with family or my boyfriends friends my self worth goes way down and all I’m constantly aware about is not being a Debby downer. Life is tiring, maybe we are experience the after effects of social isolation and social distancing for the last year idk. If anyone has any advice I’d like to know too 😅
I’m sorry you’re going through it too; your situation sounds very similar to mine. I agree it’s extra worse due to the pandemic. Here’s to hoping our loved ones will take us back once we’re in a better spot
Keep holding on let’s hope and keep space that things can get better 🌈🌈
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kydo4a/am_i_depressed_my_husband_doesnt_acknowledge_my/
I’m a female who is a newlywed. I’ve been married for a year now and have been with my husband for 9 years now. For the past few months I’ve been feeling very down. I’ve been struggling to get out of bed, many days I just feel like crying and sad for no reason, small tasks seem difficult to do and larger tasks make me feel overwhelmed and I break down in panic and tears. I am not pregnant.    My husband has been helping me with tasks that overwhelm me. He gives me hugs when I need them and tries to cheer me up. But many many times he tells me to “just do it” and to move faster than I can think, and to stop having excuses on why I can’t/ don’t want to do something.   He’s always asking me what my plan is and what my goals are for the day. I feel so pressured and overwhelmed all the time.   Every time he helps me, I make sure to tell him how much I appreciate his help. But many times he tells me that I should appreciate that he’s helping me be better, be successful, and do my tasks; but he wishes that he had someone to motivate him and push him to be a better and more successful person because he has no one to do what he does for me, for him.   It made me feel like trash. I feel worthless when he says that to me. When he asked me what was wrong, I told him how he made me feel by saying that to me. I told him that I wish I could be that person for him but I don’t know how to help him when he knows I’ve been struggling to help myself. He said that it wasn’t fair that I said it makes me feel worthless because he always tries to empower me, and that now it makes him want to share less with me. It broke my heart. He also told me that he hates that I bring it up from the past like “tally marking” it , but I told him that I brought it up with other instances from the past because he constantly says that to me and it constantly makes me feel worthless.   I don’t know what I’m feeling. I don’t know if it’s depression or anxiety or what, but am I wrong for feeling the way I do when he says that to me? Am I wrong for bringing up the instances he’s said it before? What do I do? Do I keep these feelings to myself so that he doesn’t feel like he can’t talk to me? Or how can I make him understand how I feel.

It sounds like he's trying to help you in ways that would be helpful TO HIM. However, newsflash: You are two different people. You can have different needs. He's an expert on his own wishes and needs, but you're the expert on yours.  The golden rule version that goes "treat others the way you want to be treated" is not actually great advice.  A better version is what some people call "the platinum rule": **Treat other people the way THEY want to be treated.**  (As much as possible, and without violating your own boundaries, of course.)  You can't (shouldn't) dictate what he's supposed to do. But you are 100% allowed to say, "It helps me a lot when you do A or B, but C and D just make me feel \[insert your emotions here\]. I know you mean well, but I can't control how I feel about it, at least not right now while I'm dealing with this depression. Do you think you could try doing/saying \[offer an alternative\] instead?"   And then if he agrees he will try that, ask if it would be okay to remind him when he slips up, or what would be the best way to do that without making him feel bad for 'failing'. And try your best to notice when he does say/do things more like you asked for, and tell him how much you appreciate that!  If he tries to tell you that you shouldn't be feeling that way or you are wrong to feel that way... then that is NOT OKAY. No one should ever tell other people what they feel (or should feel). Feelings aren't things we can control!   (Of course that applies to how HE feels and reacts, too. He might feel really hurt and frustrated when you tell him that his words or actions trigger feelings of worthlessness in you, which is totally understandable. But just like you don't mean to hurt him by telling him that - but he still has those feelings! - you still experience the feelings you do even if his intentions were completely different.)  What we can do is ASK others to do/say or not do/say specific things. And then if what we ask for turns out to be really hard for them, or they have a hard time understanding what you really wanted, then work on that as a joint problem: figure out how to communicate better, find a compromise, etc.   I don't have much experience with relationships, but I've always really liked the idea that in a LTR/marriage, the two of you are a team, and any problems either of you have are always the team's problems. So it's "us" vs "problem X", not "my problems" vs "your problems".   For what it's worth, your symptoms absolutely sound like depression. If I were you, I would consider looking for a therapist or counselor. Possibly, if it feels helpful to you and he is okay with it, your husband can eventually sit in on some sessions.  Even though you two are married, no one person can be "everything" to someone else. It's okay and healthy to look for support outside of your marriage - for both of you! Whether that's family members, friendships or professionals (he sounds like he might enjoy trying a life coach? some of them offer free first sessions, online, and there are also peer-to-peer coaching groups he might look into).  Same as going to a doctor or hospital - you wouldn't expect to be able to fix each others' somatic (physical) issues, right??
Hi, I don’t know your relationship. But he seems to be trying his best. It’s about YOU putting the on weight to get out. And overthinking can do nothing more but lead you more into depression. I recommend counseling or therapy and ask your husband to go with you for support. He can’t cure you. You can cure you. Together you can find out what triggers you and how to prevent it.  Remember that love is a mutual effort. Your worth is not merited by your mistakes, your negative feelings, and etc. it is merited by hoe you take care of yourself, love yourself, and pick yourself up when you are down. These moments are a small part of our lives, not the full picture.  And your husband has needs, he wants you to look out for him just like he has done for you. Doesn’t mean you’re worthless, just means that his needs are just as valid as yours. He doesn’t want to be in a marriage where all the weight is on his shoulders. He wants a healthy balance of giving and receiving love. compromise, find a new way to get out of bed. Start small. Make a small difference is a huge impact on your mental health.   Ex: start working out in your home. 1hr a day. The rest you get to do what you want/feel.  Read 1 book.( a self help one)

Ok so here I am, 26 years old and in a big mess. I will try to make it short. Sorry for my gramar mistakes, english is not my native language and i am typing this on my phone on 7:43am and tears in my eyes(no i did not sleep-as ussual).  I was born in a bad marriage betwen my mother and stepfather(at that time i tought that was my real father), 2 older stepsisters at that time I only knew 1, untill age of 14 or 15 then i met another stepsister. really happy kid I was. When I was 7 my mother is divorcing my stepfather who was beating her and not treating her well, they are selling our appartment and me and mother are moving out and i did not see that guy(stepfather) ever since. We moved to a much smaller appartment not so far away.. it was small but it was our safe heaven without debt. 1 of my stepsister is having idea that we shoudl sell that apartment and buy a small property out of town. Small house and a small yard. A lot of work and money had to be spent in order for that house to get in shape but my mother somehow did it. I was so happy i loved that house so much.. But then my stepsister wanted to put morgage on the house and upgrade a 1 level in to a house so that we can all stay at that house and live rent free hapily ever after.. My mother ofc accepted that coz she wanted the best for her daughter and split the house 50/50-mother/sister. Sister was owner of the loan and she started doing some plans for the house and some other small thing but nothing even close of what it shoudl be... money was gone and house was not even 15% finished.. so there we where small house for 2 big family-my stepsister, her housband,her daughter(my wonderful neice),my mother and me. That did not last long. They moved out and my stepsister said that she cant help anymore with a morgage so she left a big loan on me and my mother with a unfinished house. My mother needed to choose then shoudl we starve to death and pay the loan, or not pay the loan and have something on the table. so she did not pay the loan, interest build up and bank put a huge pressure on her. So she sold a house without me even knowing and bought a much smaller and shitier appartment without even me seeing it before she decided to do that. I was devastated, i was 16 years old at that time. But somehow we get over that.. but the problem was loan was not paid in full only half of it. But the bank was happy at that time.. so basicly mortgage was still there but transfered to that smaller and shitier apartment.. Me and my mother knew that wont last for long and suprisingly it did last for long 4-5 years to be exact and then bank said it was enough you are geting foreclousured. So at the age of 24-25 me and my mother are homeless. I am renting small apartment and my mother living with some guy that she met long time ago(good guy). I am jobless for more than a year, suffering major depression, my academic degree is terrible(bcs of my ADHD which i found out 6 months ago that i have) i can only work low end jobs, i dont see any future for me. I dont have any family except my mom. I lost a lot of money recently gambling coz i was desperate, i was tryng to do something from a money i got from selling the car and now i am even more miserable and depressed.. My living expenses are biger then an average paycheck in my shit country. I was planing to imigrate somewhere but i cant leave my mom and my girlfriend.. they are everything i got.. they are reason i am still alive.  Thank you for reading.

I will not share the name of the semi-famous person for anonymity reasons, but I kinda want some advice for how to get over this.  I've been going through a lot of crap in my life and this certain person (they make music) has helped me through a lot of it. I had no idea that said person actually checked their DMs, let alone see mine. It wasn't anything inappropriate, or anything too personal, just like a short little letter about an art piece I did (just the story behind it and why I loved the song it was inspired by). So I had a huge presence in their fangroups (that they moderate) and I made a lot of fanart, and actually got a lot of feedback from them, including comments and short conversations in the comments section, they even brought up my artwork a lot in livestreams! But after I wrote the letter they stopped responding... I had no idea they checked their IG DMs as they've said they don't check IG DMs. Yet mine was seen? Didn't get anymore feedback on the fanart I made for them...  At first I was like, "Yeah, okay." But then a couple of months later I reached out (through email) about a faulty piece of merchandise I ordered and asked if they were still replacing this certain faulty product (decals were peeling off and I had heard that they were honoring the faulty pieces by replacing them with new ones). So two weeks go by and I hadn't gotten an email in return. So I asked in the fan group about how they got their's replaced and they told me to message them on FB because they check their FB messages a lot (and that they return the messages most of the time when it's a question about a product). Low and behold, I was left on read... It's been a week... I'm not gonna try and say anything else because I don't really wanna be pushy, but I'm bummed that my hundred dollar jacket (which was a present from a family member) is just not gonna be replaced because I came off as a crazy fan from a message... I really didn't mean anything and feel really bad for annoying them...  I have super severe generalized anxiety disorder, so I can never get my mind off of anything even if I try my very best. I know in my heart that they probably did not mean any harm to me, but my mind is running wild and I can't get it to stop! I've felt really depressed and embarrassed about this and do not know what to do.   I know it's a super silly thing to ask for advice about, but I'm just so embarrassed and depressed for annoying one of my favorite song artists. Like I said, they aren't super famous, so I wasn't messaging someone who had a million followers. But I feel really bad for making them uncomfortable...

I doubt your idol is the one managing the fb group so try not to overthink it! It sounds to me like they just don't know how to respond about the merch, and not because you annoyed them. I feel like I can relate to how you feel, but for me it's usually because of my own overthinking, so maybe you're prone to the same thing too  Edit: usually famous people have a team to handle merchandise so it's unlikely the artist knows what's going on either! If they're not replying emails it's more likely cos the merch team sucks
My advice is dont idolize famous people. Many times they couldnt care less about their fans, and they are doing what they do to gain recognition and feel validated. So purely selfish reasons. Not like its bad to be selfish, but yeah you are better off keeping a distance.  At the end of the day we are just a number of likes and views for them
Wow, some Z-list celebrity is getting "annoyed" by a fan? Firstly their account could possibly be handled by admin so don't sweat it! You are probably very talented and very amazing. Secondly it is completely normal as someone who has anxiety to overthink about a situation that isn't that big of a deal.   I would say the incorrect answer in class for example and be depressed for weeks because I felt like an idiot.
The thing about anxiety and depression is we end up making a lot of assumptions and overthinking. The truth is, you really don't know if they read your IG DM. Maybe they just opened it to get rid of the notification, maybe they glanced and the picture but didn't read the text, maybe someone they allow on their accounts saw it, or maybe you are correct that they read it and were somehow annoyed. But you don't know.  You don't know if any of these things are connected. One thing I've learned is that many good artists are horrible business people. I buy a lot of painting and can't tell you how many times they conveniently don't respond when there's a problem. I wouldn't assume this is about you. The likelihood that they connect your different social media accounts and email together in their mind is probably kinda slim.  So remind yourself that this story you are telling yourself is one you made up, and the truth is unknowable at this point. It's okay to be upset. Some artists I can't even enjoy anymore after they rip me off and that makes me sad because I really loved their work before. Just try not to personalize it so much. I hope you feel better soon.
Maybe reach out from a friend or family members account? I suspect the merch team sucks and you aren't blocked, but that'd probably get your problem solved.  Even if they do reach out to that friend, they might be working the list backward, or just have a merch problem nightmare.  Wishing you luck!
You don't know if the person you messaged is actually the one you think it is. But you probably have the right to get your merch replaced so don't stop messaging them. They will just think it was easy to get rid of an 'annoying' customer.
I’m really bad with advice but I just wanted to say that whoever this is seems a bit of an ass because I’d be so happy to hear from a fan! Please don’t stop being creative and making fan art, I know how upsetting it can be when left on read over art. I once sent a pic to a girl on Instagram who does art and she really inspired me, I wrote her a lovely message and attached my art piece and she didn’t reply, it actually made me lose a bit of respect for her!  But please don’t think you’re weird or have done anything wrong because you haven’t! You were showing your appreciation and that is so pure!  I’m so sorry I’m terrible with advice but I just wanted to let you know you’ve got nothing to feel bad about :) and whoever this is sucks!! Don’t give up on the art work :) <3
Ok ok. So you don't actually know if they are annoyed. I mean, depending on ur letter it's possible they are. Possible they felt certain boundaries were crossed perhaps? It's not great, and I'm sorry this is weighing on you so.  But maybe some time away would help? Like...give it two weeks before you start being active in their groups and stuff. I will say for me, I have cut contact with ppl online because I felt my boundaries were being crossed. Like yeah we're friends but I will not go over any sexual info about myself with you. No, I will not send pictures of my feet.   (Examples cuz obviously I'm not sure of your particular case) also one last note- when I was 18 I called into the local radio station (wow yeah that old) and ended up having my favorite morning show mock me over the radio.   My husband knows this story and now you do too but that's it... Im 32yrs old and still cringe at what they said, what I said...all of it.   If you don't cringe at the person you were 5yrs ago, you aren't growing as a person.   So...keep growing. Don't let the lack of information (exactly why they stopped responding) be the reason you fall down. Go back and look at your letter. Re-read it as a friend reading a friend's letter they are going to send. What would you say to your bff about this letter? This way you can be a little more objective than when reading it with the emotions of everything attached to it. Give it a try.
I have that so beat. I directly insulted a famous person by telling them I hated their song. Only I didn’t know it that said person was famous or sang the song I hated. They also told me they kind of set me up and laughed. These people get this type of thing all the time. I wouldn’t worry about it.
This is why attachments to people are so unhealthy. Our happiness should never rely on another person (I had to learn this the hard way).  Anyway, there are a few things you can do that will help solve this:  I first recommend doing some shadow work to see if you can find out if the root of this reaction/obsession is potentially linked to past trauma.    I then recommend doing internal work on your thoughts. It's difficult at first, but with practice it becomes easier. Everytime you have a negative or intrusive thought like "my idol thinks I'm annoying" just tell yourself that you reject that thought, and if it keeps coming back just keep rejecting it until the thought becomes less and less. You can then start filling your mind with thoughts like "my idol likes and appreciates me" and keep replying the thought loop until it becomes a natural and believable thought flow.   It sound too good to be true but this practice strangely works. Check out Sammy Ingram's channel, she has a LOT of good material on this: https://youtu.be/frgYeAmVRhw
I know it may be difficult to stop this from getting to you but this isn't your fault, everyone idolizes people and what you did is completely normal and there is nothing wrong with it, if they got mad at you for it then that is their problem! You were being a supportive fan and there is nothing wrong with that!
Look, if they were annoyed by that letter (which you don’t know for sure) it’s bloody ridiculous. I don’t know what you wrote exactly, but unless it was creepy stalker stuff they should be flattered. Seriously - a “semi-famous” musician, and you’re making art inspired by their music? Most people would be flattered. This is also why I doubt they’re really annoyed, why should they be? Maybe try one more time about the jacket, regardless of who is running the account it’s quite possible they read it, put it in the ‘deal with later’ pile and then forgot about it.
As others have said, I doubt they were annoyed by you.  I do stuff like this all the time where I think someone not responding to me means they're pissed.  But then I realize I do it to other people too and it has NOTHING to do with me being annoyed at the person who sent me the text.  They're probably very busy and just inundated with these kind of requests, so they may be disorganized. You were completely in the right to reach out, it's good that you're using your voice to ask for what you want.     Have you ever looked into CBT mind mapping? It's very good in this kind of situation.     [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRRdSm4ZjX4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRRdSm4ZjX4)   It's really good to demonstrate to yourself that your thoughts aren't facts.  It's helped me out of a lot of tough situations where I feel like this and doing "mind-reading" over what someone else may be thinking.     This person is lucky that you're one of their fans.
As someone who has played in many bands and has been responsible for running their social media and merch pages....I would say don’t take it personally. Youd also be surprised to learn just how many well-known artists end up managing all sorts of things themselves, and well, they take on too much and get overwhelmed just like the rest of us. I personally know one band that sells 1,000-2,000 tickets per show, and their guitarist STILL prints all their shirts by hand, just to save money for hotel rooms and such. I’ve left many people on read and it was never because I was annoyed; I was just dealing with my own depression haha. And of course felt guilty about that because we SO appreciate our fans! But sometimes we just get busy, or forget, or don’t have an answer right at that moment. As long as you’re polite to them, you’re not asking for anything unreasonable or harassing them, etc. I know it can be hard but try not to worry too much!
Having anxiety means that we often overestimate things, and blow things out of proportion.   The likely explanation is that whoever this semi famous person is, they do not have the time to notice every piece of fan art or fan mail, and probably don’t even manage their FB. In other words, it’s not you, it’s them.   If you feel up to it, send another FB message, or ask someone (or the family member who bought it for you) to send another message about the faulty jacket. Even if they can’t honour a replacement (warranty and personal care of items and whatnot), they should still know the item was faulty.
I highly doubt you annoyed them. They are people too and could be busy. Haven't you ever left someone on read thinking you responded? It happens.
Thank you to everyone who gave me some insightful advice! I am feeling much better about this and managed to pull myself out of the vicious cycle.  I don't need anymore feedback, thank you for helping me!
Me too I have anxiety depression too. I remembered in school I had to ask about the food that I ordered because it was the wrong one and like I remembered I waited for the waiter to come so I could tell her that I got the wrong order of food and like I waited 30 minutes for some one to come and like the place barely had any costumers because it was at night, and I could see five of the waiters just standing behind the cashier talking. Then one came and I told her that I got the wrong order and the next thing I knew I got kicked out for being annoying and pushy. I have been suffering this for 10 years of my life since I was 10 basically, and what people don’t realize that anxiety and depression makes you feel worst about yourself. Like I don’t want anything I just want to eat and go home but apparently I didn’t eat anything after that incident
I had a personal issue that caused me severe GAD to the point of panic attacks. What eventually helped me was realizing I was the only person involved. Nobody could stop me from not caring and once I did it wouldn't even exist. The artist probably doesn't think about it, the admits of whatever servers probably don't think about it, and it could all just not even be a thing. Good luck. We all have the power to rebuild our own internal lives.
dont worry
Meh who really cares. You’ll probably never meet this said person. As for your merch just accept it and let it be..
Sadly this is true. If they are ignoring you it's very likely they are ignoring others as well. I mean you said the jacket was around $100? Shit, send out some cheaply made jackets that costs about $20 to make and ignore anyone that wants a return, that sounds sketch. I suggest your family member disputes the charge directly with their credit card company since the seller sent a defective item and isn't responding now. You at least deserve your money back.
Dog piling onto this, it’s good not to idolise them or put them on pedestals or be careful not to view them as ‘close friends’ for the moments they do mess up, either small time or BIG time (I’m talking newspaper scandal and lawyer big). Saves you a lot of hurt in the long run.
You're probably right. We often overestimate how much the things we do matter to others. Especially when we're embarrassed about something we thought was terrible. They may or may not have read it, but even if they did it was probably pretty quickly forgotten.
The first part of what you said is 100% my problem. I can't stop overthinking it. And the more I think about it, the more embarrassed I feel. It was just really weird because I was somewhat friendly with them, then I wrote the letter and they stopped being friendly. I haven't bugged them since because I realize the business they're in can get really stressful and in all likelihood they don't think anything of it and my anxiety is just that: anxiety.   I've been in therapy for years, on medication longer, yet I'm still stuck in this eternally anxious and depressed mindset.  Thank you for your kind message! It helps when someone can pull you out of your own mind.
This is one of my favorite comments! Thank you so much for sharing this with me! And  >If you don't cringe at the person you were 5yrs ago, you aren't growing as a person.   This. Wow. I can't really explain it but wow, it helped! Thank you thank you thank you!
Lol I heard it yesterday, we're all just trying to be better

I’m nothing. I do nothing, I’m worthless to society. I go to bed in the evening having failed every task I set out to do. I’m irresponsible, unproductive, lazy. I look back at days, months, years, and I think “Wow, I really am irrelevant, I really did nothing.” I always feel like nothing. Even on good days I know in the back of my head I’m an unproductive slob. Even when I do things, take care of responsibilities, participate in hobbies, I feel unproductive. I don’t feel full. There isn’t a single memorable part of my life. I may as well not be here.

i feel very similarly lately like i’m in a funk or something. i have a job that will never be a career and i dont go to school or anything. i have spent the last week literally doing nothing and i dont even enjoy doing nothing anymore like i used to enjoy spending the day being lazy sometimes but now it just makes me feel like shit like i’m wasting so much time of my life that should be spent making awesome memories and stuff or becoming successful idk. i have a boyfriend who loves me and friends who love me but sometimes i feel like i dont love me. but last night i decided to do something ab it and i started a 40 hour course to get certified to be an RBT and work w kids w autism and i am very excited and it gives me something to do when i feel like a less than functioning member of society. i looked at ur page and u like opossums maybe u could learn more ab them or something and gain some knowledge to share idk it sounds dumb i guess i’m just talking out loud.i  don’t have much good advice just here to tell u that you’re not the only person feeling this way and it isn’t unusual esp in the current climate. but my favorite thing to remember is that it is literally IMPOSSIBLE for you to always feel this exact way and for things to be how they are now. things are constantly changing and your emotions change with it. have a good day friend

I (25m) and almost done with with living life. I’ve been lonely, have few friends, never been able to get a date despite being reasonably handsome and having decent social skills, and my BA and MA are useless.   Moreover all of the career fields I’m interested in are basically impossible for me to get into and I’ve basically gave everything I had just to be worse off in life.  I’m sick of trying and I don’t think my life will ever get any better. I plan to commit suicide in a year or two if things don’t suddenly get better (it won’t be the saddest thing to ever happen to me or the worst outcome in for my future).  I’m just done. I wish I could’ve done things different in life but I’m done with everything.  PS I’ve tried therapy but it didn’t help at all and I don’t want to try another therapist. Therapy can’t solve my problems and I hate opening up to a therapist just for them to not be able to help me or sometimes even understand me.

Know that others are in this similar mindset. We are here to listen. Well I am if need be. This may just be a post needed to be said to get off your chest or truly want this. Whatever the case may be. I’d like to hear your story if you find the time. The war is open and not here to judge.
Do not apologize for such a thing. I asked and I’m glad to get a response back in a timely manner. I hate that your very upbringing has mentally hurt you. I hate the school has sucked all life out of you socially speaking.   I want to say “it’ll get better”. But no one truly knows if it will. I like to hold on to the hope of one day feeling complete bliss even if it be for a second. I wish I had a magic wand, a spell, something from the divine to help clear the gloom over you. Unfortunately I do not. But what I can offer is an anonymous ear and comfort in knowing you are being heard.   I will not ask for you not to do what you so please. I know that at this time you have taken the consideration of most if not all routes before coming to a conclusion so dark. I only hope that a brighter year is to come to help lift you from such thoughts, feelings. Coming from a stranger, I care. Even if it means nothing as of now, I will continue to be here.
Let’s just say you’re doing better than me, I’m (25m) and have no official degrees under me despite spending all of three years so far studying tertiary education. I have been unemployed and underemployed since I’ve left high school close to ten years ago now, having to rely on welfare for all of my teen and early adult life. I don’t have any friends and all my friendships with everyone else including my family is shallow because they will never understand me fully because they’re in love with the child I used to be not the adult I am today. I tried therapy for a year because it was free for ten sessions, I never used all my sessions because the last one I was about to go to I got scared and cancelled which turned out to be a really good idea. As I realised my therapist, when she texted me in a unprofessional matter, that I now have to pay $40 for cancelling and not bothering to come back to see her for a couple months and she also included other remarks as to how this is her job she’s not there for me persay. So that’s now left me without any form of mental health support, as well as quitting anti depressants cold turkey 6 months ago, which hasn’t made anything better. On top of that at the start of this year my welfare had stopped because I had to change from a different pay system because I turned 25 so they have to go over my new claim. Meaning I won’t be getting any welfare payments for anything until two months later, meaning no money for rent, food or anything. The only reason I have anything right now is because of my boyfriend, but even then I feel he’s staying with me because he’s comfortable and I think he can do better rather than have me to comfort and try to take care of. Like life isn’t great, I know how you feel, I don’t know what the fuck to do, I think about ending it everyday now as well, just putting on a brave face for everyone so they don’t need to see or feel what I feel, but then that comes across as unintentionally rude. Soo yeah I know how you feel, truely.

My dad was in the same boat as you when he was your age. He had no friends, no family, no love. He was divorced since his wife cheated on him while he was in the military and his two kids despised him since the wife lied and made up bad things about him. He was depressed and knew that things would never get better. Until they did. He met a woman in Turkey when he visited there since he was in the military. He fell in love with her and at the age of 40, they had me and my twin brother. My dad is happy as ever and has an amazing wife and amazing kids. Things will get so much better, and the wait is worth it. Your future wife and kids are waiting for you my friend. You’re only 25. You got this. I believe in you. Things will get better.
Well basically my story is that I hated university except for 4th year. I commuted to a local school (1 hour city bus ride each way) for a BA and later MA in political science. I couldn’t make friends or get a date to save my life. I feel like people discriminated against there because of my archaic ethnic first name. I have 2 close friends and some beer league soccer acquaintances but that’s it. I gave everything I had emotionally going to university for something I didn’t want too much. I only went because my mom emotionally manipulated me into going.  Having an emotionally absent, somewhat narcissistic mother didn’t help. Nor did having. A physically abstinence dad my mom didn’t leave until I was 13 who harassed my mom and I for a year after that. Like I don’t think about it too much but it messed with my ability to make decisions for myself and keep trying at life when I’ve never had the foundation to truly believe in myself.  I’m also very sad about how I never got to play baseball as a teenager because my mom couldn’t give me a ride.  Rn I’ve been unemployed for over a year and I don’t care anymore. I’m just hoping I have the guys to kill myself so I’m not a intellectual and moral failure to myself.  I’d like to be a high school teacher, physician, policy analyst (or anything in the civil service) or political science professor but those are all extremely competitive to get into in my province (thousands of qualified applicants for hundreds of spots at best).  I don’t really want to move because my 2 close friends live around here. I don’t like change much.  I think the loneliness and isolation of university have just gotten to me. I slogged life out and I don’t see how it’s going to get better. I always thought it’d get better if I could just get through university but now I doubt that. Even when things go well on rare occasion, it just feels like checking off a box and I can’t fully enjoy it because I know I’m so far behind in life.  Personally, I think I didn’t develop properly emotionally/socially when I left high because I was in a bad place for so long it’s gotten to me.  At least promising to commit suicide if things don’t work out gives me some inner peace and closure. I’d rather kill myself than continue to try and either take so long to get where I want to be or anywhere close to it that I don’t feel anything or never get there and live a futile existence where I’m suffering and slogging through life for nothing.  I’m just not interested in life or my realistic options anymore and at this point I’m need life to “show me the money” or I’m not dumb enough to keep trying for something that I know I’ll never be satisfied with.  Sorry for the essay.
Thanks for being so understanding. I feel as though if the people in my life when I was going to university were more understanding, I’d be in a better place rn.  FWIW, I have some New Years resolutions that I’m starting to make some decent progress on now that I’ve put some structure into my life but I’m still feeling pretty bad about my long term future.  Sadly being depressed and hating my lack of a satisfactory future still feels better than commuting to university. I just wish I wasn’t washed up and mentally and emotionally drained.  Thanks
I'm sorry to hear about your circumstances. I would say more but I'm afraid I really don't know what to say.   I hear you on your parents on liking the kid you used to be and not the adult you are. My mom is one of those people who's nice on the surface but is a controlling, narcissistic jerk when I tried telling her  I didn't want to commute to my local university and I wanted to either drop out and change or transfer. I just think if I'd been in a better situation in university I would've turned out a bit better.  IDK about you but for me committing suicide isn't the worst thing that happened in my life and wouldn't be the worst thing that I could do with my life. I had a shit childhood and I'd rather not suffer than keep living life and not get to where I want to.  Lastly, I wish you peace with whatever you do in life. Peace in my life is something I wish to find one day, be it through suicide or something else.   Feel free to chat or DM me if you'd like to.
Hey! I’m glad you replied I’d love to DM you if you ever want to chat together I’m just about always free so hit me up ☺️ And I think our parents have to grow and change just as much as we do, my mum and I have actually started to heal wounds that have not really been addressed from the past. I know how you feel I had a rough childhood, moreso from my father but I hope your family slowly come around and start treating you like the adult you are now. I don’t think Suicide is our option to our way out of our trauma, we shouldn’t be too quick to end the narrative of our life. Life is hard but I always try to hold onto the little joyful moments that come along the way. It’s hard, it’s stressful, it’s traumatic, but this isn’t the end, it may just be the beginning. Diamonds have to go through pressure and stressors in order to become what it needs to be. Let’s be patient, let’s hold space for change I think we can do it ♥️🌈

There’s a particular problem I’ve been dealing with constantly since last summer. I posted about it in my previous only post. I’m really down about it. Sad. And kind of scared and need somebody to private message atm for help if that’s cool. I don’t want the depression to come back.  EDIT: I am not suicidal, I love my life. I just can’t get past this one problem.

Hey friend. Sorry to hear. Going through a breakup, especially against your choice, is no doubt one of the hardest things we go through in life. Feels worse than losing someone to a death. The relationship is that same feeling of loss, but add rejection on top of it for a twist of the knife after you’ve been stabbed. Absolutely brutal. It ruins who you are. Steals your appetite, your motivation, your focus, your hope. There is no way to get off this ride until it finishes. Fortunately, your brain will eventually change to self-defense mode and you’ll go numb to the grief. It might take a while for that to happen. Depends on how attached you were with her and how long you were together. Once you get numb to it, that’s probably when you will start to feel hungry again and you won’t feel miserable about the idea of eating. If your hair is coming out from stressing this so hard, at least that will probably stop too.  There has to be countless people out there going through the same right now. Even though it’s so hard to see anything positive about your future when you feel like this, but everyone gets through this eventually. Up to your brain to say low long it will take.

Since a couple of weeks, my sister (10 years old) has been targeted by bullies at her school. She’s got a unique identity, style and personality, but unfortunately kids her age are fucking judgmental and they’ve been picking on her for that. It’s getting really bad and now she’s struggling with depression and she’s thinking about cutting herself... i want to help her but i really don’t know what to say because while i’ve experienced bullying, i’ve never experienced depression and self-harm. I’d like to hear from people who have cut themselves/seriously thought about doing it.  Why did you do it ? (Did it make you feel better/relieved/other emotions ?)   And if you managed to overcome it, what helped you ? How would you have wanted the people around you to help you ?   Is there anything you think I could say to my sister that would maybe help her ?  I would really appreciate your thoughts. I really don’t know how to help her, and since i can’t understand what she’s going through i’m scared of overstepping, or saying something that would make it worse...  Thank you

I think the why for cutting is a hard thing to distill into words. For me, part of it was control. I felt like I had no control over the things that were happening to me or everything wrong with the world, and I couldn’t control feeling awful about those things all the time, so if I was going to feel shitty anyway if I hurt myself as well I could control some of the pain. Also, I didn’t know how to heal my depression, but cuts you can clean and bandage and take care of and watch them get better. It was also sort of a “cry for help,” but not the way most people think. It was more like my depression and anxiety were in my head and I felt like I was constantly dying but it didn’t show, so if I cut myself the marks were like proof that something was actually wrong. They legitimized my feelings.  To help your sister, those might be good things to think about. Help her feel like she has agency and that her feelings are legitimate. Try to talk with her and figure out together what triggers the feelings that make her want to cut. Maybe stress and fear of failure, stress about the future, frustration with world events, etc. Let her know that its natural to feel bad about those things, and that she doesn’t need to try and force herself to feel differently. Also help her feel more in power. This means don’t try to force any solutions on her (unless you believe her to be in imminent danger, in which case take her to a hospital) She’s got to feel like she can heal herself, and you want to help. You can help her look for therapists and choose one, offer to make the appointment if she’s too anxious. Help her figure out stressors and try to figure out a way to eliminate or minimize those stressors in a way she feels comfortable and capable of doing. You could look up coping mechanisms for depression together and help her pick ones to practice. Overall, do not try to force her to stop or to try and make her feel differently. Try to understand her and let her know that you see her and accept her pain and love her anyway, to help her accept her pain and love herself. Make sure she knows you support her and you are a resource for when she needs help.
cutting is for me a way to relieve and distract myself from my emotional pain. it hurts so much it just calms me. my advice is, ask her if you need her to take anything away. a cutter can cut with pretty much anything, but just the notion that my go-to has been taken usually lowers my chance of cutting by 50%. common things are thin glass (think snowglobes), knives, and razor blades. remove these from her space as much as possible. if she wants to shave, get her an electric razor with no removable blade.  secondly, help her make a list of things she can do when she wants to cut. first a personal emotional list (things she can think to herself, like mantras "what would my best friend/loved one say in this situation?", or even just telling herself "maybe tomorrow" over and over again until she doesnt feel the need). second a personal physical (putting on her favorite movie, picking up a book to read, cleaning her room, drawing, any activity she can do by herself, basically) thirdly a "i need help from others" list (people she can talk to or call or hang out with when shes low, together activities to distract, places to go that make her feel better).  thirdly, sign her up for therapy if you havent already.
Wow thank you so much. That was truly helpful i really had no idea about that... it really helps to know how you see it as a way of having more control, or coping, or just kind of making what you feel more tangible/concrete. I had no idea. Thank you so so much !
These are all really good ideas thank you so much !!!

Hi, um, so I've tried getting to some kind of official chat function for my problems, but there wasn't really anyone online so I decided to make a reddit account as kind of my last resort to ask for advice.   I'll try to keep it short. Basically, I am afraid my significant other (22M) has pulled me (22F) into some kind of depression. I've been with him for a bit over three years, and all this time he has had problems with depression, anxiety and a bad self image. He has talked a lot about taking his life (which he assured me he would never do), self harm (which he has done, sometimes still does) and how he generally feels like shit. He has been at a therapist for all his problems, but it has never really solved anything. Even though some progress might have taken place, I still constantly feel worried about him and his state of being, to the point where it influences my work, study, and social life. I love him, but I also feel like I cannot talk to him about serious topics because I am afraid he will snap, get sad, or worse. I am not good with words, therefore not good at comforting him when he's down, stressing me out even more.    I'm considering going to a psychologist, even though I don't feel like I'm a person that needs/deserves it. I have no one else to talk about this right now and I have generally felt really down and stressed the past time. Even though I do not want to admit it, I keep asking myself why I'm still with him as he mainly brings me down. There are good days, but I can't always see them through the fog of my sadness. If anyone has tips to deal with this, I would love to hear it. Also, if there is a forum better fit for this kind of questions, also let me know <3

Last year I started to see a therapist after many years of anxiety and depression. I’ve had it worse but I guess I was in a good enough place last year to actually make the moves to go. My first session was more about diagnosing and my background. After that she would just ask me about my day or week.   I did about 4 sessions with her and nothing came out of it. Actually, more like nothing came out of me. If i had a bad week instead of talking about it, I would just vent about something else less serious. If my thoughts about dying were back, I didn’t bring it up.   I basically would go into these sessions with the intention of being open and honest but, like most social situations, I just disassociate. I’m on autopilot. I just say things but I dont control it. I can see myself saying these stupid unimportant things or venting about something not meaningful, but I can’t stop it nor can I control it. Then the session is over, I’m in my car again, and I’m in a daze, drive home, and feel like I’m back in my body.   My session would always be a blur, but I just know we didn't talk about anything meaningful. Or at least anything I wanted to talk about in regards to my anxiety and depression. Maybe we just talked about how grocery shopping sucks with extra long lines.  I tried to tell her in a session that I do this during our sessions. I do it in social situations too. And work. but therapy was the one place i dont want to, because i wanted to deal with my issues.   i stopped seeing the therapist because i didn’t know how to handle my disassociation if i couldn’t even tell her. i didn’t feel like paying all that money was worth it at some point. but my mind is again in a bad place and i do feel like i need to continue therapy. but my sessions have been basically a socializing session due to my involuntary disassociation.   any advice?

I’m just starting therapy myself. I have some stuff I want to unpack in my mind. Deal with depression. Not sure if it’s chronic and gets masked sometimes. Might explain a few things. Anyway, I had one session so far and I blathered on for 55 min, with the therapist not really saying much. I could’ve done the same thing to a bum at the bus station. At the end, she gave some suggestions, but they were pointless. For example, I explained to her that I’ve been sleeping on the sofa for the last month. I have a bed, but I don’t like sleeping there. Sofa is uncomfortable, but at the same time comforting. Rambled on about my depression for losing my family and the bed is a painful reminder of what was... and her reply was “you should sleep in your bed!”. Seemed like a pretty “duh” suggestion. Like, if it wasn’t a problem I would. That’s why im telling you about it.  I’ll give her another chance. Maybe we won’t click. If not, I’ll find another.  Maybe you didn’t click with yours? Never occurred to me that that could be a problem until a friend mentioned it before I went.
It can, unfortunately, take a few tries to find a therapist who's the right fit for you.   Do you think it would help to write down some of this stuff before you go, and then have your therapist read it first thing?  A good therapist would probably make "get comfortable enough to not dissociate during sessions" your (joint) very first goal.   Establishing trust and rapport is like 90% of what makes talk therapy work! Okay, *slight* exaggeration, but the relationship factor ("therapeutic alliance") IS often more important than the specific methods used or what background the therapist has.

Why am I holding on? Whenever I do something in this fucking world, I just get shit on to the maximum degree. Every time. Why the fuck am I holding on to any hope that things will get better? And whenever I'm under fire from the shit of this world, just when I'm at my lowest, that's when the real shit happens to me, like fucking choreography.  I'm not gonna kill myself - I would've done it years ago if not for the vain hope that things will ever improve. I'm just gonna fucking give up like everyone else and because an abusive, horrible asshole who destroys people wherever I go. I'm gonna stop caring about my health and fuck my body up with alcohol and drugs and STDs, because everyone else gets a free fucking pass to do as they please, and they're fucking fine.  Everything bad happens to me, and I'm never allowed a fucking release. It's just torment, torture and trauma all the time. Everything I do backfires completely. I am the sponge for the suffering on this earth, and yet I try my fucking hardest to be anything better. Well it's impossible, because this is clearly my fucking lot in life. This is it for me - it's the chain that binds me.  And everyone gets fucking REWARDED for shitting on me. When I fight back or try to fix my situation I get shat on ten times more. I am a fucking prisoner of pain.  What the FUCK am I trying for? Why am I trying to improve myself? I was never meant for anything beyond absolute failure. It's what I was raised to be, and somehow, the world always finds a way to drag me right back here, to the verge of giving up. Always. It never, NEVER fucking ends.

Fuck hope. Fuck self-improvement. Fuck trying to be "better".  We all need some fundamental needs met, before we can do any of that. When that's not happening, "fuck everything" is a 100% valid response.  What do you need, right now? How can you get even a teeny, tiny bit of that? (Ideally without compromising your other values too much.)   Be fucking angry. Be fucking "selfish". Figure out what you really do give a shit about (even a very small shit), and fuck everything else.     (Not meaning to be flippant, honestly, but I really liked the alliteration of "torment, torture and trauma all the time". I might steal that. "sponge for suffering" and "prisoner of pain" are pretty decent, too.)
Sounds like a pretty bleak narrative you've created for yourself. I am doubtful that it reflects reality, although I can empathize with feeling terrible about the events of our lives. I hope when the rage leaves you can find peace somehow.
I know what ur taking about I really do I am a faliure too and I lost many people I love this world is cruel it really is just pain and I also lost my best friend because of my anxiety and it just hurts everyday so I know how ur feeling and I just have to pretend everything is okay when it's not but maybe u can talk to me or anyone about it to alleviate the pain
I don't know what I need. It's like I've had so many needs denied throughout my life that they've all piled up into an unregonisable mess.  I'm not as angry as I was yesterday - I got myself outta the house and did something nice, and it cooled me off. I haven't been that furious in a long time. I suspect some of it is the anger I've bottled up over, well, my entire life.  Thanks, I did well in English. I really want to write stories, but I just kinda don't. For some reason, the stuff I want to do I never do, and the stuff that distracts me but accomplishes nothing is what I automatically do.
The rage has left - for now.  I understand what narrative I've created and how it's holding me down. But it's so unbelievably accurate. I kid you not, almost **everything** I try to do (especially major life decisions) always goes completely wrong, yet everyone else seems to just breeze through life. And when I try to rectify the thing that went wrong, it usually gets keeping ten times worse until I give up.  Why is that? Do things normally go catastrophically-wrong, yet i'm the only one without a loving family propping me up? Is that why I struggle so much?
I feel better now. After I posted this, I went out and fed seagulls and chilled in peace. But, man, I really let it out when I raged yesterday.
Glad you're feeling a bit better.  I won't try to give any input about the anger thing, because that's not one of my own issues (I'm more on the side of: should be more angry more often, and actually often relish my anger when I do feel it, because it's a kind of energy and I never seem to have enough energy!), but it sounds like you're working out some strategies for handling it (without suppressing it), so good job! :)  Untangling needs: I know it might seem overly simplistic, but: https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory   There are a number of ways to use a list like this; one might be to pick a few words that jump out at you (even if they seem odd or you don't know why) and write "whatever comes out" around each word. Maybe using a timer to take the pressure off (keep typing for 5 minutes, then stop. and delete everything if you want! or save it and look at it again later.)  I've found a number of concepts from Non-Violent Communication (aka Compassionate Communication) pretty useful, not actually so much when it comes to communicating with others (well, a bit) as in regards to putting words to my values, feelings and needs and learning how to empathize* with myself.   One central idea I got from there is that there are always multiple ways to meet any given need. We often fixate on one or a few, but it can be useful to backtrack to the underlying basic need and brainstorm other ways to meet it - either (often the best start) some way to give (a tiny bit) of it to yourself, or decide on something very concrete (typically, a present action) you want from someone else and ask for that.  *Empathy and empathizing have very specific and actionable definitions within Non-Violent Communication, which I really love.  If you find this sort of thing helpful, there are plenty of free resources on NVC to be found. Some of it's just common sense, some can get overly mushy/woo-ey for my taste, and some of it is just.... pretty cringe in general. I'd avoid the OG book, for instance (Rosenberg's), it's pretty hard going and there are newer ones that are much better written. But like a lot of things, could be worth wading through to find the nuggets that do resonate with you.
The lack of a support system is huge, absolutely. Also whether we learned how to support ourselves, regulate our own emotions, all that shit, growing up.   A lot of people end up having to learn, as adults, how to "parent themselves" - pick up the slack of what our families should have done. It sucks, but it's absolutely possible. Really helps to have some supportive people around (whether you pay them for that role or not), but when it comes down to it... We're all of us basically alone inside our own heads, right? We have to figure out how to live with ourselves. Help ourselves, literally. (Often a big part of that at some point ends up being, 'help myself by figuring out how to find more external support', which may seem like a contradiction but isn't really, the way I see it.)  &#x200B;  As for narratives being accurate or not, well, my position is that **feelings are a type of facts**. As in, emotions are very real things that have very real effects in physical reality.   Now, the stories and words that come to mind when we verbalize based on our feelings, those can definitely be examined and challenged. And getting into the habit of doing that works really well for some people. But there are lots of other approaches, too.  Venting in written form is pretty much universally acknowledged to be one of the very healthiest ways to do it, so I wouldn't necessarily worry about the specifics.  At the same time it's never a good idea to fully believe everything you think. (or write). :)
It's fine u feel better and that's what matters people around you will always restrict u from doing what makes u feel good but they're wrong
Yeah I basically bottled everything until last year, especially anger. My dad was a narcissist with endless rage, and I experienced a lot of that from birth. In my mind: It hurts too much to be on the receiving end of it, so I won't pass on that pain to anyone else. But because I wasn't taught about emotions, I considered any hint of anger 'Too harmful' and suppressed all of it.  Hey thanks for that share, I had a quick look at it. My brain's a bit pasted at the moment because I've been reading about learned helplessness, which segued into CIA torture tactics (who would've thought my entire childhood experience would be considered torture by the CIA?)  That's why I procrastinate so much with healing lol. It's never just Problem A, it's Problem B-Z at the same time, and they all need to be studied and tackled individually.
That's what really gets me in the end. It's a harsh reality that never ends; it's just a spiral of suffering; a neverending game of Russian Roulette.  Surely, somewhere out there, there has to be something better. It can't just be endless hostility. ...Right?
Idk but I'm very depresses cause when finally after 8 years of being alone I met a person I could talk with and connect with and was just so happy with they left cause of distance any anxiety I'm just at my lowest and I miss her so much
Damn man, that's gotta hurt. I wish I knew what to say, but you have my permission to vent if you want to. Venting always helps me figure out my problems (if not immediately, then eventually).
I just want to die honestly never be in pain again I really really want to die and whenever I tried to suicide it doesn't work I either injure myself badly or get close but not happen
Same, man. Same. I've never attempted suicide - somehow I always cling onto the hope that things could get better. Which is ironic because I feel absolutely hopeless 24/7. Plus the idea of crippling myself with a failed attempt (thus making everything worse) always really put me off.  But I want to die, honestly. I don't think I'd have a problem with dying. Life hasn't been much more than constant and/or guaranteed suffering, often to extremes.
Yeah exactly Even after something good happens and it genuinely happy and not lonely and feel something other than sadness it gets taken away life is pretty much just a cycle repeating itself

I haven't been doing my schoolwork for two terms/seasons/weeks?.. I failed the last one because I did nothing because I never wanted to do anything, I didn't have any motivation to do a single thing. I don't think it's laziness.. This is too much just for laziness... It's nearly impossible to get me to care about anything.. I didn't even show empathy when my mother almost choked, could I have liked it even? Do I hate her that much? I don't wanna hate her that much, and I don't wanna feel like I'm terrible...

Transitioning to and continuing with online schooling was very stressful for a lot of people, who then may go on to display lack of interest or empathy (both symptoms of depression).   Even if you are not in online school, there is no denying that last year was EXTREMELY stressful for a lot of different reasons.   Even if you have a good home environment and good relationships with your family, suddenly being forced to be caged in much more then you are used to may also contribute as a stressor.   I think it is worth making an appointment with your GP or school counsellor and discussing your lack of interest/motivation with school and other factors.   Overall, please be kind to yourself.
I don't know if you have a diagnosis of Major Depression, but you certainly seem to be showing two of the symptoms. I was diagnosed at 13. I had symptoms as far back as second grade.  First, you seem to be showing Anhedonia. This can be described as a loss of interest and enjoyment of things you once felt. Having no interest in school or your grades covers this. This can even cause the loss of feelings for your own family members. The loss of motivation is a common symptom. I have to think about showering the night before to actually do it. I've had Depression for forty years, and sometimes I still feel like i did when I was your age. This is an illness, and no illness can make you a terrible person.  Ask your folks to see a pediatrician to talk about these symptoms. It requires medication to control the symptoms. Being at home all the time sucks, but it shouldn't make you feel like you do. Message me if you would like. I'll answer any question since I've gone through this already. Take care...
First, feeling depressed and unmotivated is a natural reaction to all the stuff that’s going on right now. Lots of people are going through it, which I know doesn’t help, except that you should know you’re not crazy and your feelings make sense.  There’s many times where I can’t get myself to care or do anything. I have to try a lot of different things to help, the same thing doesn’t work every time. Lately, I’ve tried to keep a coloring book and colors beside me at all times. Even if I have no motivation, if the book’s right there I can usually work up the energy to color. It calms my brain, I can stop thinking and let go. And when the picture is done, I get a little feeling of accomplishment that can give me the boost I need to get other stuff done. Other than coloring, laundry, showers, sudoku, etc. Sometimes help. Anything to occupy my hands, give my brain something to focus on, and give me a sense of accomplishment. If you can’t even get up the energy for those, try a grounding exercise. Listen and try to hear five different sounds, or grab something with a cool texture and focus on feeling it. Sometimes after you’re grounded, you can convince yourself that right this moment you are okay, and you can definitely make it through today, and with that resolve, get up the motivation to do more.  Those techniques are for in the moment. Long term, try to keep interacting with people, even just by chatting on the internet. Try to leave the house and get outside everyday, even for just a bit. Humans are really just animals, we need socialization and interaction with nature and natural light, those are things hardwired into our brains and if we don’t get those things, we get sick. And congratulate yourself for every little accomplishment. When just getting out of bed is hard, literally everything you do during the day is a major accomplishment. Be proud if you eat, brush your teeth, take a walk, etc. And if you can’t do anything at all, forgive yourself and try again tomorrow.  And don’t worry too much about school. As someone who was a straight A student despite my depression and anxiety, its not worth it. Enjoy the opportunity to interact with other people and the chance to learn new things, that stuff is brain food. Think of it as brain veggies if you must, maybe not tasty, but make you feel better. But your mental health will do you more good and will have more long term effects than school.
Is this online school or in person school?
I was in a similar place a while back. The best thing to do is to try and get as many good friends as possible. Friends that will call you and ask if u wanna do homework together... And suddenly it doesn't become trying to force urself, but a wholesome experience, after that for me everything just clicked. Online school is mostly hard because of the lack of communication. As soon as I got friends I started feeling much more calm and relaxed about life, the laziness doesn't exactly go away, but if a friend is calling u can't rly refuse can u? And at this point it's a good thing
thank you for reaching out here.  im sorry that you are going thru this tough time.  it is difficult to focus on school assignments in this covid.  i urge to you think about this for a while.  my friend, what happened  two terms/seasons/weeks ago that makes you feel this way... online school is an adjustment.  how can we help?
Can we get a round of applause for this guy and his great comment?
Online school.

The headspace app is genuinely good. My mind runs at night, I find a good podcast to help me stop my mind spinning - I recommend 'Nothing Much Happens', helped ease my nighttime anxiety.
I would recommend Feeling Good by David D Burns. The audiobook version may be more suitable as it is very upbeat and saves reading as that can seem like a chore when depressed/anxious.    It offers good insight as well as practical managment strategies. If she is to try some of the techniques even for a week she would likely benefit substantially if suited to her. Hope this helps. It has been proven in clinical trials to be very effective so it is backed by science.   Also Mind Over Mood (2nd edition) would be good book after this, which elaborates on similar techniques.   I am talking from experience of my own crippling depression and anxiety.  Wishing your Mum well.
Thank you for caring so much about your mom. It's so easy to get frustrated and take things personally which can end up in a fractured relationship, so I just want to say how proud I am of you for asking for help for both you and her!  Discovering Your True Self by Chip Ingram is one of THE BEST books I've read when it comes to helping with depression and anxiety.  Switch on Your Brain by Dr. Carolina Leaf is another good one. She also has a ton of YouTube videos that are pretty helpful as well.  See You at the Top by Zig Ziglar is great.  And so is Girl Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis.  If you need any other "backup" or resources, let me know. I'm happy to share what I've learned from my experiences.
Thanj you, tried headspace but it didnt seem to work. I will try your other suggestion
Thank you very much for all this

I’ll keep it simple . I’ve been trying really hard , it’s not enough . I’ve been told I’m the cause of people’s problem . I keep getting mistreated , I just want to talk to anyone that can keep me together . Right now I’m on the floor of my room , contemplating it all . But I don’t want to do it again , I just want to feel like taking my life isn’t the answer when I feel like it’s the only one . Either that or I might just become self destructive again and start drinking everyday which for my health will be terrible . So I don’t really have much hope for me . I can go into detail but what’s the point , I just need to stop this heaviness on my chest . I’m getting old of always “realizing” I’m the problem and if I’m the cause of all the problems why don’t I find a solution . I’m gonna be honest .. I’m fucking terrified of the future .  I don’t always want to feel like this ...

The sound of my mom laughing can't exit my mind. I told her I wanted to learn psychology, yet she forced me to learn engineering. I barely survived math in high school. Man it sucks . I don't wanna fail her yet I don't wanna learn this subject. Even if she laughed at my dream , she's still my biological mom. She raised me . But.. I tried talking to her but it doesn't change anything. I love my mom. but I'm not really cut out for math. Do anyone have any tips rather than talk to her slowly?

How old are you?
Engineering Technician then - still get "Engineering" in the title, but with less math!  I still had to take two pre-calc classes (pre-calc 1, pre-calc 2 (taken twice)) and  a calc 1...it SUCKED.     Otherwise - do you.  Whose paying for the school?  If she is, is she prepared for you to retake math classes for engineering if necessary?
Let’s rephrase that question.. are you a minor? If not, put some distance between you and her. She should not be running your life like that. She sounds toxic and controlling. The family you make for yourself as an adult is your actual family. Those are the people who have showed you they support and love you. Look for those people.

When I was a kid I used to make up stories to tell my grandmother. Idk if she believed them but she suffered a very untreated depression and anxiety disorder
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kxqdio/should_i_tell_my_supervisor_im_suddenly_depressed/
This past week I have felt really bad, like my brain is being crushed in one of those junkyard metal smooshers. It's a combination of work stress, personal failure, money shit, interpersonal drama, and physical illness that crept up on me and now I suddenly don't want to get out of bed in the morning. I literally don't want to do anything, eat anything, I can't even pay attention to most TV. Whenever I try to work from home, I just stare at the computer screen.   One of my coworkers said I looked sleepy but besides that, no one has seemed to notice. I said today in a meeting that I was having a really hard week in general, and no one responded. I'm confused. Can they not tell I turned into a zombie overnight or are they just being polite about it? Are they just assuming that I'm upset about politics like everyone else and that I'll get over it with the next news cycle? Do they not care or are not paying attention?   I have a meeting with my supervisor tomorrow and I am wondering if I should tell her plainly "I am depressed, help." We only get Kaiser for mental health insurance, which in the past has only made my mental health worse and not better. Their therapy involves being on a waiting list for 3-5 months, and then being sent to group therapy with like 10 other people where you do exercises from a workbook you could have gotten from Amazon for $10 and then give you a CD of whale sounds to listen to.  Should I say something or no?

I wouldn't recommend using the word depressed unless you really trust her. Sometimes saying that you are depressed can be bad because not everyone understands. For example if she sees you laugh at a funny joke a coworker said she might say "I thought you were depressed. However she could understand and maybe allow you to be more relaxed at work. Personally I would describe how hard it's been lately and ask for a break. Hope this helps and good luck
I'm sorry to hear you are struggling. One of the things I have to keep reminding myself of when I am not feeling great and others don't seem to notice is with depression as with many mental troubles the way we FEEL inside and the way we APPEAR on the outside don't match.  Many of us have been so socially conditioned that we may seem find but could feel like we are dying inside  I do agree with the advice of the other comment saying unless you really trust them don't call it depression you can say you have been diagnosed with a mental illness that is interfering with your work.  On a side not if the therapy isn't helping have you considered trying medication?   Even if you have tried it before and it didn't help there are tons of options and it might be worth looking into trying for your first or even second time.
I treat my depression like I would treat any other chronic illness. Have you talked about this with any healthcare professionals?   I think the move I would recommend is to find support and treatment through your doctor, and keep your manager informed if you are concerned about performance issues or want extra support at work. I don't know if asking her for help is necessarily what I would do.   I have a pretty trusting and open relationship with my manager. I've had success with these types of conversations with my manager a few times over the past few years. I have frame the conversation in these sorts of ways -   "I have Major Depressive Disorder and I am struggling to cope currently with some worsening symptoms. Right now I still feel that I am capable to continue at work, however I wanted to keep you in the loop as at times my focus and concentration can be affected. I would appreciate an open dialogue with you regarding any performance issues as I continue treatment in the coming weeks"  "I'm struggling right now with my chronic mood disorder. I'm going to be meeting with my doctor tomorrow to discuss adjusting my course of treatment. I will be in touch with you and HR if it is determined that I will require any workplace modifications."  "I'm experiencing a relapse in my symptoms and I will need to call in sick today and tomorrow. I have a doctors appointment booked for Wednesday and I will keep you informed from there"

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kxo4qh/dont_want_to_just_sit_around_and_let_my_pets_die/
I’ve had a lot of pets throughout my childhood and most of them have passed, and I’m down to my last few, I have a pug and a chihuahua and in the last couple of months I’ve been trying to spend more time with them then I have in the passed but they don’t seem to like to be around me as much anymore despite my efforts, but that is beside the point  Although both are fairly healthy and are constantly getting love by the rest of my family, it hurts me so much to know they are most likely getting close to the end of their life, of course this is an issue about every pet owner goes through but it pains me even more to know I am sitting around and not doing anything about it, to know that every day it gets closer and closer. I have begun to hate the movement of time more and more these couple months but what can you do about it really. In general what am I supposed to do? Even if I put my heart in soul everyday into finding a cure for the death of my pets, it frankly is an insane goal and quite near impossible, and if by some miracle it were to happen, would that really be a good thing? To find a cure for death? To not allow more life to form?  I don’t want my pets, or any animals to die for that matter, but I also can’t see it being good that they live forever either. No matter how much I think of this issue, I never can find a solution or a decision I feel content with, I always just end up conflicted. Has anyone else felt this way before? Would really appreciate the help, thank you.  I should also add in that those who spend their time to help people in these types of communities are amazing. Thank you for all you do for others.

Death isn't a problem, it's a predicament.  The difference is that *problems* can be solved. Predicaments just.... are.   Death sucks. Loss sucks. I would personally be 100% onboard for "eliminating death", or at least radically improving healthspans for both humans and other animals.  Our pets confront us with the (as of now) inevitable truth of mortality so often, because they live such short lives... It's the worst thing about being an animal lover.   Personally, I don't really buy all the poetic stuff about how death makes life more precious, or lets us appreciate loved ones more. No. It just plain sucks. My feelings of fear and resentment and rage are valid. "Do not go gently..." (the Dylan Thomas poem) resonates more. Or, more radically, look up the fable about "The Dragon Tyrant", by Nick Bostrom.  What *does* sometimes help, for me, is to try to share my animals' mindsets. They live in the present, in the moment. They're not aware that they're going to die! Very probably, they don't even waste any time remembering when they were younger and more spry - dogs so often deal with becoming blind or deaf or losing a limb really well, because they just accept it and adapt, and go on living.   If I let them, they can help me be with them, right here and now.   From a philosophical point of view, only the present moment is ever really real. Everything else is just in our heads. It's always NOW. Okay, so, is there anything good about this Now? Something we can enjoy together? Or is there something I can do (right now!) to make it a bit better?  Maybe the right thing to do right now is to let yourself feel the pain and the fear that comes up when you think of losing them. That's okay.   Maybe, some handful of moments later, it will feel right to take them for a walk, or play with them, or massage them. (Lots of dog massage videos on youtube!)  It can also help sometimes to know that I share these feelings with so, so many other people, the world over. I can feel compassion for them as well as for myself. (and for their animals)
I think at least to me it is a natural feeling to not want death to happen, not wanting to experience the loss of the beings we love, and our own life.  I wish death did not exist, I think it is very sad and I hate it.  I don’t know about the future, but right now I’m sure it’s completely impossible to avoid it and it will probably be like this forever or at least for a long time. Whether or not it would be a good thing to not have death, I don’t think about it. It always felt natural to me as a living being to cling to life, and I can only go so far against my nature. I’m sure the absence of death would bring problems, but I don’t think I have to like something because it is ultimately good. The way I see is we can understand rationally that maybe some things have their function and still hate them. This rational part is just a part of us, not the whole as I see it.

Same here. Even when I’ve been doing better in life I struggle to embrace it or look forward to a future because being miserable and sad and depressed are all I know. It’s like finally getting what you want but you invested too much and you’re just trying to reduce your loses. Like I might win but at what cost. Personally, I just want to be left alone and undo my past but I can’t.  Sometimes you have to think really short term imo. Like thinking too long term just overwhelms me and breaks me down. Maybe it’s the other way around for you.

I'm 20 years old...since two years the most time of my life I spend in my bedroom.  1 friend, 2 people of my family died. I got addicted to benzodiazepines and went to a rehabilitation hospital...but because of the lockdown nothing changed. My family live in another city and so many friends left me, I feel alone but with the time it feels good. I'm also bisexual, I know that since I'm 13 but never talked about that with anyone. (Only to my therapist)  now the second lockdown ist here in germany, sitting here and accepting every day that it's okay to die alone or stay my howl life alone.... I dont know....after one year staying in my thoughts and got also back to benzodiazepines now...  Is this all? Is this the sense of my life? What will happen after death? I don't feel like anyone would care about me (I tried to kill myself once)  My anxiety got so bad, I'm always paranoid and hate myself because I'm skinny. That's why I would never let anyone touch me or things like sexual, because of my shame for my own body. I'm going only outside when I'm going to eat something or when it's dark and not that much people there because I think there would always say things about me because I feel like shit. (Even when I know they don't, its unnerving. )  Also after that long time here alone I dont wanna do anything anymore, I feel disconnected from the world, playing computer games and drinking wine.  I hate this society, the people who life that "normal" life and I hate me, at some point i think like:"Why? Why I can't be normal like them...)  Every morning I wake up and think like:"Shit why I'm still alive.) But if I have a clear mind and I'm not on drugs, I would never kill myself because of my mom....It would ruin her life...  So, have anyone experienced something like that? Sorry for my bad English, I'm german

Do you live alone? Do you have pets? Are you studying?   I am 24 now but I also didn't leave my room for a long time when I was 17. I got into a psych ward and that helped a lot but I have had really bad episodes ever since. Can't really say things are much better now. They might actually be worse but whatever.  I also have those issues with my body, except I'm not skinny, I'm fat. I'm also bi, what's the issue with that?   I don't really have any advice. Just that I feel you, I can relate to all that: feeling disconnected from the world, feeling like other people have normal and relatively good and happy lives and Oh My God why am I like this, why can't I he happy, why don't I feel like that; hating my body and not wanting anyone to see me, feeling worthless, feeling that my life has no purpose. You can message me if you want.
First of all thank you, nice to heat that I am not alone.  I'm afraid that people here are not accepting me like I am...in Germany a lot of people are homophobic...and like I said I dont have a lot friends but I'm too afraid because I was always the straight boy who had also a relationship a girl.  I have no pets and yes I live alone in a apartment with one room...I was studying and ended also my school well! But because of the time when I was in the hospital for rehabilitation, I couldn't end it.
I wish I couldn't relate to so much of this.....   It's so hard to start doing anything "constructive" when we're this far down. Over time (I'm nearly 40, depressed since mid-teens at least) I have learned some strategies and ideas that work for me, some of the time. I try to remember to write them down (when I'm less depressed), so that I can look them up again when I need them most.   Among other things, depression fucks with our memories! And sense of time. It feels like it's always been this way and will continue to always be this way. Not true! Everything changes.   Are there any ways you can be kinder to yourself, today? Can you do something nice for yourself? (Even if you don't feel you deserve it.)  Maybe change your sheets, so you can go back to bed with clean linens? Or if that's too hard, just change your pillowcase?  Maybe use some moisturizer on the dry skin on your elbows or feet?   Or find something you like the smell of (like citrus or a spice or a cosmetic item, or even soap or a cleaner, and just... enjoy that smell, for a few seconds. Sounds kind of dumb, but worth a try maybe?  Can you make sure you drink enough liquids, and try to eat something that contains at least a couple of nutrients?   If it helps or makes a difference at all, I will tell you right now that you deserve to be healthy and to have your needs met. To have good things happen to you. To feel good, even if it's just for a moment.

Hi everyone. First time posting here and looking to see if anyone has any advice. This is not a throw away because I don’t care what people think about me.   I suffer from highly functional depression. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and am currently on medication, which helps, but still have bad days. I have seen a psychologist in the past, middle aged male, that I couldn’t open up to. After seeing him for 2 years I stopped going because of work change. My spouse, primary care, and psychiatrist all urge me to find someone to talk to. I thought long and hard and realized the personality of someone that I could open up to.  With all this being said, is there a good way to search for local therapists online in your area? I tried a few months back and could only find older individuals. I need someone closer to my age (36) as I feel it would allow me to open up more.  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

honestly, the best luck i’ve had has been going through another medical professional i already liked / trusted (my psychiatrist, my primary care, a headache specialist) — that’s been how i’ve found people with personalities + philosophies that were a good match with my own.   unfortunately, in my experience, online databases have often been out-of-date, inaccurate, incomplete, etc... an issue doubly complicated when you need to see who takes your insurance! esp right now, with so many people seeking help, a lot of therapists are very booked up and less responsive to (unreferred/cold-calling) intakes. and, you may still have to “shop” a couple different folks, no matter what.  good on you for identifying what you need + taking the steps to get it. wishing you luck with this tedious-but-necessary step!
I recently found a great therapist through psychologytoday.com. I narrowed it down by the specialty I was interested in then read a few profiles and had two free consultations before picking the one I liked the most. Good luck in your search!
Unfortunately I don't have any tips for how to find them, but I've seen a number of therapists (some for years, some more briefly as part of getting diagnosed or more short-term forms of therapy) and my experience is that it's really, really worth it to keep looking for the ones who feel like a good fit for you.  This is also, unfortunately, really hard work.   Like any other "find the right X for you" endeavour, it's basically a numbers game. Keep looking, use a few criteria to sort initially, and then you will have to do 'interviews' (initial sessions) with a bunch of them.  Those older therapists you found online - have you tried sending them a polite letter asking them to recommend younger colleagues? You'll only need to write it once, and even if just a few of them reply, that could be worth it.   My personal rule of thumb for evaluating new therapists is that anyone who seemed uninterested, or stupid, or who gave me any kind of 'icky' feeling, or made me feel intensely ashamed, were definite nos.   However, the ones who made me feel a little 'anxious' in a 'clean' way - a bit hard to explain, but like I wasn't fooling them? like, they felt very professional, but also quickly had me squirming a bit with a sense that they probably wouldn't let me get away with too much bullshit? Those might be keepers.   The goal is not, of course, to find a therapist you "like" or feel (only) comfortable with. For me, there does need to be a fundamental level of trust, a sense that the person really cares about me. But I will also expect our sessions to be hard work.   Smart, well-read, verbal and high-functioning people are at risk of becoming "good patients" too easily - we pick up the jargon quickly, and (maybe unconsciously) figure out what the therapist wants to hear. We need the ones who are able to cut through all of that obfuscation and get to the heart of things.   It can also be a good idea to talk to your therapist early on about defining specific goals and timelines, or setting a date for an evaluation session.   Some of my most helpful therapists have also been the ones who were very forthright about when they felt I needed to seek out someone else. Therapy can take time, yes, but there should be some type of development or progress (but do note that in many cases, 'progress' here means that you may feel a LOT WORSE, temporarily!), or else you're both wasting your time.
I second psychologytoday.com! My current therapist I've found through the website by choosing my preferences. I think going in with knowing what kind of therapist you'd like is a good first step! A friend also used avocoach.com and they do free matching services and sessions are less than $50!
Dam you for nailing some of it with me. The point about saying what you think they want you to say is what happened with the last guy.  I feel I have a problem wanting to know what my issue is and am constantly researching things to make a determination what it could be. So I often ask questions about general things for me to understand what is wrong versus explaining what is wrong for the therapist to give ideas on how to deal with it.
Yep, that sounds extremely familiar. I have always been at my most comfortable in a learning/student role, and I intellectualize everything. Which is a strength in many ways, but I also need to recognize when that strategy falls short, or at least needs to be supplemented.  I would suggest mentioning that this happened the last time early on with your new therapist. Perhaps also make an agreement that while you can of course ask questions, researching general psychology/psychiatry topics is something you should primarily do on your own time. (Your therapist can suggest sources.)  Beware "paralysis by analysis". We are not there to become shrinks. We are there to deal with our specific problems and get better. Diagnoses and labels may or may not be helpful tools on the way, but I've usually had the best luck focusing on specific behaviors (behavior patterns), emotions, relationships and goals.  The "correct" therapy for you is the one that works. How to know what works? Find some metrics for your own behavior and mental and physical well-being that are meaningful to YOU, and try to track them over time. Don't dismiss the opinions of others (it's apparently very very common for depressed people to be blind to their own improvement or deterioration, while those around them notice that they're clearly getting better/worse), but remember that in the end you have to do this for yourself, not in order to become a better \[role\], or it won't stick and/or generate new issues.  There is a huge paradox with mental illnesses: The patient obviously knows themselves best, and we therefore feel - with some justification! - that we ourselves understand our own problems better than anybody else. Including the professionals. At the same time, the very nature of the disease(s)/maladaptive patterns means that our judgment is inherently compromised.  I haven't found any satisfactory, lasting resolution to this dilemma, although externalizing my own thoughts, ideas and analyses in the form of writing helps to some extent, as does being willing to *experiment* with things my therapist suggests which seems, prima facie, unhelpful in my case. Try it, track it, keep the bits that seem helpful, discard the rest.  I resisted "journaling" for a long time because for some reason I thought it had to be done in a sappy, "dear diary"-type format. Then I had a duh! moment: It's MY journal (or "log" as I usually prefer to think of it), it can take any form I want. Including bullet points or an excel sheet.   And in my experience the *act* of journaling can be useful even if I "fail" at keeping up the habit, or lose/delete/burn the notebook/website, or end up completely changing the system I've been using to track my habit changes/behavior experiments, etc etc. In general I have never regretted jotting down notes on my behavior, thoughts or emotions, regardless of how crude or elaborate the format.  A different strategy for avoiding the analytical trap is look into forms of therapy that use less intellectualizing methodologies - such as ones that are focused on the body (learning to handle emotions through body awareness; emotions are, among other things, physical sensations, and one reason 'negative' emotions can end up walloping us over the head can be that we suck at recognizing their more subtle manifastations), art therapy (that very phrase makes me throw up in my mouth a little, but it does work for some people!), or meditation/visualization tapes that may use metaphors and/or story formats to 'sneak' insights past the PFC, so to speak.   For instance, I have actually had some limited but possibly crucial success with "inner child" type stuff, although it took a helluva lot of work to get there - this modality initially felt incredibly cringe and stupid to me and I had to keep looking for approaches that didn't just make me roll my eyes constantly.  Bottom liine, "if it's stupid, but it works, it's not stupid." We know incredibly little about human psychology, still. The disciplines that deal with it are frankly little better than pseudoscience much of the time. Most studies show that the specific school of therapy matters almost not at all compared to the specific rapport ("therapeutic alliance") between an individual patient and doctor/therapist/counselor.   I find that *extremely* frustrating, but it is what it is. Again, I've personally had the best results just tracking what seems to work - I don't necessarily have to understand why (although I would definitely prefer to!!). And, what works for me at any one point in time may well not work for other people, or even for myself at an earlier/later date.   I wish you the best of luck!

Is there any way to seek online therapy? I really don't want to talk to my parents about my issues, since they have their own. It's all getting so overwhelming and unbearable that I can't focus on school, which I really need to do, but instead I think about suicide and other bad things during lessons. I can't get out of bed without listening to rap for half an hour and I spend far too much time staring into one spot on the wall.

I'm so tired... I can't seem to be doing better. Every time I think "woah! I'm actually overcoming my depression!!" something comes and makes me even more Depressed than I used to be... I don't know how, but.... I've been thinking about suicide since forever, not a day, or a month..or a year.. Or a few years I remember damn well how I was a 9 years old thinking how my family would be better off without me.. I... I don't know what to do. I feel, very lost. I feel like I've lived all my life since I was 9 YO and until now just because I though I have a "purpose" in life.. But I have none. I'm never good enough. And none of my family will actually look at me and think "This is my child/sibling!!" they always think I'm a disappointment.. Honestly, all I wish for is.. I wish they cared.. I wish I was good enough. I have a doctor appointment next week, and even thought it's not an incurable illness They just keep shaming me and shaming me... I wish I was perfect... I wish I was loved...   Sorry.. I know what I wrote just now is a mess.... That's just how my head is right now. Thanks for reading this i guess...

it feels like everything's been getting worse lately. when the new year started i just felt hopeless, there was an this talk of how much better the year would be and how all the problems would just be fixed, but nothing ever works like that. i just felt exhausted, i still felt unmotivated to do anything, the days still felt like slogs, and i still felt down.  it's so hard to do anything. i want to draw but i just can't find it in me sometimes. i have so many gifts i need to draw for my friends for brithdays that were months ago but i just can't do it, everything feels so sluggish no matter how much i want to do something sometimes i just can't. when i get a chance to just sit down and play a game sometimes i can and sometimes i can't, i got really invested in one but after those thirty hours were up that was it, the escape was gone and now i don't feel like doing anything again. i've been going on bike rides almost daily for a few months now and it's nice to get out but it doesn't seem like it's helping much anymore, i still just feel down.  my school's been doing a hybrid thing, we go in a couple days and online the others. after about a month of only online i finally got back in school and it was awful. everything was so empty, only two of my friends ever went to in person school and they were gone, all the friends i started to talk to more since evrryone else left were also gone, so i just wandered around the hallfways alone looking miserable enough that even the big popular groups noticed, all two of them that were left anyways. i barely talked the whole day, teachers barely taught and when they did i couldn't find it in me to pay attention. my head was a mess, i kept thinking just terrifying thoughts and just wanted to disappear the whole time, no one would ever notice it i were gone there, they would just see the class size go from six people to five. i switched to fully online yesterday, at least then i can talk to my friends during classes and do things i actually want to during free time.  it just all feels so pointless. i've always had trouble doing things out of passion, hobbies and everything, but it's just been getting worse lately. all of this has been building up so much that having a stressful weekend and a very poorly timed vacation (during a pandemic of all things) was enough to completely set me off. i want to enjoy things again so fucking much but whebever i start to it feels like there's always something getting in the way. i want to draw, just enjoy wasting my time playing games, work on videos again, and keep working on that story idea but i just can't. none of it ever gets better, i just want something to improve but everything's been going downhill.  even when this is all over and im with my friends again it's all just temporary distractions, cause when i'm home it's right back to my room to try and draw but never start or finish anything. that video scripts never getting finished. my friends are never getting their gifts. all cause im too pathetic to even do the things i want to, when does it get better? im getting nothing out of any of this, i just want things to be good.

I posted yesterday, but things keep getting worse.  So my spouse and I were given a 30 day move out notice because our depression mess was too much for them. It’s not even that’s bad, and we’ve been actively trying to get better, but they wouldn’t work with us at all.  My spouse called her mom today to wish her a happy birthday and her mom ended up asking a bunch of questions about our plan and what we’re doing, and my fiancée broached the subject of her possibly taking our cats. Her mom proceeded to freak out at her and say that she was being disrespectful and then yelled at my spouse for being manipulative when she started to cry. She then said that if we really can’t find anything that we can move in with her, but obviously that’s not something that any of us want.   My spouse is currently sobbing in the bathroom, barely able to move, and I just feel so utterly fucking helpless and afraid. She told me that she wants to kill herself so fucking bad but that she can’t because that would be unfair to me. I worry every fucking day that this will be the day that her will to live outweighs that guilt she feels for leaving me. I have for a long time. I used to come home when I worked an earlier shift from her and check the closet to make sure I didn’t find her hanging there, and that was even when things were going relatively okay.  I don’t know how we’re supposed to do this. How do we get an apartment if we’re being kicked out in the middle of our lease? No one will want us with this on our record. I’m terrified of if we have to go to her mom’s. I would suggest that just she move back in (because I think part of her mom’s issue is with me) and I find a couch to crash on until we can figure it out, but I worry that her mental state would get worse being at her mom’s without me, dealing with her mother’s emotional abuse every day.  I’m terrified. I feel like I’m spiraling out of control. My spouse’s mental health is so much worse than mine so I’m the one who always has to be strong and supportive, but I’m losing it. I’m losing my grip on things. I don’t have anyone to go to. I don’t really have many friends because my depression worsened after college and I lost touch with almost everyone I was close to. I’m going to crack. I’m afraid. I’m so fucking afraid.

Hey, I don't know if I have any advice, just wanted to say that I feel for you. The situation sounds like the last thing you need right now, and I'm sorry you have to go through that. Are they allowed to kick you out just because of  your mental health? That's fucked up.  Try to take a breath. Let it all flow away for a bit, try to get some distance. Then, consider if there are any other options for you. Buy a van and live in there until you find something better? Reach out to friends to see if they have any contacts to get a new lease? (Perhaps they can recommend you to the landlord). Move somewhere else where the housing system is different? I don't know about your life situation so these are just some things on the top of my head, no idea if they're suitable here or not. If your friend was in a similar situation, what advice would you give to him/her?  Take care of each other, just like you do. And you don't always have to be strong, it's okay to cry and let it out. It's okay to feel hopeless. But remember that it can only go up from the bottom, and it will. You can make it through this.
You're in a really scary situation right now. No wonder you're anxious and depressed and overwhelmed!  You need more support. Ideally from someone else IRL, but if not or until that's possible, at least from yourself. You deserve it. Nobody can be "the strong one" all the time.   Did it help at all to write this, and to know at least a couple of people read it and wished they could help you?  Would some kind of journaling practice work for you, do you think? Sometimes I've experimented with writing in two voices, one 'me' and one who is an idealized mentor/coach/parent/etc.  Literally writing out what I wish someone were there to tell me.   Some people like to use a Future Self for this - imagine yourself older and wiser and in a better place, and what that you would tell the current you.   I sometimes use a Non-Violent Communication framework if I have a hard time verbalizing my needs, that might be something to look into if you have the spoons for it. Specifically focusing on communicating/actively empathizing with *yourself*.  Could you brainstorm ways to support yourself and show yourself more self-care and self-compassion? Even if it's tiny things - taking a moment to enjoy a beverage, or literally hugging yourself (cringe, I know! but don't knock it unless you've tried it...) doing them deliberately can have an effect. It's like reassuring the most scared part of yourself that it's okay to need support and help and love. Self-validation, if you will.  ("Self-compassion" by Kristin Neff, especially the audiobook if you can access that, is pretty good for giving 'permission' to be kinder to yourself. You could also try searching for podcasts she's been interviewed on.)  My other thought, which is obviously really really tricky to advise an internet stranger about, is to try to figure out ways in which you and your spouse can support \*each other\* better.   Another concept from NVC comes to mind, which is that when you ask someone for support/empathy, only ever ask for something they can do right then and there. Not things that are in the past or the future.  For instance, "Could you listen to me just vent for a while without interrupting?" or asking for a hug, or for help with \[specific task\] right in that moment.   Not "I wish you'd give me more space sometimes" or "Please remember to \[whatever\]".   This could be completely off-target, but if you could ask your spouse for tiny, immediate, very specific acts of support (that you sincerely want, and then sincerely respond to), maybe that would be a way to help her feel like she's doing something "right" and worthwhile, even if she feels like shit (worthless? or just in horrible pain?) otherwise.   Or, could you write down how you feel and show it to her? Maybe make the point that the only thing you need her to do is to read it and to "let" you have these feelings (if that rings true for you), that she doesn't have to "fix" anything and you're not expecting her to suddenly get better or something. She might be aware on some level that you're forcing yourself to be (appear) "the strong one", and that that's really hard for you.  I hope this jogs something in your brain. And I hope you keep reaching out and looking for help. (I know doing that takes energy, too.)  I'm not a hugger IRL, but sending you virtual air hugs if you want them!
I mean, they’re not technically kicking us out for our mental health. They’re kicking us out for breech of lease, which includes housekeeping and shit. But living in a state where the tenant protections are limited fucking sucks.  We’re also broke. We already live paycheck to paycheck. I was out of work for a couple of months last year and we fell behind in a lot of things because of it. It’s just been one thing after another. Every time I think that things can’t possibly get worse, I get slapped in the face with something else.  I’m sorry. I’m just at such a loss and I’m doom rambling. Thank you for your kind words. I legit started crying while reading your comment because I finally felt like someone supported me, even if it’s just an internet stranger.
Thank you. I really appreciate all of your advice. I’ll definitely look into some of the sources you suggested.  Typing it out has helped. Getting it out helped. I may try keeping a journal or something.  My spouse and I have been trying to support each other through this. It’s just hard when she has her mother being so absolutely shitty to her all the time. And her mom does this any time something is going wrong. If my spouse starts crying, she’s “trying to manipulate” her. But our relationship is as healthy as it can be with both of us being mentally ill. We’ve been saying “I love you,” a million times, holding each other, trying to point out the things that are still good (like our cats, who have noticed the recent change and have been extra affectionate the past couple days).
You don't have to apologize, this is a support forum where you can rant all you want. Too bad the ideas didn't help, but you'll figure something out. And yeah, I totally understand how mental health problems AND working is making housekeeping hard (or even impossible). I don't even work/study at the moment and still have problems with it. I'm so glad I could help you feel a little better.
I’m so used to putting everyone else before me, because I know that I’m not always a good person or an easy person to love. I feel like I need to do everything I can to keep people happy. I shower them with gifts so I’m worth the trouble. I try to take their burdens away so they won’t notice how much of a burden I am myself. And I know it’s not a healthy way of thinking about things, but it’s what my brains says to me all the time. I’m terrified of fucking up. I’m scared to talk to my family about anything because I was the golden child for so long, just by the nature of all of my cousins being MAJOR screw-ups, so my family put up with me being gay and a weirdo and insane because like, hey, at least I wasn’t addicted to meth or had my kids taken away by child services. But I feel like I’m letting them down more and more. So I don’t tell them things. So all of our crisis support comes from my spouse’s family, and I worry that they’re judging me and think I’m holding her back, even though I’m the one with her during her panic attacks and meltdowns and episodes of suicidal ideation that are sometimes caused by them and the shitty things they say to her.  I was getting better before the pandemic. I started medication and finally stopped thinking about purposing running my car off the road every day on my way to work. I feel like I’ve lost all of the progress I was making. I’m back to being unable to do anything, just like before. Can’t read, create, open my emails, clean, etc. It’s like there’s this constant feeling of electricity buzzing in my brain, sapping my energy and keeping me from thinking straight. I’d say I want to go back to feeling like myself, but I think I’ve been depressed so long that I legitimately don’t know who that is? Who is Kel without depression? Who could she have been? I don’t know. I wish I did.
I'm sure the people around you can see what kind of person you are: loving and doing everything in your way to help the people around you. I don't think they see you as a burden, not even if you said no sometimes or didn't help as much as you do. You'll still be you, and people who loves you knows this too. I've always been a high expectation child and only recently told my father (who is very focused on success, education and money) about some of my problems. It wasn't easy for him to understand, but in the end it helped and I feel like we got closer from this and that I can be more honest with him. I didn't say everything, just some of it, to make it a less huge step to take. I'm not saying this is something you should do, but it's worth considering. Having people around me that knows what I'm going through is crucial for me to cope with it. And I know hiding things take so much energy, especially things like this. You're not a bad person because you don't feel well, and I try to keep this mindset to remind me that this is an illness that I'm fighting, not some personality trait.   Eventually, the pandemic will be defeated. We already see mass vaccinations going out, so it's only a matter of time. Who you are without depression, is probably not exactly the same as before. But that's also the beauty of it. Our experiences in life form who we are, and I'm sure you will come out strong on the other side. We can also, to some extent, choose who we want to be. So even if you dont know who Kel without depression is, you'll get to know her with time, and notice all the beautiful little things about you that make you who you are.

This week I decided to create a Discord Server to have meetings with people like me and so many others who struggle everyday with mental health. There is structure, and I plan to have that stability I have been looking for in other groups. We would discuss over different perspectives and medias try to understand mental health better and improve. Please check it out and provide feedback if you can!

Hi :'( I don't know what to say. I'm depressed due to my OCD and because I failed everything in my life. I'm seeing a psychologist to work about the OCD issue, but about depression little has be done since then.  I'm not satisfied with my study field. I studied maths at university because I was pretty good at it during middle and high school. But maths at a university level is very different, way more theoretical, lots of proves to remember, sometimes several pages to memorise. It has just become too difficult for me. I discovered my real passion for languages and linguistics at a time when I was already engaged in maths. I tried to continue into maths to make my parents happy, but this is not what I wanted.  With my mental disorders and loss of interest in maths, I can't manage my life anymore. The only thing which could keep me happy and shining was travelling, but it's much complicated during Covid. That pandemy really destroyed the few things I still had: visiting our huge cultural patrimony and meet friends to do activities.  I'm sad because I'm 24, almost 25 and have achieved almost nothing. I have a LDR with a girl and she wants me to have a good career plan, and me to be rich and have money. I just can't think of solutions, I feel pressured...

Oh I remember seeing your pre-cleanup post earlier today! I bet this feels soooo amazing, I honestly feel like there aren’t many feelings that compare to this one! Great work :)
HELL YEAH GJJJ
This is such a transformation! I'm honestly proud of you, for what it's worth. And you have inspired me to clean up my own apartment, it's not that bad but just the thought of doing it drains my energy. Seeing a result such as yours counters that though, it makes me think "I WANT THIS TOO"!
That’s so awesome!! Keep it up!
Beautiful! Best feeling in the world when you go do something then come back to a clean room! Congrats keep the motivation going!
I love your bed!!!
Awesome!! Huge accomplishment!
Congrats!! Good job, keep it that way. Try to don't let so much time pass the next time
This deserves all of the upvotes
Good job man! Keep it up :)
YAY CONGRATS!! You are amazing!!
So amazing and so motivating! Congrats!

So proud of you!!!
Your room is so pretty and comforting . Good work in arranging your room :)
You did it. Good job I’m so proud of you
Congratulations. This post made my day :)
Wow! I remember the Before picture. Congrats
I don’t even know you but I’m so proud of you. Something seemingly so simple like cleaning your room can feel like the most difficult task in the world when you’re suffering from depression, but you beat the depression and did it! Keep the momentum going!
Awesome job!!  It looks soooo much better, I bet it helps with your mood!
Very very proud! You're AMAZING and this bless our hearts
Looks really good and cozy! You’re awesome!!
r/cozyplaces
Yay!! I too tackled and cleaned my bedroom today. I hauled out six large black garbage of trash. I’m so proud and refuse to shame myself because it’s not my fault completely. I’m sending you a big high five!!
Omg is that a ferret cage?
It will be great if you vacuumed the floor rug/ carpet or whatever it’s called! And I won’t deny that you have done a good job 👏
Keep it uppp!!!
I am so so proud of you!!
Awesome job, you did amazing. I bet it feels like such a relief now its done.
I'm so proud of you!! Depression makes a million excuses in minds to not do something. I'm so glad you didn't listen to it! :D
Omg, so proud of you!!
Noice!!!
Good work! Congrats!!
Fuck yeah and who the fuck is cutting onions in the car
You have achieved 😎 Well done
Looks amazing, well done x
Great job 🙏🏽🥲💕
r/JordanPeterson
Make it to supper. Then to breakfast. Then to lunch. That’s my little strategy.
Yes look at that floor!
And you have such a nice room !!
Who's mustache is that?
this is so dope :)
Looks great! Your room is super cute too
Awesome job,You’re doing pleasant! Keep up the good work!
How cute!!
I didn't see your before post, but I'm sad to say that my place has got to look worse or at least as bad. I'm really depressed and not sleeping so taking a short nap during the day and then very tired. Day after day in this mess. I feel seriously depressed anyway.
Congratulations!  You have motivated me to keep trying to get my apartment in check my friend.  Keep up the good work!
I’m so sorry but what did you do?   Congrats to whatever it was !!!!
This looks absolutely fantastic.
you dropped your unusually large moustache on the floor
It feels so good! I cant stop smiling
Making up random words (GJJJ) and screaming at OP in your comment is not appropriate. This could trigger there depression even more. Be careful what you say and stop being selfish (we know you only posted this comment in the hopes that OP would gold you)
You got this! Push past the first 5 minutes and honestly it gets easy again, even a bit enjoyable
Fantastic job! I'm proud of you too! That's right dont you dare let your brain sour this moment, you deserve the right to feel nothing but great about it. Great job internet friend!
> I’m so proud and refuse to shame myself because it’s not my fault completely.   Thank you for saying this.  Sometimes it’s hard for me not to blame myself 100% for my cluttered apartment, even thought I know it’s my depression that keeps me from really tackling it.  It’s amazing how such a mental disease can ruin your motivation so much.
Chinchilla, his name is ghost :)
Hahaha XD it's a feather cat toy, the only acceptable floor clutter
You too! You got this!!
Lol I cleaned my room! The first real clean its had since I move in over a year and a half ago ☺️
Super happy for u!! 🎉✨😊
Are you a troll or just fucking dumb

What do you guys do when feeling down? Should I go out for a walk, do some sort of action, or something productive? I’ve been feeling more down that usual probably due to finals and overthinking about simple things. Anything I can do to feel a bit better?

I recently found a new site that’s been helping me in days like this, it’s called “window-swap”, I’ve been making myself a cup of tea/coffee and putting this on the tv and just allowing myself to be in this other persons reality for a bit. Walks are always helpful as well as journaling all the bad away ripping out the page and burning it! (I like little rituals) I’m sending you love today friend!
This is pretty much how Depression works. Just remind yourself that how you really feel is not what Depression makes you feel. Feeling down is a symptom and it has no basis in what you may be going through at that moment. I know it sounds hard, and it is, but it will get you through this.
Everyone's different, honestly. Try different things, and keep some kind of notes. Think of it as a science experiment.   The classic go-tos include exercise, sunlight, nature/animals, reaching out to people you like/love, setting small (or even tiny) achievable goals and celebrating them, journaling.... The specifics, though, will probably be unique to you.  The tricky part is that even when you figure out some strategies that usually help (often they will seem obvious to your non-depressed self), you may very well completely forget them the next time you're depressed.   Hence, written reminders.   And yeah, sometimes there's no reason. I like to think of moods and energy levels as my "brain weather". This has a couple of connotations: One is that I can't necessarily predict it (how I feel), or directly change it. However, I *can* adapt (use an umbrella or put on a warm coat, so to speak) and make the best of things, considering the meteorological conditions.   Also, just like weather, it will eventually change. Even when it doesn't feel like that.

I was planning on killing myself yesterday I made a goodbye post and everything but I just couldn’t do it i can’t even kill myself I’m a fucking avoidant failure. I’ve been cleaning everything in my room and bathroom all day and yesterday before I do it. I just got into a fight with my mom she just thinks I’m a lazy even though I have depression meds that she took me to get. Oh well just another triggering thing to push me to it. I hope I get enough courage soon

Hey, I don't know you and i don't know your struggles. I just want to say that you existing as you are is so unlikely to happen ever again. You just as you are is never going to happen. Your sadness, pain, joys, love, fear, and personal consciousness will only exist right now in this time. I know the world seems like shit right now, but your existence is important even if your brain says otherwise. You are here and you can find meaning in this life. You want to find meaning and help. I know that one day you will be able to help someone else. I don't know you but I love you. I want you to exist. I want you to come out of the darkness one day. But right now I want you to choose to stay. Try to break up the days into small pieces. Find some little things to stay for. I stayed for my cat. Then I found that I could stay for other reasons like I always wanted to make a large painting that I could hang on my wall. Then I realized that I could stay to help animals that get left behind. Then I realized that I could stay for me. It will take time and it will not be easy, but you are worth it.

I have no actual friends. I don’t mean that as an exaggeration. The only people I communicate with on the daily are coworkers while at work, my mother, and what few people actually message me back on Facebook. I’ve been told by my wife I need friends. Yet I can’t make them as easily as I did decades ago.  I have a bad personality so I’m told. Which makes things cyclical. I push people away. I build walls. I’m a jerk. And over all I’m a horrible human being in recovery of being an a**hole.  I’m partially depressed because I’m lonely. I’m lonely because I’m depressed. When I meet somebody I come on way too strong because I’m so desperate for that kind of attention. And every time I fail I end up even more insecure about myself and those around me.   I hate this existence so badly that all I ever wonder is when it’s going to end. I’ve long since passed the point of hoping for a better day ahead. I’m lost and idk what to do anymore.

How can someone be socially strong if they have the weight of depression pressing on them constantly? I suppose it varies by the severity of the depression.

From freshman year to sophomore year I’ve made nothing but 90s and 100s in all of my classes. Right now I’m in my junior year and I have no motivation for school. I dont care for school it doesn’t make me happy. In middle and elementary school teachers would always criticize me and call me dumb and slow, they told me the only thing I could ever achieve in the future is working at a fast food restaurant. My mom sometimes would call me dumb too. I guess you could say it stuck? I started doing well in the beginning of highschool because I didn’t want my mom to see me as a disappointment anymore. It was a struggle grinding 7+ hours everyday and now I feel like i cant do it (at least for now) anymore. Its the end of the first semester and I still have 16+ assignments to do. Normally I’d be freaking out but I dont care.

I’m not in high school but I know one thing from being in eighth grade, it’s that if someone makes you thing “I need to work harder and harder to impress so and so” then you need to take a break every once in a while dude just play Minecraft don’t over work yourself it’s not healthy at least that’s what I think anyway you don’t have to listen but that’s my advice
I definitely can relate to not wanting to do it anymore or feeling unmotivated. And I'm not very good at advice so take this with a grain of salt. But I was always taught that whatever anyone thinks about you is not your business so don't let it take up space in your mind. Its not your responsibility to make someone think positively of you. My take away from that is the only person that you need to like you is you. (As cliché as that sounds, but it's true) I'm sorry so many adults in your life have failed to uplift you. I know its hard to deal with negativity but you hold all the power within you to change that internal dialog. This is gonna sound silly, but try to make a list of all the things you like about yourself and start talking positively about yourself. Tell yourself that you are worth the work. Its not about the assignments, it's about the little voice in your head echoing those hurtful words. You are worth the effort and the only one who will benefit from continuing is you. You got this and I'm rooting for you :)
I appreciate that, I really do. I will take that advice for future reference but for now, my struggle is I cant seem to obtain even a little bit of drive to do my work. Thank you again for the advice have a beautiful life

I’m sitting here crying while writing this. I feel so incredibly depressed today. My mother was visiting and she left today and now I feel so alone. It’s basically just my one year old and I. Her father/my boyfriend doesn’t get home until 5pm and has to be at work at 5am. I’m alone all day. I sit here in the playpen with her watching tv, then I feel immense guilt for focusing so much on the tv. But I’m also 4 days sober because my drinking got pretty bad. There’s nothing to do and no where to go because it’s the winter in the middle of a pandemic. My friends are all too busy for me. They all have jobs and their own lives. I love my daughter more than anything but I’m seriously depressed and afraid. I have a doctors appointment soon so I hope they can help...

Deep breath mama. You are doing amazing. I’m not a mother myself but have watched many of friends become one and this is a story I have heard from every single one of them. If you aren’t already I would highly recommend a mommy group for like minded mothers. Lots of my girlfriends have found friends they can FaceTime with and keep each other company to talk about the struggles of being home with a little one. You are doing hard work alone that used to be done by entire villages. This is no easy feat, tonight (if you can) take a nice long shower with your favorite song playing and thank yourself for showing up everyday, even when it’s not easy. I’m sending you strength 🙏🏽

If where you live had lockdowns, it is possible you were not able to interact with your friends in the way that you are accustomed to.  Making it so the thing you and your friends bond over was not possible, and thusly you and your friends friendship became less enjoyable

I wish I had advice, truth is im feeling very similar. The only thing that has helped me is to be very gentle with myself. When I feel I need to do something and I have that paralysis I just tell myself to move my fingers, then my hands, then my feet. You get the idea but that stops me sitting staring into space. I find being busy helps or I will listen to books on audible so im listening and not thinking. Hope this helps feel free to message if you need someone to talk to xx

Hey dear friends,  I‘m suffering from depression, social anxiety and with them cognitive deficits since I was 15 years old. I recognized my mental condition (mood, motivation etc) and my symptoms of my depression and social anxiety, strangely, are slightly better and eased out when I have a empty stomach / when I‘m fasting.   Often I only eat dinner (but then a big meal to gain the calories I need) as my overall mood is not heavily but recognizably slightly better when I have a empty stomach.  So my questions now are:  • Did you experience the same? Does fasting and having a empty stomach improve your mental condition? • Are there any scientific reasons for this phenomenon I experience as I know that alternatively many people feel better when they ate something or don‘t have a empty stomach. • What are the physiological advantages of fasting from waking up until dinner? • Are there any psychological advantages of fasting from waking up until dinner? What might be the scientific and neurobiological reason and mechanism behind that?

Dude fasting is NOT GOOD FOR YOU no matter what reason don’t fast it’s really big good trust me I tried fasting and it SUCKED the main reason why was because I was gaining a lot of weight got bullied and STILL DO not for my weight just cus they wanna bully me I guess  I tried fasting for a couple of days sucked never wanna do it again I usually eat when I’m actually hungry, but you shouldn’t only eat dinner you should  at least eat lunch ya know and trust me don’t fast it’s unhealthy if you want an empty stomach that’s fine (for only breakfast tho) usually I don’t eat breakfast I eat lunch and dinner tho

A few years ago I was abruptly out of a serious relationship. I couldn't breath, I couldn't go to work. I missed her so much. My daily routine revolved around her. I did try to end my life. Twice. Like you I had other issues but her leaving was too much to bare. What really helped turn things around was constantly reminding myself she wasn't the love of my life she isn't magical or special. My existence doesn't depend on anyone or anything. I started small tasks to help myself get up again. Eating an apple a day. Reading some books. Even if I didn't clean my room I'd do my bed. Crying even when I didn't really want to just to let the emotions out. I wrote songs in my head to try express myself. The biggest factor is time. I reached the point that now when I see her I don't feel anything. Start doing activities. I'm sure there's hobbies or skills you always wanted to try. So them. Try running when your feelings are strong. But your heart into running. You'll feel better. I know you probably don't want to get out of bed but do it out of anger or frustration. Just do it for yourself. Your life might depend on it
1: I recognize how it may feel like she is the most perfect girl for you -- but the more people you meet and the more people you get to know intimately, the more you start to realize that there are dozens (if not hundreds) of women who will make you insanely happy, are presently single, and within a 2 hours drive of where you live today.  2: For me, the biggest thing that helped me stave off suicidal thoughts was being reminded that I wasn't crazy or insane for having those feelings -- it's just acting on those feelings that is "unhealthy".
I've had a similar experience. Furst off give yourself time and remind yourself that you don't need to have a gf to be happy with yourself. Do things you enjoy to and just try to focus on improving as a person and getting better mentally. Depression can be devastating and not focusing on myself but my crush hasn't helped me.

Hi so I'm 16 and my friends and I booked a week long vacation during summer. They're all working and have enough money to go, but the issue is that I don't. I've been diagnosed with depression a while back, but it's been getting worse and worse and my therapist is considering putting me on antidepressants. It's pretty uncommon in my country to be prescribed antidepressants at 16, only in severe cases so idk what to think about all of this. I really want to go on that trip, but I just don't have the energy for a job right now. I've talked to my friends about this, but they don't understand. They told me it would be good distraction. Yeah fuck that I'm so exhausted after a school day how am I EVER gonna be able to get a job? Has anyone has this issue? Please help

I was 16 and struggled too. I didn't see a doctor or got medications. I had no choice but to work. It felt horrible at first. It was frustrating how much I hated myself and the situation. But I ended up really loving it. The money was awesome to have after the expenses and to be honest I never had friends to hang out with anyway. Try the medication. It will make everything much easier to handle. As an adult I tried them when I got worse and it really made a huge difference. People tell you all these bad stories but it's nothing like that. Depends on what you take but the doctor knows what he's doing and he would never give you something that would harm you
hi! i (now 21) had a huge mental break down when i was 16/17 my junior year. it took a huge toll on my life and school and relationships and i eventually tried to get help thru my school psychiatrist. she had me go to a psychiatrist outside of the school who gave me antidepressants. to be exact i was put on fluoxetine which is supposed to be like prozac i guess? just the knock off brand so it was cheaper. it didn’t make me happy, it made me a zombie. it made it harder for me to feel emotions in general. sometimes i felt happier but then sometimes i felt like nothing at all. i just didn’t care.i eventually stopped taking them maybe 6 months later. i eventually got better but dealing with depression is two steps forward one step back.try the medication and see if you like it but don’t force yourself into it bc that’s what they say will help. it affects every person differently ESPECIALLY teens who are still developing.maybe ask for a smaller dosage.as for getting a job i got one the summer before senior year and i really enjoyed it.sometimes it sucked getting up and going but it gave me a sense of purpose and responsibility. maybe try it? idk if you would be interested in babysitting but you wouldn’t have to do it super often and it pays good most of the time.my first job was a store in the mall and i really thrived there but it’s not for everyone. stick to a very part time position and see how it goes or maybe take a temp job. if you can’t handle it then you can’t and that’s that. maybe you could try something online. i sell stuff on depop and i enjoyed it when i was out of work for a few months. you can try selling clothes you don’t wear anymore or stuff you make. anyways i hope this helps! it you won’t always feel bad but you won’t always feel good. it’s okay to not be doing well of performing the same as everybody around you. we’re not all built the same.
Thank you! I hope they'll prescribe me something!

For instance I live in the south and am only a 2 hour drive from Savannah, GA and in the past have found that driving there for a day trip often helps me heal my mind and spirit. I also live near some beaches and enjoy going in the morning for walks though COVID has caused me to not do so in the past year which was frustrating. Do you guys have any special places or destinations to go to that tend to help ease your depression?

39 male here. I suffer from severe anger problems, so much so it has basically cut me off from anyone in life. Imagine the red guy from inside out mixed with Scrooge. I’m not going to downplay it, that’s exactly how I am. Is anger and rage a form of depression in men? I feel like I got to this point naturally through environmental conditions so it’s hard to see it as a chemical response.

I'm 23 so I don't know if anything i say means much but I think you're right. It feels more comfortable to be angry. Like I'm not exposed or vulnerable. I don't really understand it but it's more comfortable to turn confusion and anxiety into anger. Is that what you mean?
u/emotionalfortitude, I'd recommend finding a counselor...to help you dig deeper into the root cause of your anger.  Anger almost always is a result of a deep hurt by someone or something, that has happened in your life.  The counselor will help you identify that deep hurt and work through it.  Where as it could be biochemical (hormones), the therapist could also help you determine that too, but likely it is due to a deep rooted hurt from your past.  It doesn't usually have anything to do with your current situations where you get angry, although the people are the victims of your anger.   Another way is to join a small group (gender like, men with men, women with women) and admit your issue and have time to talk it out.  Often times recovery groups help reveal the deep rooted causes.  I'm in a Celebrate Recovery (church based, for all types of hurts, habits and hang ups) which also has helped me heal from my co-dependency, anger and control issues.  I'd recommend finding a CR Group too as they are all over the world and very effective.  Best to you!

Hi friends.. this is my very first post here..   I'm 32, I have been ancomputer science engineer for 2 years but I have not practiced the profession .  I think that I'm a loser.   I've always tought I'm usless. I think that I have depression from 12 or 13 years old.   I'm feel alone... I feel fat, ugly, alone. I was bullied at school for years.   I think that I hate myself.     I live with my parents. my mom has a respiratory disease an my dad is alcoholic.    With the passage of time, I have lost all my interests, from music (I play guitar), computers, video games, reading. etc.  I have been single for 1 year in a relationship of 2 months. I fell in love and she left me.    I feel that I'm not enough for any type of relationship. I have no real friends. The only thing that unites me to this world is a beautiful dog.  I'm scared, lately I just think about hurting myself, cutting myself again or taking a rope and ending it all at once. I had treatment for 2 years with prozac and I feel that it never influenced me.   I have tried to change my life but sooner or later I lose all motivation and abandon all expectations to improve, I feel that I simply cannot improve my life   All the people walk away from me. I feel tired and have no strength.  thanks for reading this to whoever does.

I read it. I’m sorry. We all need continuous support to help us change, and you are in a very challenging home environment. What aspect of your life would you like to change the most right now?
You will first need to decide that you are lovable and worth pursuing, because you are. There are obviously aspects of your life you are dissatisfied with. Take each of those issues and work on them one at a time. Maybe playing guitar is most important to you. Start playing again every day until it begins to bring you satisfaction. You said you feel fat. Do something about it. Change your eating habits and add some exercise to your daily routine. Just walking around the block will be enough for starters. You were bullied in school, it's time to get over that. See a therapist for the help you need with this. Next go out and find a job in your field of preference. One step at a time, one goal at a time. Don't give up, you are not a loser. Losers are quitters and since you are asking for help you are not quitting.
You remind me of my best friend Jason. The parents, the brain the guitar. Problem is he walked away from me and into a bottle.     I also suffer from depression and ptsd. I also work I’m an industry that can cover alcoholism so most days for me were a struggle. And some still are. These last few weeks are.  I don’t know if I can help but I’ll try.     First off the The Neil Brenen 3 Mics helps maintain me. YouTube music for free.  All of 2019 I was having ptsd flash backs of 2001 and by the time September was coming on and I thankfully found Something that works. I don’t have experience with drugs and never took them till. The fist 2 I got were really bad. Once caused suicidal thoughts and another didn’t let me feel happy or sad. Final,y I realized from 3 mics that I’m motivated by completing tasks. So I asked for adderall to help keep me focused and motivated. And it’s been working till this past December. I’m trying to readjust to some work changes but I’m gonna stick with it and try to find breathing room and get back into a positive pattern because that was keeping me happier than I had been in years.  Also I’ve given up on keeping “friends” I ain’t even mad anymore about it because they all end up abusing me. I’ve got my cat and a stray I feed. And frankly with my wife who isn’t very supportive I don’t notice the difference much. Acquaintances are fine. No one needs to know the real me. And in my spare time I make are another task that keeps me on the better side.   I hope this rambling helps. I’ve held that knife to my wrist too and I realized it’s a cry for help no one will answer (back in 2k1) so I decided to stop looking for help and do it my do it myself. I’ve had ups and downs but when I stopped looking for help I ended up on the right path.   You can do it. You can beat the dragon named depression.
Thanks...   I feel that I'm not good for anything, so..   I would like to believe in myself but I have no idea how
Thanks for  read and write..   It's so hard for me to do something.  I usually get demotivated very quickly trying to do something to change my life, but I want to live..
Believing in yourself is a very big goal and is the result of lots of small wins. What was a small win yesterday?

I feel you.. I'm at that point where I've started isolating myself from my friends because I didnt wanna feel like a bother or someone extra..  Sometimes I focus on my breathing, or distract myself with shows or games. But they dont work all the time.. so when it gets too unbearable, I let out my emotions by crying, screaming into my pillow or punching the wall (which I highly DO NOT recommend.) Sigh. Heavy metal helps sometimes too, all the loud bass and the hit of the drum soothes me and drowns out the noise in my head..  Sometimes it's better to put yourself out there and reach out, I've come to a point in my life when I know a friend isn't a friend when they dismiss my problems with theirs. It helps weed out the fake friends at least.. idk sigh..I feel all alone too...  I'm sorry if I sound contradicting..as much as I want to be positive for myself n others around me, those thoughts just floods in sometimes and I'm in a limbo between :) and :(  Anywho, I hope you find a way, your way, of dealing with these shituations. My point is, to never give up but sometimes taking a break isnt bad. If you want to, I'm here to talk or listen :)  Many hugs and loves xx

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, there doesn't seem to be that many that cover depression and suicide.  So basically I'm looking for some advice on where to find a really bitter drink. Apparently sodium nitrite and liquid nembutal are both very bitter and as such I want to be prepared to consume them without vomiting. Is there a regularly available drink that I can climatize myself with? Ideally nothing alcoholic as I don't drink but if that's all there is then I'll make it work.  Cheers

In february of 2020 my life started falling apart. it was getting towards the end of my almost 3 year relationship. i was 19 at the time and had just graduated highschool the year prior. at first everything was great, we had our own place together, pets, and worked at the same place. we loved each other so much. it was toxicity that ended our relationship i shouldn’t have acted how i did but the same went for her i hate that old person i used to be. in february my grandfather passed away i became very depressed along with having to deal with this toxic relationship yet i needed her in my life. it made no sense there were so many times where i just wanted to be alone but i still wanted her in my life i needed her so much. she was all i had. i have no friends. she was my friend. due to me being depressed and basically i had changed my whole mood i was just so upset. in april of 2020 my girlfriend and i broke up. i had no idea what to do. i lost the only person i needed. i lost my moon. i lost part of me. i moved into my uncles house after we broke up. a few months of agonizing nights of endless crying went by and my uncle and i had to be evicted that was in october 2020. i moved into my aunts house that is a 2 bedroom house and currently has 6 people and 6 animals living here. i’m very grateful she’s letting me stay her but i’m going mentally insane everyday here. my family is incredibly toxic to eachother and i have no privacy at all no car to go anywhere  no license nothing. i sleep on a cot in the basement next to my grandma. i work a minimum wage restaurant job and i’m in 2500 in debt and i have no idea what to do. it hasn’t got better it’s got so much more worse than i could have ever imagined. i have absolutely no one to talk to about anything no ones here for me i gave all my time to my ex and didn’t have time for friends or anything. i drown my sorrows in alcohol and weed and any drug worth taking. what do i do.

Does anyone feel like they hate working... I hate the concept of money too.. Having to just spend all your time working to feed yourself.. I Just hate this system we created.. It makes me want to not exist...Why the hell do we have to spend our lives like this? Why the hell do we have to work? The stress is literally killing me  I feel so sad and exhausted to have to do this every single fucking day... I hope no one tells me about finding your purpose or what job makes me happy kinda shit. Thing is, I hate capitalism. I have a decent job and i'm good at it. It's actually a better job and salary than most people get around here. But having to spend my life everyday just working is just fucking depressing and I wanna die....  Update:   I'd add this and say to the upcoming youth.. How can we make this better? I really don't want this life for our children. I want them to have enough and live life and eat and travel and fall in love.     How can we change this? How do we stop depending on money as a concept.. How do we make it so that we don't spend ALL our time working? I think some countries which are adopting shorter work days are kind of on a good track.. But I want to eliminate money and working all together and just live a simple life...

I literally feel exactly the same
I can relate
I know exactly what youre talking about
Life is BDSM. We only exist so someone born rich can continue to have an ideal life. It's always been this way; we are just comfortable enough to be more tolerant of it now.
At least you may have no adhd or mental disability, reduced functions.. at the same time being born with a prideful personality, inherited. So long that remains it feels like permanent depression if you get what i mean. I really wish to be skilled at something.   But i agree..we got some flawed systems out there..in more than one area
I feel the exact same way. I wish I could enjoy my life I only recently became eligible for vacation [5 days a year] and that still doesn't seem like enough. Out of 365 days a year I can take 5 to actually see my family that lives across the country. If someone passes away I would be at work...missing the funeral just like how I missed their life.
I feel the same!!!
RUN IN BACKGROUND. This video is made for You. Definitely will cry after listening to this. Probably the Best feeling ever. [https://youtu.be/GWMxT0cslEQ](https://youtu.be/GWMxT0cslEQ)
I believe tons of people must feel the same way.. I don't know how people show up to work everyday... I barely make it and I seriously just hate working.. I don't even wanna have a business of my own or anything anymore I just want to not have to work to earn money so that I can feed myself and my family. WTF we have a lot of food and resources in the world and access to make sure everyone gets plenty but instead we have to work for just stupid companies fulfilling someone's random purpose
I'm glad I'm  not alone... Like seriously..   I just don't know how people go on and think we HAVE to work in this world. I hate it. I hate itt!!!! How do we change this!!
I can't even get started on rich people. THIS IS WHAT MAKES ME HATE MONEY SO MUCH MORE. why the f is there so much disparity of wealth. I feel disgusted that some people live ROYALLY as f while others literallY DIE from hunger or heat.  Like wtf are we doing on this earth? Why can't we just chill and enjoy our fleeting life. and why the f do people hoard so much shit. The Universe has plenty for all of us but instead people act like selfish pricks
I'm skilled at cooking...I love it. I love feeding people. But working 40+ hours cooking to earn money and feed myself sounds effing insane. I do have depression and anxiety.. I know it makes it harder.. But I want everyone to be able to just travel and eat and effing enjoy their life on earth.. Not spend our lives WORKING  I'd love to teach and help out people for free if I had the time. I just hate that we all have to work so much like crazy just to freaking survive.
Let me guess, you live in America.
I feel like I'm just missing out on living. I wanna explore... I wanna eat different food and meet different people. But even if I stop working the rest of the world I want to meet is at work LOL
I know it sucks 🥲

Aye we came into this too early I think. Imagine where we'd be if all the effort had been focused on improving our standards of life instead of one-upsmanship. It all starts with our damaged brains and our conditioning to hate the "other". We're still trying to fix this damage by talking it out, like we can explain empathy into a psychopath. Better than bloodletting I guess. People are too addicted to power over each other. Technology is our springboard, but we're likely still thousands of years away from any meaningful change.
I would like to travel to england the rural areas, ive always been interested in ancient things, rather than much else in these times. ive heard there is much things to see there, like old casle ruins and also open plain fields to take the sights in and the like. I had an interest in archeology. Its probably the only interest in a job ive had though as you maybe get to travel alot and see more at the same time. Probably.   Also working 40 hours a week does sound too much, i dont think it could be something to keep up without breaks at times..  I dont want to come across as odd by typing this, but here's a digital hug.. \*hug\*

I do :(
It's not just america.. plenty countries where people have to work to survive every fucking day and I'm just so exhausted.  working 40+ hours every week and having almost no time to ourselves. Some countries don't even have sat sun off
I feel that in my soul, dude. Something that helps me sometimes is finding ways to carve out time for myself. A time budget if you will. I think that's what people are talking about when they say to practice self care? If you wanna try different foods you can always look up recipes from other cultures and make them in your home. It might be fun to get the family involved if possible. I know its not the same as traveling but its something new to break up the monotony. If you have any free time at all maybe just use that time to do something just for yourself. Idk if that'll help but sometimes doing this gives me a boost.

Gosh Whoever you are.. I love you
This is why I like the concept of a base pay. Andrew Yang talked about it a lot.  Not to bring up politics or anything. But some people have the idea that one day society will no longer require humans to do most of the work and any kind of labor would be purely optional. Its been talked about a lot more lately with the pandemic going on. Unfortunately I don't see it happening any time soon but one can dream.

I realize that no one is happy all the time. I know happiness is not a base state of being. I heard someone say that the goal is to be at peace not to be happy as being happy is an extreme emotion like anger. You experience happiness as a result of a stimulus. But...I don't know what peace is either. Every day I wake up and as soon as I start my day all I want to do until I get home is go back to my bed. If I have free time thats what I'm doing just laying in bed. I feel like I'm wasting my life away. I'd like to do better for myself I really just don't know how. I don't mean to be whiney or seem like I'm trying to have a pity party. I know there are people who have it way worse. I just don't know what to do to find piece. I just don't wanna feel like this anymore.

Lately I'm feeling this way too. Looking for the same answer, if it makes you feel better: you are not alone. We will find an answer. 🖤
I feel this way a lot too. I find that meditating and practicing mindfulness helps. I think the concept of happiness being an extreme emotion comes up in Buddhism, and meditation is often practiced to try to be more at peace with oneself. There’s a good meditation guide on Youtube that I think is pretty helpful, you can find it by searching “Buddhist meditation guide.” Hope this helps you on your path to find peace :)
Feeling you in this one . I’m depressed offer also . It’s even better ( insert sarcasm ) when parents are like “ snap out of it “ or “ don’t let anyone live rent free on your head “ clićhe BS . My grandpa that always said “ you’re too young to think like that “ line my main goal is to just knows on my brains window & say “ listen y’all gotta pay rent or get out “ then be like BOOM 💥 I’m cured. Lol ~ try some meditation for real that helps . Smoking hella weed helps too . Making yourself leave the house leave the house even times you don’t want occasionally just to breathe fresh air. You might want to talk to a psychiatrist as well as your family doctor as , see if you have any thyroid issues.That has helped chronic fatigue syndrome. I drink a lot of caffeine but that probably isn’t a great answer though. Just helps me not want to go back to sleep. Hang in there. Once summer comes things tend to even out . Vitamin D is good for seasonal depression. Idk what normal is but hope your find what you’re looking for.
Thank you 😊 I'm gonna give it a try today
Weed definitely helps me not care as much lol. I am trying meditation and yeah maybe walks outside might be nice :)

i feel like i need all these things to be wrong with me. i will go so far to achieve it (eating disorder, drug addictions, depression, cutting, etc) but I i end up liking it, the attention and the way ‘making myself feel bad’ feels. im just a whiny little bitch who needs attention. im not worthy of help because I dont really need it. why will i do anything for attention. and that feeling of going so far feel like none of it is real but then i get so excited!!! about somwone asking me how am i, i am not good, i rehearsed this earlier, “ups and downs ya know”. but now i have doubts then again excited. its a constantly moving scale. (the money weight thinf?)  am i doing this so i can ultimatwly fuck them ??? my boyfriend, v, a,,,,,but im scared of sex.   now that im being still im getting physically anxious, im out of breath. B is in the other room and i think i need her but idk why? panic attack? she doesnt want to deal with me as im sure no one else does. now im sad, i feel the “bowling ball” in dropping in my chest, as a friend called it the other day. i dont feel like its healthy to tell my boyfreind. pointless to tell anyone else. might be too much for the therapist, so im scared of telling her. maybe its the percocet kicking in right now but i feel like im deflating.  its definitely the percs-not gonna say much more. i want to take an Aleve, muscle relaxer? might as well, but maybe i also wont feel it as much

Not a doctor but i had similar dark thoughts and a way of thinking and I recognize some of myself in this. I was very anxious and depressed and was abusing alcohol, nicotine, etc... to self medicate. It was the only way i could journal when high or in crisis. I started on prozac and therapy and am finding myself writing much more like a reliable narrator. Making lists. Being able to sleep again without substance abuse or chronic masturbation- stuff like that. It doesn’t actually matter what you “label” it right now (anxiety/ocd/depression/addiction) what matters in my opinion is you don’t seem to feel right sober and you have the power to change that. You are not alone in feeling the way you do and there is hope for you. You have the right impulse to share and seek support. Thanks for sharing. Hope this helps.
thank you. feels weird that the only place i feel comfortable sharing this is reddit but i gotta start somewherre i guess.

I made plans to end it all today. I was so sad. Then my mom came home and asked me if I wanted dinner. I rejected and then went in the kitchen and ate it anyways. She was on the sofa so I kinda just rested my head against her side and drank some green tea. It helped calm me down.   Before she came home, I was on my bed all day. And I kept getting good sleep even without doing anything. Im realizing im mentally tired.   I realized I don’t need to kill myself because I am already dead. Her being home made me feel neutral rather than sad so it felt like a huge shift. I feel like I need to go on depression meds.

Definitely talk to someone about meds! It’s really hard to reach out that first time but it will be worth it.
If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out. You can find help at a National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  USA: 18002738255 US Crisis textline: 741741 text HOME  United Kingdom: 116 123  Trans Lifeline (877-565-8860)  Others: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines  https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org
If your therapist isn't working for you, a psychiatrist can help you with the meds.
Can you talk to your mom about how you’re feeling?
There are alot of ways to be depressed. I think thinking your way out of depression is probably very uncommon. There are alot of depressing thoughts that we feel we can't let go of. To me, there are ways to be less depressed without getting rid of the thoughts that make you feel bad. I think of depression in terms of neurochemicals which are affected by many many daily things. Often times when we're most depressed we are doing many small things we dont even care about to make ourselves more depressed. At that point it can be hard to be motivated to do things for the sake of feeling better, but on some level we usually do want to feel better and small steps we don't really mind taking can make us feel a little better, not necessarily about the thoughts in our minds, but just less unmotivated and void of energy. And every step to feel a little better we can use as a step to do another thing to feel a little better. For me to the point where the things that make you really depressed can still be a part of you, but you have enough energy to function and not do other things that'd bother you more and more, like lieing in bed all day. I'm sure it'd be healthiest to let go of the big thoughts and ideas that depress you, in my mind, therapy is a last step that it takes energy from a bunch of other small steps to get to. Small steps are things like, eating healthy for depression, listening to a song that makes you feel good, doing any easy thing that makes you feel good,  eventually getting to hard things like getting sunlight, exercising and eating even better and being social and eventually making healthy goals. But one thing to remember is sometimes we force ourselves to feel worse and and worse and worse without meaning to. When we'd be ok just feeling kinda shitty about it. I think it's good to educate yourself about the things that can make your brain neurochemically more depressed. Depression can sneak up on you, but I think you can get better at stopping downward spiral when you're like, "I feel worse then I did earlier...I guess I have gotten little sleep the last two nights, and didn't get any exercise, and consumed tons of sugar and caffeine earlier", etc, etc... So you're feeling like shit, but you're like, fuck I'm gonna drink some tumeric tea and  lie in the sun in the morning, cut back on the sugar and caffeine and get some electrolytes. (There's a ton of other small things you can do to help out neurochemically with depression, and just one thing helps a little bit, its up to you how much you do). There are alot of other things professionals can help with better, I just know sometimes knowing the small things that affect dopamine and serotonin can be helpful.
None of any of that is going to help you right this very second. Meds take a while to get and just making the phone call when your in it bad can be like trying to get out of quicksand.   Here’s a Wim Hof breathing exercise you can do right now. During the breath holds, visualize your life as you want it. Do it every day, as often as you need but don’t stop doing it! I’m finally starting to feel happy to be alive after a 6 year cyclone of anxiety, depression and hopelessness and I’ve only been doing it for a few weeks ❤️❤️  https://open.spotify.com/episode/6sCJKOLgUxpFd9DhBVLENU?si=ash7_jDPT0amRESvHaUwlw
Don't end your life. Your mother will miss you. We will miss you. I have been feeling very sad as well. Just empty. I have been trying to manage a hobby. I started dying my hair. I got a piercing. Try something new. Take a walk, and take pepper spray to be extra safe. Get a pet. There is so much to do. Learn something new. I got a part-time job to try to keep these thoughts out of my mind. There is so much to do, I hope you can figure something out. Please do not leave your mom to find you. My aunt found my cousin, and she has not recovered since then. Keep us updated.
I'm so happy you didn't end it all today. Sometimes depression grabs a hold of you and you can't help but being stuck in the same obsessive loop of dark, hopeless thoughts and feelings. It literally feels like a permanent dead-end, like punching a brick wall, like yelling in silence, because no one can hear you. I still have those desperate moments once in a while - I've suffered from major depressive disorder for most of my life. When I do, I look for things that give me comfort, I hibernate if I can (books, soft blankets, tea, movies). If I'm at work, I just tell myself to put one foot after the other and do my best, until I can run home and "nest". It helps.   You should talk to your doctor about it. Maybe start with your mom or a friend you can trust. There is nothing wrong with seeking help or with taking meds if your doctor thinks it will help you out. You shouldn't blame yourself either. Your brain is failing you, but that doesn't mean it won't get better.   Hang in there and drop me a line if you need to x
If you go on meds, definitely make sure you keep on 'em! And when you feel you might not need them, try to slowly let off on them, and don't come to a sudden stop! That could make it worse, I think
Been where you are.. and all I wanted was my mom to be there for me. All  iwant really...and she is just isnt. It's a sign she came home at that time for you. Hope your feeling better.
Meds can be a very important step I have tried them before and gone off them plenty of times but last year I decided I was going to give it some real dedication and I woke up and looked outside and thought "It's going to be a beautiful day" I can't remember if there was a time in the last 30 years I ever thought that before. It really can start you on your way to improving   Be sage and stay strong it can get better.
Talk. To. Her.   And it sounds like just not being alone is a huge help to you. If you get like that again, call a friend or something. Distractions are always good.
I’m sorry to hear about the situation you’re in. It really is shitty but it does end. A couple years ago I saw no end and was depressed every day I can remember. Don’t be afraid to speak up for help. No one is expecting you to do everything all on your own. I’m not sure how old you are but a friend, teacher, family member or doctor will all be able to help. The one thing that helped me was getting out the house and going on runs. It helped me relax and allowed me to do nothing but just think things through. Even starting off on walks will work wonders for you. I hope you’re all ok and keep yourself safe
Hey, what you are experiencing sounds extremely exhausting, both mentally and emotionally.  As a therapist, I understand that what you are experiencing can be frustrating and almost hopeless at times. However, it is important to focus on the little aspects of life that make you feel a little better, like the way you felt when you spent a little time with your mom. It would also really help if you could reach out to someone. It could be a friend or a family member that you trust, or even a mental health professional. They will be able to support you and guide you through whatever you are experiencing, and more than anything you won't have to do this alone.   I hope that things get better and if you need any support or help, please feel free to reach out to me. Take care, and remember you don't have to do this alone. :")
It was a really strong step you took going out and sitting with her and having tea. Something so simply can be really hard when you're in a dark place. Neutral isn't a bad place to be when you consider the alternative. If aiming for happy is too much right now, keep doing these great steps to stay on neutral. It's easier to build up from there when you're ready.
I'm so sorry to hear that you are feeling low and contemplated ending your life. I used to feel this as well and found talking about my emotions in a space that is free of judgement/taboo culture or rejection for being authentic really helped me feel heard, seen and comforted. I am now working with a therapist that also does inner child healing (very powerful emotional healing method). If you feel like going on medication would be beneficial for you then definitely keep safe and go with your instincts to reach out to the doctors. I have always found expression in any form is a great way to reduce the symptoms of depression whether this is journaling, art, dance, speech, etc. Take care and remember needing support does not make you weak in any way. We are social animals and reaching out to others for help is natural and strengthens us.  Be patient with yourself, I can imagine this is very frustrating for you to be experiencing and I just want you to know that you're not alone and that there are many options still available for you to heal and live the life that you desire! The mind and body are connected; so taking care of either one of these is going to have a positive effect on the other (hopefully this perspective helps you feel like you can achieve more with less)!    Just felt called to share this here. I host Zoom sharing circles every Saturday 11.30am (GMT) that offers an emotionally safe non-judgemental space if anyone's interested then feel free to connect and I can send more details!
Meds can help. Working with a provider who can be fluid and flexible is worth a shot. Some fit folks better than others and there are pretty affordable genetic tests they can do to see what ones might be best.
I know you’ve gotten a lot of great advice already but here it goes: I just recently went through something similar. The fact that you decided to get up, go the kitchen, drink tea and be with your mom is a big deal. I was realizing that this was happening to me and thank goodness my brain kicked in and said that I shouldn’t be alone. Based on experience I think it’s helpful to realize your at an all time low and then be able to do something small to help. So I’ve been really working on not being alone until I can see a psychiatrist. They don’t have to know why you need them there. You don’t have to tell your mom why you don’t want to be alone. Just being in someone’s presence helps until you’re able to find the words to open up. I hope this helps.
It's best to have both and for them to share your current status. Being as depressed as the OP is demands he seek professional help. Not your family doctor!!!!! They usually only make things worse.  Talking about and through your depression is one of the few things that actually works. Using meds takes away the full force of the depression.
Definitely would recommend, although daunting, it really helps afterwards
I tried to talk to my family doctor about it and she basically said that she knows it's rough with covid lately and everyone is struggling. I was also beginning to think that some kind of medication could really help me, but I didn't know there was anyone else I could ask and after that response I stopped trying. I guess Im just not sure where to look for resources if I want to try again. Should I just look for psychiatrists in my area?
Yes. But look for Doctors who specialize in depression and anxiety. Hopefully one location will have both psychologist and psychiatrist in the same system.  What your doctor said is what I mean by making things worse when it comes to mental health. Our country is in the worst mental health disaster in history, and family doctors are saying it's tough for everyone out there?!?

Hello everybody. I have a simple, yet complex, question for you.  How would you decline a friend's intimate advances, without causing that person unnecessary shame or hurt?  I joined a small support group awhile back for those struggling with similar conditions to mine. I quickly befriended a woman of about my age, and we became each other's sort of... Personal line? We would contact each other if we felt it wasn't important enough to call a meeting.   In recent weeks she has been making intimate advances on me, none of which are reciprocated. She has asked if I have intimate feelings for her, and I have told her in the most polite and respectful way possible that I do not.   How do I make it clear that these advances aren't welcome? Is it possible to do so and keep a civil relationship?  I just don't want to cause her emotional distress or anything.

*possible TW*  Hello. I’m a 16 year old female, and I’ve been struggling with my mental health for a while now (probably ever since I was around 13). I’ve gone through rough phases with my body image, I struggle daily with OCD, and I’m currently depressed (I believe). I went to the doctors back around September I think? This happened after I finally broke, and I was assessed by a doctor in which she told me I have vitamin deficiencies which contribute to my poor mental health.   I’m utterly conflicted because I have been given supplements for the past 3 months or so now, and it’s supposedly working after I had done blood work and it showed my vitamin levels were finally improving (my vitamin d is still really low, although better). I have done a copious amount of research on how I’m supposed to feel moderate already and even the doctor told me I should “start to feel better after the first week”. But in reality, it’s been 3 months and if I’m really honest, I feel even closer to death. I struggle to do things everyday and often resort to my bed, I can only focus on schoolwork but that’s literally all. My appetite has demolished, I feel so suicidal, I self-harm everyday, and I often find myself trying not to just lose my shit over little things. Most of all, I feel so utterly drained and I can’t even recognize my face or surroundings anymore. When I’m really low, I can hear or see things of my past I don’t want to remember. I just want to know if someone has ever had a deficiency so bad that depression drove them this low into the ground. My parents are very inclined to believe that I just need to sit in the sun all day, which yes, may improve my health but I’m not sure at this point. They tell me “we all get sad sometimes, especially with the circumstances in place” which just made me want to breakdown because I feel like I’ve been planning my death for months on end subconsciously. I’ve struggled for so long that I feel so lost and I would really just appreciate any insight someone could give me.  **just to note; I’ve had OCD tendencies ever since I was like 12. It’s really affected me in ways I cannot even comprehend, and especially during the pandemic like a lot of us. Going outside in public is just really difficult.

I want to find the right words but I can’t so I keep up upvoting hoping someone else will say the right thing.   Please don’t feel alone. A lot of people refrain from comment because they are afraid of saying something they will upset you more.   So I’m going to hop in here with only experience with depression and no psychology degree. Maybe what I’ve been through could help.   Your parents are wrong. Yes, vitamin deficiency can be a big cause of depression. It’s good that they recognize it. But it’s clear your supplements are not enough. I’m surprised nobody has bought you a “happy lamp” to sit in front of. ( nice, but not always the answer )  You need to see a psychiatrist.  These are clearly signs that you are having bigger problems in your head. The people around you aren’t taking you seriously.  I urge you to seek out resources on your own if your parents aren’t helping.   You are NOT alone in this. I was raised by people who believed depression was all in your head and the solution was to go for a walk. So I know the struggle.   I would also like to say, you are going through a perfect storm of stress right now.  Seasonal affective disorder aside, you’ve got estrogen wreaking havoc on your moods and mind, your peers are not exactly mature and respectful, (I have no doubt someone is bullying someone) and you are stuck with your family in a time of COVID with very little chance to get away and relax. These things alone are enough to seek help.    Please don’t feel that your feelings are invalid in any way. You just might need a simple antidepressant. You might not, but please see a psychiatrist. Your family doctor isn’t doing enough.     Sharing a hug through cyberspace
Thank you so much for the response. It really helps a lot, definitely makes me feel a bit less heavy too. I guess I’m just scared to be judged a lot in terms of what appears to be more cynical than what is actually preventing me from enjoying life. Take care :)
We all face the struggle of being judged by those who don’t understand. The thing is. Your mind and your life are your priorities. Your family wants to see you happy. If this helps that, they will understand  eventually

Life is just slapping me in the fucking face right now. This last year has been so fucking hard. Before the pandemic, I was getting *better*! I started taking anti-depressants and I was starting to feel like a goddamn *person* again. I even started learning how to play the guitar! And then COVID happened and thus began the series of events that have ultimately led to today.  My spouse and I were served with a 30 day move out notice. It’s because they said our apartment was too messy. Which, yeah, it’s messy. But we’ve been trying really hard to keep up with it. I’ve been working 10.5 hour days at work, on my feet. I’m exhausted when I get home. My spouse is even more mentally ill than I am. Cleaning’s hard for us, but we’ve been making an effort. But they won’t work with us, even though they’re going against the timeline they gave us. I really loved this apartment. I’m so upset, because this is the second time in 6 months we’ve been given a 30 day move out notice (the first was because they were terminating all month-to-month tenants, and we hadn’t renewed our lease because it was up right when lockdown started and everything was really uncertain). It’s looking like we may end up having to move back in with my mother-in-law, which is obviously less than ideal. It has it’s pros (we’ll be able to save money because rent will be much cheaper, we’ll be able to both go to a therapist because we’ll have an extra $600-800 a month, she’s a Proper Adult who knows how to do Proper Adult Things and can help us Figure Out Our Shit), but also its cons (storing our furniture, disrupting our cats once again, only having one room, living *with my mother-in-law*, my spouse not being able to use her preferred name because her mother doesn’t really get her Gender Weirdness, etc.)  I love my spouse. We’ve been together for almost seven years, and we’ve made it through every single shitty thing that life has thrown at us. I love her more than anything, and I know we’re going to get through this, too. But it’s just *so hard*. She’s considerably more mentally ill than I am (not a competition, just a statement of fact), so it often falls on me to be the Strong One, to be the Rock. But I feel like I’m a piece of webbed glass that’s one tap away from shattering into a million pieces.   My anxiety is so high that it’s affecting my work performance. I can barely open my email each morning without having a mini-panic attack. I feel like I was left out to dry during the months following our store’s reopening after lockdown. I received no help or guidance, barely heard from anyone above me, and so just went about doing everything myself. Then they decided after about five months of that that I wasn’t doing things right and now they’re constantly on my back. I can’t lose this job. It’s the only job that pays anything *close* to decently in this shitty town.  And then, there’s All Of The Things going on in my country. I wake up every morning and it’s like the election is still happening. I live in a red state, and I’m scared all of the time. I’m scared for my family, which is almost completely comprised of people with serious health problems, including an aunt with COPD and three young daughters, who I’m terrified of losing to COVID because assholes won’t wear their fucking masks. I’m terrified of the literal attempted coup that just happened last week. I’m terrified of something happening to my spouse or me and ending up in even more crushing debt because of medical bills.  I don’t know what my goal in posting this is. Maybe I just needed to shout into the void for a few minutes. I’m not sure. I think I just need to be told that I’m not a fucking failure and that I can make it through this.  To top it all off, I’ve had the song *Macavity* from *Cats* stuck in my head all goddamn day. I cannot express to toy how much I hate the musical *Cats*.

Sorry for all formatting errors I am on mobile.   ::  I need an outlet. I honestly feel so empty and confused. Everything is just going wrong right now.  Last month I lost one of my kitties, my baby, to meningitis. It was honestly a tragic experience I found him paralyzed, and then me and my boyfriend had to put our cat we got at the start of our relationship down. Leaving his brother... Alone.  Before that month my Depression, which I had under control at the time, had a spike... I hit a low... And then that happened, I nearly lost my mind.  Well, we ended up needing to take our other cat to the vet yesterday, and he is on medication now... And could mtl die without it. My boyfriend came home today from work and we realized he must have got out. I feel so broken, it's not his fault of course, but I'm just so empty. I feel like there's nothing I can do, he will likely die as we live in a busy part of town, and if it's not a dog or car it will be his medical problems. I'm still hoping we find him.   My boyfriend has also hit a low, and I feel is pushing me away.   I'm loosing my mind. I feel so empty. Help. If he sees this post I honestly won't care... I have already told him all of this. I'm just.... I need help.

I(f) was just hired, I'm here in a hotel room alone without my wife. A few months ago I was laid off and decided "death by train" was my way out.  There are tracks behind my house and she has on more than one occasion caught me waiting for the next train. I know I know it's such a shitty thing to do to the poor engineer. But I can't take this pain. I had no insurance, we couldn't afford going to a hospital. We aren't even really making bills work.   My new job is going to be 6-7 days a week with medical insurance. Somehow finally getting a job has made things worse. I'm in this hotel alone, with active tracks behind the building. I'm supposed to work for a better future but I just don't see one. I don't see a future. I'm depressed beyond belief. I've already decided it's over and I am just going through the motions until I have a chance to just get rid of it all. I don't want to feel like this but it's a force of nature. My anxiety is so bad my fitbit thinks I'm working out when all I'm doing is panicking.   I feel the world is stacked against me, I was diagnosed bipolar 2 years ago and things were getting better. Now they're worse than ever. I'm sorry about the rant. I don't even know what you can say that I haven't already heard. I just don't want to do this anymore. I'm sorry.

I’ll be thinking of you through my day. I’ll send love to your person from far away. I pray you get through it and that a small burst of love will make you reconsider. A big hug from another depressed individual.
I know there are very few things someone can say to snap out of this kind of mentality, I know it well. The only thing I can offer is kindness and compassion, I will be thinking of you. I will be endlessly hoping that somehow someway you get a small burst of serotonin that will allow you to experience the relief.   Your brain hasn’t caught up with you being out of survival just yet, so the same feelings and emotions from the past two years still resonate as true even though the situation is not. It is compounded by the new job because the non survival part of your brain knows this is good, but because the survival part is still so active it feels like it wasn’t even a relief but in fact, made worse because this was supposed to be the thing that freed you from all that shit.   My dad killed himself a few years ago, and I know that sometimes it’s just the path we end up taking. But I will tell you since I didn’t get to tell him, I love you, you are strong, you are worthy.   I hope I didn’t offend or upset I only mean to bring you compassion.
Your wife would never want to live in a world without you. Keep fighting.
Honestly, you have brought me to tears. I feel all I've been doing these past few months was practice writing suicide notes. My family tells me the love me all the time.but it feels routine. Your I love you really hit me hard. I'm going to get off the floor and pull myself up.   I'm so sorry about your dad. My friend killed themself in highschool and I know how it effects people around you. I can only imagine how you feel. You're very kind. Thank you
Thank you for pulling yourself up. Thank you for being so strong! And thank you for hearing that. In a way it made me feel like my dad heard it too. I’m bawling, I don’t know what to say other than thank you and I love you. My Inbox will forever be open to you should you need someone to hear you.
Thank you. Sincerely
My uncle committed suicide and my heart hurts every single day. My heart is hurting to know how you feel. Dont think about the future take each day one day at a time. I wish i can hug you!!! *virtual hug* i will be thinking of you! keep us posted friend!
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm hurting your heart

Life is really hard. Some days are more difficult than others and disappointments are inevitable. I personally lost every interest in socializing, and just don't want to get out much other than if I have an important meeting or for fresh air. I don't like to answer calls or call anyone anymore either. I figured we can't really rely on anyone but ourselves because everyone is in the same struggle of finding relief of sufferings. We all just have our own unique ways to go about this. It is difficult when you don't really see the point of things anymore and the idea of a bigger picture just doesn't work for me. Every single day again we are plagued by the miseries caused either by our limited perceptions, other's limited perceptions and the limitations posed by seasonal or climatic changes and threats posed by our environment. Why does life needs to be a constant strife for survival, I don't know. I just feel detached from trying to put up a mask to hide my pain and real emotions just to fit in and to have meaningless conversations about random superficial things that really just don't seem to matter. I feel blue and I am okay with it now as chasing after prestige and success is a fire that cannot be extinguished. The demands and norms to be accepted as a capable individual by society, are outrageous and don't do good to anyone. It is a torture really, and fleeing into a relationship might be exciting for a while until it turns into a game of betrayal and disrespect because we must face the harsh fact that there will always be someone better than us and wherever we are now will be replaced by someone else in the future. To take initiatives, set goals, may seem to be the ambition for many, but not for me. I am frightened that life will keep passing by with me as its sole observer as if watching a documentary. In times of happiness many wish to be around you and rejoice in it for themselves of course, but in times of sorrow your own reflection alone will be your companion. What should we do when all words of interest and attention feel hollow like it is just business. Where to draw inspiration and motivation from if everything feels so overdone tried out already, like been there, done that. I just live, do my daily routines and sleep after periods of insomnia, and then start all over again.

I love how you phrase this whole bubble of the world we live in, my god. I'd love to rant bout my insights of this bubble but I'm too numb to feel. I laugh, I cry, and sometimes I punch wall, but the only time I feel alive is when I cry myself to sleep. We do things to keep our minds busy with the ancient structure of the world, but we've deviated so much so that even the truth is a lie. We fall back onto nth, but nth is also smth. And it becomes a loop hole of figuring out what's right and wrong, when the whole world is really just   gray.
Wonderfully expressed! Also truthful are the things you've stated. It is like a beginningless neverending quest for meaning, which in itself certainly seems to be an illusion. Thank you for your commentary and compliments.
I agree. The facts of the world are based on hypothesis and human understandings. Even time is man-made too.  Thank you for yours😊  It's been refreshing talking bout the gray area and the bubble with you. Would love get to know you more OP. Your words and insights are commendable.
Valid points!  Of course, you're welcome 😊  That's a nice and kind thing to say, thanks a lot. Have you read any of my other posts by chance? Usually I am not the kind of person most people want to be around (for long) because of the way I am/think and feel about life.
😁😁  I have yet to, but I'm bout to heh. But I'm pretty adaptable. I'm an overthinker and there are alot of gray area I've covered so..really anything between good n bad of the world, I might have thought of, idk we shall see😊   It's pretty refreshing to know how anyone other than myself think or their outlook on life itself. I'd love to understand and discuss more.  How ironic, come to think of it. Here we are wanting to share our insights but it's just plain gray. In the end, we are human after all :p
😊  That's ok haha.  You sure do seem very nice, smart, and friendly. It is not an easy quality to be adaptable so respect to you.  It's remarkable how experienced you are with all aspects of life. I'd be happy to get to know you better too along the way. Yes indeed we shall see ☺️  Thank you for telling me openly how you feel in interacting with me. The feeling is mutual which is always a positive sign. I value that you also seek depth and are expansive to discuss any matter to grow and learn from.  Haha yes it is ironic, but you're right it is part of the human journey :)

I feel cheated via the education system at all stages,   and now I am motivated to improve simple skills like typing, spelling or multiplication and very basic stuff in general. But I keep finding top apps and everything educational mostly having a score or competitive learning reward and punish system at the heart of it.      primarily here I am asking if anyone knows of alternatives to basic learning apps or websites to go to that don't give me a score or rank me against everyone else because ranking/competitive language is an instant demotivator for me that drains me of all my positivity.     I have tried to change my mind at how I view competitiveness (without success)  but I feel so strongly that I should be able to learn without this notion of trying to be better than other people and rather just simply becoming more or less familiar with each skill.      Thank you for taking the time to read, I appreciate your ideas.   little Side note: also, Reddit's upvote system makes me feel not worthy of having my own voice.

I would say read books, they don't rank you. Some documentaries, podcasts and lectures online are also helpful.  Competition/Grading can be good and bad. The problem is that it motivates the ones already doing good and beats down on the ones already doing bad.
Hi,   I'm not sure what level you're currently at for mathematics but if it's still quite basic, I would recommend checking [IXL Maths](https://br.ixl.com/). I don't feel like it's comparing you to other users and you can pick the area you want to improve. As a heads up, it does have a timer for you to monitor your own speed (not a countdown)

i was just curious if anyone has any advice on meeting someone nowadays. i have a hard enough time getting comfortable around people as it is and i dont have enough confidence to dm a girl and flirt, i cant take the rejection i face on tinder or instagram dms. it makes me feel 100x worse about myself, i wish i could just brush it off and move onto the next one but when i make an effort and someone shows obvious disinterest in me i isolate and refuse to try again for weeks. i know deep down this is a problem about me not loving myself. does any one else struggle with this or something similar?

I have been suffering from depression for over a couple years now. and my friends have always been there for me and made sure that they were open and honest with me 100% of the time. But they are going through similar things to me and sometimes when they see me just you know emotionless or sometimes a bit on the sad side, that can remind them of the problems in their life and then they join in.  when I am not caught up in my thoughts I try to make conversation, smile and through that I get an energy boost. I never thought of this very much because I was just serving what emotion my thoughts were giving off. but recently a very close friend of mine opened up and said that all my friends are secretly suffering because of the things I do and say. they really worry about me and sometimes they feel useless and their thoughts kick in and then they come to a similar spot I am at.   I completely understand where they are coming from and I see why they would be feeling this way, it's because they care, they really want me to find help and I have found some through getting a psychiatrist and a therapist. they wanted to tell me this sooner but they felt that if they did they may cause me to become more sad and more suicidal.   I really know they care about me and that they want to help. but they want me to give off less of the depressive vibe that I am usually associated with. which is understandable. but the thing is I am not sure where or how to start doing any of this.  I have asperges so I am not very good at grasping emotional and social problems and situations very well. so I am stuck. what should I start doing for myself? for their sake  thanks, I really do care about them

Well, there are many reasons this could be happening. Something to make sure is clear is the difference between suicidal ideation and actually being suicidal.   Suicidal ideation can be so Terrifying because if it’s not something you want, it will feel like you don’t have control over your own actions. Occasionally this can be coupled with anxiety so it becomes intensified and feel like you might really make that choice.   I hope that will ease your mind to know that you may just be experiencing ideation and can learn to challenge that brain of yours!
Oh I didn’t know that was a thing, Thanks

The closest people by my side does not believe in or have any awareness about mental health.   My 2 best friends believes that diet and exercise would fix every single problem I have, be it physical or mental. I suffer severe symptoms from ADHD and chronic fatigue.   They’re genuinely nice people but I can’t open up to them without feeling like a total piece of shit and all my issues are just caused by myself and my inaction to fix things (which is, verbatim “you don’t eat healthy and exercise enough”). I get where they are coming from but at the same time I am so perplexed by this kind of approach to people suffering with depression. In short, they’re fully unaware that mental illness are actual illnesses.  Adding salt to wound, theyd also tell I’m wasting my money and scammed by “business models” if I opt for professional mental health support. I can’t wrap my head around it.   How can I go about explaining this to them, and also to persevere our friendship?

You have two options here, try to educate them and if they still dont get it youre gonna have to ditch them, or just fo ahead and ditch them because what they are doing is just going to continue to degrade your mental health and its just gonna get worse with them dismissing you and belittling the way you feel. Go seek professional help, see a therapist, talk to a doctor about a diagnosis and treatment. But they don’t need to know about it, they dont have a right to know everything in your life, but you also shouldnt have to hide it for your own sanity. I know it really sucks cutting someone so important out of your life because i have had to do the exact same thing so I could move on and heal myself, but sometimes you have to do whats best for you and if that means cutting them out then it might be best for you, but that is ultimately up to you to decide

High school was the best time in my life and it always will be. I was active in sports, I was the most popular guy in the school, and I was the salutatorian of my class. I had so many friends, it felt like a family. School felt like another home to me.  During college I've slowly stopped speaking with a lot of the people I knew from high school. I stopped being active on social media and I have been texting with them less and less, to the point where I have had no contact with them for like 2-3 years at this point. I think part of the reason I have been so hesitant to contact them is because I know they're the only friends I have. If I try to reach out and they reject me ("I don't want to talk to you anymore, I don't like you, you're a bad person, go away," etc.), I don't think I could emotionally handle that. What if they no longer like me? What if I reach out and they've moved on and decided I'm no longer their friend? I can't let that happen to myself.  But I've felt so lonely since leaving high school. I miss having that familiarity with a group of people who had similar interests and personalities to myself. I miss the sense of community I felt back then. I would do absolutely anything just to go back to those days. It was the last time in my life that I felt confident, happy, like I had a personality, like anything I did mattered...  I don't know what to do. I'm about to graduate college and I feel like my life has been flying by, but I haven't felt happy for years. Am I going to spend the rest of my life alone, Yearning for my high school days? This loneliness is causing me so much pain.

The first thing you need to do is STOP THINKING THAT YOU ARE ALONE! You are not alone! Friends drift apart sometimes. This happened to me with two different people. They both got back in touch with me and now our friendship is just as strong as it was before. Some people change, we can’t stop that, but as long as they remember you as a kind person, they probably will not reject you. Remember to not feel alone, it may seem like that, but it is not true. That is fear and depression trying to win, but you need to fight back against those feelings! If you feel alone, reach out to your family, they will help you.YOU CAN DO IT!
I feel very similar to you. I was never a very social person but in HS I talked to a lot of people and had a solid group of friends. When I went away to college I was very shy and didn’t talk to many people. I would think back to HS all the time, wishing I could go back. Like you, I was worried that I might not be able to return to the friend group I had back then. Fortunately, when I transferred to a another school closer to my home I became even closer with them. Try not to worry what they might think of you. Obviously I don’t know them or you but I’d imagine the chances they would be as cold as you imagine is quite low. And if for whatever reason they don’t want to talk to you then fuck em.

I wake up tired and exhausted after battling my subconscious in my sleep and I cry. Cry at how I have to go through another day and how I cant function. I used to have depression and I have been at this stage before but this time it's worst because of the heartbreak. But I digress  I woke up today 7am because I had to pee, it was easier to actually get out of the bed. Otherwiss I would be in bed till 9.30 when my classes start. I took a warm shower followed by a cold 1min shower at the end. I felt more awake.  I went back to bed, surfed reddit to forget my feelings and see if I can find more tips and tricks to get out of this darkness. I then when to class. I now drink 1 cup of coffee in the morning. Before I drink it, I do wim hof breathing technique   I then get to class. I have a few cry sessions when the feeling overwhelm me but mostly I am numb and I cant think. Without  the heartbreak I cry less. I am more numb and even even less energy compared to my previous bouts. I end class and I think of going out but I don't. I do my laundry and fold my clothes. I am proud I managed to do that. I order take away. I want to get back to cooking and stop getting so much takeaway.most of my money is spent on this now but I simply do not have the energy to cook regularly and food gives some dopamine but I also realise the unhealthy food I order is what might be making my depression worst in the long term. I watch a movie on netflix. I used to be numb and not even have interests in watching shows. But the overthinking is so much more painful. I forced myself to pay attention although my concentration wavers at times it has been a couple of years since I actually been able binge a show fully focused.   I then go the gym and don't do anything heavy. I do not have the energy for it and I know I will hurt myself. I remember my old regimens. I walk on the treadmill for 30mins at a decent speed with incline. I sweat a little. I go lift some weight but nothing too heavy. I walk back home and take a warm shower. I lay in bed unable to sleep. I know I should not exercise just before my sleeping time but I am glad I actually did some exercise. I smoke a little bit of weed to get me to sleep.   I am trying to quit weed and coffee and bad food but going cold Turkey didn't work. I am going through too many emotions so I am slowing weaning off it. Weed helped me with my previous bouts of depression and being unable to sleep but it's was good when I only did it once a week or once a month. Because of the lockdown I did it every night to help sleep. I drank so much coffee to cope with my job and also forger about the heartbreak when during the initial stages. I liked that it gave me such energy. But the crashes were horrendous. I am sticking to only one cup per day and none on weekends. I will have to start cooking but going to the grocery store has been triggering my anxiety. Its so hard to get out but I have to. Especially in this current financial climate. I will start going to the gym everyday as well just for a walk. Nothing too serious because I just don't have the energy. I hope one day this darkness will end and not just be shoved aside like the last time when this person came to my life. I want to cure it for good this time. It's going to be a long journey but I have also seen a doctor and I am going to take a mental health plan.  Plus I plan to write as much as I can. I am not sure if this is the right place to post this. I cant even write properly. I am simply stating statements. I didn't proof read this as well because I cant. I pray that this bleakness goes away, I can't take it anymore

Throughout my teen years and up until I was about 20 (22 now) I dealt with severe depression. I was diagnosed with bipolar and given heavy doses of medication in my 20’s that I stopped taking after I visited an old therapist commented that I seemed like a shell of my former self. I never really thought I was bipolar, I feel things intensely so I can experience highs and lows but it’s not random and I’ve never been manic. After I stopped taking the medication things started getting easier, I started making adjustments in my life and now I can look back at the lowest points in my life and feel strong. It feels like the worst is behind me, yet I cannot shake this feeling of being so overwhelmed. I avoid sadness like it’s the plague and it feels like I’m constantly running from negative thoughts. Life feels exhausting but it’s mostly in my head, kind of like paranoia. I would love any advice on how to stop feeling this way, and continue to improve my mental health.

I'm a college student (majoring in Physics) in Asia with depression and panic disorder. I have a long distance girlfriend(21F) (let's call her 'Cat') currently working in a different country. She won't be back for another two years. And I recently got a crush on a friend(21F) (let's call her 'Kim') who says I'm her best friend.  Kim lives with her parents and has a little daughter and the father lives with his parents. He is aloof and Kim feels she doesn't get much love and attention from him. She says she hopes to find someone who would give her love and attention. I feel sorry for her and wish I could give her some love. I talked to Cat about it and she said it's okay if I gave Kim a hug if that helps her feel loved. Cat knows I get crushes on other women, but knows I wouldn't cheat on her.  So, this evening, I confessed to Kim in form of a three minute voice recording. I had already told her that I had a confession to make that could 'break our friendship'. Sure enough, she still keeps insisting that we're still friends. She says she doesn't have another friend like me. It turns out she has a crush on somebody else.  I haven't had a hug since July 2020 (I had an FWB then). I didn't even get a hug from my sisters when I went home in October. I feel so starved of affection.  I also feel guilty about myself because I thought I would invite Kim over to my place for lunch this Saturday, and then slowly seduce her by giving her a hug and then offering her a 'relaxing' sensual massage. I knew I would be cheating on Cat. When I talked to Cat about my plan to invite Kim for lunch and give her a hug, and I asked her 'What if she tries to seduce me?', she said 'It's up to you. You're my man. I trust you'. I'm sure she didn't mean I could bang Kim. But now it doesn't seem that could ever happen.  I'm in triple pain right now: First; from my regular depression, Second; from the heartbreak of rejection and Third; from the guilt of planning to cheat on Cat  I feel very guilty about thinking of cheating on Cat. I'm also suffering from the heartbreak of rejection. But I feel a little consolation that I won't have to lie to Cat when she asks me if I ever cheated on her.  It's 0030 hrs in my time zone right now. I'm going to try to get some sleep now (which doesn't seem likely)  Somebody please talk to me. Tell me anything; interesting weird facts, emotional support (preferred), advice, anything. Please

To be blunt, my advice is stop making excuses for yourself/lying to yourself, because that's how you come off to me. Your loneliness doesn't make your wanting to cheat any better. A woman having a poor relationship with her child's father doesn't mean she wants you. And, its kind of misleading to ask your girlfriend one thing when you know you're trying for something else. If you can't be honest about wanting to be with other women you shouldn't be in a relationship. It also seems like you have a little disconnect between different types of love. Kim is saying she needs some platonic or romantic love and it seems like you're trying to have sex with her. That's not either of those. Meanwhile you're telling your girlfriend you just mean to give her platonic love. You also mention you need love in any form. Imo (and many others), its not healthy to get your need for the baseline non romantic or sexual love from romantic or sexual love. Its kind of like needing rice and beans every day, and instead of making an effort to get it, you rely on someone else to make sweets for you. Your stomach will be satisfied but not with the right nutrients. Then when they leave you'll have a sugar addiction and still no rice and beans like when you started (sorry if that was too fake deep or corny lol...was generally an easy way to explain it).   Additionally, your idea of "seducing" women is off to me. Sounds like very large margins for making someone uncomfortable, even if she reciprocated your romantic feelings. I feel like asking someone you've never given a casual hug to over specifically to give them a hug is odd. And then to lead in to you asking to give them a massage and then sexually touching them is like...aaaa. Even if you did the right thing and told them your intentions and asked for consent beforehand, it might catch someone off guard. Some people need some time and its important to pay attention to them and their pace.  Another small crumb of advice...sometimes when your mental health is bad you're better off single. Relationships give so many opportunities for metal health problems.
I’ll be quick and blunt.   Similar age similar story but I worked for an airline.   I followed my Kat (legit part of her name) to France. I felt like you that ‘we were special’ she broke up with me mid blowjob day one. To protect her from people thinking less of her I didn’t fly to Spain that night and we ended up back together.   I cam back to the USA and another girl let’s call her “fire” she had a tattoo of fire from her crotch to her navel. She was in my class we became friends and I knew she wanted more but felt safe because she had a boyfriend, before I went pack to Paris again I found out her BF wanted to watch me and her. I freaked and disappeared. Meanwhile Kat also started suggesting similar stuff with a girlfriend of hers.    I know I’ll get shit for this but I just wanted love not that kind of kink.   It was more ups and downs and in the end Kat had started cheating and was the faithful one. I just had a dream called her and she confessed. I got depressed and I had lost friends and unlovable.      A friend made a pass at me I couldn’t even connect it. I lost so much time because every in my life was abusive or connected to her.   I just cut them all off and started new and I was better for years.   You’re young and you have needs. I got in trouble by lying to myself. Just be straight with everyone and follow your heart and desires. Let cat go and if you’re meant to be anything either if you do won’t matter.   But if you don’t live life you’ll end up having resentment.   That was the reason for my story My Kat resented me because I was too good to her and I resented people because they were free. Too free in some cases, I was just to stubborn to see it because I wasn’t living
I am sure I love Cat. We have shared our stories of our hard childhoods and our most intimate secrets. We have nothing to hide from each other. I love her like hell

Hey all. I've been struggling with depression for years, as has my wife. There are times that everything seems to much and not worth it, but I've never seriously considered suicide. I've been clinically diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety, and I have been on over half a dozen anti-depressants and I'm currently on 225mg of Venlafaxine. I don't know what to do. Everything just seems hopeless and I feel worthless all of the time. I push friends away, and just cut people off, and this has caused serious issues in my life. The most recent severe episode was a little over a month ago, where my best friend since I was a teenager told me I was being childish and to "grow the f**k up".   My life is a mess, my house is trashed, I let my car go uninspected and unregistered for most 2020, and I just feel numb and empty. Just today, I finally found a little bit of productivity and called about a therapy appointment, only to find out that my insurance sucks and it would be $100 for the initial appointment, and $400 every month for weekly appointments. How am I supposed to afford that? Why is it even worth it? It just all seems for goddamn pointless... I guess I'm just looking for some support because I feel like life isn't worth it any more.

I'm probably the wrong person to respond to this but here goes... You are struggling with something that you're going to struggle with for life. However, getting a therapist and seeking professional help is a great step. I hope to one day be able to do the same. The goal is to find the right coping mechanisms/meds for you and eventually something will click. It takes time. For some it takes years, but the battle can be won. Bad days will still come and sometimes these feelings will get the best of you. But please don't quit. Don't stop trying to find peace. I'm still trying to find it myself. So I'm right here with you.
Hello! I understand from personal experience how life can seem overwhelming and not worth living sometimes. I know it can be easy to get into a rut and it seem hopeless to ever get out of that rut, which seems to only fuel the despair even more.       In my personal experience, taking medicine only made my situation worse with side effects while doing nothing beneficial, and that I did better getting off medicine, and going outside, getting some exercise every day, cleaning up my diet, minimizing screen time, settling into a daily routine, volunteering in my community to get my mind off me and my sorrows, etc. This isn’t to say you should come off your medications without talking to your doctor – I am only sharing my experience and what worked for me. And I did it consulting with my doctor the whole time. Trying to focus on blessing others was the biggest thing for me because it took my mind off me, and helped keep my problems in perspective – and actually gave my life more meaning. It helped remind me everyone has problems, and it isn’t like everyone else’s life is perfect like it seems on the surface sometimes.        When I get into these kind of funks, I have also made an effort to write out lists of what I do right and what I am thankful for. Just 1-2 things a day every day. I made myself come up with something. It was sometimes painful. Sometimes I couldn’t come up with anything. I made myself do it each day. No matter how mundane. I can breathe. I can talk. The things I can do and may take for granted because not everyone can do these things.        Over time, the combination of all of the above lifted me up to a point I was in a better mindset to function in life. Then other things like keeping up on the house and taking care of yourself will probably fall into place on their own much more naturally.       I would consider getting your car registered though. Depending on what state you live in, you don’t want more fees or penalties for each month you put it off. Accomplishing that small task may help you feel better about yourself. You don’t have to change your whole life in one day…you didn’t get here overnight, but if you do one small task and feel good about it, then it may propel some positive momentum to help get you out of this funk.        As far as your relationships, counseling is what I would consider if it is me. If it was me and just one friend I was pushing away, maybe I would see it differently and try to make up with my friend, but if it was me and a pattern in my life that I couldn’t seem to overcome despite being aware of the pattern and wanting it to change and not seemingly being able to on my own, I would definitely consider counseling to help me overcome my problem. It is commendable that you are open to this step.       As far as insurance, I know counseling can be expensive, even if someone does have insurance or even more so if they don’t. With Covid-19, there has been so much more tele-health and virtual counseling, which for some places, has driven the cost down compared to an in person session. Other counseling places have sliding scales based on your income, and some have reduced prices with Covid-19 with the uptick in people seeking their services. I might check and see if there is anything online and how that compares price wise. If it was me, I would also check into any sliding scale places in your community.        If it was me, I might just call a place up and see what they have to say. If it is too expensive or doesn’t work for me for whatever other reason, I would be honest about it and ask if they could refer me to somewhere that better meets whatever the issue is. They probably know of some options in your community to connect you with even if they don’t have anything to offer themselves that works for you. Especially if it is an affordability issue, many are happy to refer to places that accommodate financial constraints.       With so many more virtual counseling sessions available now than ever before due to the pandemic, you may be able to find affordable options outside your geographical area that you wouldn’t be able to normally consider if you were limited to in-person options in your community.       A life coach might also be an option that is less expensive than a professional licensed counselor if you are just looking for guidance on the relationship aspects and your medications are overseen by an existing professional.   I will be keeping you and your wife in prayer.

Hi,  I'm not really sure where else to go with this, a friend of mine has kinda just disappeared for over a day now and usually when this happens they're active \*somewhere\* still. This time, they've had no online activity for the entire time, and its honestly got me really worried cause I cant get in contact and they were in a really bad mood the last time I heard from them. I'm kinda assuming the worst right now sadly as thats what my brain does - i left so much unsaid and it's gonna pain me for the rest of my life if i'm correct - but what should I do? what can I do? they live like 100 miles away so its not like i can go find them...  &#x200B;  thanks.

If no one knows where he/she is call the police. Hope you find him/her safe
thank you for reaching out here. try to breathe....  think of where they were last talking to you, the last person who may have talk talked to them or seen them.  can you reach a family member of theirs or a person near where that person was to be located  miles away.  they could be just mad and need space, maybe not the worst.
you dont think it'd be an overreaction or anything? i'm seriously tempted but i dont know if its going too far... if it is all okay they're only going to kick off on me, but then im scared as it.  ty for your advice though
i just heard from the police. they're gone. thanks for your words though. i missed out on saying so much, i loved them and never got to say. i appreciate your support.
If someone is missing contact the police immediately, if it's everything ok they will have good news to deliver, they won't be mad at you if you are legitimate, and you are, do this quickly, when sooner the better.
How are you?  I hope it all works out...
thank you for your earlier advice. i contacted the police and they called me back not long ago, she has taken her own life. thank you for helping me out earlier.
not the best. appreciate the follow up, have been having to tell so many people what's happened - and surprisingly got invited to the funeral. don't speak any polish so i don't know how it'll go but...I'll get closure? spent so much money feeling better tho, and managed to get the character she wanted on the game so...it's something?
Sorry to hear that, if you need something I'm here for you.

So I have anxiety/depression which I take fluoxetine for.  I've been on it since I was around 17, now 27...so 10 years :/  It helped initially but I feel like it makes both the painful and good feelings numb in equal amounts - I don't feel consumed by my emotions, but I also don't feel very 'alive. I feel like I'm just going through the motions, trying to have fun where I can, but I never feel excited about things or like there's anything to look forward to or strive for. I don't know if this is just the drug or a symptom of many years of supressing my desires/not fulfilling my goals in life, which is a hard thing to deal with and accept and maybe I just kind of try not to think about it.   I tried another drug called sertraline but it made me nauseous, so I didn't keep taking it, but I did feel  really different in my mood - like I could remember the feeling of excitement/joy again.  Anyway not asking for straight up medical advice here cos I do have a doctor, just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience on this drug and what else they've tried.

Yeah, good point.  I don't drink a lot but I should probably avoid it more.

I am never able to come forward at work. I keep making some mistakes or the other and keep getting negative feedback all the time... It has mentally affected me tremendously and I am almost always stressed. I don't have the option to change jobs either. Now I don't find any motivation to work or to do anything. Please advise me on how to stop feeling so bad everytime I screw up. Much appreciated :)

Find something you are good at. It doesn’t need to be much, maybe just something random like caring for money plants. Then focus on that thing and practise it. In the case of the money plant, just take one to your work place and care for it. Whenever you feel bad, just know that the one thing you are good is still there. You can’t be a total failure if you have something to succeed at.
Thank you for your reply. It makes sense. And your reply means a lot to me. Will do the something similar :)
By the way, I’m no professional, but I hope this will help.
Your welcome. Message me or reply to this post if you want to talk
Sure thank you! Means a lot to me. And likewise. I too would love to hear you out incase you wanna talk

Two minutes of working on it is better than no minutes.   You deserve a clean, safe, healthy place.   I had black mold growing on a wall for years cuz I never moved a basket of random shit. I don't want that to happen to you, kind internet stranger.  Keep at it, even if it's not all at once.
You're doing a great deed. It isn't as simple as just cleaning your room, you're cleaning your psyche. Every tiny amount of space you organize in your room represents a bit of your spirit.  You are pursuing something meaningful and facing the dragon of chaos. Keep it at and God bless!
Imagine all the space for activities when you cleaned up lol you can be like me who cries on floor
Throw on a good tv show and get cleaning! You got this. You’ll feel so good once it’s clean.
Small steps, every little bit counts!  😊 i am 55 have major depression disorder and it took me a long time to get my living space the way i have it now, neat and calming.    Play a good song and work through that.  Then another.  Wordless “work music” on youtube can also be helpful to get you into the flow.    Boxes or laundry baskets are easier to toss stuff into than garbage bags - one for trash, one for stuff that belongs elsewhere, one for donation.  The stuff to put away is easier to deal with if you treat the basket like a bus, walking it in a circle through the house and dropping “passengers” off where they live.    Everything you keep needs a “home” where it goes when it is not in use. (Preferably put of sight, and placed, not crammed in.)  Making decisions can be mentally and emotionally taxing.  Have a simple rule, like “have i used this in the past six months?” to help you decide what to keep.  Or if it’s sentimental, “does this give me joy?” (If not, let it go.  There is a whole book by Marie Kondo called “the magic of tidying up” on this idea of joy in the home, might be helpful later.)    if you just can’t make decisions about some of the stuff today, another tactic is to box it and store it, but put a date on it 6-12 months from now.  if you don’t go into that box for something before the deadline, that’s a solid indication you don’t need what is in there.  Maybe just toss it without opening it again after that date.  For clothes, turn all your hangers backwards today, then put them back the regular way after you wear/wash.  After a few months, the ones still hanging backward are candidates for donation.  Future maintenance and housekeeping can be enjoyable, if you treat them as mindful moments.  Have lots of cleaning cloths and nice-smelling cleaner available, and use daily tasks (like making the bed) as an anchoring ritual.  Most of all, remember that you deserve and *need* a restful, healthy space for yourself.  Everyone does, but even more so for people like us.  Just thoughts, take what you can and leave the rest - depression is a sneaky illness but don’t lose heart.  Luck plays a big part, so don’t feel bad about your illness, but your habits and mindset, which you can control, play a big part.  With a treatment plan (meds if necessary, talk therapy) and good self-care (healthy sleep and eating, moderate exercise), you can still have a long and fulfilling life.  I am happier than ever now, and satisfied looking back on my life.  It can be done!
play your favorite music while you're cleaning! You can do it :)
Go through visually. Pick the treasure out. Literally throw everything else away.
Hey friend, I see that wegmans bag. Proven that youre pretty cool and and deserve every ounce of happiness life has to offer. Clean your place and take pictures. Share with us when you’re done :) I might even try to clean. I’m sick of tripping over my damn garbage. My cat likes the obstacle course at least ...
Just start with one group at time! Like all the boxes, or craft supplies and then go from there
Removing chaos can make room for clarity. Clarity may lead to the next step. Each step you take leaves your bottom farther behind. You can do it.
Set a timer for 10 minutes and then take a 5 minute break and repeat as needed.
Me too. Let's both try to get this done tonight.
My room looks pretty similar so I feel your pain.   I like to start by gathering all my trash, and piling the dishes somewhere. Then I throw everything else into a pile on my bed, sort through it (trash/donate/closet) & work through that pile first. Then I take out the dishes & any remaining trash. And If you have any energy after that, I vacuum and wipe down all the surfaces (floorboards, desk, door handles, etc.)   Remember, you don’t have to do it all in one sitting, if it’s easier just throw away all the trash and then the next day, get started on sorting through items. It’s cliche but try and pick up your items and ask if it really benefits you in any way. Good luck my friend.
Little things add up. Rather than hero days, go for non-zero days. What I mean is that trying to do everything all at once can be overwhelming and often leads to inaction. Instead, I found making sure I do at least something to be much more effective. For example, today pick up five things from the floor if nothing else. Then tomorrow pick up another 5 things, maybe more. It gets easier. You can do it OP!
Don’t know if this is hat you need but here is what I do:  I set a timer for 15 minutes and go ham during thst 15 minutes   Tunes are needed. Playlists generated off of Mika’s song Lollipop, or KC and the sunshine band, are the best. I’m not a disco fan but there’s something about the blindingly bubbly uncompromisingly peppy music that helps. You want nothing with emotional ties to your real life, minor chords, or interesting lyrics that make you think. WAP is a good song for this. 1960’s Cuban instrumental jazz. BOUNCY FUN STUPID energy music.  At the end of the timer, you can go again if you’re feeling it or take a 15 min break.  Repeat until it stops feeling like self care.  I’ve developed this method over years and it works really well for me.
my room doesn't look like this, but my life kinda does. So many loose ends and unfinished projects.
You can do it!! Just focus on some small section in the room and then go from there. (My depression finally backed off enough for me to try to clean a bit, after 2yrs. I'm still working on it.) Focusing on one thing at a time, taking small breaks so you don't get overstimulated/ overwhelmed and making a list helped a lot. That way you can see what you've done so far & it feels great once you accomplish it & check it off the list. Keep up the great work!! I hope I was some help. Probably not, but I wanted to share what worked for me. :) Btw, congrats on even getting into the mind frame of cleaning. That's a big start.
Focus on small tasks. Just take it a bit at a time, and remember, there's no rush.  &#x200B;  I saw a post by a woman on Tik Tok about a "game" she plays to help with her cleaning when overwhelmed after a depression episode and her room being a mess.   &#x200B;  Each item you have has a home-"Oh, my hair brush goes here. My socks go in this drawer."  &#x200B;  Once you've assigned the places for your things, or their "home," cleaning becomes much easier. You simply put things back in their place.  &#x200B;  My room is a hot mess right now. But, my goal is to do some laundry today. I have a big pile. Instead of getting the huge pile downstairs to the washer and dryer, I take it in small loads at a time just so i'm not overwhelmed.   &#x200B;  Do what works for you. It takes time to figure it out, but you'll find exactly what works. I'm proud of you for posting and being vulnerable-asking for genuine help. I hope that I may have provided some help <3
What I like to do is first work on things that are going to have a visible impact. Like the floor, or the bed. Once that is done, take a deserved break and come back to the next thing. And so forth and so on. Sometimes just starting helps get the motivation going, sometimes you need to listen to your body when you need a break. Just understand that whatever you are capable of doing is still awesome. You can do this, you got this.   You are good.  You are great.   You are worth it!
Do it for the cat
I like to set a timer for myself for 5 minutes, and then I push myself to clean for the full 5 minutes. Then I set another timer for 20 minutes and play a video game or something. Then I repeat the cycle. When you've done that for a few hours, you'd be amazed how much you can get done.
It took time (I'm assuming days) to get that way, so don't feel bad if it takes time (even days) to get back to a good state.  Just do a little, like getting the stuff that is clearly trash, and call it a day. Then tomorrow do a little more, (like the desk), and the day after tomorrow a little more (ex. laundry).  It takes time to make a mess, so give yourself time to clean it.
One little step at a time... you will be so proud of yourself when you are all done ;)
I suggest listening to comedians while you work. I like demetri martin and steven wright alot.
Although it sucks to think about how you got there, enjoy the liberating feeling of being strong enough to even start! Don't push yourself to finish today. Do as much as you feel comfortable and willing. Know that this is an incredible start. You are not only cleaning and decluttering your room, but your thoughts and soul as well.
Keep working you got this!! Try to keep yourself busy it helps distract yourself.
U GOT THIS!!!
A lot of edm, ncs, helluva boss song( I don’t know why it makes me feel like a badass), I have a crap ton of music that just puts me in a trance where after I’m done I feel slightly better
A lot of edm, ncs, helluva boss song( I don’t know why it makes me feel like a badass), I have a crap ton of music that just puts me in a trance where after I’m done I feel slightly better
You got this!!! Take one action at a time. I usually start with playing some music. Then drinking some water. Then chose a category, I usually start with trash first. Because that's obvious, easy, and it always just goes in the trash. Awesome job!! Then pick a new category. If that seems too much, break that down into more categories. Smaller quests make it easier to manage. Don't look at it as one big project. You got this!!! Lets see after photos!!!!
The way I’m usually able to clean is by dividing my room into sections, then dividing each section into smaller tasks that make it more manageable. Like if I want to clean my floor, I’ll have these sections: pick up clothes, put clothes away, put away art supplies, vacuum... etc. I often have bags of stuff that sits forever, so I treat each bag as a task. Then I have a BUNCH of boxes to check that makes it feel like I’m making progress, even if it’s slow.
You’re doing great!!! The fact that you can see the floor and already see the area opening up is great progress!! love to see it, good luck!!
good on you bro! when im tidying i like to sort things into: whats trash, what needs to be cleaned, and what can be put away. it makes things a little easier, as just looking at the mess can be a little overwhelming. baby steps still mean that you are moving
Hey! I have some tips for cleaning that really helped me. First off, start with one type of item, I usually do biggest, like Clothes or Trash. I keep working on the clothes/trash/etc. until it’s all grouped or organized, and then I move onto something else. Sometimes I work from the top down, working on surfaces, like tops of dressers, the floor, and just ignore what’s in the dressers until a later date or time. Background noise, like music or your favorite show are always good at keeping the boredom away, and remember, breaks are always okay!
This may sound silly, but I’ve found Marie Kondo inspirational.
I always have boxes from deliveries, so I try to roughly sort stuff with them. Keep going!
If you’re going to procrastinate, procrastinate by cleaning another area of the room.
I try to make some fun out of it and do it by colors, give it a try :)
I feel that.It was like a hurricane had passed through my room. Little by Little everything change
The amount of gratitude your going to have after it will motivate a better day. Keep on keeping on
I am so proud of you! I know how hard this can be and it's hard to stay motivated. Just remember to take food and water breaks?
Just gotta slowly chip away. Progress is progress. You got this.
Yo got it one task at a time and ride the momentum. I just did the same thing couple days ago and feels so good!
Turn on something fun on the tv or YouTube on your phone if you don’t have a tv in there. Make like a list in your mind and find certain things you can do. Such as first gather and toss all trash, next gather all laundry, then gather every lost item and put it in a pile, then sort the pile into smaller piles you can put away in their respected locations, then dust, vacuum, etc.. You can do it in one day or spread it out if it’s easier! Think of it as getting one task of your cleaning done at a time rather than a huge project at once. Be proud of every thing you accomplish no matter how small cause it is still a step forward.  Edit: Fix grammar and spelling.
You can do this. You will be able.
Listen to a nice podcast!
Do a little at a time. It’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed and take your time. You deserve to feel proud of yourself for standing up and taking action, even if just for a moment.  I’m a huge fan of making three piles/boxes: keep, trash, and donate. Moving the clutter into 3 piles puts me at ease and makes it much easier to clean.
What helps me out when I get like that is a saying that goes something like "one of the best presents you can give yourself is a made bed/clean room" it's always nice climbing into a nice made bed at the end of the day especially when you feel like crap and you're done with it all.
honestly, some good tunes and the thought of how much better you will feel waking up to a clean environment is all it takes for me (and ive gotten far worse than this, trust me)     your mileage may vary though, im a metal head and metal music gets me pumped if i let it.
I so want to jump into this room and clean it for you !! lol I know, I am a weirdo - I love tidying my room when I feel a little energy return after a long spell of down days. I can't wait to see the "after" pics!! We're all cheering you on from the sidelines !! :-D
Music!
A room that is clean gives you a feeling of relaxation, plus doing some cleaning will help you achieve something on that day and give you great rewarding satisfaction. Good luck.   Keep up the good work and never stop wanting to get better.
This will be a quicker job than you think!  Grab a large box, put everything laying on the floor in it and spend 10 minutes here and there putting things back gradually. Before you know it - bam, much improved space and headspace!
One thing I’ve found that helps is just clearing the floor and vacuuming. It’s amazing how much better the room looks and then I feel good enough that I take that as my win for the day and clean off surfaces later.
You got this.
You can do it!!!  Take it one step at a time !!
It’ll feel so good once you’re done. Small steps.
My room is a mess and I'm losing everything.
i feel you on this im hiding 3 big holes in my wall in my room i hope everything gets better for you
Someone else probably said this but start with one thing. Put one piece of rubbish in the bin for example. Like when you want to read a book. Read one word, then one line. The problem I think alot of people have is they think too big. Baby steps.
If depressed , seek a therapist.  Lower the heat if you can't wake up in the morning.  Start exercising!  It dies wonders for tge mind.

Was planning to reply to everyone later when I had tired myself out but I just had to stop and say how much I love this comment. Something mondaine for some is heroic for others. And damnit I can be my own prince charming!
Somewhere in Canada, Jordan Peterson is smiling because of this!
Haha didn't even realize that was visible exactly why I'm cleaning though will definitely post afters even if I'm not fully content with it I'm still proud of what ever progress I can make
Find a better place than a motherfucking mental health subreddit you thoughtless, insensitive dickhead.
I'm happy that you appreciate my comment. :) How's the room? How are you holdin' up?
I sure hope so! He's my hero. :)
Up close sections mean you can record individual sections of mess then progress. A lot better than trying to take in a whole room at once. Good luck!!
Room is coming along. I've slowed down but I'm still motivated so on we march
Mine too. Can't wait for his new book. Take care 🦞
Just chiming in to say when you feel it becoming too much, remember it’s a step at a time, one piece at a time. It’s what I do on bad days. Just remind myself to do one action - get out of bed, okay now I’m up, might try to brush my teeth. Showering too much, screw it just wash my face. My dad used to say this all the time “How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.”

24 years young, cybersecurity grad, CompTIA certified, living in Northern Virginia, renovating a house in West Virginia for my mom to move into.   It’s at $800/month mortgage, utilities is around $300. Financing a $20k HVAC unit at 0% interest for 24 months, deck project is roughly $26k. I have about $20k going towards the deck, I have $5k in my own checking.   My mom is getting $700 in SSDI and my brother is getting $700 so in total it’s $1400.   I’m getting $2k a month at my job..   I want to be independent and my mom understands that but she wants to leave the welfare system and live in a house. She said either she will move there and make payments or we will put the house under Section8 and I rent it out to her and she pays.   Then I can go on my own and move or do whatever I want.. but I feel like I’m on the brink of being house-poor and it’ll take me a long time to get my dream car.. I hate the Corolla I have now. It’ has big fender damage, hood dent,  door dent, stained seats..it drives but my passion is to drive a nice VW or Civic and throw some cosmetic and performance mods, join a car crew...   My peers keep telling me that I’ll get offers as soon as I get my clearance but I don’t know if it’ll be any different than applying to public sector jobs..  I feel like the only thing I can do is wait for the renovations to be done, move the stuff there, and then I can finally be free... but chasing all these materialistic things..  will I just be tired and long gone, disinterested in everything that I used to just want, just like how I lost interest in video games, movies and tv shows.   It’s all just fixated on getting certificates to get a better job, my head hurts writing all this.   TL;DR- caught in a financial mess while chasing goals and money...

When I was in a financial mess I try sitting Infront of my laptop with an excel sheet. Track all your income and expenditure and try painting a picture. Start allocating money to different things like. 200$ for food 100$ for bills Etc Keep a small amount for savings and for yourself. Soon you'll find clarity  Hope this helps
Yes, I was thinking of $500 towards a Roth IRA, $250 towards getting my dream car, and the rest will go towards getting my own house for rent or mortgage, etc.
Yes awesome. In my country we don't go by dollars, I had just given an example. Hope I didn't confuse you :P

If you ask me for a favor I can almost always provide something for it. I can be given a lot of homework and I can still know the solutions to all of it.  I know how to draw and I've improved a lot since I've started. If I try to learn a craft or skill, I get used to it very quickly (crochet, swimming, knitting, coding, math, new recipes, etc). My grades are always relatively high and I'm always one of the people at the top of my class. I'm a computer science student and this is 100% a course I want to be in, when people want to buy me things, I tend to say I don't really want much. I've also regularly been told by people that I'm conventionally attractive. I can open up to my family a bit more now compared to the past. I get to eat three meals a day, I get to have a bed, I get to have 4 cats...and yet...its still there...the feeling that being alive physically hurts. Lately, every time I do homework, I end up crying and screaming until I can finish it. It got to a point where I've actively avoided homework cuz even if I can get the job done in high quality...the process hurts too much.     I still get urges to slam my head on a wall or just die and constantly feel the need to hold it back. I can't sleep early because my chest feels heavy and I become very uneasy and restless and resort back to screaming. I've been holding back the urges to scratch myself as well. Whether or not I get the chance to wake up early, I still have no will to get up in the morning...every time I wake up...I go back to sleep...and when I force myself to get up, I end up crying again. The only time my mind is at peace is when I'm asleep and sometimes it feels like its better I don't wake up. I loved drawing but now every time I do it, I want to cry. I used to help around the house all the time but now whenever I try to do anything I start getting anxiety and my heart becomes heavy again. I keep being told that I should just keep fighting it but it hurts so much...I seeked therapy to know the answers as to why I feel this way but therapist just told me I wasn't grateful enough which is why I'm unhappy, and that I can't do my homework cuz I don't know how to manage my time. And that I should just sleep earlier and wake up earlier. And that I should help around the house to be more helpful to my family and to stay distracted. And that I should talk to my pets more (but I've already done that regularly). She told me to exercise but exercise always makes me cry as well.     I want to stop having to distract myself all the time...I want to stop having to "fight it" all the time. I don't want to have something to constantly fight...cuz it hurts so much. Whenever I say that they think I'm giving up, but that's not what I mean. I just want to be able to sit down in pure quiet...and not have my heart start to sink again. I just want to be able to stay with my cats on a quiet sunny day and not feel like breaking down for no reason. I just want to stop having something to fight back.     Imagine hanging on a cliff...and you just keep hanging on it...and for some reason you never fall down. Even if you never fall down...it still hurts hanging on it forever. You're putting all your strength to get over the cliff but the best you can do is only hang on to it. People keep telling you that you're strong because you keep hanging, and every time you say you want to stop hanging cuz it hurts already, they just keep asking you to keep hanging and that if you've done it before you can keep doing it. They keep telling you they're there so you can keep hanging, and that they'll help you keep hanging. You say that hanging hurts and it hurts having to stay hanging so they distract you from it...they just keep distracting you so you don't have to think about hanging...but every time the distractions stop you're reminded that you're still hanging. You tell them that you want to get over the cliff so badly but they tell you that you're not trying hard enough. That you have to keep trying. You're amazing for never falling and sometimes you want to fall just to prove that you're not, just so they could believe that even if you keep accomplishing this...you're still in pain...you're still hanging on a cliff. You're doing your best...but your best isn't enough.

I am a 25 year old female and have had success in my grip twice over the last five years. I had my dream job and my dream relationship in my grips and sabotaged them both or lost them both to circumstances that were either my fault or a combination of struggles mixed in with the stress of opportunity. I have and am still struggling to overcome crippling anxiety, alcoholism, and the fear of failure because I know I am capable of failing. But at the same time I already blew great opportunities and I feel like maybe that was it? Maybe god dealt me a hand and I fucked it up and now it’s downhill from here. I worry that years from now I’ll still be regretting what I am now and that the golden years have passed and I am a fuck up. I’m not worth happiness because the things I’ve been offered I have ruined and that I’m not going to be worthy of or succeed again because you can only have so much beauty until it’s run out and your chances are spent. Anyone else feel this way? Do things get better even after feeling like you failed in love and career and I would change it if I could go back and change it but I can’t. That helplessness of feeling like I learned a lesson the hard way but was already hurting to much to see the good when it was in front of me. What a cruel idea...

hang onto the fact that you managed to achieve those things in the first place. most people never even get close to their dream job. youre only 25! you got the whole rest of your life to have new dreams, new partners, new jobs. you probably feel like you peaked already but the truth is that what goes up, must come down. as cliche as it sounds, lifes a rollercoaster and nothing stays the same. you will be happy again.

I know a lot about failure. I've been close friends with her for a while, but think about it this way. You didn't fail you just found ways that do not work for you. Also I just want to say that your feelings are completely valid. Hope it all gets better.
Same
I’ve been there and I’m there often. It ebbs and flows for me. It’s really important to find out why you’re feeling this way in the first place I think. It doesn’t get rid of it but it does help you recognize how you can sometimes be upset for no reason (subconsciously blaming yourself for a bad event etc.).  And telling these people will help all of you. They may see you moping around and think “jeez this kids got a shitty attitude” because they just don’t know what you’re going through. So tell them, maybe they don’t care but maybe they do. But it’s not just for them, it’s to help you come to terms with the fact that you do have a problem and you won’t react the same way to situation as someone who doesn’t struggle with this.  The first step is honesty my dude, to yourself, your family, your loved ones.  It’s no a fix all but it’s points you in the right direction.  I hope you’re doing alright now, if you wanna chat more you can pm me. I realized halfway through this that I have no idea on your circumstances so some of my tips may not apply to you, so if you’d like an outlet I’m more than happy to help you out :)

I’ve always struggled with depression but about a year and half ago my partner of 7 years left me and I’m spending quite a bit of time alone since then. My weekends used to be so fun but now I absolutely despise them. I start getting anxiety on Wednesday and spend the entire weekend depressed. I don’t have a lot of friends and often find myself bored. I tried finding hobbies but it sometimes makes me feel even more alone. Or I don’t have the motivation to do them. Does anyone have any advice, or at least feel the same way?

No advice, but you’re not alone.
I will start by saying, I totally feel you. When you’re lonely and depressed, weekends can be rough. You feel like you should be enjoying them but they drag on, and hobbies aren’t as entertaining when you do them because you are killing time.  Worse now for winter climates, and worse yet covid. Ugh. I’ve been watching a lot of tv but I feel like I’m wasting my time. I have hobbies that I think I enjoy, but I can’t get motivated to do them. I’ve done woodworking for years, but when you don’t have anyone to show off your work to, it seems pointless. Same for learning how to play my guitar. I was thinking about this earlier today... I think I’m going to start spending my weekends taking my dog on road trips. See how far I can get. I’ve never traveled solo very far. Would be easier if I didn’t have a 9-5 M-F. Just a matter of keeping within a reasonable proximity and sticking to dog friendly destinations.
You’re definitely not alone. I went through a breakup last September & i would always spend every weekend or random weekdays with gf. Even if it was nothing I was always with her & we had so much fun lounging around. I’m so depressed but even more so because I can’t go out or see friends. She was my person during covid & now I’m alone. Weekends are the worst. I feel so u productive because a lot of times I sleep all day. Mind you, I wake up randomly & feel shitty about being unproductive. My goal for the last several months has been to deep clean my room but I don’t even have the motivation for that. I hope I can do it soon so I can make a cute little space in my room & start learning how to sew. So no, you are not alone friend. Sorry I don’t have advice really.
Thank you for making me feel a little less alone.
I’m sorry to hear you’re going through the same thing. It sucks.

I just feel like sometimes i might just be lying to myself, or that im overvaluing my emotions. like, there are voices in my head telling me i dont have anything wrong with me, that im not depressed, i just need to suck it up and move on, and as much as i try to ignore that, i cant help but feel like maybe that part is right. i feel like i dont even deserve to call myself "depressed."      im not sure what im trying to do with this post. all of the support you can give would help immensely. thank you in advance. because there is a semi-realistic chance i cant respond.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kwa1z6/dont_want_to_just_sit_around_and_let_my_pets_die/
I’ve had a lot of pets throughout my childhood and most of them have passed, and I’m down to my last few, I have a pug and a chihuahua and in the last couple of months I’ve been trying to spend more time with them then I have in the passed but they don’t seem to like to be around me as much anymore despite my efforts, but that is beside the point  Although both are fairly healthy and are constantly getting love by the rest of my family, it hurts me so much to know they are most likely getting close to the end of their life, of course this is an issue about every pet owner goes through but it pains me even more to know I am sitting around and not doing anything about it, to know that every day it gets closer and closer. I have begun to hate the movement of time more and more these couple months but what can you do about it really. In general what am I supposed to do? Even if I put my heart in soul everyday into finding a cure for the death of my pets, it frankly is an insane goal and quite near impossible, and if by some miracle it were to happen, would that really be a good thing? To find a cure for death? To not allow more life to form?  I don’t want my pets, or any animals to die for that matter, but I also can’t see it being good that they live forever either. No matter how much I think of this issue, I never can find a solution or a decision I feel content with, I always just end up conflicted. Has anyone else felt this way before? Would really appreciate the help, thank you.  I should also add in that those who spend their time to help people in these types of communities are amazing. Thank you for all you do for others.

I don't think Im really reaching out for any reason other than just to write it down somewhere, which hopefully will help....I dunno why, it just seems like what I need to do.  So basic background- I'm pretty sure that most of my life (I'm 33 yrs old), including my childhood, I have been battling many occurances of undiagnosed episodes of moderate to severe depression.  I believe (this is all self-diagnosed by the way), that due to years of having these episodes go unchecked, by the time I reached my early-20's it has developed into me living in a near constant dysthymia, with rare and short occurances of "normalcy" between long dysthymia episodes, yet with FAR more episodes of clinical depression episodes between the less severe dysthymic ones.  By my mid-late 20's, I felt that I may have started to be on the cusp of developing Boarderline Personally Disorder...by this time my general personality and temperament had drastically changed from what I viewed as my normal.  I was helped during this timeframe of my life by various sources.  One was a pet cat, that was originally a girlfriend's cat.  I had to be the one to keep the cat most of the time as a kitten, therefore he took a strong bonding to me, and I kept him after we split up.  Another thing that helped me was kinda developing an alter ego at work.  I was working as a line cook and a lot of the staff got nicknames that we "earned" from our coworkers.  By playing up to my nickname, I was able to be more outgoing and socially confident, as opposed to my usual shyness that might otherwise overwhelm my social interactions.  This nicknamed followed me to two other restaurants, so it helped me for a good few years.  Another big thing that helped me was being more in tune with my body.  I could usually tell 2 or 3 days in advance that I was going to have a severe depression episode...while not being able to do much to prevent it, it gave me the opportunity to prepare for  them...this meant that I could avoid drinking, avoid going to crowded places (I was starting to develop minor anxiety issues, rarely, during this time), let my friends and loved ones know that I would be in an episode soon, etc.  I feel VERY fortunate that I was able to sense most of my major episodes coming on beforehand.  After my most recent girlfriend and I broke up, I feel like I am less in tune with myself than I used to be.  My anxiety is pretty common.  My shyness is about the worse that it has ever been.  I don't have the sense of forewarning that once had in regards to major episodes coming on.  While her and I were together, she had the hunch that I showed Bi Polar traits (she was diagnosed with severe Bi Polar disorder at a young age, was medicated, and regularly saw a therapist).  Her hunch lead her to believe that I was cyclothymic.  I always shrugged off what she saw as my possible mild manic episodes, was just me feeling like I normally feel without depression/dysthymia episodes.  She viewed the "natural high" feeling that I would get rarely was very mild mania; whereas I felt that it was just because I was so used to being in some sort of depressive episode, that when I wasn't under any sort of hormonal/mental state, I seemed/felt more elated than the "average" person in a "normal" state. After celebrating news years recently, I feel like I did have a pretty bad dysphoric mania episode.  It's hard to say whether it was caused by an underlying condition (bipolar or cyclothymia) or mainly caused my a bad depression coming on while drunk.  But it has got me thinking that maybe my ex-gf was right.  Anyways on to what is really driving me to write this down right now.  Im in a severe episode right now...this one is a triggered episode, as opposed to one of my "unbalanced" episodes.  I was attacked pretty bad my cat this evening, no permanent damage, but really messed up my arms/hands.  He has always had a territorial problem with other cats, despite him being raised around other cats and dogs, and us waiting until the recommended time (to allow proper socialization) before taking him from his mother and litter mates.  Anytime a stray cat is by the window or door (with the solid door open and screen door closed), he completely freaks out.  He goes into pure attack mode and loses all recognition of anything. Anything moving becomes an enemy, and if you lock eyes with him, he will likely go to attack you.  This is the third time of him attacking me this viciously (with quite a few other times of be able to avoid him attacking) and I can't have it anymore.  He is too dangerous to keep.  He would have gone for my face had I not protected myself.  And had he done this to my mother or grandfather whom we all live together, then the damage would have much worse.  Had he turned on the dog, a little shaggy mutt, then he likely would have done severe damage to her as well.  Luckily when he attacked this time, we were in my bedroom while I was watching a movie.  Had it been in the living room, who knows who he would have gone for.  It is unsafe enough for me alone to have him around, let alone for the rest of the household.  Giving him up for adoption is likely a bad idea.  For the obvious reason that he could be a potential danger to anyone who takes him.  What if a family adopts him, then he freaks out by a stray there and attacks a small child or elderly person?  Second, he is WAY to attached to me, and I feel like that nomatter where he ended up, he would fall under severe depression.  He's not a young cat, and having his last few years filled with anxiety, depression and of wondering why I abandoned him, seems cruel.  Obviously abandoning him somewhere would be even more cruel.  I feel that my only real solution is to have him euthanized.  This will absolutely destroy me to the soul.  He's helped me through some of my darkest times, and possibly has been the final factor of me pushing on past some of my most suicidal times.  But I truly fear that he will one day go my eyes, and if I'm not prepared, he just may get one/them.  And I really fear for the risk he may have on attacking my mom or grandpa.  I love him more than anything, but any other solution just seems cruel to him.  He completely loses him mind when he gets territorial like this, he has nearly attacked my mom a couple of times, and I wouldn't trust him to stay with anyone without fear of him attacking them.

My name is Luna and I am 24. I have been suffering from depression, anxiety and OCD for as long as I can remember. My childhood memories are filled with the fear I felt towards death, losing my parents, getting kidnapped. I am triggered by my childhood house. I also had a pretty unstable house growing up, there was a lot of shouting, fights, broken plates. My dad used to hit me until I was 18 or so. It wasn't frequent but I was scared for my life on many occasions. He would get mad and stop the car in the middle of the road just because I said something as a kid. He had a temper that I could see he hated me in his eyes. Yet, the next day he would be caring and kind. He was always unstable, he still is. I never felt safe in my own house. It took years of therapy to understand how my mind has been so dark for so long. I am still in therapy. I am currently on SNRI, SSRI, Xanax and Olanzapine. I have been on and off medication for 10 years now. My dad still doesn't accept my depression. My family still doesn't understand how much I am suffering. I am a STEM nerd at heart. Even though, I had to take 2 years of gap year in university, I am currently trying to get my bachelor degree in Physics at a prestigious university. I was always been so interested in so many things from stars to microbiology. Lately, I have such a hard time getting out of the bed and I keep crying myself to sleep. I just feel so alone and tired. I am constantly scared. I need someone who still has hope for greater things in life such as love, art, science. I need to share this undying fire that burns within me that is actually in love with the smallest candle light. I don't wanna be alone anymore. I sleep thinking slitting my wrists to so that I can breathe easily for once. Write to me if you want to get to know me.

Hey I relate to many things you said. I’m in my 20’s and I’ve had depression and OCD all my life. It’s never been easy. These past years I’ve also developed anxiety and physical illnesses. You’re not alone in how you feel. I wanted to tell you that I’m very proud of you. You’ve been through so much and you still have such a light shining within you. Never lose sight of those dreams, please. I know you can achieve them, because I can tell you’re truly passionate. I know things are hard now, but if you hold onto your dreams and, very important, don’t neglect your self esteem and self care, you’ll be in a much better place in the future. It’s a long road, it’s step by step, but you’ll do it. You’re doing wonderful asking for help. Advocate for yourself and love yourself because you deserve it. I can’t tell you how much my utter lack of self esteem and care has ruined me, so I emphasise on this. If you start going too much down that road, ask for help. Again and again.   I’m sorry if I can’t do much more to help you. I don’t have the mental capacity to keep up with people and I’m isolating myself from everyone. But you deserved to know that you’re amazing and you probably don’t see it, so take it from a stranger.
I started crying as I read this. I always hated myself for so long and to hear someone saying that I am passionate, instead of me saying to myself that I am useless piece of shit is just something so important to me. I am trying so hard to understand and love me but it is so hard and I am failing way too often. I will keep reading this message as I get lost in this journey. I am thankful that you took your time write this. I understand that you are going through hard times and looking after yourself is merely enough. If you ever wanna talk, I am here. Sending lots of love.

I can sense that my sister is starting to be depressed again, she started to tell me that she might indeed be depressed again or she mightve been anxious lately due to her job. She always had been hating her job but she avoids to resign, my mother would suggest and push her to work everyday, i feel bad for her. i wanted her to be happy and do what she loves which ia playing and cosplaying anime characters, she also recently told me that she's not making friends that she can talk to when it comes to this.  She isnt interested in relationships, she had a bad traumatic experience from his ex.  I suggested her to go and find a therapist, i am not good when it comes to talks like those. but i seriously want her to be happy.  She told me she cant get a therapist, mom would know. Its concerning, she had hallucinations too whenever she sleeps like 2 months ago resulting that she needs to take sleeping pills.  How can i help my sister? can i get any therapists? thats willing to help her? In chats?   I am 19 btw

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kw8bg6/i_think_my_boyfriend_has_depression_how_can_i/
Here are the signs I have noticed: -he has gained 40lbs in the past 4 months -he constantly makes comments about his fat and insecurity -he stopped going to the gym  -he stopped paying attention to his fish tanks -his room gets quite messy -he has been working two jobs for the past 4 months (around 60-70 hours per week) -in the past month he started working overtime in addition to the standard 40 hours & part time job -within the past 3 months he started playing a game on his phone and it seems like he is addicted. He plays the game sometimes during work, and often talks with his gamer friends. He plays it a lot, and gets defensive when I mention it.  -he said he is stressed  -I tried to tell him he needs to do some self-care, and that’s he’s working too much -he got defensive and said he can’t do that -he seems to get agitated easily while working if something is difficult, or over simple things like not being able to find the shirt he is looking for  However, there have been a couple of positive steps.   -yesterday we went to the gym for the second time in a week and we plan to continue going -his last day at his part time job will be in a couple of weeks -he said that when that job ends, he plans to do a deep clean of his fish tanks -although he is negative sometimes at the gym, he has been working hard and he has made a couple of comments that he will be back at it in a couple of months  All of these issues are leading to some tension in our relationship. I am trying my best to be understanding. It bothers me that he plays his game while working sometimes, and then he needs to stay up very late working in order to complete his projects. To me it’s very clear that if he would put his phone down, his productivity would increase and then he would have more free time (to spend on himself and with me). However, he has made comments that he goes on his phone when the work makes him too stressed.   How can I support him? I can not “tell him what to do” or make assumptions, or he will shut down. I have asked him if he is okay, he said he is fine.

I’ve had depression ever since I can remember. (I’m also diagnosed with OCD and anxiety disorder, and I suspect ADHD). These past years I’ve also developed some physical illnesses that, along with my poor self maintenance, have wrecked havoc on my teeth. Every time I look at myself at the mirror I spiral down to some of the darkest places mentally I’ve known. I know I couldn’t do it, but I’m thinking about suicide often, and I’m scared.  I can’t help but blame myself for letting myself go to this point. All my teeth are severely damaged, my mouth looks like that of an old person. I’m also so so very afraid of going to the dentist. Afraid of catching the virus, afraid because of the cost, afraid because of the judgement. I don’t think my already broken self esteem can take it. I need help, understanding, compassion. Is this all my fault?

I am certainly sure I should seek counselling instead of just posting it here, which I will be doing. But for the time being, I would like some advices on my situation. So here goes....  I feel normal on most days without informations of my friends getting married, engaged, birth of child. However, whenever I see such things I get filled up with feelings of being a shitty crappy and unlovable person. That’s why I’m not married or in an official relationship. I have a partner that we are recently engaging in talks about getting housing together which I assume would eventually lead to marriage? I hope? Idk probably not. I am not good at expressing myself and that’s a understatement cause words are always jumbled up in my head. Just looks at this short passage my thoughts are everywhere. Anyways, just yesterday we were talking on the phone and I really felt insignificant and invisible as though he doesn’t care just because he is always talking about his stuff and ignoring my problems if I were to raise it up. So I did voice out my opinion regarding how I was feeling, and he simply just shut me down by saying it’s up to my judgement to judge if he cares. So basically according to him he used his actions to speak and that’s it, if I feel that he doesn’t care through his actions it’s my fault and there nothing he will say to assure me. I mean a logical person will make sense of his logic, but I can’t, it hurt me so much I had a meltdown i secret behind in back of course.  TLDR: I feel unheard and uncared for by my partner and it sucks. Is it my fault for asking for assurance?

I’m a woman in my late 30s, successful in my career and married. My husband and I haven’t shared love or intimacy in years. We don’t have kids. We have good money, living comfortably and all bills are paid. I am however SO unhappy with life in general. Not to the point where I want a divorce, but to the point where I just don’t want to live. I don’t see what I should live for. I have no real purpose. Nothing to look forward to. No one to leave a legacy for. I am not loved. I wished I never made the decisions I made in life. Maybe I would have ended up in a love-filled marriage? Maybe I would have had children? Maybe I would see purpose in life? I don’t really have any friends either. I’m an introvert with anxiety and I can’t keep friendships because they require so much attention and care. I’m exhausted. I don’t want to live. I wished I could turn back time and be 21 again, and just have another shot at life. Now it’s too late to start over. I’m too old to have children. Too old to find love again with someone who doesn’t already have a family. Too old to change careers. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up anymore. I am so unhappy with life.

Ok so I’m a 12 yo girl and I’ve got a few things I want to say:)  1: It’s never too late to start over, you can always have another shot at things. Like ur dream job.  2: U are not too late for children. My mom had me when she was in her start 40s. (Idk the reason why u think it’s too late, maybe you can answer so I can help🙂)  3: U should live for the small things in life. Like seeing the Christmas lights one more time or to seeing sun set again.   I rlly hope this helped though I don’t know as mutch about the world as you do.
I understand the way your feeling, I have felt it myself but it is never too late.  I have friends in their late 30s and early 40s who have just gotten remarried and having their first kids now. We are now in a world where this is more common than you think and can be done!  Find someone you are comfortable with to speak to and look at what would make you happy. Don’t expect big changes straight away, start small and keep expanding those changes.
We are around the same age and I wish I could hug you. Your words sound like my own leaving my mouth. Tbh I don’t have the same advice I would normally give someone so I’m going to talk to you like I would myself.   Act like your 21, make terrible choices, buy a 1 way ticket And travel alone for a month! From the sounds of it you have the money to fuck up a little bit and still be fine. Kill the self that thinks your stuck, kill the self that thinks you aren’t worthy. Look in the mirror right and now and yell: I AM FUCKING WORTH IT!!! Give your self a month of full on living, be afraid, cry yourself to sleep in a new city all alone and wake up the next morning and explore.   I know how debilitating anxiety coupled with being introverted can be, so I’m sorry if this sounds like a made up fantasy you could never do. But I only tell you this because I myself did this challenge once. I told myself after that month I will kill myself so I might as well try everything opposite of what I’m doing now. I will not sugar coat things and say it’s easy or that it will cure you. But what it might do is wake up that little voice in your head that KNOWS how incredible you are, how deserving of life and love you are. I love you, and I’m so sorry of the place you are in right now. I know that place well and still visit it from time to time. You are so strong and Incredible for posting this. I hope I didn’t come off too strong, I only mean to push you into the world to discover your strength.
You dont need a purpose in life. Just do what makes you happy. It’s ok to live a simple life. The idea that you need to do something grand or you have to have a purpose is overrated. You just need to live. And see the good in the world. Often times it’s so hard to but believe me there is good in this world.
Me too. If you want to hang on discord, I'm around
You'd be surprised how many people feel exactly the same you do now. Unfortunately this is the world we live in. We surround ourselves with comfort and stability and all the pleasures money can provide ignoring the other aspect of life and then realise life is hollow, doesn't bring joy. But as others mentioned it's never too late, I'm not an expert in fertility but I know for a fact having babies is possible after 40. And for sure it's never too late for love. I'm not gonna ask what decisions you've made that you want to change it but believe me there's nobody in this world who wouldn't regret at least one decision in their life. You think you'd change them but you cannot possibly know the outcome, maybe your life would turn out differently maybe not. But there's absolutely no point in torturing yourself over something you cannot change, it's destructive and useless and it takes a lot of energy. You need to think more of what you want and focus on that. My only advice would be to talk to your partner, plainly and honestly about how you feel. I don't know the situation but something motivated you to make a choice to be together so try to remember and hold on to that. If you really feel like your situation is getting out of hand then I'd recommend to try psychological support from a professional. dunno about couples counseling but personal psychotherapy can make a difference when it comes to the perception of life itself. Get a pet if it's possible for you. Animals are often used as therapy in different cases and it's proven to help with depression and anxiety, not to mention you'd have someone who'll give you all the love they can and you'd be their whole world, it's priceless. I hope you'll find my words useful. I also hope you'll get through this and find happiness in your life.
The 12 is on point here.  I’m 42 and Ive got major depression with ptsd and I’m helping my wife with her anxiety and we have similar problems you have. Yeah I worry about it but I started my life with her at 28. I straight up opened a door and she’s been with me since. So don’t let age hold you back.   I say buy a baby yoda and start taking silly pictures. that’s been the only thing keeping me sane this year by looking like a loon.    Like I said the kid is right live for the small things and they will become big things and one day you’ll stop caring  about the stuff that matters to the “world” and start caring about what matters to you
I love this response. It is NEVER too late to be happy. Do not settle for less. Live your life authentically even if that means starting over.

Just here to vent a little. As the title reads, after one really annoying day at work I walked out on my shift thinking I could and deserved better. Two months later with only like $20 dollars in my savings I still don't know what to do, I've been applying everywhere, with little luck. I've been looking online for gigs on Craigslist. Even writing papers for people on Fiverr.    I feel like a loser. Since 2021 began I've been adamant on wanting change and that I refuse to bring this type of negativity into the new year, and I've been doing pretty decently lately...but the thoughts I have remain. I keep thinking I can't do this and without some type of employment I just feel like I have no purpose.  I have 0 plan. Especially since classes are starting back up (or maybe they've already started?) I don't even know anymore. I just know I can't afford to go back to school now. I just desperately want to get back to the financial (and social standing) I was two months ago. I don't know how I let things get so bad.

I’m sorry dude, but you quit your job in the middle of a pandemic, when unemployment is higher than it’s been in years?  Do you think it might be possible for you to get your job back?  You might have to humble yourself but it would be worth it, because I don’t think there are that many jobs available right now.
I also walked out on my shitty job 2 months ago, thought avoiding the covid holiday rush was a good idea. It was, but I became super depressed as well. I'd reccomend you look into temp agencies. Yeah the jobs tend to suck but its better than nothing and they get you in fast. There's also lots of entry level jobs open right now due to seasonals leaving. Depends where you live tho

I seriously hate having such strong anger in me. It’s not worth the bitterness anymore, it’s actually making me physically ill, Ive been having crazy chest pains and aches. It eats away at me but I can’t seem to just let shit go easily right now. Due to my financial situation and moving bk with my parents after a breakup with my son in June, it’s just so clear how much they gas light me. Anyway obviously my step is to get the fuck out of there but as of now I’m not and it’s brining up so much emotion. My parents are making me feel like my Memories are false and I’m holding on to my childhood and how i was raised to have someone to blame for my life. My dad told me this weekend I need severe help and medication with pure digust on his face. Anyway I don’t wana go into it. I know I’m a lot but I’ve had a lot of mental illnesses and talking about them helps and having compassion for things in my past helps me move forward. They just don’t seem to understand anything about me and think I do everything for attention. It makes me doubt my self, doubt if I have depression; makes me wana close up never talk about my feelings but I know it’s when I talk about them is when I feel relieved. I know there my parents but most days I hate them and I’m so sick of family is blood. It’s a load of shit

I am so tired of seeing EVERYONE I see prosper and reach their goals and dreams and I can't, not because I'm lazy or haven't tried or don't want to but because no one will give me a chance - AT ALL. I'm sick of it and I honestly whoeheartedly feel that I would be better if I were dead because my life without achieving my goals and dreams is like **hell.** My problem is that I'm afraid to die by my own hand. I'm fearful of taking pills and not taking enough and ending up in the hospital. I'm fearful of climbing a building and jumping because I'm afraid of heights and of the pain of the fall and what if I survive and end up being permanently hospitalized?   But yeah, that's me for today. I'm tired, tired, TIRED of people rejecting me from reaching my goals and my dreams and so I'm just.....ready to be done. I HATE IT HERE.

The real courage is not giving in to those feelings of harming yourself. We have an illness, and a symptom of it is this desire to kill ourselves. I have had Depression for forty years and I still have thoughts of doing harm to myself. It's not your own feeling. It comes with Depression and you don't have to give in to it.  With the proper medication you can have a productive life. It won't be easy, but you can do it. So tell yourself: I wish I had the courage to keep on living.
If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out. You can find help at a National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  USA: 18002738255 US Crisis textline: 741741 text HOME  United Kingdom: 116 123  Trans Lifeline (877-565-8860)  Others: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines  https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org
I"m wondering what these goals and dreams are that you haven't achieved?  Could you share what they are?   I'm assuming it is that the lack of achieving these goals and dreams that have brought you to the point of thinking life isn't worth living?  Or are there other factors?  I've heard it said that  F-E-A-R has two meanings: 'Forget Everything And Run' or 'Face Everything And Rise' and that the choice is ours.     When you speak of people rejecting you from reaching what you are striving for, how did they achieve this?  Did they intimidate you?  Belittle you?  Just trying to determine what it would take to remove you from this place of fatigue.

my boyfriend told me he’s been struggling with depression for 3 years but in the year we’ve been together he’s never seemed sad or detached. however in the last few weeks he’s seemed withdrawn and uninterested in almost everything. we both go back to college soon & i don’t know what to do to make him feel better before he leaves. is there anything i can do to support him and hopefully help him feel a little bit closer to normal before jumping into the semester?

From experience; no. You can’t help him. All you can do is make sure he knows you’ll stay and that you are there for him. And get him professional help
If it really is Depression it doesn't start and stop. It's there always, but it's a degree of sadness. It's good he can still get to continuing his education.  Remember that he is not really sad. That's a symptom of Depression.  Sometimes he may do something that sabotages his education or work. That too is a symptom. You can help him best by letting him know that this is happening, because he may not be conscious of it himself. This next thing is very important, and i speak from my own experience with Depression. If he suddenly seems "very happy" ask him if he has been thinking of doing any harm to himself.  There is a tremendous amount of relief that a person might experience if they have planned a suicide attempt. I commend you for being there for him.
Just be there for him.  give him tlc.  tell him with a sincere heart that you care about him. that you appreciate him.  that you are glad that he is in your life.  that you are there for him if he needs you and to talk to.  thats the love language people in depression need to hear.  that they are loved regardless.  that they can recover from it (because I have 3 major ones).  let him know that he is valuable and just hug him if he allows you to be close to him.  and ask him if he has anything that he wants to accomplish before he goes.  it may be that he is  reluctant to do school for some reason.  be creative but really gentle in asking questions to figure it out.  reassure him, with your honest heart, your position with him that you care.

I've been supporting my boyfriend throughout this pandemic, and I don't know what to do anymore. He's struggled with severe depression for years and tried many different treatments with not much long term success. I know he's struggling with suicidal thoughts although to the best of my knowledge he is not in imminent risk at the moment. But he is pushing me away, telling me to forget him and find someone new, and not wanting me to come over. He's also been isolating from friends/family, even though I know they've been reaching out to him. For the record, I am his primary support physically nearby. I've tried to help him find a therapist (he won't go), told him I'd support him doing ECT, tried listening judgmentally, reading the research for ideas to share about treatment options, being there for him when he's upset, trying to give him space but still check in, cleaning up when he's not up for it, writing him letters/buying him gifts, helping him get a pet, trying to go on walks or exercise with him...none of it is helping. He appreciates it but he doesn't believe he can get better and won't (at the moment) consider additional treatments beyond the psych meds he's on (I'm glad he's taking something, but it's clearly enough).   So I have two questions:  1. Is there anything else I can do to try and help him? I am at such a loss. I know he needs more help than I can provide and that I can't 'save' him, but I am so afraid of losing him.  2. Does anyone know of support groups or subs for those supporting a person going through severe depression? My local NAMI chapter never got back to me, and another group I tried is currently inactive. I have a therapist but told very few friends about the situation due to privacy reasons and I desperately need more support myself but don't know where to get it.   Thanks to everyone in advance

if he doesnt want to see a therapist, try talking him into seeing a psychiatrist. his meds should be making his depression somewhat manageable, but from your post it seems like it's only getting worse. he might need a higher dose or a whole new prescription
He does have a psychiatrist, whom he likes (his psychiatrist also recommended therapy). I know he's tried different prescriptions/dosages over the years, but I still think there's potential to find a better combination than what he's on now. I don't know how to convince him that trying something new/different might make a difference. I feel like I'm looking for magic words that don't exist.
I know this hurts to hear, but at the end of the day you cant convince someone who doesnt want to get better. He has to reach that point on his own.
Counciling is the best thing to do. I was like him and my life got turned around within 2 months
Yeah, you're right. I hope he reaches that point soon.
That's awesome, I'm happy to hear you were able to turn your life around! I agree it can make a big difference and I really hope that can be true for him too. I just haven't been able to convince him.

I almost took my own life couple hours ago, my depression wouldve ended there
Medication and therapy, but also just time. And I stopped drinking to cope. When my psychiatrist suggested other underlying causes for the anxiety and depression and upped my dosage of medicin, I became more stable. Then the therapy also started making sense because I realised my thought patterns were very far from reality and often were the beginning of a period of down-spiraling. Not that I’m completely cured, but existing has become a lot less painful.   You’re not a worthless person. In the grand scheme of things we’re all “worthless”, but please don’t objectify yourself like that. <3
Ryan,  First off,  you are not a worthless person.  Look at the value in what you said to the person who said, "I almost took my own life couple hours ago..."  You gave them some hope because of how you came through it earlier.  Accept where you are now and that you have overcome where  you were.
I am sorry but please don't do that. Its not the way to go, I have been through depression myself for many years and i can tell you things turn around and you will be glad you didn't do it. Much love and support ❤️
Aweeee I am soo glad you feel better and existing isn't as painful as it was because that's the biggest thing, your out of that painful depression blackhole. I hope you continue on your journey and hey if possible I would absolutely love knowing about your therapy process, what helped you etc so that I am better equipped at helping people myself. Love and strength to you❤️
Thank you very much for your kind words! And yes, there is no doubt I have overcome where I was and I really do not take take that for granted. Now I want to just support everyone to the littlest I can because just with a little help and support, they will slowly heal and be in the other side, which exists but can't be seen for the one suffering. It's a beautiful life beyond words *smiles* and one thing that makes it beautiful is people, good people, I am sure you are one. Much love and Freedom to you ❤️

I have social anxiety and an experienced doctor found out that I have a case of depression, I first didn't know about it when i founded out, i called my parents for saying them the truth, but, they were arguing i was obviously crying cause they didn't argue like that, My Father was hitting my mother and even me, i sitted in my bed drinking cola in the dark, under the blankets,  after that night my parents didn't solve their problems and i didn't have anyone, (SELF HARM) i cutted myself at least 50 times per day. If i mistaked something that would be 100. Im ok now...i cut myself at least 1 time in 3 weeks. And i don't like it when my Boyfriend force me to show my arms to him...Like...everytime i talk with him some sensitive topics slip out of my mouth...And HE FORCE ME TO SAY EVERYTHING. I know he does it for protecting me, but , i don't feel comfortable, When i go to school usally my classmates like to laugh at me and some of them hit me...I don't like when i go to the bathroom, some students of other classrooms always bully me, like, put my head in the flusher. I can't really say all the things that are wrong with my life right now...But i will post other posts to continue this. Thank you for reading and sorry for wasting your time.

Hey everyone,   I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. I'm worried about my brother and I know he needs help.  I will give a little back story first. My Brother is in his 40s and is married with two children, a boy and girl ages 10 and 8. My sister in law is still awaiting a diagnosis for what we think is a neurological condition. On bad days she is in great pain, can't walk and even loses her voice. This has been going on for about a year now. My brothers business tanked because of Covid and she is no longer working. Unfortunately I do not know what their financial state is but I know its not good. My Mother helps him out quite a bit.  My Mother has been trying to help as much as she can but she is 70 and can't keep up with the kids. She is always telling me about how he is in bad shape but I have no answers to give her. When I try to reach out to him its like tearing apart a brick wall with my hands.  I know all about depression as I suffer from Acute Bipolar Depression but have been stable for the past 2 years thanks to my wife, psychiatrist and medication. I thought he would listen to me since I've struggled with my mental health my entire life but no luck. At the moment my hands are tied because I'm searching for a job since covid has put me out of work and I have 5 month old twin boys to care for.  He is against medication because the one time he took antidepressants, he didn't like the way they made him felt. Instead he went to the doctor and requested to be prescribed a certain type of sleeping medication to which the doctor flat out told him no. Instead he smokes a copious amount of Marijuana which isn't helping anymore but instead is fueling his anxiety.  Anyways I could keep typing but I digress. Long story short, I'm worried about me brother and his family but I have no idea what to do.  I'm thankful for any advice or even if you have any questions.

It's weird when you known someone for years and they don't talk to you anymore. Idk if they're ignoring me or what. I'm always left on seen and they never interact much with anything I send them. Maybe like if they need to ask me something but that's it. Why do I feel like it's my fault? Like did I do anything wrong? Are they stressed? Like what's going on here? How do I bring this up?

First I want to say, I’m sorry you are experiencing this. 9/10 it’s always about them and what they are going through, not you. I am actually on the other side of this so I very much apologize if anything I say becomes hurtful. My hope is that sharing the other sides perspective will help ease your mind.   I have two best friends that I love deeply with all of my heart. However, since the pandemic I have come to realIze how little our friendships serve me and my growth as an individual. I suffer from severe depression and every time I would talk to them it felt like I was being drained even more.   I tried to gently bring up the fact that I need space to heal myself and focus on the struggles in my own life. However, because of their own mental health problems I have found that they now project their own style of healing onto me which has resulted in me responding very little to them.   Now I want to clarify, that I in no way am making assumptions about how you and your friends relationship is. My only hope is to provide context that my wonderful friends have done absolutely nothing wrong and are still incredible people whom I love. The one and only issue is me, and the healing I need as an individual for my own sake. And my lake in ability to communicate that back to them to make sure they know that.   Again I’m sorry you are experiencing this, I hope you are able to find self love and friends who give you everything you need to feel loved. You are enough. You are worthy.

I don't want to get into the details of what happened today but in short I got into a fight with my parents and I tried to slit my wrists with some scissors. Ive wanted to kill myself for a very long time now and I think I finally found the guts to do it. Although I'm debating. I have had depression for almost 7 out of the 14 years that I've been on this earth and Im scared it will continue.

You will come out of your depressive episode at some point, other cool things will happen in your life that you probably won’t wanna miss, a fight is not worth killing your self, that’s a much bigger decision..depression can be lived with. I take medications and work on it, and i can live with it now and find things to enjoy and be happy about. You’re 14? Don’t kill yourself yet
this feeling is not forever. nothing is forever, everything changes and so will you. being in your teens is the worst, but your life is going to change so much and so will you. its so much more than shitty schools and shitty family. at your age i attempted and ended up in a psych ward for a week. after i got out i told myself id leave this planet for good if i wasnt in a better place by the age of 20. im so happy i waited because now i want to live and for once im actually scared to die. i owe my whole life to my 14 year old self who had nothing but a little hope. take it one day at a time.

I'm 13, nearly 14 to some extent. I've self harmed for months and I'm seeing to the school counsellor, but no matter what I do I can't stop feeling numb. My parents do not understand it and my mom just calls me a freak every time I try to say anything or express how I feel. I've relapsed multiple times and, at this point I don't know if it's anything but an addiction to harming myself. Alongside that I cry a lot, usually at night, sometimes so hard that it's really difficult for me to catch my breath, and I find myself trying to pretend my pillow is a person so I can cry into "them". Since the start of December 2020 and today, I've had 2 attempts; both cut short by me being too hesitant and too scared to go through with anything. But it's still a desire to just, leave. I'm tired.  I cannot get diagnosed with anything as of currently because... How am I meant to tell my parents if this is the case? But I at least want an idea of what's wrong with me. Something is wrong and I don't know what it is.

I was diagnosed at 13, but i showed the symptoms if Depression as early as 8.  Im sorry you own parents can't recognize that you have an illness, and that's exactly what this is. None of this reflects on you as a person. I'm glad you are seeing your counselor at school. Be aware that anyone in your school is what is called a mandated reporter.  They are obligated to make a report of child abuse. Denying a  minor necessary medical care can constitute abuse.  It might work in your favor to get the help you absolutely need.  Just putting it out there. Feel free to message me. I can tell you what to expect.

Since two years I have been feeling this, that I’m not worth anything and I’m stupid. I know I’m not but my surrounding are such. For a while I even used to think of comment suicide but never had the balls to do it. Even now I think but it’s much less. At work even if I make a small mistake I break down and can’t deal with it. My boss at work knows but he says that just how I’m and I need to improve. I’m seeing a therapist but I don’t think it’s helping. I don’t know if I need medicine or how can I get it.  Everyday I don’t feel I like getting up. I can’t do anything except just sit. Please advice what can I do

I’ve been depressed for years and i didn’t know. Didn’t have anyone to talk to. I self diagnosed a few years ago but was reluctant to take medication. But it got worse. And when i hit a breaking point I decided to take medication. I wish i made that decision a long time ago. I started taking my med 2 months ago. I am less irritable and have a more clear mind. More over my emotions are under control. No one knows you better than you know your self.  Listen to what your body is telling you. I hope this helps.
Thanks. It does help
So you are indian too? If you want to talk you can send me a text. Id like to help a fellow indian out.

Ever feel like you have alot to say in your mind but suck at sharing the story?   I'm kind of depressed now but I dont know how to express my feelings. While everyone have friends or people to lend an ear. I'm that type of people who sit silently and observe, scare of making the first move. Whenever I'm depressed I hid and avoid talking to people as much as possible. I hate it when my heart wrenches and I try to hold my tears at work. Work has been giving me a hard time. Ever since the lockdown started, my manager worried about the poor sales and kinda selfish.i just want I quit but you know .at times like this tmit is difficult to find a job. I don't know.. I'm just not myself lately

I have the exact same problem. Lockdown really had a effect on me and I just got depressed again. I am worrying about what to say and how to say it. (Whait isn’t the same thing?) I tried reaching out today but I got kinda denied lol. I’ve just been demotivated for online school and it’s only been a week. Tho I really wanna cry I just can’t. It’s just is like a big ball of sadness inside of me now.

Just remember that when you do things and are productive it’s an act of self care. The point of life is to experience things and when we stop ourselves from being productive we are bound to feel worse.
Thanks, that's a good reminder! I tend to go wrong when I'm thinking of productivity as something that makes me worthy, or proud. It's way more helpful to think of it as something I'm doing for myself - to feel better.

So my boyfriend told me that he was in a bad place before he met me and that nowadays (the entirety of being with me) he’s been happy and hasn’t felt sad in a minute. Today somehow the topic of being sad came up and I was like “why would you be sad again?” and he responded with “because it always relapses. That’s how depression works.” and I was speechless. I understood that he used to have breakdowns (they all, 2-3 in total, included something that was about me.) but I never guessed that he’d have depression. I’m a generally very happy person and I’m not sure how to deal with this. I don’t think he’s professionally diagnosed because I do remember him saying it feels like he’s depressed but never said he was diagnosed. I don’t want to doubt him but at the same time I don’t think what he’s feeling is something as severe as depression. I don’t know what to do/feel. Should I just support him either way? If so, how am I supposed to support someone when they’re having depressing episodes?  Edit: thank you so much for the personal experience stories and the advice. Every single response is dear to me and I really find it all very helpful. I hope you all have a great day.

It sounds exactly like he has clinical depression. Are you a psychiatrist? If not, why would you minimize what he is feeling and assume it’s not that bad! That is not helpful to him at all. Don’t try to decide what he feels and second guess him!   Ask how he feels and *listen!* Don’t minimize it. Don’t presume to know his feelings better than he does. Depression isn’t just sadness. Please understand that. They are two completely different things. Sadness isn’t as all-encompassing and it feels temporary. You can objectively look at it and take action. Not so with depression.  Have you every had something truly horrible happen in your life? Maybe your best friend or a parent died. Or you totaled tour car and it was your fault? Or you got fired unjustly?   Then you wake up normally for the first few seconds the next day. Then BAM! A terrible feeling of dread envelops you, and for the first few seconds, you haven’t yet remembered what awful thing happened, but you still have that oppressive feeling of dread. It’s suffocating! That’s what depression feels like. Close your eyes and really think about it.  Therapy and meds can help so much. This is above your pay grade.
Depression is a monster and you’re lucky to not be able to understand it. People can be in the perfect relationship with the perfect partner and still want to kill themselves because their brain lacks the right chemicals and fails to function as it should. I dated a severely depressed person and sometimes that looked like watching him lie face down in bed for 16 hours or driving him around for an hour because he was too scared to go home and see his family. It looked like me getting ghosted for a month and only being able to see him at midnight because he slept until 8pm.  For me, depression always comes back. I cherish my good moments and try to build a life for myself that will withstand those periods where I just want to lay in bed and die. If you’re going to keep dating this guy you need to understand that he may very well have periods of depression for the rest of his life. It doesn’t mean he doesn’t have to be a good partner to you (my previously mentioned partner used his depression as an excuse to be an asshole to me) but it means you’re going to have to give him emotional support maybe more often than you’re used to if you don’t typically date people with mental illnesses. Understand that recovery is possible; recovery must be the goal, but to an extent if you’re mentally ill there will be times when those breakdowns are just inescapable. You get better coping mechanisms so you don’t want to die anymore and the breakdowns are spaced out farther but it’s just a part of our lives that inevitably we will spend periods of time feeling like shells of people.  Please think about if you can date someone like this before you get more serious with him. It’s so important for mentally ill people to have partners who understand them and are willing to be there when everything feels like it’s fallen apart.  Also, definitely ask him to go therapy. I would have a hard time dating someone making no effort to improve their condition.  If he’s having an episode, tell him you love him, bring him his favorite snack, try to get him out of the house (does he like hiking or other outdoor activities?), come over to lay in bed and watch movies. Make sure you’re taking care of yourself too. It can be easy to get dragged down with them if you’re prone to getting sad. But for him the most important thing you can do would be just physically showing up for him, making him feel cared for, letting him vent if he wants to. And absolutely try to get him to go to therapy or even look into meds if he sees no improvement after expending real effort. Depression is a tragedy, but it’s not okay to get stuck there and let your life fall apart without trying to fix it.   Understand that you shouldn’t date someone with depression if you’re not willing to be understanding when they want to die over nothing and you definitely shouldn’t do it if they’re completely okay with the fact that they’re depressed and have no interest in improving themselves. I’m pretty sure the guy I dated, while I loved him more than anything, was never going to change so his life is just always going to be falling apart. Some people are like that and we have to know where to draw boundaries.
As someone with chronic depression (aka Major Depressive Disorder) I only expect a few things from my partner.   1. Understanding that I don't choose to be this way.  I have had depression for a long time and I expect I always will. I manage to live a good life but it's always there. There's no way in hell I'd choose this if it was up to me.  2. Knowing that it isn't his fault.  My partner makes me very happy, but he cannot cure my depression. Nor do I expect him too, that would be like expecting him to cure my physical health problems. The last thing I want is for him to feel that he doesn't make me happy. Guilt is a big part of my depression, so I need to hear that he doesn't feel bad as a result of it. 3. Not minimising what I'm feeling. Depression sucks. For people that have never expressed chronic depression they often think it's simply being a bit sad. Sadness is a part of it but there's so much more to it than that. Hopelessness, guilt, emptiness, insomnia, body aches, exhaustion, lack of motivation, brain fog, being unable to do even the simplest of tasks, the urge to harm yourself, and suicidal thoughts. Depression is a serious problem that can potentially be life threatening, so don't minimise it.  The best thing you can do for your partner is to ask him what he needs from you, and encourage him to get professional help. You cannot cure him, and you can't be his therapist. If he's struggling then he needs the support of professionals. Don't try to take on that role because it won't work.
My first sui\*ide attempt was at 8 years old.. im 28 now and have gone in and out of major episodes and multiple attempts. I have a loving and supportive family all of whom, until extremely recently, had zero clue I was going through any of that.      Don't assume to know what's in a persons head.      Even in my dark moments, I somehow manage to be cool as a cucumber (externally)... Aswell, when I'm in a good mood, I have little to no  memory of ever being in a bad mood.     Humans are funny, the brain is funnier... best thing to do is treat them and their actions with love and respect, the support, then, will follow.
I think just being with him is enough. If it isn’t I would go with him to the therapist. You should talk with him about that.
Relationships have a honeymoon phase. Depression can be life long. Don’t take it personally.
I can't really add anything others haven't already said, except personal view, having dealt with it myself most of my life. There will be good days and bad days, there may not be any specific trigger, I've simply woken up in an episode for no real reason.  I'm mostly single, and what helped me a LOT during an especially low point just before the holidays was a FWB showed up at my apartment out of the blue. She didn't say a word, just grabbed my hand, dragged me to the bed, pulled me down and... Cuddled me, she didn't say much, just pulled me into a cuddle, with me as the small spoon. She ran her fingers through my hair, held me tight, and just let me ugly cry. No questions, no judgement, just let me know I could stop fighting for a little bit.  I can't recommend this enough. He may not need it really often, but if he's in an especially low point it may help him a lot.
I felt so sad reading that,when I read that you don’t know if he really got depressed j broke my heart. I haven’t go to a doctor,to a clinic,or to a psychiatrist,and I know for a fact I had severe depression for the last year. I didn’t feel like going to the doctor,it was an impossible task,I didn’t feel like eating,or eating in excess,I only wanted to drink and smoke and get high to never listen to my thoughts,many nights awake trying to avoid my thinking,waking up panicking and with so much difficulty to breath,irregular heart beating,honestly just waiting to die... without never telling nobody! Not even my own family,cause I just know they will not fully understand it and belive it,just like you... I remember few years ago laughing on twitter of depressed people,I thought,wow,they so weak and they exaggerate things,and here I am... feeling the same... please believe him,don’t pressure him to much,just let him feel ur love ❤️
Continue to do some research and get a professional involved. Start with a general practitioner or a therapist and move forward from there. Continue doing more research online into what depression is and how it works and THEN work to help. Some of the things that you are saying now can be more damaging than helpful, but that’s ok if you don’t fully understand depression. Just be aware of that and be understanding. Maybe you could even see a therapist yourself to develop some techniques and strategies to help him when things get bad.   I wrote up several strongly worded responses to this, but forced myself to dial it back. I’ve had depression for most of my life so it’s hard for me to comprehend how people don’t understand it. Not everyone is sad or depressed and I have to remember that. But the fact that you are looking to help will mean the world to him, I assure you. This will be a difficult road and isn’t always quick or easy. Listen to him, be understanding, be kind, and most importantly don’t give up on him.
To add to everyone else, there will be times that your boyfriend cannot identify a single or precise cause for a mood shift or some kind of mental stress. It doesn’t mean he won’t tell you because he doesn’t trust you. He may not be able to identify something specific that caused him to have a bad day or lash out or pull away.   My ex would always ask why I’m depressed. Many times, it felt like he either believed that my depression wasn’t legitimate or that I was intentionally hiding things. He never was able to accept that depression isn’t something that I chose or willed upon myself.   I’d approach it with the offer of help without the insistence that he takes it or must share his thoughts and feelings.   “Can you pinpoint why you feel down/sad/overwhelmed?”  “Is there anything specific that you’re struggling with?”  *the option to identify an issue or not identify anything specific - no specific answer doesn’t mean he isn’t responded to the question*  “Can I do anything right now to help?”  *long term is difficult to approach when the present is difficult and needs to be handled first* “Would you like a __?” “Can I get you anything to drink or eat?” *a lot of people have comfort foods, drinks, items. I find that herbal tea or water is soothing when I feel vulnerable and may be struggling with my mental health* *sometimes a change of clothes might be appreciated, particularly if getting out of the shower/tub, as well as grabbing comfy clothing if it’s a good chance to crawl into bed or curl up on the couch*   Also, learn his favorite shows and music. He might appreciate to just spend time with you and distract himself with a show or movie. Don’t watch or listen to anything sad or depression. If he has triggers, don’t even mention media that might bother him. BoJack Horseman is great, but if I’m feeling low, it only lets me sink further into a depressive episode.   Phone games can be fun too. I connect with my partner at night when I’m having a tough time and can’t sleep with him. Words with Friends seems to be great for me, but can be stressful or annoying if he doesn’t enjoy it. Simple games that aren’t long or stressful or difficult are great to explore.   Above all else, just try to accept that you may never really understand what it’s like to suffer from depression. And that’s okay. I’d never wish it on my worst enemy. It’s an invisible battle, and it can be seemingly impossible to share with others. The most powerful thing my partner has ever said to me is “Your feelings are valid. You are heard. And you have my support.”    If he asks for your support or otherwise indicates that you can help in any capacity, he’s trusting you with something incredibly important. Even when you feel helpless, being their for your partner and holding his hand or showing you care is incredibly powerful.
Oh alright, thank you. Seriously, your response helps a lot.
This.
This is an amazing response. I'm new to reddit, so don't have any coins but If I could give an award I would :)  u/ppolariss, you sound like a really supportive person, despite not understanding how depression works. Reaching out to a community of people for advice is more than others would do. I've been on both sides of trying to support someone with depression, as well as having depression myself.  u/thesunindrag has said pretty much everything! Please know that even if he isn't having a visible depressive episode, people are still struggling internally, so try to be as supportive as possible.  A few things that help me:  \- people asking if I want to rant or want advice. (unsolicited advice can get exhausting to listen to, as  a lot of times we may have already tried)   \- someone else going on a walk/ exercising (I sometimes can't find the motivation, but will join in if a friend suggests). The same applies to other activities so find out what he enjoys.   \- encouraging them to see a doctor and helping them prepare for the appointment.  Also, it can be really hard watching someone you care for have depression, so please take care of yourself too.  \- Set time aside for yourself to do your own thing :)    \- It's often very easy to start becoming the therapist in a romantic relationship. This shouldn't be your role and can be tiring. Please ensure that you set your own boundaries.   \- Have realistic expectations with what he can achieve, as well as the level of support you can provide.  Good luck, he is lucky to have someone like you in his life x
Thank you so much. This helps a lot.
This, 100% this.
Thank you so much! Covid has been restricting our contact so being with him is rare, like once a month or once every three months. We live in the epidemic of covid (New York) & he has an immunocompromised mother so it’s a little hard.
That’s so sweet🥺. I’m glad something as wonderful as that happened to you. I happen to want to comfort my lover in the same way but as I have mentioned in another comment, there’s a lot of complications due to covid. His love language is more physical rather than verbal so he’d love something like what you described. Maybe one day when everything gets better I’ll be able to be there for him more often. I bet he’ll love that. Thank you for the perspective by the way. I’m grateful.
Thank you. I understand that I’m ignorant of certain things therefore I end up saying something naïve or careless. I’m sorry if anything I said was triggering. I appreciate your response.
Thank you! I struggle with things to respond with when he tells me he’s feeling down (I tend to overthink & sound like I’m uncomfortable when in reality I’m just nervous about saying something insensitive) so this helps a lot. Yes, I’ll most likely never understand how he feels so the very least I can do is be there for him. I really want to be his comfort. Thank you so much.
It sounds like you are a caring person who is trying to help him. And that’s a lot, just to have a steady person to lean on. Sometimes it’s everything. We all live and learn.
As someone who has been diagnosed with clinical depression, I can tell you assuredly it is not just being sad and really, it is that bad. There is absolutely no way for you to understand how he is feeling and you don’t have to understand it to be supportive. It is a very difficult thing to deal with and it is constantly looming over your head even on a good day. Theres alot of feeling hopeless and just generally like a failure (at least for me) and that your life just hasnt amounted to or may never amount to anything even if you know thats not true. You know that your family and friends love you but it doesnt feel like it, and theres really not anything you can do about that other than just being there for him. It can be debilitating sometimes when it gets really bad, you have no energy to do anything even if its something you usually enjoy doing, you might feel like the whole world is against you and you dont want to get out of bed, and just want to sleep all the time. Its kind of like being at war with yourself sometimes because you might desperately want to feel better but your brain is just fighting you tooth and nail. I once heard depression described as being at the bottom of a really deep dark well and just screaming and screaming for help and trying to climb out but no body comes to save you, and thats a pretty good analogy in my opinion. He needs help but the likely hood of asking for it is usually pretty small. Encourage him to go see a doctor and or a therapist. Its really good that you are trying to be there for him even though you dont understand what hes going through. There is no cure for it and it really really sucks but you can get through and have alot of good days, but there will always be bad days and it may not happen often but it will happen. Theres no rhyme or reason to it and it doesnt make sense, you could be completely content with your life and then one day just feel horrible for seemingly no reason. And I cannot stress this enough just be there for him. There really isnt very much you can do but let him know that you are there for him and encourage him to get help. I am not a doctor but this is all stuff I have experienced dealing with clinical depression. Its hard for everyone but you can do something to get a handle on it.
Thank you so much for this. & actually I’m very lucky to have him in my life. He’s amazing in so many ways. Truly a beautiful soul & I’m glad he chose to stay by me. It’s only fair I do the same. I’ve been closeted about real world problems my whole childhood so I’m what he calls “naïve,” but I really want to try my best to become more generally aware. Also, if I may add, he got offended once when I suggested that he needed psychiatrical help. Like profesional help. He got really bummed out & told me after so I felt bad. Isn’t that a bad thing to suggest to someone? I’m afraid I was too blunt/mean with it. I wasn’t trying to portray it in that way.
I think texting or video chats are enough, whenever i feel down just the thought that someone cares about me makes me a little bit happier. 🥰
It’s not a bad thing at all. If you have mental health issues or trauma, the best thing you can do for yourself is get help. All of my friends go to therapy and I probably wouldn’t date someone who had never been to therapy if they had the same issues as me. It’s a very normal and healthy thing to do. They don’t treat you like you’re crazy, they just help you understand the roots of your problems and figure out how to cope with them.  It’s ultimately his choice, but just be aware that if he’s been like this his whole life and continues to refuse getting help he probably won’t change. Getting better often requires professional help. It sounds like it may not be a common thing in the groups you guys hang out with but literally everyone I know, even the mentally stable ones, go to therapy - it’s very normal in different parts of the world.
I'm glad to hear you have a good relationship with him it sounds really sweet.   Approaching the topic of therapy is quite hard as some people can get defensive for a number or reasons (scared, feel attacked, think they dont need help, or think that it's being blown out of proportion, feel misunderstood, etc).   I'm not sure if you want to try approaching the subject again, but if so, do it when he is calm and there are no problems between you guys. If you were blunt, try and apologise and say that whilst you dont understand, you do empathise. Try use I statements, instead of making him feel blamed. Do your research and present positive facts of research, to reassure him it's normal and can be helpful. (This is what I've done when suggesting therapy to friends).  Of course, everyone is different so see what's best for you two. If you are able to have the conversation, please note that it is emotionally draining for him. It could be useful to have a chill evening planned afterwards so be conscious of when you do it.   (Also I'm aware that depending on the country you live in, therapy might not be easy to get, so if you would like any other suggestion on what has helped me, I'm happy to share )  Hope this helps x
Thank you. I’m really grateful.
Yes thank you so much.

I am turning 18 in a month but I feel like my life is already over. I am failing college, which was my last hope after a torturing highschool experience. I was hoping things would change but i still have this horrible feeling. I am thinking of dropping out and just gonna work an easy job to make a living. I am so fucking lost and I am not looking out for the future. I know I am in the correct course. But nothings fun. Everything I do ends with me being disappointed in myself and losing motivation to push trough. Everything I enjoy gets blocked that is beyond my control. I am already a mess at almost 18 years old and I feel the future holds nothing but more hardships.

So I have had lot's of ups and downs in my life , I have had lot's of break ups , friend losses , you name it, also I remember once I had this dizziness in my head around one month that it turned out to be a deppressive thought. But right now It has been almost two years that I've been feeling down and day by day I'm feeling worse and worse . Because of my current situation and because of it's oddness to me I keep recalling before two years ago and just ask myself what happened to me then? Was it the bodybuilding steroid pill that i took? Was it the weed i was smoking almost four times a week { by the way it has been two years that i am not able to smoke weed , because it just makes me paranoid and overthink } , Was it that wierd girl who i met back then and she was just so insane and i think she was some kind of demon and went inside my head after that { right now i have contact with this girl and she told me she sees gods in reality and she has some special skills} .Is it the law of attraction { I was intoduced to it by one of my friends and i have been in it a little} Is it My porn addiction to femdom and humiliation stuff { I have been watching only femdom and humiliation porn for 6 years now and it keeps getting darker , right now I'm just aroused by femdom and sissy porn stuff , and i have been trying to quit it and i just can't because of my deppression} ? you just name it . You know this is what my mind looks like nowadays , and imagine it has been like this for about two years. I sometimes think i am controlled by outside powers that have gone into my mind and i have no control over them , I think I have some kind of mental Cancer that goes around my mind . In this two years i have lost all my friends  , i have not been able to study my lessons { and consider I'm a medical student} . I just keep recalling myself how beautifuo life was back then , I'm not saying i had a better joh or I was reacher , I just coupd commuinacte and not overthink my situatuon this much , Right now I'm literally paralized by my thoughts , whenever i see my older pictures and my chats with ky friends i see how happier and carefree i was back then , My basic mental situation was OK .  Sometimes I think that i have some special kind of disease like Bipolar disorder or depression but i just can't relate to , Right now one day I'm feeling OK but another day It's just hell to me to the extent that I keep questioning everything in my life and my surrondings and use some stupid reasons to calm me down . I think I won't be OK anymore because I have this obsessive thoughts popping to my head that you just won't be Ok again to just simply can talk to a friend without getting paranoid and overthink. I'm seeking therapy this weekend and hope it works for me . If my life would continue this way I don't know what will happen to me ,  I've  literally searched everywhere , asked anyone for help , and now that i know reddit exists , hers is my source for answers , But no real answers I've been getting . But ladies and gentelmen , I have not been myself for two years , I don't know where I'm going , I just can't keep up with this life anymore. I want my old self back. I am tired of seeking answers online , on reddit , on quora , from friends etc . I'm tired of been high for one day and then smash to earth with face . If you have read this much I truly appreciate you and If you know sth about my situation that can help me please do me a favor and save a life.

Keep your grades up and you can get yourself into a country that allows religious freedom. I know things suck right now, and your family probably won't want anything to do with you once they find out, but that's why religion is dangerous and sick. That's my opinion though, I recognize you may have found another religion. You know you're in the right on this, and I know it too. If you can keep your head down, work hard on your freedom and keep imagining how life will be once you're out, one day it will happen and you'll never have to worry about it again. You'll be well educated and even if your family never wants anything to do with you again, you can build a new family. A better one that doesn't force their kids to believe what they believe, in a country that doesn't force ideas on their countrymen.  All that said, I know how you feel about life in general. The only persecution I face is against the poor, and I still don't like my country. I consider suicide everyday because of the state the world is in, and the fact that the people who aren't suffering don't seem to care at all. I get it. Just wanted you to know that, and I hope you keep fighting.

Welcome to adulthood birthdays are just days
Lately I've been more accepting honest and open without the slightest bit of a filter thru out these months I've lost my father due to heart problems and I've lost my only "friends" thru there own toxicity and the love of my life due the great distance  that grew between us both physically and mentally but thru it all I haven't felt more sad or mad the depression that possesses me has very much turned from an emotion to a constant mood I cant seem to escape even thru outlets I dont find my self interested in games of any sort I cant smoke bud cause I get horrible headaches from stress often now(not everytime) nd I no longer have friends as we discussed and I have no relationship with my siblings of which there are four in fact we all have a strong disliking toward one another so at this point I have nothing to turn to I'm just stuck and even musicly I find my self only able to only bring up the topic of self loathing so at the end of my day im in a place with thoughts that long to torture the very feeling of happiness  hopefully it changes soon or I'm going right after my mother sorry to say but its seems to be the only thing I can look forward to(the day when I can finally go)             (16) (M) (B day Feb 10th) incase ya gave a fuck  Good day to all who read I hope your atleast doing better then me
But too feel better google all the free stuff you can get on your birthday and treat yo self to freebies

Hi everyone. A couple months ago I found out I have high functioning depression. I thought I was just normal and that sometimes life just sucked very badly. I’m learning how to see when depression is creeping in. Since I feel fine most of the time my natural response to depression is to completely ignore it and pretend is fine, and when I realize it has gone bad and everybody around me hates me. I get pretty frustrated when depression hits and I behave more aggressively. And then everything just kind of goes away and I’m fine for a month and then the cycle happens again. How do you cope knowing that you feel good today but tomorrow you might wake up and barely get out of bad or be struck by sadness that has literally no logical foundation?

This feels really silly.  I am having a quiet night by myself...or, as by myself as one can when they room. It's nice right now though, the roomie is asleep, so it is just me and my beloved kitty, up and just sorta tooling around on my computer, like I used to do on sleepless nights. It's been raining heavily these past couple of days.  I've struggled this whole year with a relapse of my depression due to the pandemic, among my other issues. It really sucks. The isolation from social distancing has made it worse. I've had my problems for years, and I have a really good therapist for once in my life...but I miss seeing her for my therapy in person. I miss my other appointments too...and being with my friends again...instead of the phone of through a screen...those ways are so cold. They make me feel strained and exhausted.  Anyway...this hasnt happened in such a long time, where I let something small from the internet affect me. Just a small comment from one of my recent posts. I know, I know...it's the internet, on a public internet forum...it was something I want venting out about on the sub for ranting. I struggle to not let those things bother me a bit.  I do get more serious problems than this but...I sorta cope by withdrawing into myself and away from others...I don't really interact. I just shut down.  I wish this oppressive pandemic could be over. It has been painful. This post will probably get buried...hahaha. Thats okay, it's not a big deal anyway. I just wanted to find a hopefully gentle place to air out some worries, and the other subs for mental health support...well...I finally just settled on this one. Anyway...that's all.

Started a new job and yes there is a lot to learn, but it takes time.  Yet the voice in my head tells me I'm an imposter, that I'm not good enough for the job, and that I shouldn't be there. It's making me feel low and really shit about myself.   I'm currently sitting on the train crying, wondering why I always have these thoughts.   How can I stop this? The imposter thoughts trigger my depression and anxiety, and so far all I can do is cry it out. I don't know what else to do.

Hello. First of all I'm sorry for my broken English, I hope you can understand what I'm trying to say.  I have been dating a girl for 6 years and I love her deeply. She also has depression and is taking antidepressants, it turns out that her libido has decreased a lot since she started taking the medications and since she got an hormonal IUD, at the point that simply touching her body is bothering her. I don't want to pressure or hurt her, but it has been bothering me a lot. My anxiety makes me think that the problem may be me. She says she loves me the same as always and tells me to wait and see if things get better. She also says that we are no longer teenagers and we don't need to catch up all the time(although this is rarely happening). She will stop taking the medicine in February on the doctor's recommendation. So... Is it possible for things to return to normal? May I am the problem, maybe she doesn't find me attractive anymore? I love her and I didn't want to break up for any selfish reason. what can i do to deal with this without being an asshole?

I feel so alone even though I’m surrounded by family who cares and have a few friends who I am super close with. I lost a friend recently because I told her I loved her... that went about as well as you’d expect.  Everyday I have to fight to get up, everyday I look in the mirror and feel nothing but hatred, I hate every inch of my body, I hate my mind, I hate my soul. I would never kill myself or self harm, but there are days I wish I just hadn’t woken up. The worst part is I’m stuck with this flesh and bone until the end of my time, then I do whatever happens after life.    Although I’m surrounded by love and care, I feel so alone. Why do I crave the love of others? Why do I crave what I can’t have? Why do I crave the love and satisfaction of those who don’t care? The amount of love I have for others is truly astonishing, but why can’t I feel that way towards myself, or anything else other than hate and loneliness. Why can’t I look in the mirror and say “you look great, I fucking love you” instead of, “you’re too ugly, you’re not enough, you’re overly sensitive, or too cold hearted. Why can’t I love myself the way I do my family or the people who won’t ever feel the same?

I feel this soooo much. I get so mad and frustrated with myself because I feel like I have such a great life, but I'm just a waste of space. Why couldn't someone else that deserves this love live my life and I could just disappear? I felt very alone. Whenever I get these feelings I take a step back and ask "what do I need?" And tbh, it's not love from others that I really need, it's love from myself. It sounds like you need to look in that mirror and show yourself some compassion and patience. You survived the day. You were able to get out of bed. Heck, you were even able to post this on reddit and reach out to a community where you find safe. No one said it's going to be easy, but be kind to yourself and think of 1 good thing that happened to you today. You are allowed to feel lonely. You are allowed to feel sad.

I have been suffering from depression for many years since I was 11 and I am now 15 almost 16. I have attempted to kill myself before but i never told anyone because i was scared they would not believe me. My parents don't take mental health into consideration at all. I went to my school councilor and she referred my parents to professionals however my mother dragged me out after 3 sessions because she "didn't see a difference". And I've been struggling over these Christmas holidays and I don't think ill be able to do grade 11 without help.   So how do you think that i can get my parents to believe me enough to take me to a psychiatrist?

Ok so I just think you should seek help urself. If your parents won’t take a mental disorder serious then you should do something about it. I honestly think it’s a good time to get childsurfeses or idk how u spell it but anyway. Other people will take it seriously. Ok that’s all I have to say. I hope it helped✌️

I don't care if I wake up tomorrow. I think this is "normal" for me at this time of year, but I was partnered the last 5 years, so I might have forgotten. I have seasonal affective.  I'm alone. I don't see any point in continuing this charade, this life. The world is going to hell.  I know I have used the phrase, 'hanging on by a thread', with my prescriber. I just don't remember this apathy.  Please I don't want to be losing my mind or be this depressed. But also if this is something I should talk to someone about, please help me.  I'm sorry.

I could have been such a great student. I had the brains and if I stayed disciplined, I could have done it. Canadian universities are not difficult to get accepted into and yet I couldn't even have done something so simple. I wish I told my parents and my family about what was wrong instead of suffering in silence and self loathing. Everything could have gone right this year but I didn't tell anyone about anything. I don't even like talking to people about my depression and using that as a reason because it's a fucking stupid reason to do poorly in school. I can't even take responsibility over my own life or anything. I can't do school because my discipline sucks ass. I could have achieved something great, made my parents proud and gotten a scholarship. my previous grades proved that I was smart enough for a good program but I just decided to suffer in silence and not tell anyone. I'm never committed to anything. I keep failing myself in everything. the only certainty I'll have is that I'll pass highschool and go to a low tier college which is better than nothing. I have always been a disappointment since my parents gave birth to me. If I told my sister everything that was wrong, we could have set up goals together. I don't even deserve my family or my school life. I would rightfully give it to someone else. I have it so easy. I could've done amazing and I blew it and choose to blame my mental illness which isn't even a valid reason.

This is a throwaway for a pretty good reason. I was constantly bullied from a very young age probably 6 to the time I was a sophomore in high school. I was manipulated into doing sexual things to my sister when I was 8 when I didn’t know what was going on and she was 14 and knew what was going on. I’ve had friends and my sister take their lives, i was sexually harassed and sexually assaulted in Highschool by a girl I had a few classes with, my last theee girlfriends have been abusive and manipulative. Even more that I just don’t want to say even on a throwaway.  I’m not asking for pity so please I don’t want any. I currently live alone with my kitten Leo. I have social anxiety, depression, ptsd, and I’m just all screwed up in the head. I stopped taking medicine because it made me feel like a zombie and constantly made me sick. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m not happy with my job, where I live, how I look, the fact that I’m inside every second I’m not working. I just don’t know what to do. I’ve never actually heard of any success stories, and I am starting to believe they don’t exist. If you have a success story I’d love to hear it, or even just some advice I’d love to hear it. Thanks for listening random stranger.

Hello there. While I don’t have a success story to tell as of yet, I think if you have a few things or people(or even just one) to be passionate about, it will make life slightly easier. Of course, it can be a long search, but I’ve learned that living for my passions is probably the best way I can try to live. I hope you can find something you love enough to give you a more clear sense of purpose! Stay strong, and if you need anyone to talk to, I’m always open.
Tell your psychiatrist about the medications, to make a change. Change will happen. If your psychiatrist doesn’t care, get a new one. Go to a therapist. Likewise, if you don’t feel like the therapist is very effective, switch. Ask yourself questions and answer them, such as “what should I do now?” Sorry you’re going through so much.
Sending a virtual hug
Hey bro, you've been strong. I'm amazed , not everyone can the amount of patience you have.       Just don't think you're alone ok. I mean, there are still some people who'll hear to your problems. For your problem , I recommend searching for a family member or someone that you trust. Your story is sad ngl but stay strong. if someday you're interested  in some success story, someday when you're free you should read the  childhood story of Muhammad. He has kind of a sad life , but in the end everything went well for him.
I also live alone after spending all my life in a cult. Everything is scary and new and im alone but im determined not to give up.  After the greatest pain and darkest storms, you might find peace. And I think this is your moment. Focus on yourself, build your personality, pick the pieces after they broke you.  And be patient. Someday you will feel confident again. But you need to work hard
Try other meds til you find one that works. Get therapy.   As for "success stories", I was bullied since I can remember. My neighbor tried to choke me to death with a metal pole when I was 4. Him and his friends were always throwing things at me, pushing me, kicking me, etc.  Then as I got older (I can't remember before this honestly) my mother got abusive. She would call me a bitch, a cunt, beat me cuz she was tryna quit smoking, tried to isolate me from friends.   Eventually I got a boyfriend. She tried to have him arrested. That was a really bad time. I can barely remember anything except how much we were ready to off ourselves together.   It's been 7 years since that last incident and we're still together and have 2 kids. I'm going to college  My mother is dead in a ditch for all I know or care. I'm the happiest I've ever been.   Sure I still have bad days, that's how it is when you have depression, but there's things you can do to make things better. At some point you need to take control of your own future and stop using the past as excuses. I'm not saying to just get over it, but it is in the past. You don't *need* to focus on that anymore. Focus on the good things, no matter how small. Like that kitten you got. Or a hobby you like.
How old are you currently? This might help with the context.
Idk if this’ll help. But success stories are daily stories. Waking up, getting up, choosing to do something. Those are success stories. It worked for me. I’ve been through some of the things you’ve mentioned and it’s helped.   Also, I oft do things to spite the world. I try my hardest to be the best at work to spite the world. Like how dare it try and bring me down.   I hope you’re ok. Come chat if you need someone to talk to. Inbox always open
Hey buddy I know it's hard and I know the past is not pretty But is gonna be better Listen, take deep breaths and listen to some relaxing music, mediate at last 5 minutes a day (is even better when you do it before bed, it will help you sleep better)  And you can try for example to work out, simple exercises to just keep your mind ocupate with something productive, a healthy body, a heathy mind  And you can even use some sticky notes, ride down some things (3-5) you want to do that day, a To Do list you know? Simple things, like "cook something you like" or "meditate" or read 5 pages from a book It can give you self confidence when you see all the things you did that day  Take care and be strong  We are here for you 💕
I started meds when I was 10 and quit them at 19. I’ve taken so many different medications and so many different doses I can’t even begin to list them off and the ones that worked had bad side effects cause. I was taking two other prescriptions with it and my parents just kept forcing me to shove more shit down my throat. Not a huge medicine fan.
I’m turning 23 in 11 days
Wow, we are almost the same age!  If I could give you one advice, it would be: Don't let yourself define by your past. I'm also currently in a pretty miserable position in life but what I've always tried to do is to look into the future and see the potential there. I mean, if I would only define myself by my past and how other people saw me, I would probably be one of the biggest losers on the planet.
I don’t think I let myself be defined by my past, or if. I do I’m really not trying to. I guess it was more just me getting some stuff off my chest than anything else

I feel so alone, i don’t feel okay going back to school, i feel so isolated, everyone hates me, i don’t know what to do anymore, i spend almost all day either emotionless or depressed. i have given up hoping people would text me. I’m tired of people leaving.   (i don’t know whether to flair it as “requesting advice” or “requesting support” ?)

People suck and are always fickle. Others will tell you that most people are good, but I don't believe it. I know how you feel as I've been abandoned by anyone and everyone who should've cared, even the ones I showed the most care for, even without hurting them, even doing everything for them. It's not you, it's the human condition. We have to be satisfied with the superficialness because it's all there really is. Deep connection is rare and dangerous. Our brains fight us on this because our species use to need deep connection to survive, but that's not how it is these days. Now all it gets you is hurt.   People don't hate you, they barely think about you. People only hate you if you hurt them a lot, or when you're successful and/or creating what they can't or won't. It's really not such a bad thing, but it's something I think we have to get use to. You don't need people to like you. Let them come and go. The best ones will stick around and the vast, trash majority will disappear out of your life. But care about you because you'll always be there in the end.

I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression for about 4-5 years now. Recently it’s been getting a lot worse. My mother very suddenly passed away on our kitchen floor from heart failure. There wasn’t anything anyone could do anything about. On top of that my school has been all online from the pandemic. I was never a outstanding student (all as and bs with an occasional c) but now I’m closing to failing. I’m in high school and it’s around the time when colleges start to really care about grades. I have big ambitions and want to achieve a lot that I need to get a college degree for. I just don’t have the motivation to do the things I need to do. I’m on antidepressants and see two different therapist along with my psychiatrist but I just feel so sad and hopeless. Sometimes I feel like I’m emotionally dying. Before hand I was completely numb with the occasional anxiety attack but now I’m just sad and anxious out together. I’ve been see my therapists but I’m in such a low place that the advice they give me isn’t helping. They say I need to try to think positive but I just can’t. I try to but it feels like I’m lying to myself. If anyone has any advice on how to get out of this slump that would be greatly appreciated.

Lately I feel very alone I go babysit a newborn at 6:30 and get back at 3pm my boyfriend leaves for work at 2pm and doesn’t get back until 2:30 am the only time we are both in the same place at least one of us is sleeping. We both try to be quiet to not wake the other and it’s to the point where he wants to sleep in the other room so I don’t wake him up which I understand. My problem is he’s the only person I actually enjoy talking to I have no friends to text and the only person I see all day is a 6 week old baby, he doesn’t understand that for 5 days a week I’m completely isolated for almost the entire day. At his work he works with other people he supervises people and has friends he works with he sits with them on breaks. I asked him to maybe call me on one of the 15 minute breaks which would be right before I go to sleep and he doesn’t see a point in it he just wants to talk with his friends. I sent him an article someone else wrote to their partner about their depression and said it was pretty close to how I felt and his only response was I don’t even know what to say to that. Then he stopped texting back and went back to work. I’m scared he’s going to tell me to leave that he doesn’t want someone broken like me.

You're not broken, just lonely. It sounds like you're in a difficult situation. I understand it, but don't at the same time. I am dealing with my own form of loneliness which I think drives me to do the things I do. So if you just need someone to vent to or talk feel free to pm me
Oh friend, that’s so challenging. Can you join any social media nanny networks to connect with other babysitters? Newborns can definitely make you feel lonely. All work and very little fun.

You may hurt people, or you may hurt others. An example of what it is like to hurt people is like nails on a wood board, you can apologize by taking out the nail, but the hole will still be there. If you hurt somebody and apologize, that scar will be there. People like me have so many scars I have lost count. This hurt me greatly, nearly to the point of suicide, but I am pushing through it. Every scar shows a battle you have won, so why give up? You have already won so many, don’t give up now. I tell myself this everyday. People have told me to just die, give up, life would be better without you, and I believed those things, but I am still here and am getting better because I started going to therapy, and I already feel less depressed and alone. It seem like you are alone, but you are not. It hurts, but pain fades away. Do not give up. I hope this helps somebody like how it helped me.

Hey, So what you have to know is that I’m currently doing an exchange year abroad. I’ve had self harm tendencies a long time ago, ending in me in the hospital (by accident) and then going to therapy for a month. That didn’t really help, mostly because I wasn’t completely truthful (so I’ve never officially been diagnosed with depression) but because of the shock of landing in the hospital, I was fine and didn’t do anything. This went on for 3 years and then this year it all started again.   The last few days have been extremely hard for me, as I constantly feel down, unmotivated and just depressed. The self harming has gotten worse too and today was the first time where I did it and felt nothing at all, no pain no relief just emptiness. It has also affected my school, as I just can’t bring myself to do homework and as soon as I start, the littlest of things will just bring me into this downwards spiral and then I’m not able to work anymore.  My parents don’t know about my current situation, since if I told them, they would send me back home immediately. I have been thinking about telling them, but I feel like it will disappoint them. I also feel like I am not grateful enough, as this year was very expensive and I am here and just not great.   Should I still tell them or should I just try and make it to the end of the school year and then try and get help?  Sorry for awkward formatting, I’m on a phone.

I’ve been there OP, I say that not to detract from what you’re going through but for me it’s easier to hear advice when I know the other person can relate. I think you said what you needed in this, you need to be honest. You weren’t honest with your therapist and you said it didn’t help, well I can tell you that’s the first thing you should do. You have nothing to be ashamed of, and nothing to lose. You deserve someone to hear you for you can get the proper help you can, and if this therapist isn’t able to help you can try others. It took me several tries until I found a therapist that I could trust and seriously helped me. Once you start being more honest and open, it’s like a weight being lifted from your shoulders. I know there’s no hope in sight right now, but it literally came out of nowhere for me. Little steps everyday will take you to a place where you can breathe and one day be happy. Please don’t try and hide your depression from your parents either, you have absolutely nothing to hide. And hopefully they will be able to give you some extra support.

It's like no matter what I do I still get the same result - I fail. I'm never the best or one of the best at something. If I'm 100% dedicated and work 10 hours a day then I'm mediocre at best, but the price I pay ,obviously, isn't worth it. I'm not particularly good at anything, don't have an education and nothing really interests me. I feel like the only thing left that is in my control is how I'll kill myself.

I used to feel quite the same before.  Everything I was doing, I was failing it. But unlike you I wasn't dedicated to what I was doing. I was just doing ASAP what needed to be done. So you should be proud that you are putting effort in what you do. Like really. It's important. Because at least you've tried. And if you think that what you're doing is bad, maybe ask someone what she/he thinks about it. Maybe you just think that what you're doing is mediocre because you expect it to be perfect.  As for the things that could interest you, I understand as well. There are only a few things that I like. But it doesn't matter. I'm not interested in a lot of things, and people might judge those things as "useless stuff", but. I don't care. I have a few passions and it's the only things that really matters. And sometimes, once in a while, I found a new interest that could potentially become something I would be really in.   And finally for the suicide part, always believe that things will start getting better. But not by waiting the happiness to find you, you have to look for it. Try to reach your friends, your family... Anything that you think could help.   I'm not sure if this is really helping, but I hope it does.
If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

I feel you feels like the only choice we have is if we see tomorrow your not alone. I just wish there was somone who wanted to help that could....
If by failing you mean you're still depressed, you need to accept that it's not going to change no matter how hard you try. No one has a cure for depression just yet. You can be successful at managing the symptoms.  Properly medicated you can lead a productive life. I've managed that going on forty years now. I still have thoughts of hurting myself, but those are like a dull pain that doesn't go away. I don't act on them anymore.  If you really believe you want to hurt yourself, you need to do a voluntary hospitalization. It keeps you in control so you don't spend a whole month in a hospital. That happened to me twice. You have to care for yourself.
Any words and ,I hesitate to admit it, attention are/is helpful. It also helps a little bit to know that someone understands if only a part of what you feel. As for rating myself as mediocre - that hit the target. I'm a perfectionist, because I don't have anything to be proud of I turn every little thing I do into a search for the holy grail, so to speak.
Well, if you were less perfectionist (which can be hard I'm aware) then maybe you would found a lot of things (or maybe just a few) you might be proud of :)

I guess it depends on the stage for me. When I’ve gone through severe bouts of depression with suicidal ideations, it only got worse until I got help, which was talking to a counselor.   Then once my mental state is better but my motivation is low, I usually need some kind of outside stimulus like a deadline or a job. Just something to get me out of the house but with just enough pressure to get me off my ass.   After that it was about finding balance, maintaining a routine, making sure I kept eating and sleeping enough, etc.   If I felt myself slipping back it was usually a sign I needed some quality rest time and to take a breather.
goods news my friend, you can recover from depression.  there are medicines but you must talk to your dr for that.  you can also consult with a close friend, family member and or therapist because getting the thoughts and feelings out is a big step.  i urge you to begin a journal of your day and include everything.  from the time you wake up how you feel and what you think to the last thing you do and your thoughts when you turn out the light at night.  drink water, chew gum, listen to soothing music, no slow and sad related songs something that will be relaxing, take a shower, get fresh air, play an instrument, do some form of art.  do one thing in the morning that you like and one thing in the afternoon that you like.  i have more ways to help you.  theres certain foods and drinks to avoid as well and what are best during this time to eat and what is best to drink.  here if you wish to talk further.  i had 2 deep depressions and totally understand.
Hi! I’m suffering with depression but I always get back up again after an episode. I normally treat myself to snacks and get foods I like and clothes, when you do this it’s important to tell yourself that you deserve this and this will make you feel better, after a while your body will associate your favorite things with getting yourself back on track! :)
According to me, depression is like a sin wave... Or any wave on the ocean for that matter... Some days, it will hit you like a train, others you will be riding smoothly... So on the smooth days relish it. And on the horrible days, think of It as you are waiting for a break in the weather. Meanwhile, you can also try distracting and pampering yourself...  For me Reddit, cooking and eating,. And working out are recreational activities.
I've been in the same position. Better days are coming, please remember to be gentle with yourself and take each day as it comes. Please follow the advice given by others. I don't have much more to add.  I know it's hard to motivate yourself, but what worked for me is that I used to essentially live by "3% is better than nothing".   For example: Eat a snack you enjoy when you can't cook a meal. If you need to study, try for five minutes if an hour is too much. If you don't want to exercise, walk to your front door so you can get some fresh air.  If you have any goals, break them done into little ones and then just pay attention to one at a time. If there are any hobbies you enjoy, focus on them more and try do it a little bit each day. As mentioned by others, if you can talk to anyone, please do.  I know it can be exhausting, so sometimes just send a text if a call is too hard.  It can take some time, but every little step is growth and after some time I found myself willing to push myself further and getting better.
Ohhh thankss for sharing your experience i feel hopeful about getting better and going back to normal again
Thankss!! For sharing your experience

I've often been unsure of what exactly is going on in my brain case. Like I know that I have had periods of depression and anxiety for most of what I can remember. But does anyone else seem to feel like they just don't feel anything anymore? Like your just kind of in a comfortably numb situation. I would love to hear y'alls thoughts.

When I was 18 I had a really good friend (lets call him Dave) and we would hang out basically everyday. I eventually realized that he was a shitty person after I heard him talk to his girlfriend explaining how she had to be “punished” by driving him to the store. After awhile his girlfriend, who had dumped him after a few months, stayed at my house for the night and we ended up having sex and becoming intimate with one another. At the time she had told me that they were no longer together so I shouldn’t feel guilty I was with her, even though they had just broken up and I was friends with the guy.  Dave began to grow suspicious of me and the people around him. Being with this girl (we can call her Erin ig) felt amazing. We had a lot in common and we hung out everyday. We were both stoners, getting high literally every time we met up with one another. One day Dave showed up at my house randomly and tried to invite himself in while Erin was over. I told her to hide in the corner behind the door and I sternly told Dave to fuck off. He always came over randomly. He eventually left but Erin and I were super panicked.  Fast forward a month or two (the concept of time has been very distorted for me recently so it maybe be inaccurate) I was at Erins house and long story short Dave broke in through the front door and started punching me. I wasn’t beaten hard, in fact I don’t think he got one off on my face, just my head and neck. I ended up calling the cops on him and he got charged with assault and battery as well as breaking and entering (rightfully so). He tried to “apologize” to me through cash app because I blocked him on everything else. He was rude as fuck to me during his apology so I took his dollar and ghosted him. I started to develop anxiety issues, wondering if someone was going to come through my front door to kill me.   A few more months go by and I started to get really paranoid that Erin was cheating. She went to band practice a lot, but I was worried because it was all middle-late aged adults (I’m turning 21 in a week or so and Erin is 22). Erin told me all the time that I was just being anxious and paranoid for no reason, and that she loves me and would never hurt me like that, right to my face. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and got put on medication to treat depression and anxiety. One day she brought home some medical weed for us to smoke and said it was a gift from the band head to me. Fucking hilarious. I eventually found a text from an older man with a wife and kids(the band head) asking her to come over at 2am. Erin admitted to me that she was fucking that old man since before our relationship started, and everything she said to my face was a complete lie. Not to mention this old guy has no idea that I existed.  Erin and I tried to make things work after that. She made promise after promise she wouldn’t hurt me again, but I went to the guys house and saw him and her there alone, most likely fucking. I tried to be with her for months, wondering what this old guy had that I didn’t have. How was he better than me? Am I really just a piece of garbage? She showed me a text of her leaving band towards the end of our relationship, and I’m still not convinced that it wasn’t fabricated.  I ended up going to his house and talking to his neighbor basically ratting him out because I couldn’t do anything else. The guy came over and was threatening to assault me. I freaked out so I got in my car and I left. His wife and kids still don’t know about what happened (or what is still possibly happening).   Erin recently told me that she no longer wanted to have contact and wished me well. I told her to kill herself and to suffer 10x worse than how she made me suffer. I’m not proud of it, but I honestly don’t care. She has fucked up my life horribly.   I am now basically set up in my room waiting for death. If I eat its one meal a day and it’s at mcdonalds, because I can’t be assed to make anything. The smoking has been destroying my teeth as well as an acid trip gone wrong where I ground them down. I’m going to lose my teeth. I’m too anxious to call for a dentist appointment for how they would judge me. I have been unemployed for months and when I did work I was a residential mover, which destroyed my body physically.  I have never felt more alone in my life than I do now. I have friends to talk to but they haven’t been in my shoes and don’t understand how fucked the whole situation is.  I would try to break out of my depressive cycle and get a job, but I don’t even want to be physically seen by people due to my teeth. I’m too scared to kill myself so I just stay in bed. I haven’t left my bed except to go to the bathroom for two days now. this is weeks after she originally left.   I still check my messages every half hour to see if Erin messaged me.  I have never been in a depression this bad, nor a situation like this. I’m at a loss with how to cope. And I don’t see myself entering a relationship with anyone ever again due to the severe trust issues I have developed. I can’t stop getting fucked up everyday because I don’t want to exist with these thoughts in my head  What the fuck am i supposed to do now? my life feels aimless and empty, and the one girl I loved and put my faith in spat in my face with an older man. It makes me feel like I’m less than some dude who just uses her for pussy.   Tl;dr Good friend treats gf like shit. The gf comes to me and we start dating. Good friend assaults me and we lose our friendship. Realize she has been having an affair with an older man with a wife and kids. She lied to me for months on end. She ditched me and I feel empty. Don’t take care of myself and smoke way too much to cope so I’m going to lose my teeth. I’m too scared to kill myself. My life is on hold and I’m surviving off saved money. What do I do? What would you do?

Alright, so first off, ignore that other commenter because that person is giving some piss poor "advice". It's actually just about the perfect opposite of what you should do. Don't stalk her, don't harass her, don't hack her phone, that's dumb as hell.   This is just a lesson most of us have to learn: cheaters be cheatin. If you don't like being cheated on, look for the big red flags, red flags like the one where she jumped on you right after your friend. Allegedly right after your friend; there's no telling she wasn't still messing with both of you and the old dude. First time you see one of those flags, let her go. Even if it's inconvenient. Even if it means not getting some from her anymore, it's not worth the drama. Your friend could've totally been a murderer in that situation, you don't know until you're murdered. Luckily he wasn't.   There's a reason everybody on Reddit is always preaching about dumping your other over what sometimes sounds like "little things", it's because the little things are just symptoms of a bigger thing and many of us have gone through similar situations. If someone is acting sketchy, they are sketchy. She was sketchy from the jump. Don't ignore those signs and don't get with your friends ex, that's just code.   The best thing you can do is stop obsessing about it. I know it's hard and I know it sucks. I know it seems like you guys had something special, you didn't, at all. She's sleeping with everything dude. It isn't some failure on your part, it's who she is and she isn't going to change. She isn't going to "come to her senses" and realize she should've been faithful. That's not her MO.   I think it would do you a lot of good to get another part time gig, get some money in your pocket so you can buy things to make you happy. That'll help. Not every job is like that last one you had. Get a nice, easy gig. A lot of janitorial jobs for bigger companies pay decent, have very flexible hours and you don't have to kill yourself. Cleaning is super easy and laid back 99% of the time, and they usually offer more hours if you want them. There's many other jobs like that, you just gotta look.

If you need any help with Hacking your spouse phone or getting to know what he or she is up to, hire a hacker to help you out with that. I hired **PROCYBERHACKER AT GMAIL DOT COM** and she helped me clear my doubt. It’s better knowing what the problem is than living in a state of confusion and heartbreaks. I hope you find your happiness.  Goodluck
Thank you for taking the time to read my post and write a reply. I’m going to try and create new positive habits, starting with clinical therapy and actually fucking washing myself.   I agree that I shouldn’t obsess, but no it is not easy. I got into a habit when I was with her of going out to her house and then the old guys place to see what was happening. It happened every night and if not every other. I need to learn to stop caring, because she never cared.  I have to stop getting drunk and high as well, because I’ve gotten the advice that it doesn’t help anything except suppress my feelings. I can’t even legally buy alcohol yet. and I feel that suppression physically.  I honestly refuse to be with anyone, at least for a long time while I heal. I hope that I one day wake up with the motivation to get my life going again, instead of wasting it and hiding from the world as to not be seen.  Thank you for the advice. I took it to heart and I’ll try to improve myself instead of suffering.
Thanks for recommending the hack, she just helped me and did a good job, I’ll suggest her to friends
Ayy what a fantastic response. I'm glad you're going to try an take the high road on this. There's too much cynicism in the world (including mine) and it's nice to see somebody fighting back; it gives me a tinge of hope too. I know what it's like dealing with a mega-toxic ex and I know how it breaks you down to your core. I hate to see others get sucked into that state of mind. Good luck man, go kick the world's ass I know you got it in ya.

So I've had depression since I was 11. I'm now 20 turning 21. For around 5 years I was on antidepressants. Not the same meds ,on one for a few months and eventually doses moved up or mgs moved up. So now I'm on no meds since March last year and it's taken a decent impact on my mental. long story short my thinking capability has been capped. It's like I'm not in my body or out of it. Stuck in the middle. I can't think to the depths I know I'm capable of or I used to be able to when I was early into my depression. I'm getting back into studies and I need my brain but it's not cooperating. I think slow can't concentrate when I know I'm better. It's literally a barrier stopping me. Depression has ruined my ability to progress as much as I'd want to. Sorry if I come off as attention seeking or anything, but I'm desperate to fix this

I too would like to know of any advice. I just started on mirtazapine and my thinking capacity/concentration has been absolutely shit for about a month. Could be due to all the stress and little sleep but I also can't sleep at night. It's hard knowing what the problem is because I recently went completely sober from all illicit drug use.
I definitely have this issue. I’ve on antidepressants for 2 years now. I’ve been having to work harder to concentrate and it feels like I’m in an argument with my mind to stay focused and not get distracted.  It definitely makes it hard to follow through with things at work. I was just thinking it may not hurt to talk to the prescriber of the meds to see if they can help?
Look into microdosing psychedelics (especially mushrooms) now that you are off your meds.
:( yeah. I’ve tried being more consistently with sleeping so like more 8 hour sleeps but it makes me less tired yes but doesn’t help with concentration. So know that. It’ll just make you less tired not help you with concentrating. Here if you need x
I’m sorry dude. It sucks so bad I’m so annoyed at feeling this way. I could but I’ve had like multiple psychiatrists. So not an option for me but maybe for you. I should see a doctor. I think I got dysthimia
I'ma come hang out too; I practically could've written your post along with you =)

I have been having skin issues on my lips since I was 15 or 16. I am now 26. I have been judged very harshly by people for these bumps. I have tried to go to several different types of doctors and I can’t seem to find anyone who takes these bumps seriously, won’t really diagnose me or try to remove them. It’s taking a huge toll on my mental health and self esteem. I’m pretty sure only 1% of the population is dealing with these same health issues as me. I spend so much time online researching what this could be but I can never find anything close to what I’m dealing with. I also spend a lot time on health forums trying to get answers but nothing. I feel so isolated and alone. On top of that I deal with rosacea and acne. My depression and suicidal thoughts are at their worst.

My stomach twitches when I have an extremely negative or anxious thought (mostly self-deprecating). It's feels like a pinch, a stitch right below the sternum. I tend to have between 5 to 20 of these a day.   Does anyone else feel this? Is it related to depression?

I think it definitely can be related to depression. I have often found that anxiety can also be a big contributor to these kinds of pains and pressures.

I was hoping to make another one on 2020 but the pandemic happened  its been a year now and the only friends i have are online, and while they are really good friends they rarely want to go out and meet up because unlike me they arent losers and they all have their group of friends they know from irl  the only one who wants to go out with me is my boyfriend, who lives in another country and i cannot meet because of the pandemic  so i have to see everyone (my boyfriend, online friends and irl acquaintances i follow on social media) hanging out and having fun with their friends while im stuck at home unable to make new irl friends because there is a pandemic and i cant go to school  and it makes me incredible depressed  i really work on myself, ive been studying japanese, drawing, reading more, working out, running and cooking. yet i still feel empty and unwanted because no one wants to hang out with me  i dont really know what to do anymore, i really want this to change. im seeing a therapist, but everytime i talk about my issues i downplay it and make it seem like it doesnt affect me as much as it really does

Depending on how bad your mental health is, I would say prioritise your mental health first. Get it to a level where you feel more in control and then focus on future.   However personally feel that this depends on the situation, in terms of what you will be doing that's going to help your future?  I understand you may not want to share, but if it's something that you have always wanted to do and your passionate about, then it may help your mental health as it can give structure and help you feel motivated.

Had a crush on her for a year now, can’t get this perfect image of her out my head. I kissed her once but it was an awkward drunk encounter. She’s got some other guy now and I don’t speak to her, she lives in my head constantly I always think about her. I was diagnosed with depression in July and I have been on antidepressants since September and my head is fucked and always has been. I dream about her 4/5 nights and sometimes I just randomly say her name even when I’m around other people. Just the thought of her with this other guy is killing me. I want to die honestly it’s just consuming me and has been for a long time now, just the feeling she’s with someone else and I’ll never get her. I’m really not confident with girls I’m nearly 18 and I’ve only ever kissed her and one other. I genuinely think I can’t attract women. Ever since I’ve been on the medication things were getting better but now everything just feels shit again. I had a lot of suicidal intentions prior to taking the medication but now they’re back again and constantly in my head, I’m obsessed by her and wish I never met her. I’m sorry that this has came across as quite melodramatic but I wanted to get it off my chest. Thank you

Hey man.. I'm 25, and I have been idolizing and reaching out for a girl for the past two and a half years. I always tried to make it work and thought we'd end up together.    I feel you, it's insane how it works - how these thoughts completely obsess and fill your mind. I have been thinking about it - why it's like that, and I have no clue..   We split up several days ago, and this time I finally realized after all this time that it's over. It's very strange feeling, there's void inside. Not sure where it will take me, but I guess I'm finally free.   Don't know what to say tbh.. I guess shit takes time..    Take care man, love you.

Hello everyone! I am new to reddit and would love to have some feed back and advice on this. I was raised by my grandmother, who I am starting to resent a bit because she constantly praises everyone around me, yet never is supportive of me or my accomplishments. It seems that anyone that she knows from church, family members, friends of hers, or my dearest friend, if they do anything she's exhilarated. It could be as simple as a person says that they want to do something in their life, even if they make no effort of doing this she smiles big and is so happy about it. When I tell her of things I've accomplished that I worked hard to do, or dreams I have she won't take her eyes off her Ipad to acknowledge me. And her response to me is very dry and very vague, or she points out the negatives of whatever it is I am trying to do. And with my dearest friend, she constantly praises them. No matter how small of a thing my friend does she is so happy, so excited, constantly liking their social media pictures. Even when my friend makes a mistake she tends to be very empathetic, and never looks ill upon them. Yet things I post seldom does she like or comment, and when I make a mistake I am condemned by her. Her other grandchildren she constantly praises for the smallest of things.I have tried to point out that she does this in a respectful way, and at times very harshly and she just gives me a poor excuse about it, or changes the subject to something that is super irrelevant like "Hey did you see lifetime has a new movie on?" It is so frustrating and makes me not want to talk to her, or do things with her. Which really sucks because we usually have a great time together, and I love her very much. Don't get me wrong I am not making her into a monster, she just does not acknowledge me, and it really does hurt. I really don't know what to do, I am always there for her. I always check on her, always help her where I can, always give her gifts for holidays or just because. And if I give her a pricey present she'll constantly complain it was too much and tell me how much she wishes I didn't spend that much money. Yet if another family member gives her a pricey gift she gushes over how amazing it is. I have also never been lucky in love as I've always been used for car rides, or for money. And I finally found a guy who did really nice things for me, and she told him he should stop doing them for me as it was too much money. Even though she knew I'd never been treated so nicely before by other men, it really hurt me to hear her say that to him. When my dear friend's bf buys her expensive things or takes her places, my grandmother gushes about how great that is. Any feedback I can get would really help, no one in my life knows how dark of a place I am in because of this.

As a stranger reading thus, it seems like your grandmother may have very low self esteem. Since she raised you, she maybe can't accept that you turned out well, since she may feel she can't do a good job. Or it may be there is some resentment against your parent who is her child. Or maybe she is jealous of you. If you can figure out why maybe it won't hurt as much. My husband acts in a similar manner although much more subtle. I know how much it can hurt.
You sound like a good soul. Don’t lose your kind nature to another person’s issues or shortcomings. You can love your grandmother but accept that you may not get what you would like from her. Above all, resolve to live your best life, and remember to set boundaries with others who take advantage of your good nature.
Sounds like a toxic relationship to me, as someone to has never experienced that, that sounds horrible. You need to take her ipad and talk to her about it. If she doesn't listen, slowly drift away. You deserve better, you work hard.
In the same way that fish don't notice the water that they swim in,  many people are no longer able to "see" the people that they live with.  They take them for granted. They forget that their family members need encouragement and appreciation and recognition. They give those easily to the outside world because there is a new-ness to those interactions, but they don't take the time or energy to give them to the people closest by.   It takes a lot of conscious effort from both parties to avoid family relationships becoming monotonous and colorless,  especially the relationships that have some degree of dependence.  I don't really know the answer,  but I sympathize with your situation. It's the people we love the most that we hurt the most and who hurt us the most.
As others said, it seems to be toxic.. I think you should try to talk to her seriously : Why are you doing this to me? Do you know how I feel?  And stuff, and if she doesn't answer, or tell you smth mean, maybe you should consider putting an end to this even if it's hard.. Go for healthy relationships, find people that will acknowledge you, I know it's not easy but it's better than staying like this (in my opinion).  Also, I' m sure you're someone great with many good points and I hope you'll succeed in whatever you're currently doing
your in the same situation as me bro funny thing is a situation just happened tonight  it's like nothing ever goes right
I am a grandma. My mother never could tell me anything positive to my face... only criticism.   It affected me all my life.  My grandma, however, loved simply, kindly.  Now my mom has dementia and it's too late to find out why-- her Depression era poverty, narcissism, low self esteem.    It's really important for you to find people who say kind things to you.  Who value you.  Stick to them.    My joy now comes from people who don't know my family but really like who I am, my qualities, my work.  I keep them very separate.  I don't want to ever have them poison the well of love.  Chat anytime.
I was raised by my grandma as well, (and quite a few foster parents) but my sister and brothers on my dads side were jealous and kind of resentful towards me cause of it. But the thing is I never got love, or appraisal, or anything like that from my mom. I never even got as much as a hug from her. So everytime My mom would intentionally send me away either To foster care or to the streets at 13 as soon as my grandma found out she took me. That was the only times I’ve ever felt love or like I had a family. Well I ended up with my own kids and left my grandma and my life to save my moms other kids I was also feeling a certain way towards my grandmother. It was the worst decision ever. A week later I got a call and was told she didn’t have long. I went back and she couldnt talk or anything I don’t even know if she knew I was there. I regret the argument we had before I left I regret being mad at her. I think you really should just talk to her. heart to heart. But I also think she could be that way towards you but not mean to. Because of how my Mom did me I don’t know how to love or show love I don’t know how to trust anyone or ask for help when I need it most. I have 3 kids of my own now and never wanted to be like my mother. and I will never abandon them or bring a guy around them I’m also over protective and criticize them way to much and it’s weird to me when they hug me or anything but I’ve always felt that way when anyone would touch me especially a hug or something. But I honest to god am trying to fix it cause I do love my kids they’re the only ones in the world that i do love and the only ones that love me. But I’m sure they see me acting a certain way to other people’s kids that I don’t with them. But I don’t mean to, i only do that cause other people’s kids aren’t mine. I don’t have to worry about them. I don’t have to raise them to live in this cruel world but I do with my kids so I am a lot more strict. Like with your grandma saying you spend to much maybe she’s doing that thinking it’ll teach you to save for necessities for yourself, I would do the same with mine. Not with other kids though. Or with your boyfriend maybe she doesn’t want you to get used to it or end up depending on him for money or other stuff but its Not her job to try And do the same with your friend. I know that would be the reason I’d do that to my kids. But I am also straight forward and will tell my kids that. Maybe thats what your grandmother is trying to do but just hasn’t or can’t say it. Maybe she does feel bad about it to. I know I’d end up being the same way and I do act the same but I am honestly trying my hardest not to I don’t want my kids to feel this way but it is extremely hard when you’ve never been or seen how a real family works or was never taught any of this stuff. she could have resentment or something but if she took you in I think you should try and see if maybe she’s not doing it purposely. She just wants what’s best but doesn’t know how to properly teach you.
Thank you for your comment! I never thought of that before, that is really interesting way to look at. It's sad yet it could be really true.
Thank you for the kind words that means a lot to me really. I agree I need to accept things won't change, and create bounderies and distance.
It's so important to acknowledge when something that hurts us is the direct result of someone else's hangups and/or trauma. The healing can begin only after this realization.   To me it sounds like your grandmother has skin in the game, so to speak, when it comes to your life. She may be unable to see you as an independent person and, instead, she sees you an an extension of herself. She may be extremely critical of herself and therefore is just as critical of you.   It's the same thing my mother has done/does. It's been a long, painful journey.  You could explore r/CPTSD and r/raisedbynarcissists to see if you relate to any of it. From there, you can seek out some external resources like books or even a therapist depending on how much it affects you. A book that helped me exponentially was Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents: How to Heal from Distant, Rejecting, or Self-Involved Parents by Lindsay C. Gibson, PsyD.
Thank you for saying that, it makes me feel  better hearing that. I wish I could get her to talk to me honestly, yet she won't. I even try and talk to her in public places where she doesn't have an ipad and that doesn't work, she just changes the subject.
I agree with that. Thank you for your comment
Thank you so much for the kind response and advice. I think it would help if I worded it that way, hopefully I can get an answer.
What happened?
This is so cool to hear from a grandma! Thank you so much for the kind words. I am so sorry to hear your mother treated you so harshly, you did not deserve that. Thank God you had a kind grandmother, I am sure you are a great grandmother yourself.  I agree it is important to find the good people, my dear friend is amazingly kind and supportive, I am lucky to know her. Which is why it sucks that my grandmother tries to inadvertantly and sometimes purposely come in between our friendship.
Wow, I am so sorry to hear that you went through all of that. I know that has to be really hard to deal with, I cannot imagine it. You are a very strong person, I definitely understand that if you have trauma you don't like being touched. That is something completely understandable. I do hope you do come to a place where you can be more flexible for your children with that, because kids need affection. Or they'll grow up feeling rejected and hurt. Although you certaintly don't mean it. You sound like a great mother and great person. Thank you for your comment and great insight

It's the truth. If she won't own up about it, you should start ignoring her as she does to you and only listen to other people, when they bring up her? Change the subject.
I hope you will, and that things I'll change, you can do it mate. I believe in you! And no problem, being kind should be normal :)
it's just my parents always praising my sister always saying she better and more mentally healthier then me and let her get away with everything like this week i completed all my chores but with dishes i barely completed them but i still did them but my abusive and hot tempered father didn't like that and took everything away from me my console and restricted my internet i barely had anything in the first place because he took it all away he is only like this with me i have 3 sister's and he is the best father in the world to them but not me he is refusing to take me to the hospital because i called the police on him for hitting me and kicking me out the house and telling me not to come back yeah my life is shit this is why i want to die all they fucking time
I am so very sorry to hear this is happening to you. You absolutely don't deserve for your dad to treat you that way. He should be arrested for abuse most definitely, that is disgusting he put his hands on you. I really hope that things get better for you. Don't allow him to cause you to give up on your life because you're young, and I'm sure you're an amazing person. Great love, money, and beautiful memories will come your way. Please try your best to stay away from him, and if you have someone else you can stay with for a while please do. Hang it there. Much peace and love to you beautiful soul ❤
thank you so much may peace and love come to you too

You’ll likely regret the scars. I used to cut when I was having the craving to, and now I have to get tattoos to cover them up. It’s not a good look for your life, self harm scars are obvious when you see them so you can’t really do normal things without having to explain yourself and/or put someone off
Idk of this will work for you but you could try running your water until it is ice cold into a bowl and dipping your face in.  It works for anxiety sometimes, and it won’t leave scars that you have to explain away to everyone that sees them. Scars suck.
Because it will get better, eventually. Maybe not today, or this week- but it will get better. You matter.   You matter, and are loved
I think you know deep down that you don’t want to do it, or you wouldn’t have posted this here. You did an amazing job asking for help, letting yourself be vulnerable by asking for help is so hard but you did it! Listen to that little voice inside, the part of you that somewhere deep down knows that you have value and worth, find whatever scrap of hope and love that you can and cling to it until you feel safe. It WILL pass. 💜
because even if the whole world hates you, they'll be that one person that loves you and he/she would've feel sad for your scars. The hesitation means the rope is still there, hold the rope tightly
I think about my darkness like weather sometimes. Blizzards come and then they go. It’s not foolproof but it can be helpful.
If I'm depressed and craving to cut myself, I'd first get on the floor and do crunches or planks. Then I'd go for a run and run till I'm near total collapse. So at least I would not have ugly scars and the endorphins from a workout would alleviate my anxiety. Although this didn't always work, but it definitely lessened the number of scars.
It may not seem like anybody likes you, things would be better without you, that you are alone, but that is not true! You dying would make everybody who knows and loves you hurt. People are there with you, and it hurts sometimes, but push through, your road has just begun, and sometimes it isn’t straight. God bless the broken road.
Thank you. I was really scared because it was my first time having such a craving. I had no idea what to do/think. Luckily it passed after a little while. I’ll remember your words if this comes to me again.
When you have the craving, wrap up in a blanket and rock back and forth

getting out of bed for school feels like a battle. I feel sad and lonely all the time. some times I feel weird and the only way I can describe it is like this, all of my good moods and general good things are like tiles on a massive board and when I feel like this it is like all of my tiles got flipped over, or when you are almost done with a really hard level in a video game and you die and have to restart. it feels like that tripled.

Is there anything you like to do that could motivate you?
Hey, open to DM! I'm 19 and have experienced this plenty and have struggled with depression and mental illness all my life. Finding a reason to get out of bed is really helpful, even if it's to go to school so that you get to come home and feel accomplished, because it's not about what you fail to do, but what you do, because you don't ever fail to do anything. You start at zero, and anything greater than that is an achievement worth celebrating, don't let your pride get in the way, if you got out of bed when it was really tough it doesn't matter that it's easy for others, you did that and deserve all the praise in the world! Don't forget that sometimes you just need to stay in bed, don't ask more of yourself than is healthy, but accept that this is a bed day, don't spend the time feeling bad about it, play video games or read or watch something good, commit to it and don't feel bad, because this is you caring for yourself and being patient with yourself. I really hope this was of some help, sorry if it's a bit rambley and my DMs are really open!

I'm pretty sure I have depression and some other mental illness with need of a professional diagnosis and treatment. I've had three psychiatrists before, but it didn't go really well.  Big sum up of backstory: Around 11yo I had a irrational fear of loosing milk teeth. I threw a tantrum and bit my dentist. My mom put me in a psychiatrist. She gave me sedative, but it wasn't working, so they tried giving me laughing gas which led me to beg for my dentist to kill me. My mom gave up on my teeth and after a while took me out of the psychiatrist (I didn't like talking to her too). When I was 13 my mom put me in treatment again because things weren't going well in my new school (I could talk about this for several pages haha...) and again when I was 15 because the teachers at my new school (yes, again. I went to 7 schools) were concerned about my behavior and asked for a psychiatrist and a tomography. My mom was forced to do both (but the doctor refused to do the tomography lol he actually got mad at the teachers for demanding it). ANYWAY, these last two had a personality that made me hate talking to them, their reactions were dramatic and judgmental, I had to repeat what I said several times because they didn't pay attention and one of them accused me of lying. My state of mind got even worse, so I begged my mother to stop it.  My mom already had a bad light of psychiatrist and mental illness, now it's even worse. She says pretty bad things about people with depression, so I'm scared. She already threatened to put me in a mental hospital several times for "acting insane" (I think they are anxiety attacks? I usually had them at school or when my parents weren't home, but because of quarantine my mom is seeing them and she just makes it worse). My dad will probably tell me to go to church more often, that he gave the psychologists a chance and they proved to be useless.  I should have told the last two psychiatrist about all the things I really felt, but, as I said before, I didn't feel comfortable talking to them. For years I hold myself to the thought of "my parents need me so I can't kill myself" and it got me from around 10½ to 17½ years old, but I don't want to feel miserable, lazy, useless, hate myself, cry for hours, keep avoiding all these suicidal thoughts and many more problems every single day.

I’m so sorry you’re having a hard time. Is there ever a time when you think your Mom or Dad might be more open to listening to you? I would tell them that your symptoms are getting worse and you need to see the dr again.   Other than that, is there another adult you can trust that you might to to about this? If not, DM me. I’ll talk to you. I have struggled with depression for years, so I know how lost you can feel when you’re young and your options are limited.
They are usually stressed from work, but I don't like telling them bad stuff during weekends and holidays to not ruin their rest day. Maybe when my mom is watching movies before going to sleep? She might be annoyed at first, but eventually listen...  No other adults, or anyone really... My parents are the only people I talk to irl. One of the past psychologists said that I might have selective mutism, but she never elaborated on that.  I was kind of desperate when writing this post, but today I'm feeling a bit better. I think it worked as a vent. Thank you so much for reading and responding. I'll keep in mind you're open to talk in DMs. Thank you.
Good for you. We all need to vent sometimes!

Do you have an adult you trust that will listen to you? A school counselor, a favorite teacher, or one of your parents? You are not alone, even if the people I mentioned aren’t available or trustworthy I am here for you and have been where you are. I’m 28 now and still suffer from depression but it’s worlds better and I have the best support system. I know it sounds so cliche but it does get better, but I had to find someone to listen to me and take me seriously to get to that point.   If you need me to be that trusted adult I am here for you always. I won’t judge, I won’t try to fix your problems, I’ll listen and be a shoulder. We need you in the world, your life is just starting and you are so valuable, I wish you could see it. Your depression is talking down to you, don’t let it win. You are more than what depression makes you.

Hey there, this is a good place to be as a first step! But if you are able to tell people in your life about how you are feeling, they will very probably want to help you as well.
Dying makes it worse..you have to work off that karma and that takes a millennia at best. The dying scramble, lie, cheat and steal to come back to this plane..just work through it.
Talking to the strangers can be easier than to the ones you know. You can talk to me!

I am not able to brush my teeth, shower; clean my room, do schoolwork, dress properly or anything the like. The funny thing is: 5 hours ago I was super happy and I just dont know how long I can live with this emotional rollercoaster hidden away in my head  I just want my therapist to actually give me any kind of hint or help to get better, instead of just listening and saying the infamous "aha"

I feel like this too
I guess you could say that my depression is in "remission," but that's probably not an accurate word to use because I always feel an ongoing battle in my head like you do. I assume it's like what a recovering addict must feel, I don't think it's ever something that's cured.  So, with that being said, you have to come to grips with the fact that you are probably always going to have to fight this battle.  The good news is that you will feel better when you finally realize that it is OK to have down days and up days.  You don't have to put on a face for anyone.  You don't need to be ashamed.  Depression is a disease that isn't treated like one. The people that can truly relate to you are the ones that have suffered or are suffering with it.    Likewise, it is OK to look for these other people that can relate like you have by posting.  Every day doesn't have to be a great day, but you just have to not let these snowball downward.  You have to build momentum.  So today you skip brushing your teeth.  Tomorrow you do it.  That's a victory, build on it. The day after brush and make your bed and so on.    Focus on these victories and don't languish on the things that you didn't do.  Your mental and physical health are most important.  Don't give a crap about how it "looks" or what other people think  when you are down.  Maybe if they knew you would actually build a stronger support system. You need people around you to help you out of dark days.  I am living proof that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  You just have to find your way of getting there.  It WILL happen for you, just never give up and never give in. Don't let it beat you. You are a survivor. Many small victories lead to eventually winning the war.
live without a psychological mask  you'll never want to go back to the masked world

Recently I feel like I am just going through the motions in life. I don’t feel sad or unhappy I just feel numb. While I have a few short term goals that feel rewarding I have no direction in life. I have scheduled an appointment with a counselor however that won’t be until February. Until then I was wondering if anyone else has gone through this before and what might have helped them get through this.

Everything is getting worse for me. I used to blame others for my own shortcomings. Now I realized it was all me. I'm the weak one. Everybody improvise, while I'm here failing most of the things in my life. I had a perfect family and some friends and everything, but I'm sick of putting the happy mask. Does anyone has any tips for me to feel like my life has reason or feels like it have meaning. Basically any life tips , I'll take it I guess

I'm 17 and have been suffering with depression for the better part of 4 years now. It all sparked after my step brother's suicide and when I blamed myself for not being able to prevent his death. I have since realized that it wasn't my fault and have come to terms with it, however when I believed that I fell into a pit of self deprecation. I hurt myself, started to drink, and often thought about suicide myself. Back then I had a great support group. I was involved in band and was constantly around my friends, I was going to therapy, and I started having a better outlook on life.   Fast-forward to fall 2019. I begin harboring those same emotions,  the feelings of self hatred and loathing. I had, at that time, stopped going to therapy on account that A.) my therapist resigned, and B.) I had improved a lot from where I was. I had coping skills and a good support system, I was confident that I would be able to overcome my next hurdle. I nearly didn't. My self harm increased dramatically, I had frequent anxiety attacks, and I had come very close to attempting suicide. I once again received help. This time it came from my drumline instructors, all men who I had extreme respect for. They genuinely cared about who I was and how I felt, when at that time I felt completely alone even with all my friends. I got help, once again, and managed too pull through.   2020, my family decides its time to move. I lived in Oregon for practically all my life and my family couldn't afford to live there anymore. I tried convincing them to stay for one more year, as it was my senior year and I didn't want to abandon all i had been working for. Alas we moved, all the way over to Mississippi. Besides my anxiety about a new school and academics, I had a lot of anxiety about my support system. I would be leaving all my friends, who I relied on to talk to and be with when I hit my lows. My school resources, such as my drumline instructors. Everything.   That brings us to the present. I'm beginning to fall once again. I have finished half of the school year, and there is not one person here that talks to me. On top of that the atmosphere has greatly changed.  Before my mother was a caring person who was worried about me and was there for me when I needed her, and now she's...different. A few months ago I tried telling her I wasn't well (mentally) ands she blew me off, saying I needed some vitamins, which even then she didn't even get me. I feel like I can't go to anyone. I'm never good with conveying my thoughts online to people, so I haven't been able to talk to my friends back in Oregon about it. The one's who still are my friends anyway, many have left me or claimed that I am a terrible person somehow when it wasn't my choice for me to leave. I'm stuck. I haven't been able to find any kind of support here, as the stereotypes regarding male depression are very much present in the community here. I'm scared that I will fall into a worse hole than I have been in the past, I have been feeling the urge to hurt myself creeping into the back of my head for awhile now.  I don't know what to do.

For reference I’m 23 and probably started getting depressed around 12 and it’s only started getting better in the past 2 years. I’ve made a lot of progress but I still just don’t feel like a person- like I’ve always been here on the edge of a normal life, but never able to get close enough to have it.  I don’t have a personality or interests, I’ve kind of just always been “there”. I’ve never really had anything to contribute. I have about three real friends (for the first time in my life), and even then there’s just some disconnect. And it definitely sucks watching my friends date and have guys be so into them, and guys don’t even notice much less talk to me. I know dating someone wouldn’t fix me or anything. It just sucks knowing nobody’s ever wanted me like that, and the only time someone maybe did I never even got to find out because I wasn’t functional at the time. It feels like everyone’s always been able to tell I’m not worth it, even before I figured it out.   My life just doesn’t seem to work normally, like I don’t get the same chances other people do. I don’t expect my life to be the same as other people’s and when I compare myself it’s more general. I just know I missed out on all these things like dating and having friends and figuring yourself out that help you developmentally and I’m not where I should be right now. I don’t even know if this is something that can be fixed. But I’ve already missed out on my whole life and can’t find any indication that the rest won’t be a waste too and it’s so tiring knowing that.   If anyone else has felt like this, what did you do? How do you “catch up”- not to others, but to where you know you could’ve been if you hadn’t been depressed? How do you even start being a person? I’m just tired of convincing myself things will change when they never do and I don’t know what else to try. Or is it just too late for me to become someone? Part of me thinks I’m just stuck like this and it would be better for everyone if I just disappeared and lived the rest of my life alone somewhere. Why should I even bother doing all this work just to get to a normal person’s bare minimum?

Things won't really change until you start changing them one by one. That's harsh but I don't have another way to put it. First, stop looking at others, grass seems greener on the other side. The worst thing about depression is that it makes you feel powerless when in fact you are not.   &#x200B;  I digged my way out by reading and trying new hobbies. I forced myself to put all the attention on me. I felt like I had this spotlight on me for a while that wasn't going anywhere so I eventually started getting the bare minimum done. One year later, even though I have severe ulcer due to alcoholism because of the depression, and some other issues that I need to work on, I am better.  &#x200B;  Take them one day at the time. Force yourself to learn something new every day, and put the spotlight on yourself. Others have struggles too, you just don't know about them. And that's normal.
Hey, for a start,  you are a person and your a clever, articulate, introspective and questing individual that obviously has enough sense and self awareness to convey your thoughts through writing.   As the other comment stated, finding things that interest you, developing new skills and hobbies and throwing yourself into new challenges will beat back the nihilism and the complacency that leads to stagnation.   I have not figured it all out either and I'm 34 years old. I'll be 35 at the end of March and I have no idea what I want to do or realistically what I can do. I'm reading a bit again. I'm taking care of my health more, I'm self teaching myself piano, listening to loads of new music from new artists and finding new "me things."  As for Love life...in my experience, that comes along when you least expect it to and often you dont really know its happening until it's already become a thing and then  it's like...'oh, I didn't realise that was happening and now I'm inside of a happy, serious relationship.'   Just take it easy, try not to get anxious about your 'identity' or who you should be and just let yourself gravitate toward the things you find you enjoy as you explore and search. After awhile you will find things that you want to press on with and the amalgamation of those things will build up a stronger sense of identity.

Is it just me or someone going through this too. I'm unable to focus on what I'm doing, rethinking if I locked the door or not, locked car, left door open, drop something, may be I forgot something, lock the doors and recheck them 10 times, sit and simply do nothing, stay in bed think shit with useless thoughts . Etc.. Last 2 months I have lost my wallet which had all my ids, bank cards..

This could be OCD. That's a pattern where the brain reacts to uncertainty and fear with varying compulsive behaviors in an attempt to avoid a perceived threat and control the fear-inducing circumstances, fueling a cycle of fear-compulsion-relief-fear-compulsion-relief.   It's best to contact a mental health professional on this asap to get a proper diagnosis and plan your next steps. If tackled early through ERP or ACT it's a lot easier to cut out the compulsions and establish value-centered behaviors. The longer you wait, the more the compulsive behaviors (atm that's checking & controlling certain circumstances) might become a routine, making it even more difficult to cut them out.
I'm going through something similar, but severe enough that I'm applying for short-term leave to see if I can recover by reducing my stress (and yes, I'm lucky that I have this option... my other "choice" would have been to keep doing my best until I get let go for poor performance, and then use UI as STD insurance). Not depression in my case, but it might be neuroinflammation, which may cause some cases of depression from what I'm reading.   Hugs, it's hard. I joke that it's severe "why was I in the kitchen?" syndrome, but for me it's every couple of minutes I forget what I'm doing and have to start over.  I have had some luck using Ibuprofen preventatively for my situation, as soon as my head gets the "buzzy" feeling that tells me it's getting bad in my case. And I'm taking half-days of PTO until my leave application can be completed, which also seems to be helping me be at least a little productive at work.

I’m 23, and my mom died 6 months ago. I helped take care of her through the last few months of her life, and it was the first time I’ve watched anyone really close to me die.   I’ve always struggled with anxiety and depression, but this has pushed me to a place I don’t know how to get out of. After she passed, I slowly developed a pretty intense health anxiety disorder. Does it get better? If my mom died, what’s stopping something horrible happening to me young, taking me away from a life I haven’t even lived yet?   I’m on meds and in therapy. I just feel lost today (and most days). Not looking forward to waking up to virtually work my 9-5 tomorrow morning. What’s next? How do I love my life again? Or have interests or any motivation?

Oh honey. I’m sorry for your loss and I know exactly the shoes you’re in. Only real advice I can give you, because everyone grieves and processes on different timelines, is to just try to remain open to life and its possibilities. Willing to receive.
Thank you for your kind words. It helps to know others have been there and are still kicking and living. Hope you’re having a good day!

I don't even know how to explain it, but since the first time I got depressed, I've been downspiralling from time to time. At one moment I am completely fine and the other i'm crying and having really dark thoughts, putting myself down and having trouble breathing. Nowadays I feel like I've lost touch with many of my friends (I only talk to 2 now) and I just want to disappear so that I have a reason not to talk even to them (even though i care abt them). I just want to be left alone, but then again when I'm alone, I feel too lonely and left out from the world. I feel like I'm cutting ties with people I like and want to do something about it, but I have no energy and motivation to do so.   Has anyone ever had the same feeling?  (It's my first time on reddit idrk how it works)

Welcome to Reddit. Have you talked to a professional? It sounds like symptoms of bipolar
Sometimes when you’re really depressed, especially if you have been hurt or betrayed by others, we self-isolate to protect our hearts. Then the isolation can make the depression worse. Isolation during depression can be a bit dangerous as we retreat too far into our own pain. I know I tend to get too self-absorbed when alone for extended periods of time while depressed. I think that many, many people are going through exactly this same issue now. I hope you can reach out to a counselor, even if only by phone.
I get this pretty often. wanting to change everything in your life and isolating yourself but also getting extremely lonely once you do so. I think the best way to approach this is address ur issues to ur friends so they could understand why you do these things and also possibly seeing a professional to get yourself checked to see if you do have something other than depression causing this..
Thank you. Well, actually i haven't talked to a professional yet, because i don't know how to bring it up to my parents because when I try they don't believe me. I don't blame them though. They are always super supportive and love me and care about me, but I haven't ever shown any signs of it to them because I look always happy  (+I don't want to burden them). They always claim that it must be puberty or sth (I'm 19).
That's really close to what I feel, thank you for understanding! (Many previous/toxic friends of mine have caused many insecurities) Do you suggest I should go out more, apart from reaching out?
Are you in school? Ask your guidance counselor on services available, or call your doctor. As of 19, at least in the US, you do not need your parents to get a referral for an evaluation.
Normally, I would think so. Often I don’t want to go out or even see anyone. It sounds like too much effort and unlikely to pay off. Then I go, and once I’m there, I’m having a great time.   However, with Covid, it surely isn’t a good idea. I wish I knew the answer. Personally, I’m forcing myself to get up and ready to go, as if I was going out. Once I get moving in the morning, I usually feel a little better. But it’s definitely a daily struggle. Probably the most helpful thing is to recognize the harmful, anti-social internal dialog and stop it. If I say to myself internally, “I friggin hate people sometimes”, I try to reframe it, as in “geez, I’m grumpy today.” Then I force myself to call and check on someone else. Helping others seems to be the best way for me to stop myself from ruminating about poor ole me and my issues. The struggle is real, my friend.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kuvxqy/i_feel_very_undeserving/
I think I finally found why I’m sad all the time and can’t stop myself from wanting bad things to happen to me. I feel like I shouldn’t be where I am, like none of the people who love me should I shouldn’t be given any of the things I have or be able to have the opportunities I do. I feel like no matter what im given I just ruin it. I just wish I had never existed or that someone better would take my place and make something of my good lot in life.

Oh so sorry. Don't worry too much. It's not your fault.
Don’t. You can get it even if diligent. Put your oxygen mask on first, help others if you can and let it go.
Sorry I didn’t see other mentions. By O2 mask I meant like a plane take care of yourself and then help others
It is actually because ive had symptoms and did nothing
Sorry for being rude but it's ur fault then. But you can't blame yourself too much. Just told them that ur truly sorry and mean it

I dont know what to do anymore. I'm just existing, and not in the best place. I'm stressed and anxious and scared, even at home because of everything. In ireland, cases are skyrocketing. I'm in my last year of secondary school, so I'm stressed beyond belief with the uncertainty around exams and everything to do with them. And it's all just spiralling down the fucking drain.   It does help my mother and father are fighting and shouting and screaming at each other most night while I try to sleep. And tonight I finally broke and screamed at them. Then walked in on my mother crying because of it, and seeing signs that didnt look too good.   It doesn't feel good being stuck in the middle of it. I just want it to stop and I dont know how to make it stop

I'm no medical professional myself, as a disclaimer, but here's my advice anyway.  In situations that feel difficult or impossible to control (like, say, just to use a completely random example, a global pandemic), it's good to focus on some (healthy) things that you *can* control. I've found making art, writing, or music to be pretty good for this, as tired and cliched as that might sound. It can even be smaller things - I once started picking up and collecting rocks that I liked, for instance.  It's also important to remember that you aren't responsible for anyone's actions but your own. In a family like that, I have a hunch you might be blaming yourself for not being able to change others' behavior, which isn't a good mindset to get into.  W/rt school anxiety, Irish exams can be pretty intense, so I feel you there too. No matter what happens, though, your grades aren't a part of your identity, and nobody rational would blame you for doing poorly, under the circumstances.  Best of luck, and stay safe. <3

The second one is so true wow
These are actually super tender, makes me feel warm. Thank you for sharing ☀
May I ask how do you journal? When I write down my thoughts, it just makes me feel worse as they feel magnified.
I agree. I dont think those quotes would help me because I don't care and that I have a hard time in  life, it doesn't hurt to have a little positivity I guess
Hello Reddit family not paid to say this I promise just personal experience but I’ve tried herbs, klonopin, biofeedback therapy etc. I bet we all have and still live with crippling anxiety but since starting acupuncture and using an acupuncture pen I feel more lively and using it during panic attacks when I feel them come on keeps me present it’s very relaxing.  I’ll link the one I got, but apparently they are all pretty similar but I’ve had this for a few months and it’s still fine. Give it a shot and if nobody told u today then I will  I love u❤️  https://revolutionizedhealing.com
😊
Thank you for your kind words, I am glad to hear that as well ☺️
Absolutely! Well, if I'm feeling down and wish to reflect on my thoughts and feelings, I'll free write exactly what I'm thinking or feeling. I try to get at the root of the issue that's making me feel such a way. After I either do 2 things. For one, I may focus on how the thing that is bothering me is not really a problem, how it will not be important in a week, month, or year on, or how like a wound, it will heal with time. Or two, I focus on the good things I have in my life and focus on being grateful. In other words, I focus on what "is working" rather than what is not working.   I hope this makes sense and helps as well. I'm willing to say more too.
Your feelings are validated and acknowledged. I'm sorry to hear that but you know, I've been there too. Everything seemed pointless and meaningless. Nothing mattered and I really did not care about anything or anyone at all. Other times it felt worse than that.   All I will say is that people do care about you and love you, whether you believe that or not. And you do have purpose. Depression sometimes fades away but can come back. Just know that things will get better with time. Dont be afraid to reach out for help. Battling depression is a team effort kind of thing.  If you ever need someone to listen, I can. Thank you for messaging on here :)
Thank you! That's really great! I'll put them into practice too 😊. I've only been writing about my feelings and usually end up feeling exhausted and bad. 😅 Been going at it the wrong way! 😂
Internet has been a fantastic place to realize that, even when you feel the loneliest, others are right there, in that present moment,  deeplyexperiencing the pain with you, somehow. And it brings a sense of companionship hard to describe. It's been my experience that only people who have experienced depression know how to talk properly to people to are there as well. It is one of those things where simply knowing the theory about it won't help you. Depression is over romanticized, it is not cool to have depression and yes, it is a medical illness that has quite a lot of causes, and therefore just as many treatments. Finding the one that suits you better is a life quest for many, I'd say. I am not that old nor wise, but this I can guarantee: this too will pass.
You're welcome friend! Thank you! Yes give it a try 😊 also know, you dont have to overwhelm yourself by writing every single day. I've done that and then I get disappointed in myself when I don't write everyday but until recently, I've learned, its okay to not write every single day. Dont look at it as the "wrong way" friend, look at it as experience and wisdom. We all are finding what works and that's okay 😊😁

I've a psychiatric appointment tomorrow but my family has asked me to postpone it because of surging cases of covid and they're afraid that I will cry and get myself infected. They've even demand for the reason I cry and told me I must not cry bcoz there's no legit reason for me to cry but I can't help it. Tears come to me easily since childhood, a swell of emotions and tears spill. So telling me I can see a psychiatrist on condition that I don't cry is impossible for me.   I'm not on medication. I've been diagnosed with depression many years ago and I think I've relapsed since last year but I was in denial because I didn't want to relapse. It felt like such a failure. So I told myself I'd get through it.   Then end of last year, I had palpitations and after check up, I was referred to the psychiatric department for anxiety assessment and I felt awful bcoz it's a confirmation that I've relapsed in my mental health.   I'm trying to stay afloat. I know some coping strategies to deal with the thoughts but these emotions come so fast and before I know it, I'm crying again and I feel awful for being unable to control my tears and thoughts. I have some good days and some bad days.   I'd like some words of encouragement because it feels so hard. Thanks whoever is reading this.

Yeah, I can relate to this. Honestly, there are tons of people whose mental illnesses have gotten a lot worse in the face of Current Events, so there's nothing really to feel bad about there. Even people with no history of anxiety/depression are developing symptoms right now, so there's no reason to feel bad about them, especially if you have a past history.  As for having no "legit reason" to cry.....that's kind of the crux of the issue. Imo, at its core, mental illness is about involuntarily responding to your situation in a way that's not healthy. Of course your crying doesn't make sense to your family - it's an involuntary reaction with no good, logical cause.  It's possible that this is truly a misunderstanding, and explaining it to them that way (ideally in written form) will get them to understand that pointing out the problem doesn't help solve it. Of course, it's also possible an explanation won't help - that's really up to you to decide.  It potentially could also help to frame this appointment as something that's just required despite the risks (I'm assuming they still go out to buy groceries), agreeing to additional safety precautions (like sanitizing your hands before wiping your eyes, increasing the space between you and the person giving the appointment, or having it in a larger and better-ventilated space) or even pointing out that almost all covid exposure comes from air exchange. Again, don't know your situation; these are just angles you could potentially try if you think it might help.  As an aside, I'm pretty confident you've thought of this already, but video calls can be really effective for mental health treatments. Might be worth looking into your options there, if you haven't.
Thank you for the encouraging words. I appreciate it very much. Take care.
I've explained how I felt and my worries over being unable to cope to my family and I've sought help yesterday. Thank you very much for your comment.

Hey. I am sorry you are going through this. If you don't mind me asking, what do you mean by sick? Excuse me if this question is inappropriate. I don't want to offend you in any way.
Would you mind sharing a little more about what is going on? Someone here may offer you some insight you haven’t considered.
[deleted]
Unfortunately no one can change the facts. I’ve spent thousands of dollars and untold hours on therapists and doctors. It may sound trivial to some but I made an irreversible mistake last year when I was going through a rough time and basically destroyed my whole life. There is nothing left for me. I can’t sleep and when I do I wake up screaming from the pain and mental anguish. I can’t endure any more days of this.
You probably don't want to hear this. But yes it is. I feel the same almost every day. But then something little happens... a little bird landing on my window sill... snowfall and I suddenly remember I used to love seeing snowy landscapes. I know the unbearable feeling and I understand you don't want to go on. But please reconsider.
I’m so sorry you feel this way. May I ask what the mistake was? Please censor as you see fit, but I would really like to know more about your situation.

I've got this roommate situation going on where I'm literally afraid of the person I'm living with. He's a drunk and can be erratic and most of the time I just stay holed up in my room with the door locked trying to stay under his radar. He's supposed to move out at the end of the month, but you know, who knows if he'll actually do that. He's basically indigent so I see no reason for him to move to a new place and not instead just root himself here for us to evict him. My other roommate is in another country until February and I live in a completely different state from my family. I'm isolated.   That being said, I've stopped caring for myself almost completely. I don't remember the last time I shaved, got a hair cut. (Covid is a good excuse to not get a hair cut, but I feel just disgusting.) Getting up and taking a shower doesn't work. I just lay back down. I might have a problem with my car, but I don't want to take it to the shop because I'm afraid it might be my only escape if things get bad, and I'd rather it die on the road from a fleeing event then just not have it at all. But at the same time, is that just my brain rationalizing? I don't know. I have to get it fixed though because I have to use it for work.   I just feel hopeless. I don't know what to do to try and motivate myself but even knowing that this is a product of feeling sad makes me even more unmotivated.

I’m sorry to hear you are going through this.  Are you going to work?  Of going to school?  I guess if you are doing the main life stuff, just cut yourself some slack.  It would be scary to live with a drunk.
I work from home so, I have to be here. He's off in the middle of the week so at least on the weekends I have some of the day to myself but. I really don't know what to do. From everyone I talk to it sounds like there's literally nothing.
There are two kinds of depression, biological and situational.  It sounds like you have situational depression which is a normal response to your horrible living situation.  I’m going through a similar situation.  New people moved in upstairs from me and they play video games at all hours.  I haven’t had a decent night’s sleep in months.  The landlords can’t evict them because of the eviction moratorium.  I talked to a therapist.  I’m working on moving.  I feel you.  It is a horrible situation you are in.
If you're in the USA the landlords can, in fact, evict them. The moratorium only applies to non payment of rent. I would speak to your landlord again. Hope that helps.  Source: A coworker got evicted 2 weeks ago for selling drugs from his apartment.
Yeah. I wish I could move. This place is cheap so I have to stay here basically until I get my credit up to an acceptable level for somewhere else. I don't know what the contingency is if my landlord can't get him out. His relatives say he'll be out but like I said, without a bunch of funds, unlikely.   Sorry to hear you are in a similar situation
I started taking Saint John’s Wort.  Helps a bit.
Do they sell it at Walgreens? All I have time to go out is this Saturday
It is probably cheaper to order online. Swanson is a great place.

I feel like you could find some people in the same situation. I know this because this could have been posted by my daughter. She feels the same right now. Does your uni have a Facebook page with virtual activities? Does it have a student blog? Are you studying a language—maybe there is a tandem-language group you could join. Can I ask what country you are in?
I'm in Portugal. It does have a Facebook page but I don't know about activities or the blog. Not studying a language but my studies aren't going as I wish which also doesn't help 😅
What my daughter has done to distract herself from these exact feelings (also- her studies are not going as she wishes) is to find a  Netflix series she can get interested in, doing art, listening to new artists on YouTube, and exercising. Some days it is a real struggle for her just to get out of bed—so I realize these things might not sound that great to you. She also just purchased a weighted blanket to help her sleep as nights are extremely hard for her too. Could you share your space with a flat mate?
I don't enjoy the time investment you have to put into watching a series haha, but I draw and I used to exercise, don't really like to duribg the winter, and I'm always listening to music ☺️. I have to try the weighted blanket tho

Nothing is working out for me, I'm lonely at school and home. The internet is my only escape but it's littered with so many toxic people, I don't even wanna turn on my computer anymore. It feels awful when your only safe place isn't safe anymore. My head is hurting from everything going on. I don't feel bothered to do anything anymore. Everyone else is just so much better than me. Even if I try my hardest, I just can't get where I want to. Everything is just crumbling. Everything good is going or is gone.

> It feels awful when your only safe place isn't safe anymore.  It really does :(  I'm so sorry you are going through this.   Is there anyone that you could talk to about going to a doctor or therapist?
Keep trying. It’s hard but it’s not impossible. Agree you should seek others to help though
I've told my mom but she hasn't done much
Maybe she needs to hear it a few times before it really sinks in that you are serious and really do want to get professional help. Especially with how our modern culture throws around the term "depression" to mean "feeling sad today", people might need to see that you are serious about it and are really struggling.    If you try your mom again but that doesn't go anywhere,  is there a teacher or aunt/uncle that you could go to?

I need help My Fiancé, my world, has bad mental health.  Throughout our relationship he has had some periods of no feelings, and each time we backed off for a little bit. Last time I stayed at my house for a couple days before he wanted me back. It’s happening again. This time feels different. I’m scared I can’t lose him, I will not survive. He is my world and more and when I try to explain this he refers back to his lack of feelings. He has even been told by proffionals not to do anything silly between us to (in ending things). But tonight he’s now lying on the opposite side of bed (my head next to his feet) and he’s took his ring off.  I’m breaking. I tried to tell him how when this happened before he wanted me back straight away and got upset about being away from me and just last night he said that he doesn’t want to leave me. I don’t know what to do. I know it’s his head but I’m scared he has found someone else or is hiding something and disguising it as something else   Any advice. Please

OH SHIT!!!  At this point now, you need to get into **Tough love**!!  You need to set up an intervention on him! He honestly has no idea what the fuck he’s brushing with his behavior going completely unaddressed!  Unfortunately right now it sounds extremely toxic between you two.  The moment he realizes he’s getting the treatment, is the moment he’s trying to get you back on his side. That is extremely abusive of him emotionally.  It’s basically the same behavior of a spoiled cat who ruins everything in your house and expects you to feed her Just because you love her. He’s not that kind of animal, and you don’t owe him any breathing room to behave like that!!!  He KNOWS that consequences are just waiting to be served up to him, and he doesn’t want them, but that does NOT mean he can/may control wether or not you give them. You have no reason to feel this kind of Stockholm syndrome with him!  So what do you need to do is **Put your foot down about this**. You need to express to him, in no uncertain terms, that you honestly can do a hell of a lot better than him. You need to let him know That you care a great deal about him, but that you will ** not** indulge his word on wanting you back every time you have you limit with his conduct!!! He is STILL AND ADULT, and at this point he needs to make an adult choice between getting serious help with his mental problems and learning how not to let them affect you & or your relationship, or else letting you leave him for his own sake to realize that of himself.    There’s no other way around it without further enabling him.  You need to be firm on this.

I'm pretty sure I have ED because I'm depressed. I haven't had any desire to have sex in over a month. I'm guessing it's from the winter pandemic but I usually have seasonal depression and I've never had ED before. I tried getting more, sun, exericse, and vitamin d pills and nothing.

Today i just couldnt get out of bed. It feels like im not going anywhere, theres no end goal. Nothing i ever do makes a change on me, my surrounding or anyone around me.  Im bored and cant get out of it. When i stop feeling bored i just feel sad and sometimes angry at myself. I thought about me dying and i assume some people would be sad, but it wouldnt be tragic. All my affairs are in order, my parents have other kids, my SO will probably be better off and my pets will be taken care of. I havent done anything relevant with my life and i know i wont in the future either.  Basically, i just dont see the point.

I can relate to everything you said here. Sometimes I feel awful about how little I’ve accomplished. I have no sense of purpose in my life. And I’m almost 40, so I’m starting to feel like my life is basically over. But I try to shift my perspective to see that as a relief. No one is waiting for me to do anything great anymore. The pressure’s off. I support myself in a perfectly respectable job, and it’s actually a great job in the sense that I work very little for the amount I get paid. I have people in my life who care about me, and I care about them. So I just try to do things I enjoy and not think about what a mediocre person I turned out to be. This will all be over soon enough. We might as well try to enjoy the things we have while we have them, and forget about the rest.

I’m a male, soon to be 29. I feel lonely pretty much all day, every day. I think i just usually suppress it under the taught belief that “it will go away” and feel normal through my daily activities, to function and so forth. I get home and then it reminds me. I’ve only had a few girlfriends, the last one being about 3-4 years ago.   I asked out a girl at work awhile ago, because she wouldn’t stop talking to me and seemed to find me wherever I was. Obviously I misread that and she said no. That’s awkward. Wonderful for confidence.   I woke up this morning at 4am thinking about a girl that I used to date who actually reached out to me. We went out, and I blew that one. I was uncomfortable and boring, because I don’t do anything other than work and study. I just don’t get the opportunity to date. Women always tell me no.   In the same dream there was another girl that never became anything official, but I loved. She ended up being engaged, and closer to the crazy side, but who am into judge. That’s probably why we got along so well. Shes still got a handle on part of me, she was one of the only girls that said yes and gave me a chance. She also happened to be a head turning bombshell that put me into another level of confidence. Oh well I guess.  I’m just tried if this feeling. I used to be quite the player in a short span of 2 years before college fucked up every part of my life, I know what I deserve and what I’m capable of. I just wish other people saw it too. I like to think of myself as a go-getter I can do anything kind of guy. There hasn’t been a goal I’ve set for myself that I haven’t achieved, when I decided to stick to it. No matter what I do, women seem to be my kryptonite. I’m always a great friend to them, never a love interest. If I try to become a love interest, then I’m an idiot and things are awkward.   I was successful when I had a body and partied like Hefner. When I had a lot of friends before everyone moved away. I’m just so tired. Im emotionally drained, completely emptied. I don’t have the energy to be assertive with myself at work, I just want to avoid all conflict because there is so much internal conflict going on every second of every day. I’m getting to the point where I’m starting to accept that I may just be alone forever.

》I’m starting to accept that I may just be alone forever.  So accept it.  A life partner doesn't cure depression.   If you never find a life partner, how would you want to live your life? What do you want to experience? What do you want to give back to the world? What would give you energy and joy and fulfillment? Start to find those things and do them. Build a life that challenges you and engages you in the ways that you want to be challenged and engaged.   When you are an active participant in your own life, that has so many benefits - and one of the benefits is that you will meet the people who are a good fit for you. People are attracted to partners that are being true to themselves.  It sounds like you have some of the symptoms of depression. It might be worth talking to your doctor or a therapist about your experience of loneliness and the internal conflict that you mention.
Get up and do something every day, even if it's a small something    I am a woman, I was stuck in a lonley rut, not doing anything but the bare minimum. I had to focus of me, starting with small things, take a talk, get a new outfit you feel nice in, do one social thing. Before being with someone made sence and came more readily. I had to become comfortable in my skin, with who I am. I am nerrdy, so what.    A partner of any kind should not have the weight of your happyness on them. You must first learn to be happy alone before you can be happy with someone. The notion in all the movies of my life is incomplete or not worth living or whatever with out a partner is bull. Even married as I am now we have our distinct hobbies, and are distinct people, yes we get to share most memories now, but if he goes out to do something I'm not sitting home miserable.
I don't think you will be alone forever :) and even if you were, you will never be truly alone. Do you have hobbies?
Thank you
Thanks, I really do appreciate this.
I appreciate that. I did, college has kind of eliminated all free time, so I had to give up most of my hobbies for a few years. I don’t qualify for much aid, so I have to work quite a few hours on top of it. I’m almost done though so hopefully I can do things to help physically and mentally again.  Covid hasn’t been very progressive for me in the Bobbie department either, so “breaks” are usually just pure work.
I know it's hard when your stuck alone and wanting a partner, but you need to be comfortable with yourself . And happy alone before you'll be happy in a relationship that will last.   Start small
I can relate. I don't get any help either so I worked some jobs to keep me afloat. But there's a light at the end of the tunnel for you as I can see. I always try to remind myself that you go through some phases in life. Maybe you should still try to do little things for you, even if you can't do much, because you have little to no free time. Maybe you can still find something to distract you from everything.
It is. It’s advice I keep hearing, and I keep trying to apply. I just feel like as I focus on myself, I just end up doing more independent individual things. I’m perfectly happy alone, until I look around and realize I’m alone, and realize that’s where my life is headed unless I change something. Over the course of 20 years of “doing me”, i feel like it’s not working. The only time I noticed substantial growth in that area of my life was when I got involved with “the wrong crowd”.   I was younger then, I wanted to party, be stupid. The “wrong crowd” facilitated that enviornment. Life hadn’t corrected me yet with disaster and pain. Now that it has, I don’t want to act like that anymore and be in those situations, I want a family and a home to share with someone.  But because that’s how I feel, I think that makes me boring and Un-attractive.  Additionally, I’ve been rejected so many times, I’m developing resentment toward women. Regardless if it’s my fault or not, I know I can’t heal unless I admit it. Not trying to bash, just sharing what’s going on inside.
I have been trying to learn to cook haha. A little goofy, but it occupies time. Thank you though I appreciate all the positivity
hey that's a good thing :) I get that people trying to be positive when you're feeling really low can be overwhelming but I am glad you're fine. If you ever need to rant again, feel free to write.

WARNING:  Some comments repeated may be triggering for some folks.     My aunt has never been able to come to terms with the loss of her husband (6 years ago).  Pre covid she opted to move into a senior facility as the lonely nights were too much to handle and she was drinking to cope rather than eating and took a spill that hospitalized her for a month.   Having a community helped and folks that are there to check on her be there at night.  Family and friends could take her out to be social and enjoy the days.  Post Covid, she isn’t supposed to leave the facility at all and if she does, there is a 2 week quarantine to her room for the safety of others.  Due to this she barely moves and sits all day.  She is falling further and further back into depression and eating less.    Last month her brother passed away which rocked her hard and sent her into a deep depression again.    To make matters even worse, COVID has reached her facility despite their best efforts.    I am at a loss as to how to help her.  She was always into crafts and projects but that all lost its shine when her husband passed.  Her saving grace was getting out and about with friends & family as well as eating out and window shopping or playing poker with a widow club she found.  She lost that with covid and once again feels so isolated.  She keeps asking to die talks about it constantly like she did after my uncle passed.  She laments that each day she is still here.  Her beliefs are the only thing that stop her from direct self harm I think.    So what I am asking for, are things I can say or try to do for her that can ease her pain.  Or to at least be a better shoulder or ear.  I don’t know how to respond to her comments as I asked if I could bring her anything and she asked for a gun so she could end her suffering.    I don’t know help her.  We have considered moving her in with family however, she doesn’t want to do that and in all fairness, we couldn’t be home with her all the time the way she needs someone to be.

There are alot of factors, if they can't get therapy just being there can help but you also have to take a look and find the root of problems such as fear and that. I don't know how to hope you as everyone is a different case. Just, there are certain things you need to look out for like triggers.
To be honest with you, you can't get someone out of depression unless you're a therapist or psychiatrist. You can be there for them tho!! Talk to them about going to therapy, be there when it gets rough.. good luck!
Thanks :)
Thanks a ton!

i don't know... i hear of fights in my city all the time at night... i don't think it's safe
damn that sucks. it's kind of the situation for me, heh  i still suggest giving it a try sometime
that's one of the things that frightens me: to get mugged or hurt
update. just walked at night. really good experience. do not recommend doing it at night though. maybe morning is the best time

Lately I have been feeling very suicidal and I am really starting to get worried that I lose control and kill myself. My depression started when I was 13 and ended when I was 19, but came back a year later and because of anxiety and the pandemic it is very difficult for me to get to a better mental state. I am 21 now. I know that it will end someday and everything will be fine again and I even know what to do because like I said, I already managed to get out of this dark place once. But this time the feeling of hopelessness really hit me.   The problem I have now is that even though I know that this will pass and what I have to do I just don't understand why. My life will be shit for at least 3 years even if I manage to get out of depression and after that I will have to go to work everyday for the rest of my life and that's it. I really don't see a future for me anymore and I don't know what to do. My life will be shitty and I will spend the next years watching everyone of my friends living and being happy, while I will be alone and have to recover from everything that happened. Like I said I have been feeling very suicidal the last month and I never had suicidal thoughts this bad. I really think that's it for me. I don't want to die but I see nothing in my future worth being strong for. It feels like my life is over, like this is just a bad dream. I cant believe that this is my life. I am really scared that I will lose control and kill myself in a moment where I am not strong enough and I really want to do something to get better but last time (3 years ago) even though I couldn't imagine that I will feel better I still saw things in my future I wanted to experience, but this time there is nothing.     Has someone advice that could help me with feeling hopeless and seeing no future?

I'm sorry to read that your depression has returned after you kicked it for a bit.  The pandemic is taking its toll on a lot of people.  You certainly aren't alone there.  I hate to state the usual crap, but at 21, your life is just beginning, and you spin your future into some monotonous routine of just clocking in for some dead-end job day after day, and that's all your life will be... without meaning.  But that's not what is going to happen.  Yea, most of us have to work to pay the bills, but there is no reason to think you won't have a career that you enjoy and take pride in your work.  And that will just be a part of your life.  You will have friends, you will have a partner in life, and maybe you will have a family with them.  Then, your life will have no meaning and you will no longer be only concerned with yourself.  You will take vacations to relax, or go on adventures. You will host holidays and love every minute of it.  You will look back at 2020 and be grateful you kept your chin up and pressed forward because back then, you couldn't see what was coming.

Hi friends, life is tough sometimes. But i wanted to share what got me through this fog I’ve been in. My normal struggle is with anxiety, but this last week has been...heavy. Today, it all peaked and I was talking to my boyfriend because I have been having a hard time sleeping, feeling motivated, and feeling like myself. But you know what, he said it’s okay to cry, to grieve, to feel things like this BECAUSE THEY’RE FLEETING. He told me to go take a nap, and I woke up with a sliver of more energy. I asked if there was something I could do to keep my hands busy so me and the kiddo made brownies, i felt ever so slightly better. And the highlight of my day, I had enough energy to put on headphones and have a dance party!!! I know things are tough, and in the last three days I’ve spent more time in bed than out. But this dance party (to I feel good by James brown lol) made me feel lighter, gave me some hope. Some joy.  I hope reading this sparks something for you. I believe in you, your life is worth it, those dark moments can be so heavy, but just in this community there are so many of us rooting for you. I know you’re rooting for me.

My boyfriend (22) is living in my house with my family and has been during the pandemic because he doesn’t really have anywhere to go that he’d feel comfortable. He’s from a conservative area and his close family lives out of the country.   He has been having fits of bipolar depression for about 1.5 years now and it’s getting worse. He gets disproportionately angry every morning at very small things, then gets embarrassed about it and apologizes for it later. He has made lots of different plans to get help but it always fall through somehow. This constant cycle is starting to affect my mental health and I want to do what is best for the two of us.  I love him with all my heart and the thought of losing him to this mental illness is so scary.   My questions are:  What would you try in my situation?   When do I say enough is enough?   And if I have to — how do I go about breaking up with someone who I’m still in love with during a pandemic given our sensitive living situation...  Any advice or opinions are welcome.

*whom* I’m
Hi, just found this. Im new here. I actually struggle with what my girlfriend thinks is bipolar depression  for a few years now. Ive pretty much connected with what some of your boyfriend does.   The best thing I think you could do is help him find something hes passionate about. So for me, my friends and me will use base building videogames, kind of like DayZ (we all got a private no pvp server). It helps me enjoy something that takes focus and can help relax me with the complex building mechanics. After I play it for a bit (hours), I can usually slip out of my bad feelings.   I dont know if its a bad way to get out of what i felt before but it makes things a lot more bearable. I dont get easily mad or frustrated afterwards. Plus, I usually just go back to my day and can spend time not ruining anyones mood or being a sad guy at the party, I can feel something. Even if your boyfriend doesnt have friends, just you being "interested" in something he finds cool, could also help slip out of what hes feeling even if its temporary. Like say he loves watching sports, watch some highlights with him. He loves scary movies, try to find a new one together, basically stuff like that.   He might be hard to help at first but my friends would basically drag me to my ps4 to get me going then, my girlfriend will show me some more art she drew and tell me about the techniques she uses and plans for what she wants to do with it, maybe talk about her new commissions. Its great and it helps even if I dont feel better at the end of the day. Just make him feel like hes apart of whatever, even if he cant control it.   I hope this helps. Im bad at explaining things and tend to over explain, but I feel examples are useful.
Does he know how this is affecting your mental health?  If he loves you as much as you clearly love him, that could be a good motivator to work on his issues. If he understands that he is hurting you by not getting help (and that he is putting your relationship in jeopardy), then he might be convinced to finally see a psychiatrist.   I would encourage you to lovingly and emphathetically communicate the impact that his lack of treatment has on you.   Trust your gut as to when enough is enough. Sometimes saying No and stepping out of the relationship (even temporarily) is the most loving thing you can do (sometimes).  Before you take that step, I would encourage you to discuss that with your parents or other adults who have an outside perspective but know you and your boyfriend well. Trust the wisdom and experience of people who care about both of you and have your best interests in mind.

Please help I cant take more leave or a break

You’re not alone. I often feel the same. I am a morning person so I make sure that I wake up two hours before work so that I can have time to myself to meditate, exercise, eat breakfast, and get ready. I stay away from negative people because I tend feed off of their negativity. I focus on my work, and try to do the best job I can, for my own personal satisfaction. When I have a quiet moment and start to get stuck in my head, I repeat a positive affirmation or mantra in my head that makes me feel good. I think about what makes me happy- my friends who support me, my family who loves me, and my animals who have endless cuddles for me. I might reward myself with a snack I really love (making sure it’s not full of sugar- because that makes my depression worse when the crash comes). I also have allowed myself some frivolous purchases, because a little retail therapy never hurts. I bought myself the pair of shoes I always wanted as a child but could never afford- doc martens. I know it sounds stupid, because wearing them makes me giddy. I try to look for opportunities to make others feel good,  because that makes me feel good. Little stuff- complimenting a co-worker on their cute outfit, buying someone a coffee who is having a bad day, leaving my daughter a note to tell her how much I love her before I go to work, etc. I stay away from Instagram, Facebook, etc at all costs. My real friends text or call me. Sometimes, when appropriate, I reveal to people (co-workers, grocery store clerk, patient) that I am struggling. In this current environment of covid, you’ll find more often than not, that they too are struggling.  I know some of these tips come from a place of privilege (financial security, family who loves me unconditionally), but I hope some of the other tips help. I understand the anxiety completely- i don’t feel like discussing my job, but I spent most of 2020 extremely fearful and physically isolated. Just know you are not alone, there are more people out there feeling the very same way. Just keep plugging along, and be extra, extra, extra kind to yourself! Hugs!

Lately my depression has just kept on an immediate downward spiral, everything gets to me on a personal level lately and I can't stop crying and hyperventilating. I'm trying to get better with my art so I can be what I've always wanted to be career wise but everytime I try to make something I just think horrible things about it and myself and I end up giving up halfway through. What do you guys do to help stop it?

I’ve been suffering from clinical depression for a bit now, I have frequent days or moments when I’m completely down and depressed and I just shut down. I know I have people who support and love me, and I’m very thankful for them and putting up with me, but sometimes I ask them if they still love me, especially when I’m sad. I do this a lot with my girlfriend, when I’m pretty down I’ll ask “do you still love me?” Or “do you still like me?” Of course, I know the answer is yes, I just don’t understand my tendency to do it. Should I stop? I don’t know what to do, I’m afraid it’ll make my close ones think that I don’t know they love me. I’m not sure, maybe I’m being a bit silly, it isn’t serious, but if anyone has any thoughts, I’m willing to listen.

This is my guess, the reason why you have the tendency to ask the question in regards to being loved, could be the attention and the validation that you get from the response to this question.   In my opinion, you should stop asking these questions,the reason why you should stop this, is that this action can make you feel comfortable in your own depression and make you feel less inclined to partake in actual productive/constructive actions for yourself. On top of this, this question that you give to your gf is quite pointless, if you already know the answer to the question.  The better question to ask yourself, 'do I love myself?' (of course not in a narcissist way), I think this is a better a question to do reflection on. Maybe from here you can start to see a bit clearly in how to improve your personal well being. I believe it is fundamental to have love for yourself, you can have love from the whole world and that is great, but if you have no love for yourself, it really does't go anywhere.

At the start of the pandemic, I was doing okay and I enjoyed being myself, but now, everyday I look forward to going to sleep because everyday is the same. I'm 21 years old and like it sucks being confined to my childhood bedroom, not being able to go out and do things. Yeah, I could go to the mall, go for walks or what not, but the problem is that I already know my area inside and out- it is so familiar, I need something new, you know. I miss being on a college campus so much- I asked my parents if I could live on campus, but they were like "no, you'll probably be bored there", but I don't think they understand how much it sucks being confined to my bedroom. It's very limiting for me and I'm frustrated every day because this is not how I want to be living. What is even more frustrating is that I have had my driver's license for almost 3 months now,  but I have no car to drive, so it's not like I can even go out on drives. I'm so utterly frustrated- if there's a way to sum up how Ive been feeling it is just pure frustration. I'm sick and tired of being confined to my room- yeah I mean I could go or walks as I said earlier in this post, but it's just all the same.  I need something new and exciting, you know. no excuse, but it does not help that it is cold out, which makes it even more difficult to do stuff.  but then I think say if there was no covid- I think my life on campus would be the same- I would be lonely and unsatisfied with my life. Don't really know what the problem is, because regardless I would probably still be miserable. I'm just very unsatisfied with my life right now, but like even if things were different- I would still be unsatisfied. Don't know what my issue is but its annoying to live like this.

I'm mid 20's and I've had depression since I was 13. I left school when I was 14 and never returned. I don't have an education and have never had a stable job. I'm getting scared because it seems like if I ever google the feelings I have it seems as though I have like 7 different forms of mental illness.    I once took a large amount of sleeping pills when I was 14 and used to cut my arms to the point where I had to clean up my floor with a mop. These dark feelings don't persist though which makes it hard for me to reach out for help. 50% of the time I'm a normal person, but the other half not.    I think my brain is starting to panic sometimes, as a few times now I've had an overwhelming sense of going out of my body or mind and seeing myself seeing myself, which is a truly horrible feeling. I sometimes need to focus on not having that feeling creep up. The reason I make this post is because a few days ago I woke up and genuinely didn't want to be awake, like I'd just never wake up. It was quite disturbing because now I .."think" about suicide and if that would just be better because I'm really messed up at this point and don't see what I can do. I have no drive to do anything at all.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ku4631/advice_for_talking_yourself_down_from_self_hate/
So my New Years resolution has been to lower and eliminate negative self talk from my mind. It's been going pretty well but today I made a really stupid mistake and was uncesscearily rude to someone I have no way of apologizeing to.   As you can imagine this opened the floodgates of self hate. The usual mantra of "you're not really a good person" "you've just been pretending your whole life" "you're really just a narcissist and if you're not that your an idiot and if you're not that you're really just an asshole"  is running kind of comstantly in my head.   A person whom I care deeply about witnessed the thing I did and are understandably disappointed. I don't think they are devastated but I'm absolutely mortified that I've let them down and ruined their conception of me. I don't know if I actually have ruined it because when I get into these crazy hate spirals I have no concept of scale.   I'm doing better at not hitting, biting, or otherwise hurting myseld physically but fucking christ it's hard when I'm this embarasses to mitigate the mental stuff. About all that helps is going to sleep and starting a different day.   Any advice helps. I know I'm not a bad person. Nobody was hurt. I just feel awful and want to get back on the track and stop spiraling.

Maybe what you need are more achievements and a sense of achievement.  You said that your new years resolution is to lower and eliminate negative self talk, right?  What is the opposite of this negative self talk? Self talk yourself about what you have achieved., this similar to bragging or boasting.   I say reflect on some achievements that you have made or start to plan to achieve something,   small or big.

I am a 19 year old college student. I moved to another state about a year ago from my home state where I’ve lived my whole life up until then. With that being said, I haven’t seen or talked to many people I know. One of my old friends recently posted a disturbing Snapchat story stating that “Every good person he knew and was friends with had fucked him over and he doesn’t see the point in living anymore.” The last time I saw him in person was first semester of senior year in high school. He dropped out before the second semester and didn’t graduate. I’ve heard from other people that he has a very bad history with drug addiction and has gotten in trouble with the police and has even been hospitalized for it. I’ve talked to him and comforted him about his depression the last time I saw him, but he has only gotten worse since then and I’m really worried about him.  I’ve been friends with him since the second grade and I feel like I’ve made a big impact on his life as he has made one on mine. I just don’t know how I go about talking to him for the first time in nearly a year and a half, especially when I live far away and can’t see him in person. Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated because I know that I can’t let this go unnoticed.

I can't speak to Benzos, only SSRIs but I am now 2 weeks into no antidepressants after being on them for 22 years. The best advice my therapist gave me was to make a list of objective things I could measure each day to make sure I was staying out of the danger zone. These are things I generally do each day and if I don't do them then I need to get help now. For me, those were things like not able to do any work for 2 days, not working out for more than 3 days in a row, not being able to read stories to my kids at night, skipping meals. I've come close on a couple of these but have so far managed to get through each day okay. It's not great, it's very f**king hard, but I can see that day 14 is just slightly better than day 1 and that gives me hope.

Depression and relationships  Hello, I’ve been with my current bf for four months- this my first relationship. When we metI had depression but I wasn’t depressed, but now that it’s winter time and I’m back home from college, it’s back full force. He’s been saying I haven’t been talking to him and he’s definitely noticed a change in my behavior. I explained to him I was depressed but he wants me to open up more. I am scared though. I’m scared to share my thoughts with him in fear that they’re too dark and he’ll think I’m not the same person anymore. I’ve lost a lot of weight and it’s hard to speak most days. He’s amazing and he deserves so much more and i just don’t know what to do.

As someone who is in love with a guy with severe depression; it’s very frustrating to be pushed away. It’s also very frustrating if i don’t know what he is thinking, because it makes me unable to understand and support him. So my advice; share your feelings with him. If he loves you, he’ll accept you just the way you are :)

I understand this may seem silly. Everyone has their own issues and struggles, their own obstacles and problems, etc. But I truly have a very blessed life, I am attending college, living with my father; he and his wife have very respectable income. I do not have to pay rent, I have an abundance of friends who care about me a lot, I have hobbies that I excel in, I am at least relatively proactive in taking care of myself (eating breakfast, lunch dinner, exercise, etc.), I don't partake in self-destructive behaviors (examples: smoking, drinking, etc.)     So why do I feel sad? More importantly, why do I feel GUILTY for feeling sad? I look around and see people in situations light years worse than mine, and that is a big part of why I find it so hard to talk about this. I start to feel down and I want to speak up but my "down" is just the majority of the norm for some people, and I feel like I am unable to be taken seriously because of this.     But even more than just worrying that other people will not take me seriously, I feel like I can not take myself seriously, and it feels beyond pathetic. I hate myself so much when I watch people in terrible situations still trying their best to do the best for themselves and others around them. I feel like I have such a golden opportunity at life yet I'm just wasting it in self sorrow and self pity. This realization has pushed me to an extent. Like I said, I have hobbies that I excel in, I go running and try to take care of myself the best I can. I do my best to help around when I can, be a contributing member of communities and generally just be nice. Yet I still find myself feeling like it's not enough and that I'm just not worth it. How am I supposed to work on my problems when I don't even know what they are anymore?     I'm at a very low point in my life. I manage to put on a strong-front for my friends and family, and don't get me wrong, I am truly happy on a respectable amount of days. But the growing strength and quantity of my closer-to-suicidal nights are very clearly alarming. Even the thought of that is riddled with guilt (But that's nothing new).     Thank you for reading all of this, it does mean a lot honestly. If you have any advice or words that you think can help me, please don't hesitate to say them.

I'm yet to hear a statement of the form 'A deserved/did not deserve B' and further my understanding of either A or B. The only thing that does get revealed is the speaker's interpretation of how things should have happened, which isn't helpful.  The reality is you feel sad. You've not told me what it is that makes you sad, so I can't help with that. However, other people having greater pain does not invalidate your own. Suffering isn't a competition and treating it as such is very damaging.   Sadness, depression and anxiety are rather taboo in many cultures and people often have to learn how to deal with them on their own, and when this is coupled with the fact that people also don't know how to validate another person's emotions or even listen properly, it can leave people who feel sadness or depression or anxiety feeling like something is inherently wrong with them. There isn't, everyone recognizes there's something wrong with the culture at some point, but nobody wants to be the one to speak up, since toxic cultures often also victim blame.   Read about people who have gone through similar things, talk to someone you trust and who has been understanding and learn how to stop shaming yourself for feeling bad.   It may be depression, it may not be. Avoiding it will likely not make it go away.
its totally relatable. Sometimes we overcomplicate and overthink our emotions. We ask ourselves if we deserve to be happy, sad, depress, name it. I do it myself. i dont really have an advice to give since I too struggle with the same issue. But i guess we just have to own our feelihns  and see that whatever we are feeling... its valid.   I have had those thoughts too, and nights that I feel like ending it. Then I feel guilty about feeling that way because i feel like my situation isnt really as grave as the others. I realized its a danger to compare yourself from others because it is you, your feelings are yours, and they are valid. Maybe start writing down whatever youre feeling. I start doing that this year, after I started to have these suicidal thiughts, and somehow it helps me to evaluate what I feel, why I feel them, what triggers, etc.   If you feel the need for a therapist, give it a try. Whatever you feel suits you, its all up to you. I dont know if any of what im sayin helps, i just want you to know youre not alone feeling this way.
There will always be someone worse off. Someone else's pain does not devalue your own. You are in different situations, yes, but that doesn't invalidate your own feelings.  It sounds like you need support. You mentioned you're putting on a strong front for your family and friends, but I'd say to talk to them and tell them you're not feeling the best mentally. Find your support in family, friends, and possibly even a psychologist if you can.  I've been diagnosed with mild anxiety and depression. I'm not the worst off, I live in a house, we're not starving and we have some money, I'm getting married and we're starting a family, that doesn't mean I don't have bad days. My biggest thing to get past was my absolute fear that I'd be told I didn't have depression and anxiety, that I was faking and I was wasting resources meant for others. My utter relief when I had my first session with the psychologist manifested in tears. I cried through our first five sessions without fail.  If you need someone to talk to, to vent to, to offer some form of support and validation, please PM me. I'll do what I can to be supportive for you. You're not alone and your feelings are valid. Wishing you the best x
I identify a lot with the description you gave of not deserving to be sad, especially feeling guilty for feeling low. The feedback loop from hell (e.g. feeling depressed about feeling depressed) can take it toll. Keep in mind that no one is a perfect happy machine, even if you do grow up privileged. Being sad at times is par for the course. On the other hand if it does feel like something more serious than just sadness, then think about it this way: Would you feel guilty about having diabetes, even if you had access to a better life? My point here is that depression is an issue that many people have to deal with. I view my own as a life condition that I have to manage. The insidious thing about depression though compared to a physical ailment is that the problem is invisible for the outside. This makes it difficult for the depressed person themselves to understand, let alone an outsider.  I would remind you pain is subjective. Often there is a reason for it, but sometimes there isn't. In my own case, I view the society I live in as dystopic because of the unnecessary suffering our cultural myths allow to happen. To be honest, I see this suffering often perpetuated by this hustle until you make it culture for everyone but the wealthy, who are often the only ones who actually do make it. On the other hand, some causes are internal. I often will find myself just suddenly feeling horrible even during pleasurable activities. It happens. I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose how I react to it.   From what you have posted, it sounds like it would be good to talk to someone about it. Maybe it is depression. Maybe it is just being sad. The point is that empathic listening can help us feel better and understand our emotions better. Is there a close friend you trust that you can talk to about this? Seeing a therapist sounds like a good step as well. You don't have to be severely depressed to talk with a counselor, in the same way you don't need to be deathly ill to go talk to a doctor about something physically bothering you. From your description above, you have clearly identified an issue that you have to face. Therapy, reflection, and medication have helped me a great deal.   Lastly, you mentioned some closer-to-suicidal nights. I am not exactly sure what you mean by this, but please make sure you are safe. Get help, especially if you have any concrete plans. I have suffered from pretty regular suicidal thoughts, and I know first hand how distressing they can be especially when you haven't developed a framework to respond to them. Please take care.

Ever since quarantine, I obviously haven't seen them much. They never text me when I don't text them first. I considered them as close friends but idk anymore. I feel like it's my fault that maybe I ranted too much in the past and they got annoyed by me. So I decided that I wouldn't bother people with my worries and to just have better conversation. But I guess people won't even give me a chance. I just feel like a freaking loser.

On New Years, I took an edible at about 3am, 15mg THC, 15mg CBD. It was government recognized, so there's no way it was laced. However, this was is way more than I'm used to, I got too high, anxious and it wasn't pleasant. The day after I felt like crap, I assumed it was because I was still slightly high. Then for about 4 days I felt better. Then, on the 7th I couldn't sleep because of anxious thoughts, which continued to now. Since then (two days so far) my brain has felt exhausted, no motivation, and all my emotions feel greyed out. In some ways, I still feel high. Food doesn't seem appealing. I am absolutely terrified I have induced some sort of mental condition. School starts in a week, I have no idea how I'm going to manage. Is this like placebo? Is permanent depression from one bad high a thing?

While it is possible cannabis can cause certain changes in mental health, it's only been good in my experience. I'm not a doctor, so if you're concerned and this feeling doesn't go away you should look into getting a professional opinion.   That being said, here are some possible theories on why your experience was so horrible: to me it sounds like you took a sativa/CBD hybrid edible rather than an indica. Sativa is something to avoid for people with anxiety, although it can be good for motivation during the day in smaller doses. But only during the day, imo. I have had a bad trip from sativa edibles twice (only taken them twice) and because it did induce my anxiety I felt weird and "off" for a few days after.  Generally you won't still be high after a few hours, but a really strong one can remain over night. However it doesn't sound like you took a strong one (your tolerance will be really low at first though). Since it's been a week you aren't still high, but it does sound like you're showing signs of depression for sure.  In my experience smoking THC is better for anxiety and depression because you can control the high much better than something you ingest and have to wait out. I avoid any sativa edibles and most Indicas just because it's too hard to properly dose. Or maybe it could have been mislabeled (the government makes mistakes too), or you took 150mg and thought it was 15mg? My dose is only 40mg tops and I've been using medical cannabis for about ten years now. 150mg would put me on the floor in the fetal position begging for it to be over.  As far as it causing a bout of depression, it may also be linked as far as giving you anxiety and your body is still recovering from the traumatizing experience. One edible usually isn't going to change your brain chemistry, it takes weeks for your cannabinoid receptors to start binding with THC and CBD, and as far as I know that's usually a positive change.   I'm here if you have more questions. But again, I'm not a doctor and any severe change in your mental health should be discussed with a professional. I wish you well, my friend!
Man this is a solid answer.  Well put.  I smoked a lot of weed for years in college and afterwards and I was a champ.  Never a problem.  Went to Amsterdam once and tried a "space cake".  Terrible trip.  I was out of my mind for what seemed like all night long.  That was the last time I consumed THC for years, until recently someone gave me a gummy.  I didn't even eat half of it (makeup unknown).  I lost my shit.  I had had a couple panic attacks prior to this, and this gummy triggered the worst one I ever had.  Almost checked myself into the ER.... again (first panic attack).  Edibles can mess with you if you aren't careful.  I pushed through it on the floor of the shower for an hour until it finally wore off.  I didn't remain high after what the typical duration the effects would have on someone, but I didn't forget the experience.  I became hyper sensitive to anything that seemed even remotely out of the normal and assumed I was having some sort of after effect.  My mind was messing with me.  Still is some.  Since then, I have been using some 2:1 thc to cbd.  Very chill, small doses.  After the initial "bump" when it starts to take affect after an hour, then I get sleepy and zonk out.  Re-training my mind to not be so sensitive, a little at a time.
The second and final time I took a sativa edible my heart was hammering so bad I texted my sister to let her know I might die (not my first panic attack but boy was it hard to convince myself to just breathe through being too high).  It's all about listening to your own body and mind to find the right dosage. Start low and go slow, I always say. Have a good weekend!

My life has never been worst.   I always felt like a misfit, even my friends. It was always like that, everywhere I went and everywhere I go. I am 15 years old, so I am in school and this year is so far the worst yet. Everything happened at the same time. Where I live, the pandemic really wasn’t so hard on us (until now) because it is such a small place, meaning that schools were open for the past three months. The only thing was that we had only one group instead of eight different ones (one for every subject). So three months ago, when we received the list of our class, I was thrilled to be with my friends!.... Long story short, the one I was the closest with (who talked with me about the other girls in our group in their back for months) told them I was the bad one for doing it and that she was only doing it “not to upset me”.... I admitted that I was wrong, cried a lot for a long long long time and felt like the worst. “God I am just the worst! How could I talk in people’s back like this!”.... So what did they do? Become friends with everyone in my class and talked in my back to them..... which I later learned they did all along, just like I did them.. I never felt so hated.   To add to that, classes take ALL of my time. I have harder maths and science (I don’t know the exact term in English). The teachers are complete psychos, not to mention that we see them everyday. I was always good at school. Now I have to work for weeks on a subject to even pass. I cry all the time. I have no time. Wake up, eat, class, come back home, homework, eat, bed. That’s it. Everyday. And on the weekends, I have to work. I feel restless. Tired. Not happy, at all. Terribly alone.   And finally, my boyfriend. He is amazing. I love him so much. I have been going out with him for more then two years. We went at the same school, but now we don’t. I saw him everyday, and now I could only see about 4 hours a week if I was lucky. And as of right now... we can’t see each other for a whole month or more because of lockdown. I can’t do this without him. He is my only reason to live. He is so understanding of everything. From my free time being so small, to my condition called vaginismus which makes penetration unbearable... he gets it all.  I don’t see an end to this. I am already empty and the biggest part of the scholar year is coming up, and I can’t see my boyfriend and have almost no friends. Well I do, but like my boyfriend they are not in my school so I don’t see them either. I feel alone. Sad, deeply deeply sad. I always wanted to do some big big studies but I changed my mind. I don’t want to continue anything. I want it to stop. I can’t do it on my own.   (Sorry if there’s mistakes, English is not my first language. I hesitated to share what I feel because I don’t know if it’s appropriate here. I am not diagnosed with depression. I just feel helpless and needed to share.)

Hi, I hear how bad and alone you feel. I am so sorry this is all happening to you.  Remember you are not alone.  The whole world is going through this pandemic and EVERYONE feels lonely.  This is not to diminish how you feel but to try to help you know you are not alone.    Part of what's happening is you are with a small group of people all the time.  This covid will end in the next few months with the vaccine and we'll be able to get out more and what the kids in your class say or do won't seem so important.  Just hang on.  Things will get better.
In a 3-week study, women with type 2 diabetes who ate 1 ounce (30 grams) of sunflower seeds daily as part of a balanced diet experienced a 5% drop in systolic blood pressure (the top number of a reading).
You have no idea how much reading this makes me feel. Thank you for taking the time to write this, it’s little things like this that bring me a little bit of hope when i need it the most

19, male, if that helps any. For the past three or four years I've been struggling with major depressive spells but this most recent one has been going on since March of last year and it's really taking its toll. I'm living with my abusive parents who constantly remind me of how shitty I am, college is a no-go because of my finances and performance in high school, and I don't really have an outlet to find friends. None of the people I have in my life seem to care at all about my mental or physical health and only want me around when they're feeling down or lonely. I feel like I'm a side character in my own story and haven't wanted to live for a while now. Last night I came the closest I ever have to suicide but I just barely didn't have the guts to do it. I remember how being happy felt and I want that again but I don't have insurance nor the money for medicine. I was in a mental hospital once when I was younger as I was having suicidal thoughts but I don't remember anything about it, really. I don't know what to do anymore and I just need some assistance right now.

Hi. Being down in the well of depression really does take its toll. My own anchor is dragging at the moment. I know it may seem overwhelming, especially with the abusive relationships. But, from what you posted, it sounds like you want to escape from the current situation you are in--not life itself. Things always change; sometimes for the better. Sometimes for the worse. But they always change. At this point of your life in particular, you are close to being done with high school if not already. You are starting your adult life now. I would encourage you to think about what it is that you value. What do you want to get out of your life? It may align what your parents, your friends, or society thinks is important. It may be different. Each path is just different. College isn't the only way to be educated (I love libraries) or have a good life. I (27 M) identify with that feeling of not wanting to live. Most days I hear the thought rattle around my head like a constant buzzing in the background. However, over the last few years, I have been better able to manage my depression. I still have bad days, but little steps do add up. It still sucks. But it sucks less, giving me space to find fulfillment.   I have personally never been to a mental hospital, but I have been close to checking myself in. So take what I am about to say with that in mind. I would suggest that if you do not feel safe, i.e. if you feel you at major risk (such as having a concrete suicide plan), then get emergency help, especially if you don't feel like you can talk to someone you trust about it. There are hotlines as well, but keep in mind they are imperfect. Are you able to see a mental health professional outside of a mental hospital? Do you have someone you trust who you can talk to about this? For me, I have regularly seen a therapist. Moreover, empathetic friends, who have just listened, have helped me in the past immensely: their outside perspective has been instrumental in challenging the negative delusions I have about myself. It can be intimidating, but it sounds like you need to get a support system in place, whether formal or informal.  If nothing else, start with this sub. Together as a community we can start to figure things out.  As a final thought, I would point out that living is hard. Rather than feeling like a coward for avoiding suicide, I would insist that, on the other hand, you had the guts to continue to live on. This implies you have an internal strength that maybe you didn't realize you had. There is something you still want here. Finding what makes you happy or what gives life meaning takes time and effort. It is different for everyone. But look for it. Read. (I can give you some suggestions of what I like if you want.) Listen to lectures. Watch interviews of survivors of suicide. Observe trees. Produce art. Let go of things pulling you down. Try something new. Start anywhere. After all, you have nothing to lose.   Have patience and please take care.
I’m so sorry that you’re struggling right now. My advice is to start taking baby steps to get out of it (or to at least try to get out of it). It’ll take a while, and it won’t be easy, but over time, you’ll notice a difference. First, definitely get out of your room. Go for a walk, let the sun shine on you. Don’t sit in your room with the blinds down. Do what you can to get out of the house or out of your room. I know there’s a pandemic right now, but there are still things you can do and places you can go.   Also find something that gives you joy and try to do it each day. Reading books, drawing, skateboarding, taking baths, gaming- whatever it is, just do it. Even if it doesn’t spark joy immediately. Also don’t do it in your dark room, do it somewhere else that is bright and open. But don’t go taking a bath somewhere bright and open, I’d definitely stick to the bathroom for that.   Lastly, take it easy on yourself right now, and prioritize self-care. I know this isn’t possible for everyone, as not everyone has the resources or time, but if you can, take some time for yourself no matter how much or how little. It kind of goes hand in hand with what I said in the prior paragraph, but put time into yourself, whatever that means for you. Maybe it does mean going to a mental hospital to get help. If so, do research on the place to make sure it’s not a place that can make things worse (some around me have bad reviews and I know for sure to avoid them).   And know this: you matter. You’re important, and you deserve a great life with great people who love and support you. If you have no one else to talk to, message me. I am not a therapist in any way, shape, or form, but I will listen. And if no one else cares, know that I care, and the people here care. Do some research (if you haven’t already, thought maybe you have) on places around you that can help people who are in a similar position as you and don’t have money or insurance but need help. I know a lot of people say this, but it’s true- you’re not alone. I promise you.
Assuming you are in the US, are there not means to seek free counselling or therapy?  Honestly, if you’re feeling desperate enough that think about suicide, I would recommend going to ER.
That sucks. No matter what you do, please stay. Honestly there’s no good answer because almost anything will cost money (therapy, meds, mental hospitals, etc.). :( Do you have a safety plan?? I wrote one out when I was feeling okay so when I get down I can remember. It has reasons I stay, hot lines I can call, things I can do to distract myself, etc. Super useful!
Brother I understand your feelings and with all due respect to your situation right now, I am writing this.  I have seen many people around me going through similar state of mind with some plus/minuses in their story. But getting admitted in mental hospital is not at all a solution.  I suggest that everyone of us should pay attention to our mind and the health of our mind. We generally tend to ignore our mind a lot and then land up in situations like this.  So how do we take care of the health of our mind? Instead of admitting yourself to a mental hospital, I would suggest you to find a nearest Yoga class or if there is none near you, try to get admitted to one of the online Yoga classes. Most of them are even free.  Yoga has real power to cure the mind health and get oneself transformed. I have seen it with myself and many more around me. How Yoga can benefit us is just amazing and one has to practice it to believe it. It can't be explained.  You can find many videos on YouTube as well on how to heal depression with Yoga. But the one I liked most is Salimah's [Kundalini Yoga for Depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eDG0EAld14).  Apart form Yoga, you can also do a regular exercise, go out in the nature and spend some relaxing time with yourself. You will be transformed for sure.
I’ve been in a psych ward for postpartum psychosis, so my experience with a mental hospital is very different than desperation, however I’ve had to deal with depression off and on since I was a teen. I will say it’s nice to be in a place where you can’t harm yourself, and your monitored. Other than that, the staff were very disrespectful to me in my psychotic state..
Hey,, dm me man,, I'm also 19 and I'm also fucking depressed as shit 😅 I'm a great listener, you might not know it but you have people that love you
Ya know, a suicide hotline may be good to help talk you through this. A hotline may be better than nothing. They are trained. Not therapists, but they may help you be able to see more clearly what it is that you need. You're clearly scared by these ideations and want someone secure to lean on.      Obviously, we are here to help and support; we just aren't as trained.      Also, I just wanted to say hold-on. One thing that can be helpful with managing suicidal despair is procrastination-- "no need to make a decision to die today; It's just such a permanent decision. But I will always have the option. I can decide later. " Also, I was very stuck in an abusive situation until my mid-late 20's. You're ahead of the game because you realize it's abusive. I didn't know that mine was, which made my depression harder to manage. Despair is an understandable response to an awful situation. My parents had me evaluated and treated for depression, anxiety, and ADHD when really, I was just abused. Abuse can cause a lot of the same symptoms.     A book called A*dult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents: How to Heal from Distant, Rejecting, or Self Involved Parents* and its more practical sequel, *Recovering from Emotionally Immature Parents: Practical Tools to Establish Boundaries and Reclaim Autonomy,* really helped me. Maybe by now, there are books written specifically for young adults stuck in homes with an abusive family. If not, you may be able to get more help over at r/AbuseInterrupted
If you feel comfortable with the idea then absolutely. I was involuntarily placed in one a few years ago and they set me up with a free state insurance so i wouldn't have to pay anything.
No..
Get some magic mushrooms 👍🏻
Hi, thanks so much for your time and the care that you've put into your words, it means a lot to me. Unfortunately I live in the middle of nowhere, I don't have an outlet to any mental health professional. It's a weird situation that I'm stuck in, I'll admit. I've been trying hard to find a creative outlet I enjoy. I used to have fun with art but my passion for that died last year, reading anything feels like a chore, leaving the house is a chore because of quarantine, etc. Idk what I'm saying really, just rambling without structure
The biggest problems with the "free" counseling is that most require insurance information, which is something I don't have atm. Same thing with the ER.
I just saw this comment now. In the right context, hallucinogens can be really useful. I tripped on acid once. During the trip, your conceptual models break down, allowing you space from your usual thinking patterns. In turn, this leads to insight into how you conceptualize the world. I was surprised at how many conclusions I just snapped to, especially those that involved me letting other people down. But I don't have to think that way. Taking a break from these harmful modes of thinking can be restorative.
There are some online services. I think they are cheap, but I don't know too much about it. What about personal connections? Do you have any close friends near you? The middle of nowhere tends to have nature though. Maybe do some exploring? Sometimes I have found putting the cart in front of the horse helps. What I mean is that motivation isn't always linear; it is more like a circle, where doing something builds motivation which causes you to do something. But please meet yourself where you are. You already reached out here. That is a win for today as far as I am concerned.   I totally know what you mean by everything feels like a chore. I have had my bad days where I have sat in bed watching TV for days at a time because everything felt pointless. I have found that being in the moment tends to reduce that. Be present. Notice what is around you. Attention. A lot of culture pressure, at least here in the USA, tends to cause me to think that I am not worthy of dignity unless I produce things of value. The more I rail against this, accepting just being, the more I feel like doing things that I get something out of. Just keep taking one step at a time. Focus on the process not the result.

this is something I wanted to do , and here's everything I've experienced in last few days ,    So , it starts on Thursday , I went out with my cousins to visit a place and look around , we visited the place rather early and decided to hang around with my cousin's friends . we had lunch and landed at their place,   Introducing everyone I'm with , AB( cousin with the friends ) , IB (another cousin) , T and S ( AB's friend and her sister )   Me being me , was quite for the most parts , we smoked , and that's the only time I interacted , and everyone talked and caught up with what's going on in their lives , everyone being all joyful , and me being awkward as I am , hahaha   Then , I somehow got into the picture , we talked a bit about something non related to anything , usually how I'm doing and how my life's going , ( spoiler , not great ) , we talked about food , AB made us some chicken dish  , and then him and T went to buy beer .   This is the point where everyone went into the drinking time zone , and this the where the best moment for me starts ,   We opened one beer each  , smoked endlessly , before we finished even one beer , we already had a bottle of scotch open in front of us , we finished the beer and then started drinking the scotch and rum we had , one thing lead to another and we all had a huge debate on politics , there were the communist and the nationalist and the leftist , every representative fighting over how the government should work , how things are and how they should be , me and T held back , because she had her reasons that I can't tell people ,and for me I was just too insecure to even have opinions ,   Till this point , the whole journey was just a compilation of awkward moments for me , I just sat in the corner and listened to everyone speak one thing or the other , all I did was just made up imaginary points I could use to counter every point they put on the table , but I held myself back from working anything , an hour or so passed it was already past 12 midnight , and we were near ending one of the bottles.  This is when the unexpected happened, and tbh I can't comprehend how something like this ever happened to me, but , I started objecting and speaking, whatever came to my mind, whatever point I jotted down to oppose everyone's arguments , I wasn't insecure anymore, maybe it was the alcohol , maybe it was my crippling depression attacking me and making me numb to surrounding , but I spoke , I spoke what I wanted, I spoke what I could and I found a friend .   S , (T's sister ) , was as drunk as anybody in the room, she initiated a talk between her and me, we shared stuff , we talked a little , I told her about my ideas , she told me about hers, I think it was the first time I opened to a random, in the first meeting , and I felt like there are people who are not as judging as I think of them    If I had to introduce S to everyone , she was older than me , and she expressed that , she was the mom kind of personality but also the friend kind of personality , it's rare and it's very nice to talk to someone like that . I felt really comfortable talking to her  and I told her some stuff , very little . Somehow she sense me being insecure and not being straight , which amazed me . one of my friends called it Gaydar , which is very true .    So the day that started as an awkward boring city tour , ended as a great party to get wasted and have the best talk I ever could .   The only thing I'm bitter about is that I never got to know her story, I wanted to , but things happened, and I never got to know her side , I never got to tell her thing i wanted to , I had tons upon tons of things to talk about , maybe that's the reason we didn't continue talking , but ofc , not everything is permanent, the memories are , and these were some good memories , I'm savour them for the longest, looking for a person like S to talk to freely and openly .    Thanks for reading if you reach here, I'm not very good at writing and expressing in a long story , but I'm trying , I'll keep making posts like these   Also Virtual hugs to anyone who needs it ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ  💛💛💛

I'm currently dealing with mixed anxiety, depression and possibly ADHD. Thinks got bad when I quit drinking alcohol (I was drinking a couple of beers a few times a week, so not huge volume but it was doing enough to significantly reduce my anxiety).   My doc put me on Zoloft and also gave me a month's supply of Xanax. I asked him how often I could take them without risking addiction and he said taking them every day for a month would be fine and the SSRI should be helping by then.  Has anybody else taken a benzo while coming on an SSRI? Were you able to get off that fine once the SSRI got your anxiety under control +

Sorry this maybe long winded and not sure if this will make any sense but I don't know where or who to turn to as I'm the type of person who doesn't like to bother others with my problems, oh where to start so my country is back lockdown and the joys of homeschooling is away to start again, last time home schooling didn't happen in this house because at the time I was battling with a bad depression episode my child was starting to be diagnosed as high functioning autistic as well as coming out as trans which my partner can't understand or accept.  It took a while but I did start exercising and lost over 40lbs in the space of 3 months however I hit a wall.  So now I'm struggling to just get up in the morning to stay positive I have no idea how to homeschool a teenager but I know we need to. I have no motivation I feel my depression is creeping up again and I'm already on the highest dose as I type this I'm struggling to keep the tears at bay as I don't want my kid to see me upset   I don't even know what I'm asking here but other than I needed to get this off my chest.  And thank you for reading

I can't offer you anything except that I am feeling the same way in some sort of way. I don't want to bother anyone with my shit while Iknow that there are definitely people who would be willing to reach out and help. I've just been feeling down for so long with no motivation. I just keep telling myself it will be different the next day.
Thank you tbh I just felt a little better after posting this but all I want to do is sleep all day and it's a major effort to do basic things just now

I'm sorry if I sound like some spoilt brat here, but I'm dreading going back to school. Not in the oh no I hate hw way, but more of a I can't see myself living in this world kind of way. I had a month of school holidays to help me recover from this existentialism I have but all I did was not think about it and drown myself in games and anime. I don't want to go back to interacting people I know are close to me but consciously I feel distant to. I don't want to pick up responsibilities that I don't have motivation to carry out. I don't want to live, and going to school is making me realise that I am indeed living, and I have to move forward if I don't want to kill myself. I'm too cowardly to kill myself, so I keep on living. I don't have what it takes, and I'm dreading it. I told myself I'm going to go to a school counsellor this year, and already have an appointment with a therapist from outside to see if I actually have depression. I've been dealing with "depression" for 4 years now but have never got it checked. Maybe if I did get it checked I could get professional help and get out of my predicament, but right now I can't feel the will to live in me anymore. It has died out long ago. Does anyone have any similar experiences and know how to cope with this? Thanks for reading this far down if you did, I partly wrote this because I needed to vent. I had been feeling empty for too long

so.. me and my boyfriend have been dating for a while. He’s in his late twenties. He’s living with his mom, and has been for a while. He suffers from severe depression and anxiety, and I’ve been on him about seeing a psychologist, he started taking meds, but they haven’t helped much. I’ve been trying to help him overcome his depression and anxiety for almost a year now, with little progress. He won’t go see a doctor unless I practically force him to, but he keeps telling me he wants to get better. I love and care for him a lot, but if he wanted to get better he’d put more effort into doing so? He says he can’t get a job, because his anxiety acts up to much for the application process, and he hurts to much to work. But he won’t see a doctor about that either. I just don’t know how to help him anymore. It’s frustrating.

hello. this is going to be long bc i ramble. feel free to read if you want   i understand you’re frustrated, but imagine how he feels since he’s the one who’s suffering from it firsthand. the idea that “if he wanted to get better he would put effort in” is EXTREMELY dangerous and potentially harmful to believe, because depression and anxiety make every small thing seem “impossible.” when dealing with anxiety, there’s a term called the “impossible task,” which is any task a person with anxiety feels incapable of doing. it can be cleaning, or exercising, or even just eating / showering. it could also be larger things like a dysfunctional family. anything that feels overwhelming subsequently can become “impossible.” depression is an incredibly self sabotaging illness, and it’s going to make you feel like you CAN’T get better, despite how much you want to. so what you’re describing of his behaviour absolutely does line up with typical depressive behaviour  the best thing you can do is empathize and understand that it’s not his choice to not do these things. it’s going to be hard for him, and you need to positively encourage him to do small things and be a positive source of energy for him.   even if it’s things like, when ur seeing each other in person, ask him to get u a soda or a water from the kitchen so that he can just get up and move and accomplish something, those are HUGE. being able to cook a meal? even larger an accomplishment.  it sounds like you care a lot, and that’s great!! you sound like a great partner who’s trying to stay supportive, even when it’s out of your realm or when it’s not your job to do so. but you also have to be careful because it’s super easy to think you’re supporting someone but actually be applying negative convictions to them. i know i’m fixating, but the line you mentioned of him not wanting to get better bc he doesn’t put effort in is just so invalidating. i hope you haven’t said anything like that to him; and if u have, that’s ok! just apologize and say you’ll work on your own biases. again, sorry for fixating on that, but i find that super super important for you to keep in mind  it sounds like rn, he’s struggling BAD to go to the doctor. communicate with him, ask him why it’s difficult for him and what you can do to help. even if it’s gentle daily reminders, or some other form of TLC. depression and anxiety are super case by case and people will need support in wildly different ways. same reason why it can take people going through over 5-10 different types of antidepressants before finding one that actually works, if they ever find one at all  sorry for the in depth answer; i hope he manages to start recovering someday soon. and remember; it’s not your job to get him meds or therapy, so dont feel like you need to stress out about it on his behalf. it’s ultimately up to him to get better, and he’s going to have to work hard to start taking physical action to start getting better. you can only just be there for him while he works at this.  I hope things work out for you! Good luck, too. i’m sure he’s lucky and thankful to have you around  also i hope none of this came across as like- assuming or being rude or saying ur not being supportive. i can’t know the full situation so i probably repeated many things or repeated things u already knew, but the fact youre seeking help for him is so so so kind
I really appreciate you’re response. It terrifies me that anything I say or do is toxic to him, and I don’t want that. I didn’t see it that way, so I appreciate you getting in depth and explaining more. Thank you so much, this does help a lot.

I was quite depressed about a couple years ago, I tried to poison myself but it just made me horribly sick. despite how crazy 2020 was it was the year were I began to feel happy again. But over the past few weeks I’ve began to feel the heavy weight over me of guilt and just no real emotions but anxiety and sadness, I’ve been in denial trying to convince myself it will go away soon but it’s getting worse and I don’t want to go back to what I used to be, I don’t know what is causing me to feel this way again.

First of all you deserve to treat yourself better. No one is perfect and its not a reason to end you life. Time passes and we can learn how to live with these small dark moments but that's all they are. They are small moments. When I feel a lurking feeling coming up, I get up and out of the room. I treat it like a person I don't not want to be around, because that person is me but my mindset. I get up and go outside and think about something that I enjoy or makes me feel peaceful. I walk away and think or replay a happy memory no matter how long its been. It doesn't matter how long its been because I was there at some point and it was me happy. I think of how peaceful it was the day I at a sandwich at the beach with the ocean in front of me. I think of someone I made laugh. I walk away and look up cute animal videos. I look up how to make a simple food recipe with the ingredients I already have at home. I do something in the moment for myself, not matter how big or small, it's for me. Sometimes I wonder what other people are doing or listening too, so I just look up random things like Italy's top 50 music. I don't speak Italian but I pull myself out of the feeling. I know I will away have myself and that my friend and family don't know everything I think or feel. I do know that if the ones I cared for felt this way I would want to help. So I treat myself as if it were one of them. I hope this helps but know that I could be you and I would look up "Crab Rave", "21 years old: I have no friends" or " you suck at cooking" on youtube just to take a break from myself. Sorry if I have writing errors, I am also dyslexic. Please take care of yourself.
Thank you for your thoughtful response, it makes me happy to think that you put the time to write such a detailed message 💚  EDIT: and I thought your writing was perfect.

I’m not professional but from my personal experience so far it’s been this.  *Sometimes steps maybe repeated, delayed, rearranged or not included as everyone’s problems and struggles are unique. *  1. Identify symptoms of depression that lasts more than 6months and draw a conclusion you need professional help after reaching out to family and friends. 2. Seek a mental health provider about your concern of depression. 3. Multiple visits for a proper diagnosis. 4. Create a treatment plan 5. Trial and error with medications or different types of therapy 6. Find a treatment that works 7. Stick to treatment plan 8. Hopefully identify causes of depression 9. Process past trauma or understand it’s a chemical imbalance  10. stick to your treatment plan 11. Make necessary life changes 12. Profit!!!! ...   I mean, recovered from depression or adapted your life to limit triggers and living more in tune with what you require to live peacefully.  Step 24/7: remember that it’s ok to ask others for help and suicide hurts the people you care about, so don’t do it please.  Thanks, this was a fun exercise to do and helps me reflect on how far I’ve come. I’m by no means “recovered” but medicated daily and in a much better place than I was. Take care ^.^/
The short answer is none. There is no cure from Depression just yet. You can treat the symptoms and maintain an active life within limits. I was diagnosed at 13 and just turned 54. I still have thoughts of killing myself, but i know they are not my thoughts. They are a symptom of this illness. When you can tell the difference between your own thoughts and the others, things do improve. But it's like a dull pain that doesn't go away. There are a lot of adjustments you personally will need to make.
Hi there.  A really important step that a lot of people don't know about is connecting with peers.  You can find free virtual peer support groups by searching the websites of NAMI (national alliance on mental illness) or the DBSA (depression and bipolar support alliance) by location.  Hearing from and sharing with other people who've been there is a really powerful experience, and makes one feel far less alone.  Best wishes, -F.
Meds help me. But not everyone. I went off them (you’d be surprised how dumb primary care doctors are) and it got worse. Survival in depression is simple drudgery. Endure. Plod forward. Mine tiny shards of joy. Repeat. Sounds like shit but it seems to be an option
This makes me sad
do you have any advice for me on what to do/say to someone close to me who has depression for three years? i have no idea on what to say to him and what exactly i should do
Good to know. I was wondering about this as I was only recently diagnosed a few years ago, and I am 27 now.
I know it does, but you can live with this. You just have to be ready to make some changes.
Being there alone is a great help.  But, remember, you are not responsible for what he might do in the future.  It may be outside of his control. Just let him know you know that he has an illness and you don't believe he is worth less for having it.
Its not worth living then  I'll try my best to come out of this man
thank you for that. do you mind checking out my post and maybe leave a comment? im really clueless on what to do.
Listen. That helps so much.   Probably the worse things someone has said to me when I feel low is actually mantras like "Things get better." Rather than supports, it inadvertently invalidates my feelings, which make them even more difficult to handle. Acknowledging an illness is different, as it does acknowledge the internal suffering.
You care, and that alone will be a great comfort to him. Let others know that it's not that he is sad, but that he has an illness and one of the symptoms is feeling like he does. Keep reminding him if that too.
I don't care for mantras. It doesn't acknowledge that what you are feeling isn't really you. Now that would be a good mantra: This is not how I really feel. It took me some time to learn that since I didn't have the internet to turn to.
what are things i can say other than "things get better"?
thanks so much

I've been depressed for years and hated all the thoughts of suicide that were stuck in my head. A month ago I finally opened up to my parents, things have brightened up, I seeked professional help last week, and might have some counseling with my fam soon. I've reconnected with people I've missed, and I'm really trying my hardest to stop feeling depressed. I've even started reading up on meditation and such. My doc and I are still thinking about the meds though.  But my bestfriend...is suicidal and depressed, I'll call them John for now. He regularly has the urge to self-harm, skip meals, or do reckless things. And regularly talks about wanting to die and how he wants to do it.  I've given him a lot of advice and I've done my best to remind him that I'm always here. But....it's starting to feel like he never takes any advice I give and that he's given up on himself already. He already seeked help long before I ever did but he hates his meds cuz he thinks it just forces him to be happy. He's an online friend so I can't approach him face to face. I've known him for so long and I know that's he's a good person and that he doesn't deserve this. He wants a better life where he's free from his family...so I recommended some small job offerings to keep him stable but he doesn't want to commit to it. I recommended he find some hobbies...but he doesn't want to. I told him to try making new friends, he says he already has me... I tried to explain why that wouldn't be healthy and he seemed to try to say that other people will just hurt him...but I'm not perfect...I can't provide for all of his emotional needs...I barely have control of my own. I can't help but feel the need to play strong just so he has someone to lean on. I want to finally start thinking about myself and relax...but everytime I do I feel like I'm leaving him behind. I've told him that he's one of the reasons I chose to seek help and stay alive but...he doesn't get it.  It feels like everyday I have to talk him out of it....And even when I'm crying on my bed over my own worries, I have to hold it back and be strong and comfort him. Even when I've just been from a funeral, if I see him in distress, I need to stop thinking about that and comfort him. Even when I finally get the best news of my life in 2 years...I feel bad for being happy while he's suffering. He keeps telling me that he's not my responsibility...I just want my friend to stay alive. I know he feels the same way about me but he can't seem to understand that that's what I feel about him...I can't help him if he won't help himself...  I'm so tired...but I can't tell him...I don't want him to feel like a burden. But I feel so powerless...I feel like nothing I do works...I feel like telling him I'm here doesn't seem to work anymore...and I know my presence alone can't help him...but he refuses to eat...refuses to drink his meds...he can't talk to his psyche...he doesn't want other friends...he doesn't want to find better help...and he himself has even stated not being interesed at being happy again....I'm so lost...I can't be happy while I watch him suffer...I feel...so...trapped   Edit: typo at the last sentence

I'm sorry to say but, you might have to step back from the friendship. First of all, if he knows about your depression, it's a real dick move to unload this on you especially if he isn't making sure you have the spoons to not have it effect you. Hell, even if you weren't depressed it's a dick move that he's putting all this pressure on you. I honestly don't think you should keep a friend who is refusing any and all help. Please, in this case, be selfish. You can't help someone who doesn't want help. Even if you could, your metaphorical glass is already low, you can't keep pouring water into someone else's glass
The same situation happened to me.  The conversation you are avoiding needs to happened sooner rather than later. I get there you don't want your friend to feel like a burden but you also have to take care of yourself.   We are not martyrs to absorb the suffering of others. Friendship and support goes a long way but without professional help the situation is going to remain the same.
I really feel for you and your friend, and I know sort of, the cycle of thoughts going through his head. I've been in that place, where it feels like there's only one person who "gets" you. Depression, amd suicidal thoughts, can really commit you to a way of thinking that locks you in place.  I felt for a long time like I was in a holding pattern and I can only project my experience onto John's. I struggle with a right balance of advice. You're not John's therapist, but you're also his friend. There is an appropriate balance of activity there, that let's you support him, without his weight adding to yours.   Something I found 'works for me' when I talk with my friends, who also suffer from depression, is...  I will try to discuss topics I'm passionate about, but that they can contribute to the conversation on. You're no doubt friends, even online, for a reason, and if you can set a mood for a positive time, it might give him a more stable mental place for you to discuss this.   From the way you made things sound, I know that you're probably worrying that any sort of approach of "listen John, I have my own problems!  I can't be your ONLY life line!" Would make him withdraw into himself, or make him self harm.  I don't know how he'd respond to anything like that.  I just know that if he is using self harm or his suicidal thoughts as a lasso to force you to support him, it is selfish, and hurts both of you.  That kind of activity, even if he feels it is the only option to keep you in his life, is not healthy. I don't know if he does that, or if he is maybe aware that he does it?  I'm not sure.  I don't want to sound like I'm going "doesn't he know how his depression is making YOU feel?" But at the same time, you know.    It is hard to help people, and it isn't always your job I guess. It's OK to not be an infinite well spring of support and love, you can help him, while letting him know that you need a break now and then.  But also, that him needing support doesn't make him a burden.   It sounds like a tough situation. My break is over so I can't say anymore, but I'm wishing you luck.
I’d say you sound like you’re a good, empathic friend and I would encourage you to show yourself the same compassion and care you do your friend.  You sound very articulate and I think if you can convey your message of where you’re coming from, it’s on you to know that you’ve done what you can and it’s okay to set a boundary or step away for your sanity’s sake.  Stay strong!
I'd try telling him about how you feel. See his reaction. Both parties need to bring something to the table and care about each other for the relationship to make sense. If his behaviour in response invalidates your needs it will make it easier for you to end the relationship. And if not then hopefully something gets better.  It must be really hard for you, this ambivalence of not wanting to leave your friend in need but also wanting to get better and knowing he's dragging you down. Communicating with him is key though. Remember that nothing makes you responsible for his actions even if you do decide to end it.
It’s ok to set boundaries for yourself. I find that friends who are in the depths of their anxiety or depression fall into roughly 2 camps for me. They either can’t or don’t want to take the advice.  Those who can’t aren’t in the right headspace to take everything in. So, giving them the same advice over and over just doesn’t penetrate. But just being there for them is the best you or I can do so that when they reach a point where they can take in the advice you’ll be there to witness it.   Then there are those who don’t want to hear it. They are in some sort of denial, or they just want someone to agree with them. I know people who bounce from therapist to therapist, and then say that because every therapist tells them the same thing, and they’re all shite. But, y’know, maybe there’s a reason separate therapists are saying the same thing. I don’t waste a lot of my time with people like that, because it’s a huge drain on my mental health.   I have been both of those persons, so I know I won’t hear anything that I don’t like until I am ready. The former I have more empathy for, so I can be patient. But the latter, while I understand, there’s no getting through to them. So, you really need to protect yourself one way or the other. Sending virtual hugs.
the saying goes you are the accumulation of the people you spend your time with. unfortunately although he is your close friend, if you spend time with someone who is negative 24/7 this will also knock onto you. this also happened to me and my friend, i spent the weekend looking after her, and when I got home I had to take a few days off work myself due to the knock of effect of myself now having low mental health .   i would try telling him how you feel, he may not be aware of it due to him being absorbed within his own depression. but you do need to be honest with him, otherwise you will slip into being unwell again and you do need to look after yourself too.  best of luck
I'm going through pretty much the exact same situation right now and it's taking so much out of me. I decided to take a step back until my friend chooses to get help. I'm still here, but I'm not going to be as engaged or offer as much of a sounding board anymore.   I've been offering advice and support for upwards of 6 months. I can't keep saying the same things or offering the same advice without it taking a toll on me mentally. Worse yet, I've been going through the worst depression of my life during this time period as well, and I'm not receiving the same level of support from my friend that I'm giving. That's making things worse.  So I guess my advice is to take a step back and reevaluate. Give yourself a break for a week or two and see how it makes you feel. If your friend gives some pushback, it's time to set clear boundaries with them. Something like, "I'm sorry, but I'm not in a good enough place myself to continue offering you the support you need. I need to take a break until at least one of us is in a better place mentally. I hope that you'll understand."  Best of luck.
In the words of JaidenAnimations, “this is a hard pill you’ve got to just swallow.... you are not responsible for anyone’s happiness!” It sucks, and it hurts to leave someone behind “but you can’t just drop everything to deal with someone else”
Something that really helps me is working to find connections to the things I’ve gone through and the possible emotions/depression feelings that can come from it. It sounds simple but theres definitely work that has to go into it. Encourage him to seek these out on his own (this sub has helped me a lot, hearing other people’s stories that are similar to mine can really put things into perspective. Also, therapy has definitely helped me but I know how challenging it can be to start). It will help in the future when these feelings of hopelessness/self sabotage come into play because they’ll know the reason why he feels a certain way.   This tip could have been said already but I hope it helps! I can completely relate to how both of you are feeling.
Hey, exactly similar situation I have gone through few weeks ago before I found the solution on this. My best friend was going through depression due to prolonged lockdown and that was affecting others also in her circle.   But I am now so excited to tell you that my best friend has finally come out of a depression after almost 7-months of attempts. Due to last year's prolonged lockdowns, he was forced to stay at home and slowly went into depression from the beginning of May 2020. We all tried several tihngs to get him out of that mind state but failed. Lastly when we came across online Yoga trainer from Canada - Salimah, and started practicing her techniques to [heal depression with Kundalini Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eDG0EAld14), within few days we saw a transformation in him. This technique is really powerful and we should all practice it even if we are fit to keep our mind healthy.
You are not responsible for this situation.  When I am low I just want to tell a friend about it.
First of all, I am so sorry for the pain and sadness you both have gone through... no one deserves that. Second, I went through a similar situation with a friend a few years ago, and I have a couple pieces of advice from what I learned  1. You need to set boundaries. It is not only safe and healthy for you; it is safe and healthy for your friend. No human can fulfill the expectations he is setting for you. 2. Does he have family members or anyone that sees him often that you can reach out to? In the moment, this may seem like a betrayal, but he needs people who are around him every day to encourage him to seek help, take his medications, eat... In the long run, it will be so much better for your friend.   I am super happy for you that you are taking steps to address this horrible mental illness, and I will be praying that your friend does the same!
It seems like most people with depression just go to a psych and then talk to them and/or get meds.  He needs therapy. Meds should be a last resort. And just talking to a psych (or to you) isn't going to help him. He has tried it enough. The only thing I can recommend is telling him he needs a real therapy. And also if you want the friendship to sustain, being honest is the best way to go. Maybe you guys can decide that he can only vent twice a week or something? Idk but you're not a professional and it's impossible for you to keep doing this.
I'll try my best to take your advice. I honestly didn't know where to go so reddit was my last hope. It's nice to hear from someone that relates to him in a way.    As for if he's threathening me with it, no he's not. I'll try to divert his attention more often to something we can enjoy. Thank you for all the paragraphs you wrote down for me, I really appreciate it :))
I've been trying to build up the guts to tell him. He's a bit dense at times and takes alotta reexplaining to understand some things sometimes which makes me struggle to find the right words at times but I don't want to be too blunt. I posted this during a huge low for me and its been a few hours and I've managed to settle down. I don't want to let him go because despite his current state, he was there for me for a lot of my struggles in the past. It seems most of you guys are supportive of the idea of talking to him. I just hope I find the right words this time. Thank you for your response

Today i cut myself 7 times with a knife becuase of my shit family, my sister who is 18 is an absolute dick and is making my mental health fall, im still in school yet i feel the need to take responsibility for my family's mistakes. My sister should be able to tell how depressed i am but she has no clue.  My dad is worse he over works me and is verbally abusive towards me and my mum. Any slight mistake me or my mum makes we get screamed at where my sister on the other hand is allowed to bring boys over and fuck them at 11pm even though we live next to a large family that have several toddlers, and its not like she's quiet either she is extremely loud it ruins my nights were i get to relax  Anytime i mention that i want to kill myself she says that i shouldn't becuase its the cowards way out.  I hate my family

If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

i know how hard it is to live with that kind of family but you shouldnt cut yourself for that.. i've been through the same in some ways and after a long time i figured it out that it wasnt the solution. i wont tell you to talk to them bc they wont ever understand but i'll tell you to fight your demons until you can go to the university or something that gets you outta there. talk to your mom and try to be her shield and she be yours just untill you can get something changed by your own i know you can do it and you're not alone. if you need something, send me a message and i'll try to answer asap oh, and if you're able to, please contact a specialist so you get better psychological help!♡
I know how you feel, but you shouldn't say because of someone. Yes their actions made you feel like doing it but they didn't do it. It doesn't help you, and I've found that for me it was a gateway into more cutting. Im no psychologist, nor can I  say I haven't done it, but it doesnt help you either. Im sending all my love and strength your way.w
Sending compassion.  And I wish you would not cut.  Rubber bands on the wrist provide a similar dopamine response.

So, I've tried countless times to take exercising more seriously, but since I see no benefit or lift in my mood, I am struggling to care enough to keep doing it.  Last year, I went for walks for weeks on end, 3 times a week, 45 minutes. Then I also did lifts on a steel bar in my garden. Guess what? It did NOT do shit. The only thing that I gained are slightly more muscles, but even that is whatever. I was never vain and have kind of accepted that I'm ugly, so why should I give a damn if I get more muscles? I have no one to show it to.   Same with all the other exercise-bullshit I tried: cardio, jumping rope, weight-lifting. I just feel tired and shitty after. I've never liked exercise, it reminds me of being shitty at P.E. in highschool. Knowing I have to do it to help my depression is making me more reluctant.  I have this app to help with depression and it's also started nagging me to exercise at a certain hour. I hate strict schedules and I hate exercise, the two combined is hell.

Do you ever get that "runner's high" after some hard cardio?  I personally have never had it myself but I believe it exists if you hit it hard enough.  I doubt exercise is really gonna address depression head on, but at least it's a distraction while you do it, and in theory, that feeling of bettering yourself physically will carry over into your mental well-being.  Even if you don't have anyone to show your gains to, at least you can have that feeling of accomplishment and visually see a change in yourself when you put the work in.

I have dealt with depression for as long as I can remember. But it is hitting me so fucking hard lately. Im dreading going to sleep tonight cause I dont want to wake up tomorrow. I have to I can't be done cause I have my kids that need to have a father but I dont want to wake up I dont want to deal with my divorce I dont want to be alone anymore I dont want to struggle to eat. I dont want to feel like to only person on this planet that cares about me is me. I have friends that care but I dont feel it. Im so tired of knowing things are not as painful as they feel but still hurting every moment of everyday still feeling like I'm 13 years old wait for the mother that is not coming to get me. Im so tired of knowing that the reason I hurt is cause no one in my life has placed value in me. I know I have value but I can't see it when I'm sitting here alone unwanted cause if I had value would I really be getting divorced would my mom have lied to me so often and left me so she could get high. Wouldn't some one in my life actually care about me enough to see how much pain I am in. I know that I can not feel like this i know I can go to therapy get meds work through some of this pain I know that but I dont feel it and I am so tired of trying im so tired of not being able to sleep of not wanting to wake of not wanting to do anything more than the bare fucking minimum.   I'm truly sorry if you stuck through and read this im sorry and thank you.   I'll still be here tomorrow I have to but I dont really want to be. Not tonight I dont at least.   Good night.

I stuck through reading this.  Sorry this is so difficult for you.  What is the current status of your divorce?  Is it fresh?  I went through a mental hell during mine.  I can definitely relate to this.  Having kids in the middle of it was brutal.  I struggled with bringing myself to seeing them on my scheduled weekends.  I just wasn't "right" enough for two little ones at the time.
I moved out about 8 months ago. But she waiting till December to file after we had agreed to wait for our stimulus checks to go through it as cheap and easy as possible. We had agreed to joint custody and an even split time wise with the kids but she filled for ful custody and offered only every other weekend with the kids.
Although we never had a verbal agreement to the contrary, I was also offered the every other weekend dad gig, which is what ended up happening.  If you have a way to get more, do not settle.  In my state, the mother pretty much calls the shots and I had no choice, according to my lawyer.  This was 12 years ago.  What happened was my kids would come visit as scheduled, but I really wasn't their father anymore.  I would go to some ball games and school plays and whatnot, but I wasn't parenting them.  It was like watching them from a distance.  Avoid this if you can.
I'm so sorry man. I refuse to not fight for them. But everyday sucks right now. I honestly would rather be back in that toxic relationship than alone right now but I know that is not the right choice it is just the easy choice.

I just thought he was kind of being an asshole who didn't seem to be want to stick with anything and was just never satisfied with anything. Generally just a huge pessimist. while that doesn't excuse some things he has done or said, it makes more sense and I should have seen it for what it was.   I also struggle with depression but have had help in the past and am back on meds currently.  It sounds ridiculous, but his job is one of the major stressors and I've thought about suggesting that he find a part time job instead of working full time. I work two jobs right now and think I could handle most of the bills on my own. He's never been to therapy but is open to the idea.   Idk, anyone have thoughts? I just love him and don't like seeing him like this because I know how it feels.

I have a couple suggestions here. It's really hard coping with your own struggles, and having a partner who is also struggling.   If he's open to the idea of therapy, and you're able to, I recommend a few couples sessions. You want to support him, and it sounds like he might not have the best tools to express himself. A couples therapist could walk you through some exercises that would help you both.   If his job is a huge factor, I agree with looking for alternate options. I'm not saying part time for sure. Even if you can handle the bills, unless you have a clear plan in mind, including him getting help, that could spiral in a negative direction. A different job with less stress would be great, though.  Also, remember that as his girlfriend, your role is not to fix him. You said you should have seen it for what it was. Remind yourself that you can help a loved one carry their burden without placing blame/responsibility on yourself.

This is going to be a lot so I apologize for the run on sentences and the spelling mistakes. I am scared that I am never going to feel happy. I was adopted 5 but placed into the foster system when I was 3 because my single mother left me in her apartment and went on a drug binge and ended up overdosing and dying. I was told when they found me in her apartment I was extremely malnourished covered in my own shit and piss ECT... I was adopted and my foster parents were very resentful and just the kind of people who opened a group home in Chicago solely for the income. When I was 10 I tried to kill myself and I was taken to the hospital and then a mental/behavioral hospital for children and young teens. Horrible time so i promised myself if I was going to kill myself again I was going to do it correctly. I ended up getting sent to foster home and actually was blessed to be adopted at age 11 by two amazing people that I to this day consider my parents (I am 23 Female) my foster mother ended up passing away from MRSA when I was 16 and my dad just passed away from COVID. I am an active duty military member and was raped my first year of being in the military and my rapist was sentenced to 24 months in prison the rape occurred in 2015 and he was found guilty in 2019 the Military takes forever with sexual assault charges, I was just told today that he is getting released from the brig early on parole. I am newly married and my husband is stationed overseas and he just left this week as well. I'm trying to do the whole Sober thing for 2021 because I am a very very heavy drinker and I don't know I guess in this moment I just really want to kill myself and I love my husband dearly and I KNOW that this would be selfish of me to do but I just don't see my life getting any better.

I am so excited to tell you that my best friend has finally come out of a depression after almost 7-months of attempts. Due to last year's prolonged lockdowns, he was forced to stay at home and slowly went into depression from the beginning of May 2020. We all tried several tihngs to get him out of that mind state but failed. Lastly when we came across online Yoga trainer from Canada - Salimah, and started practicing her techniques to [heal depression with Kundalini Yoga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eDG0EAld14), within few days we saw a transformation in him. This technique is really powerful and we should all practice it even if we are fit to keep our mind healthy.   &#x200B;  [Kudalini Yoga for Depression](https://preview.redd.it/ylwc6ouyw8a61.jpg?width=1226&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed486a1d5fd8dea3e2b6c2a65f9bb515dcef3c37)

Big trigger warning  I have self harmed and had suicidal thoughts before but I’ve never had a thought like this one. I was in the car with my sister. I so badly wanted to grab the steering wheel and make her crash into something (only to kill me). But now I don’t really feel like that anymore. I feel my parents should know about this but I have no idea how to tell them or if it’s a good idea to tell them anyways. Any advice?

That is a lot to process! Take a deep breath. Make your favorite warm beverage (tea, hot chocolate, coffee...), grab a couple [dozen] cookies, and start making a list of your options. Are you able to stay with your partner where they are temporarily? Another friend? Do you have access to apartments with month to month leases you could afford? Is there a plan or a timeline to still move in with your partner? Do you just need to buy time for another month? 2 months? Could you stay with a family member for a bit? Would your current roommate let you crash on the couch until you figure things out? Think of every option this weekend. Rank them. Make another list of steps to accomplish them, and start taking those steps Monday morning. Make phone calls. Send emails. You can handle this.

Maybe it'll alleviate my stress...I don't know. But today I realize I turn 29 this year. I don't have any issue with getting older but I'm still in a home where no one likes me. I think all my life I've just wanted to have a home where someone is happy whenever I get home, even if its just me and my dog. I've been working so hard over a decade to get myself into a position where I can earn a living on my own. I'm getting my masters so I can become a licensed practitioner. But I'm still in a home where my family often reminds me of everything I do wrong, where I'm failing, how much they are upset with me, try to control and monitor everything I do in exchange for help with tuition and housing expenses.   I. am. miserable.    My default is to be goofy and excitable but now most of my conversations are about negative viewpoints. I realize my environment is poisoning me. My internal self talk has turned into telling myself I'm not good enough and then backing it up with whatever criticism my family has had of me recently. And I haven't been able to convince myself that its not true.   My friends are far and I try to tell them I'd like to spend time with them. I don't want to vent anymore, I just want to sit in the company of people who are happy to see me. But they often have to cancel for legitimate reasons (quarantining, sick, or work related). I'm understanding but it makes me sad when they forget to reschedule. It hurts to keep trying anymore.   I'm even making the same mistake in my relationships. I left my ex after 6 years because he said he didn't want to get married until he was financially prepared...but then bought a house without asking for my input so I knew the house was for him not for us. I met another wonderful man but he also said the financially prepared thing too. He's in law school now but that's another 3 years and we've been together for 3 already. There are other signs that make me think he's not preparing for an 'us' but idk if I'm just sensitive to that.   I'm trying to make it but I've failed classes and if I fail these 2 classes again I'll be kicked out of the grad program. I won't be able to afford to live so I think I'd do it then. I know everyone will be sad but I have to be honest of the extent of my misery.   I appreciate anyone who took the time out to read this

There are some exercises that can help you feel more present. If you practice these when you're feeling good, they can become second nature when you're having a bad day.  Sit down wherever you are and count 10 things you can hear. Cars, wind, furnace kicking in, birds, your own breath...  Keep a list of 10-15 colors with you, and pull it out when you need it. Look around and try to identify one thing for each color on your list.  Go through your 5 senses. List 5 things you can see, 4 you can hear, 3 you can touch, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.   I'm sorry you're dealing with so many difficult struggles.

Hi, my boyfriend broke up with me about five days ago and now I’m currently really sick. I am all alone, and I hate I am all alone mostly when I am sick. And every time I think about it, it brings me pain and this horrible feeling in my stomach/heart. I want to start doing stuff for me that will help me gain self-love. But I also I’m very sick and sometimes have no motivation to do anything. In addition, sometimes I will have good days and I were bad days due to the break up. I just don’t how to feel or what to do anymore. I want to gain self-love but my heart is hurting so much I don’t think it’s allowing me. What do I do?

Take it one step at a time.  Get yourself cleaned up, even if it’s just washing your face and brushing your teeth.   Try to change out of your clothes as well, and move to a different room of the house if you’ve just been cooped up in your room, open the windows if you can, get some sunlight coming in  Then get yourself some water, take any medication you need, and preferably, something hot to drink or eat. If you don’t feel like making something, you can order delivery, and if that’s not an option just even some toast or fruit is okay.   Do something you enjoy, like watch a feel good movie, or read a book, or something that’ll turn your brain off for a bit.   Take it slow, you’re both sick and heartbroken right now. Be kind to yourself. Tell yourself it’s okay to be bleh right now, but also that you deserve to do things that’ll make you feel better.

I have trouble eating. Hardly anything tastes decent enough to eat. I'm a picky eater in general and when I'm depressed I can't even make chocolate (a favorite) palettable. Often I starve just because food is so unappetizing. But I have to eat, especially at work because I become emotional and cry in front of clients. To complicate matters, I just don't have much energy  to expend in making a complex meal or the know how to do it. Any recommendations for something I can take to eat at work?  I have done sandwiches, ramen, and shakes, but the sandwiches get boring, ramen tastes bland, and the shakes aren't filling enough if they taste decent at all.

Are you losing your appetite over depression or just losing your appetite in general. If something is bothering you, maybe that is the root of the problem. However, if not then maybe trying different sauces can make things more interesting. Maybe getting cute sandwich shapers like a cat shape or something would make you cheer you up even if you don't want to eat that much. Perhaps buys some different flavor bar packs as snacks. I hope things go well and take care of your health!
Did you try meal replacement shakes? Sure they aren't tasty, but provide much more nutrition than protein shakes so might worth it just to keep your body functioning.
Maybe you can bake something at home and take it to work the next day! I think baking is a lot easier than cooking and you can adjust something like a cookie to your taste. Even though it’s not the healthiest it is better to get some calories in, plus you can always find a healthier option online
Sandwiches are my go to for nutritious and fast! Turkey with cheese, tomato, mayo/mustard and lettuce is solo good. Even just turkey with bread is good to fill your stomach, I make BLT's and grilled cheese a lot, warm and quick (:
Depends on your tastes but my go-to depression meals are either a microwave baked potato with tons of butter or some pre-made thing from the store that takes minimal effort like dumplings.
Im just odd. I have always had a rough relationship with food and depression makes it worse.  I like the idea of sandwich shapers, thank you! I'll try and find some snack bars i like too.
I have tried a few, but they just aren't filling enough. Thanks for the suggestion!
Thanks for the idea!
Thanks for the help!
Thank you!

Today I thought I would get involved in something creative and learn how to draw again. I had done a lot of art as a teenager but I had abandoned it when my first year of college  started. I figured this Christmas break was a perfect time to start doing it again. I had been watching some beginners’ tutorials on how to draw, but as soon as I tried to put everything I learned into practice it looked like a potato.  Which is fine, I knew I wasn’t going to be good at it at first since I hadn’t don’t this in a while. I knew it would take some time to get better at it. But as soon as I started trying to see what I did wrong and how I could improve, I felt a sudden rush of lethargy that I couldn’t get rid of. I just felt so tired and sad and I couldn’t motivate myself to keep working on this project.  The thing is, this has been hurting me for a while. It has been increasingly difficult for me to handle a full course load in college because I just feel exhausted all the time. I wake up in the morning and instead of being ready to get to work, I just feel like a tired bag of garbage. It’s like there’s a weight attached to me that I can’t get rid of. I can’t focus on anything, I spend a lot of my time watching YouTube videos or checking Reddit/Twitter while I should be studying or getting my work done.  I’m scared that my life is going to pass me by and I will never be able to do anything with my life because of my lack of motivation and focus. I hate that I’m such a lazy piece of shit but this is so hard to push through. I don’t know what to do. Am I just doomed to never entertain any new hobbies, never do anything creative, never have fun with anything for the rest of my life?

Don’t look for what you’re doing wrong. You are halting your own creativity with critique. When the piece you’re working on feels underwhelming, start another spin on it or something opposite. I had an art teacher that emphasized how important it is to know when to walk away from a work.

I’m really scared to be on medication. My dad started taking an antidepressant when he was my age and was never able to come off of it, even when it started making things worse. I know that tons of people take them, and that it should help me with depression and anxiety, but I’m worried that I won’t be myself anymore. Not that who I am now is necessarily good, but I am worried that I will have the same issues my dad had. I’m not saying I won’t start taking the meds, but I want to know if I should start tomorrow (and go to work), or if I should wait until Sunday when I have a couple days off? I’m sure it will take my body a while to get used to something like this. Any advice would be really helpful and appreciated

In my own experience, it didn’t really require any time off from work because I didn’t have adverse reactions. Some things helped, some did nothing. Mostly they did nothing. Don’t worry about losing yourself, you’re only gonna get better and be happier with the right medications
first off: i had the same concerns as you. i can’t say going on meds has been a perfect fix, but it has been much better than the alternative? just because your dad has issues doesn’t guarantee you will — there are all kinds of factors at play. you may not feel like “yourself,” and that’ll be one sign to try something different... or you may feel more like your best self than you have in a long time. the most annoying thing is trying to finetune and find the best med (or combo) for your particular body/brain.  as for your specific question: it depends on the medication, i guess, but it really shouldn’t affect your body that quickly! however, don’t underestimate the power of anxiety to make you feel like something weird is happening; if it makes you feel safer to wait, then wait.  make sure to share ALL of your concerns with your doctor, so they know what to help you monitor. and try not to do too much googling on your own; i have been on and off assorted meds, and the messageboards out there can be unhelpful.

Make your appointment. That is step one. Do whatever it takes. Ask a friend to call and make it for you if you have to. I've made appointments for people in the past when the phone calls were just too hard, and it's really not a big deal.  Then you can either rehearse your explanation over and over again until you feel more comfortable, or just write it down. Take some time, write out everything you feel is important, and what you need help with, and hand the paper to your doctor. Say "this is hard for me to talk about," and let them read it. You can try to answer their follow up questions, but they should get the idea by then. This person is a professional being paid to help you. They'll know what to do.

(I posted this in the depression subreddit but afterwards I found this one..I didn’t know this existed. I hope you allow me to have the same post in different subreddits..I just want someone to listen to me thank you)   For the past few weeks I haven’t been myself. I’ve been struggling really badly with depression and stress. From life and worrying, trauma, and other things my mind may make up. I don’t have health insurance so I can’t go to a therapist. I have been procrastinating everything I need to get done due to the frustration and idea of having to do it alone to refrain from asking people for help so I don’t cause any stress in the household. I have been really slow in my thinking and I’m not as fast as I used to be. I’ve often forgotten to do things or did things without thinking. I’ve been crying everyday now, due to family problems. Problems I should be used to by now... i don’t have any friends and I’m lonely. I feel alone and I often believe many negative thoughts about myself. The worst part about this is my birthday is coming soon, and last year something traumatic happened that I don’t want to repeat again. Sometimes I get paranoid and sometimes I lose all hope. I’ve thought about suicide a couple of times and this is breaking my heart. I don’t know what to do, and i have so much to do... I don’t feel lost necessarily but I felt disappointed in myself and sad. Often times I feel as if I’m falling with no way to catch me.

Yeah, I feel the same. Depression really messes with how we act in our daily lives. I keep procrastinating as well bc I couldn't get myself to do simple things.
Hi Painting,  depression and anxiety suck - I've been there.  I did a few things to get my life back.   * started doing very easy exercise. I went for walks and bike rides and hikes in the woods. This always made me calmer and has become a habit. * read a lot of books. Mark Manson's F\*ck'd books are excellent as Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday * found empathetic people to talk with. I know this may be harder today - or maybe not. Most people who did live events are now online. Find someone who can teach you skills - I like DBT and CBT personally.   When I was suffering, it was due to a lack of skills to put the past into perspective and to see a path forward to a better life. Between the books and learning DBT, everything is different :-)  You can do this :-)  Feel free to ping me any time.
Sounds like you are going through a lot and especially with your birthday coming up (whether or not something traumatic happened) it can be so lonely and triggering.  Don’t be disappointed in yourself, your feelings are not your fault and they are not you. Your feelings are valid and it’s ok to feel sad and depressed.  But you won’t always feel this way. I know it sounds cliche but there will be better days. You can get there, it just may take some time. I’ve felt those dark depths where I couldn’t even think past the next day and I felt like I was walking through treacle all the time.   I don’t know if you want advice or not (if not please ignore!) but there are some small things you can do to help alleviate some of the pain. I wrote about the [techniques I use to manage anxiety](https://askamna.com/how-to-control-anxiety-in-a-pandemic/), they also apply equally to depression.  When you’re really depressed it’s hard to even get out of bed. The way I get myself to do things is I just think “I’ll just do 5 minutes of reading” or “I’ll go out for a 10 minute walk”. Do something that you really enjoy for yourself and don’t feel guilty about it! Taking a few deep breaths when things get really bad helps too. I always recommend the Headspace app. It works if you keep at it. Do small things often and things will improve, maybe not enough but it’s a start.   Not sure where you’re based but have looked at some mental health charities? Some places offer free counselling or helpline services.

I’ve been dealing with depression I guess like since I was young like in my early teens? But it’s had its ups and downs until it got really bad recently and tried to seek help myself since I knew it wouldn’t help if I talked to my friends and Asian parents about it. I’ve tried talking to my parents maybe during high school, but it really went downhill from there. Drugs were a factor in that time period, so my parents always resorted to that being the reason why. I stopped doing drugs soon after believing that it might’ve been the case. But recently, it started getting worse when my boyfriend started to have these “episodes”. He was never like this in the past, but he liked to say that it was my fault. But honestly I don’t think it was my fault and I try not to defend myself. If I did,  I don’t know how’d he react if I try to stand my ground and make him feel worse than he already is. I’m guessing by the way he was acting like this was the first time he was depressed since he got diagnosed but I don’t want to invalidate his feelings since everyone probably has different ways to handle their feelings. I can tell you the rundown of what has happened to him. He basically had a Covid scare and was unable to go out and started having panic attack that something was going to happen to him, but that went away some time after. It came back in two weeks after he started going outside again, but this time it was paranoia assuming that I was cheating and it would get end up with these mental beat downs on me to the point where I would cry everyday and wonder what I did to deserve this. I stuck by him and still tried to help him because I knew he was going through things and didn’t want to make it worse. Even though, I wasn’t able to help myself at that time I kept on telling myself that he was the priority at the moment. He was in and out of the emergency room and then tried to do some therapy. He stopped therapy because he felt different and thought he really didn’t need it. He was also prescribed meds but he didn’t want to take them as well. Or he wanted to be prescribed drugs like Xanax, which made me think whether or not he was actually being serious with how he felt or he just wanted to feel good on drugs and actually be prescribed them. Nowadays, he’s been well and got back to doing what he did before his “episodes”, but I seem to be stuck and only keep on feeling worse everyday. I tried to get a mental wellness check and got a general idea of why I’m feeling this way. They said they didn’t know for sure but it seemed like I had a mood disorder, depression and some sort of anxiety. But they recommended me to go to an actual therapist to get more in depth. Me still under my parents insurance and Asian would need to ask my parents. I didn’t expect much from telling them but I did anyways. The feedback I got was exactly what I expected, invalidation and the need to talk about their feelings and think that what I’m going through is something they always go through in everyday life. So that doesn’t give me a chance to actually get the professional help I possibly need. I resort to talking to my friends and my boyfriend who wants me to tell them how I actually feel. But there’s only so much they can do. They try to get me to go outside and get some coffee to chat. Or try to spend sometime inside maybe trying to start new hobbies with me. My boyfriend got me into playing golf! Which is fun, but I can’t really go that often. At the end of the day, I feel like there’s really nothing I can do to change how I feel and all this happiness is temporary. I’ve been moody and I know everyone tries their best to help. I mostly just feel bad thinking about this and cry. The crying doesn’t even make me feel better either and it makes it worse. So I’m scared to also cry as well, and I’ve been holding things in since I feel it’s gonna be a burden to everyone because they all have their own lives. And just recently, I’ve had fights with my boyfriend because I would try to tell him that I would like some headspace and alone time. He would again assume that there’s someone else or I don’t feel the same about him anymore. And I constantly try to tell him, it’s just for me and I constantly also try to reassure him. I’m getting tired of it. I love him but it’s honestly too much for me to handle. But I don’t want to be rude since I know he’s done so much for me just like I’ve done for him. I’ve been so mentally drained and stressed that I’ve even lost all motivation to do anything and came to this community for some help or guidance, because maybe someone might have experience somewhat of the same thing that I’m experiencing? It might be messy to read out but my thoughts have been messy as well, so please bear with me 😔

i don’t know if this advice is beneficial to you or not but here goes;  my friend who is a nurse took time off from work for ‘burnout’ and then started back at work progressively only starting a few days a week half days to begin with, is this an option for you when starting back?  have you spoken to w regarding this, a boss or colleagues?  do you have a mental health system in place at work where you get over the phone sessions to speak to people about your work?  what exactly is making you feel anxious and depressed with the new unit? is it anything in particular??
Thankfully you made the right move taking some medical leave. I must admit I'm rather suprised as a doctor you'd turn to a forum like this for advice so I'd surely advise you to seek some advice and counsel through your upper line staff and supervision.    You surely wouldn't want to put yourself in a jeaprodizing  situation in a medical field that could affect someone elses health or your future as a doctor.  I appreciate the fact that you're seeking help and trust that you will overcome this long  battle and once again feel comfortable and productive in your field of practice.
currently i am working in an ICU which is a new environment for me...since i am new to this environment there is a lot to learn..but nothing goes into my mind since i am anxious and depressed..on top of that i get insomnia whenever i have a problem..i have discussed briefly about my condition and i am getting lot of support..but the issue is somehow i have to go back to work..my whole life depends on this..

I'm too depressed to work. The only things I enjoy doing are hobbies that aren't too demanding. Other people tell me that I have value -- I'm a good person, I'm kind, smart, funny, talented, etc. But I can't make money. I don't want to work. I don't want to do anything. And it's impossible to forgive myself for that.   I mean, I'm convinced that on some level I'm being selfish. I hate the idea of giving away most of my time to work, even though *I'm* not doing anything with it. I hate the idea of anything being demanded of me. I only want to deal with the world on my terms. And I don't even like the world all that much in the first place.   But I still want to live. I don't know how someone like me is supposed to live, especially in a western, capitalist society. But I still selfishly want to. Even though it means other people have to give up *their* money (and by extension, their time), that they earned by working, just so I can keep existing. Even though I don't *do* anything. Even though their investment seems to disappear into the black hole of my relentless depression.   Obviously, all these negative thoughts about myself only serve to maintain my depression. But it feels appropriate. My dad was the type of person who was perfectly content to leech off my mom's income. He felt entitled to it. I don't want to be like him. The least I can do is feel bad for not contributing, right?  I know that this entire way of thinking is the culmination of my childhood experiences. Even when I was diagnosed with depression, my mother pressured me to work, trying to "tough love" me out of it. I think her frustrations with my dad not working ended up transferred to me. But all it did was make me more convinced that I don't deserve to exist.   I feel like it's selfish for me to want anything at all. And even when I get past that feeling, I don't know what I want. It all feels so horribly self-indulgent. Growing up, my wants and needs were not important. And I completely bought into that. I became exactly what my family wanted: someone who has no desire for anything. Someone who neglects her own needs until she breaks down. I couldn't quite do the other half of these expectations, and become someone who works hard, and makes money, and doesn't require any financial support. I just made myself disappear as much as possible without actually dying. And it still wasn't enough.   So now, I'm in a good position, all things considered. My husband supports me. I don't have to disappear entirely. But I'm never going to be anything unless I start being at least a little selfish. And I don't know how to really commit to that. I thought that after a couple years, maybe I'd come into my own a little. But nothing's happened yet. I still don't know what I want, I still can't work, and I still feel guilty all the time.   I just don't know how to undo the brainwashing. The idea that I might have intrinsic value means nothing at all to me. I know it would be healthier to believe that. But it runs completely counter to how I was raised.   So... can you convince me otherwise?

Oh my goodness. I apologize I'm just now responding to you. You were so brave and so vulnerable to write such a powerful truth, and then to feel like you're out here even more alone because no one responded? Please forgive me.  Now that we're here together, I want to start by saying never before have I had anyone put what I used to feel into words like you did. I can remember so many times thinking, "I can't ask anyone for help because I have no idea how to even put into words what I'm feeling."  ...until now.  I also remember thinking, "OMG I just need someone to convince me, prove to me, that living it worth it. That it can get better. That it won't be like this forever."  No one could.  What someone did do for me, though, was took time to get to know me -- all of me -- and loved me anyway. For the first time in my life I felt acknowledged and accepted for who I was not what I did -- I felt seen, heard, and like I mattered -- and that "simple" act of unconditional love is what changed the trajectory of my life forever.  It also had me start questioning EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING. I grew up in a home starved for affection and communication -- the two things I crave more than anything. I never learned how to make decisions for myself, so I never knew how to function in the world -- which was cool because I found people to help "take care of me" and yet miserable at the same time because I knew like I knew I was capable of so much more.  Once this literal stranger named Anne took me in and offered me something I'd only ever dreamed of before yet never believed was possible for me, hope happened.  After hope came possibility.  After possibility came...fear again.  And the cycle continued until I was finally able to take baby step after baby step from hope, to possibility to potential to reality.  Do I get it right every day? Heck no! I'm still living minute by minute over here.  What I do know is that what I was taught as a child, the "lie-dentity" I inherited through no fault of my own, is not how I HAVE to live.  But that never would have happened if someone hadn't seen me, acknowledged me, and loved me unconditionally.  So allow me to be that person for you.  Clearly I haven't met you. What I do know like I know like I know is that you are a person who has a HUGE heart, who cares more than you've allowed yourself to feel -- through no fault of your own -- and who is here for a purpose and on purpose. You're an overcomer, and you were never meant to fit in.  So allow me to also give you permission to stand OUT, speak your truth with love and respect, and know that you are heard, acknowledged and accepted for all things YOU.  I see you.  And you matter.
I also have someone who loves me, although I feel somewhat cut off from it. I don't think I truly allow myself to be loved. In a sense, I'm not as hungry for affection and healing as you were. I'm very self-neglectful... and I've never really put my happiness before everything else. I'm not sure *how* to do that.   But, well, it's nice to think that I'm some kind of Overcomer Who Doesn't Fit In. It's certainly how I always feel.   ... but I find it hard to believe that I could be heard, acknowledged, and accepted for all things me... I feel certain that there will always be some parts of me that people don't want to deal with. And they shouldn't have to. It's not anyone's responsibility but my own to fix me.

When I feel depressed and anxious, I tend to get really impatience and frustrated with myself. My inner dialogue becomes very toxic and destructive. I start spiraling into darkness and it feels like I'm seeping out a dark aura..  I pause and I have to verbally tell myself I'm not okay. I am hurting and struggling. I am in pain. What I'm feeling is equivalent to getting a really bad cut (more like rolling down a mountain and getting hundreds of deep cuts and scrapes). I need to remind myself to treat my mental health as if I just got physically hurt, and it helps me acknowledge I'm not okay. I need to take care of myself and reach out to people to help me heal. It's as if I have a scratch on my brain and I need help recovering.

This also implies that, just like a physical injury, it takes time and little strengthening exercises with recovery to heal. I do like this analogy. Thanks internet stranger.
❤️ thank you for this. I needed it today.
I always tell others that Major Depression is an illness. Everything you described feeling are the symptoms of this illness. Being scraped and cut is a good analogy for this. Just like being cut, the traumas that come with Depression leave real scars.  I'm 54 now, but there are times I feel like I'm still 14 when some mental scar resurfaces. Treat the symptoms, because your Depression isn't going away anytime soon.
Being patient is key and it does reward you in the end.
I completely forgot about strengthening exercises. Thank you for the reminder 💕
I'm really glad to hear I could be of help to someone. Thanks for the comment
Wow I can completely relate with "there are times I feel like I'm still 14 when some mental scar resurfaces". I used to tell myself I was taking steps backwards but you're right. Depression isn't going away anytime soon. Were all just learning how to live and experience our lives with it.
Good for you. You'll get through this...

throwaway account for multiple reasons.  Since a breakup about a year and a half ago, I feel like I've exhausted all routes towards getting better. I was diagnosed with Major Depression in September of 2019 and have recently been updated to Bipolar just a few months ago. I'm incredibly self-deprecating-- I truly believe that I'm the worst person on the planet and don't have a single good quality about myself.  &#x200B;  Since about November, I've been doing everything to try and change myself. I've lost 20 pounds, I've accrued two full time job offers (still in Uni), and I've broadened my social circle on top of medication and therapy. People tend to flock to me and ask me for help (I'm exceptional at masquerading my symptoms) but it doesn't really seem like a lot of people are really there for me.   After I lost the weight, I really couldn't see or feel a difference, regardless of what those around me would say. I still terrify girls (every girl I've tried to talk to since the relationship has run away from me) and I think if I don't change who I am I'm going to be alone forever.  I consider myself vehemently unattractive and it just seems like any skillset I have is for other people's benefit rather than myself. My mom passed away about a decade ago and my support system at home is really week. What changes have you all made before to build back a sense of confidence?

Hello  i (m) need help with finding my passion i guess. So im 23 years Old and studied economy till the 3rd Semester and developed some problems with anxiety(agoraphopie) and vomiting while studying. I chose busniess economy bc i didnt know what to do else and my psychologist is saying my problems started developing bc i do something i dont like at all and i think he is right bc i had no problems before in school with getting sick (vomiting bc of anxiety).I got a bit depressed as well bc i didnt wanted to get out with Frinds to crowded placed anymore so i dont get sick that much and isolated my self more and more. And than covid hit i cant go out even if i want. So now to my real question. I had my 6th session with my psychologist now the first 5 were to get to know eachother bettter and on the last session he told me that i schould find something where i am in the flow state in my mind so i can Focus on a positiv goal while treating me anxiety and Depression. A flow state he told me is when u enjoy something that much u dont even realise how much time is passing and u dont get exhausted that easily while doing that aktivity bc u enjoy it and he told me that the most people had some flow moment, hobby or aktivity while they where a child or kid but i cant remember what it was for me or if i had any Hobby i realy liked. Also today i dont realy have anything i like doing. I just watch netflix, youtube or Play games and Stuff but nothing that excite me. As a kid the only thing that comes to my mind is drawing but when i try to draw nowdays i dont feel that much joy and i am definitly not in a flow state. I have no Talents or something that i can increase or at least i didnt found it. So how do i find something i like or how do i remember what it was as a kid and do u guys have found anything and if so how did u find a passion ?   If u have question to my personality or anythig just ask maybe it help to specify it more and thx for reading.  And sorry for bad english:)   Thx in advance

Listen to her, remind her that you are there for her, make her favorite foods, offer to do things she likes with her.
Hi there.  I'd suggest helping her look for a peer support group.  You can find free virtual groups by searching the websites of NAMI (national alliance on mental illness) or the DBSA (depression and bipolar support alliance) by location.  No matter where one is with ones mental health, hearing from and sharing with peers can be a really powerful experience.  Best wishes, -F.

I met this girl through a club at our university that we both are members of.  We didn't have much talk in person but we had few short conversations on Instagram because we're both kinda shy.   During the quarantine, she replied to one of my stories saying that i'm cute(not in an intimate sense), and since then we started talking daily and started building a good 'friendship', we flirt jokingly everyday and show love to each other every night before sleep. i knew i had to ask her out at some point cuz i started liking her and we had so much in common and i felt like i'm talking to someone that finally understands me.  it turns out she also have feelings for me and asked me out first.   After a week, she told me that she's going through a depression because of a medicine that she's taking, i told her i'm okay with that and i promised her that i'll always be there for her no matter what.  for 2 months we had the best time of our lives, we were so in love, we already said 'i love you' to each other, we always reminded ourselves that we can't leave each other because it will be so wrong to leave this special thing we both had   one day she told me she wanted to keep our relationship private and don't tell our friends about it to avoid judgments/problems(she's the ex of a friend of mine)  2 months later, she had a very bad week where she couldn't leave her room because of depression so she decided to visit a therapist.  so after having the appointment she got back home and texted me that she needs space to figure things out and don't want to hurt me and that a lot of bad things happened to her in the past: her ex harrassed her all the time, she was raped at a young age by a friend, her school teachers sexually assaulted her too, her classmates always bullied her for being bisexual...  I insisted that i want to be there for her and that i can't lose her now and that she is irreplaceable but she told me that i deserve better and that she can't do anything about it now cuz she's so broken and can't be in a relationship rn so she can focus on her problems.  I respected her decision and let her be cuz i LOVE her so much and don't want to see her get hurt because of me.  1 month after the breakup she texted me that she missed me but she couldn't keep the conversation going and always reply after a day or two so i decided to end it there and not have contact with her.  4 months later i accidentally met her at uni but i couldn't talk to her since i didn't tell anybody that we both had a relationship. when i went home i texted her that i want to see her. i thought she moved on and will tell me she can't see me but she said she would like that and she really miss me and she hope we FIGURE THING OUT. i was very happy to hear that and i told her i feel the same too hoping that we will get back together again.   NOW: she got caught up in exams so i let her focus on that, but when finished passing her exams she didn't text me back so we can meet up, one day i texted her to see if everything is okay she said she's fine and just needed a break. it has been two weeks now and she still didn't text back and i certainly know she's talking to other people and interacting on socialmedia and go out with her friends and post photos of that on ig.   i don't know what to do about it and i don't want to lose her again, one day she tells me she hope to figure things out together and the next week she starts ghosting me

Firstly, sorry for any mistakes, I'm not a native English speaker.    It probably looks like a small thing. I doubt anyone will even read it. But it's a big deal for me.    I am terrible at contacting with people. No matter if it's face-to-face, or a phone/video call, a message, or even chatting on a stream chat. I am extremely sensitive and unconfident about what I say. Often, when I want to say something, write something on a stream, or post a thing like this, I overthink if I should do it. I usually start writing, and then immediately after I just delete it.     Eventually, when I somehow find courage to say something, usually on the internet, people are being careless assholes. And like I said, I am INCREDIBLY sensitive, about everything, actually. So I just go back into my shell and say/text nothing for another... week. A month. A few months...     Just now I'm watching a stream. I said something. Didn't mean anything bad. A moderator deleted my message and said "rude". He pointed something out and of course I started crying. For like 30 minutes. Until I decided to write this post. I'm still crying tho. I'm sure he didn't mean anything bad either. Just doing his job. I don't blame him. How could he know I'm that sensitive?     But, as usually in situations like this, it just made me think about everything. How I'm bad at everything. I can't even talk to people. And how I'm oversensitive about, yet again, everything.    I just can't take it. I'm gonna repeat myself. Just when I find courage to say something, people are mean to me, or just unaware that I'm extremely sensitive, and make me cry. Even if they didn't mean it.    I was about to cut myself now. Because of one simple message I sent, trying to be nice. I somehow stopped myself. Mainly because I share a room with my sis. She could notice.    Also I'm about to go to sleep, so I'll probably reply to comments (if there even will be any) in the morning.  Thank you for spending your precious time on reading this. Bless you all.

I think your problem here is more common than your realize. I have met a lot of outwardly confident people who have admitted to questioning things they say, or having awkward interactions. They tell a joke, and no one laughs. They contribute to a conversation, and no one acknowledges it. A waitress says to enjoy their food, and they reply "you, too." Obviously, not everyone will react like you, but we all have moments.  I'm assuming you're a minor since you share a room with your sister? Please consider seeking help for your cutting. You need to find a healthy way to cope, and cutting is not it.   Try looking up mindfulness activities for when your anxiety gets out of hand. Practice them when you're having a good day so you are prepared when it's a bad day.  If you don't feel confident in what you have to say, try giving yourself more interesting things to talk about. Look for cool volunteer opportunities. Take a free class online (coursera, or Edx). Start a new hobby. The more you do, the more you'll have to pick from in a conversation. Keep in mind, you are enough just the way you are, but putting yourself out there might help you in more ways than one.
Hi,  I hear you and understand your feelings.  This is not a rant, you are a caring person who wants to understand how to interact with people without feeling terrified that you might say the wrong thing and have someone be unfairly cruel to you.   I'm 61 years old and I believe young people are much crueler than they were now than I was young.    Here's the secret: Most people don't talk about anything important...ever.  The best way to have people like you is for you to ask them about them.  No joke.  How are you doing today?  Where do you live?  Did you grow up there?  What are the people there like?  What class are you taking?  Is that teacher good?  Do you have brothers and sisters?  Give me a person and I can give you 25 questions to ask and they'll think you're so interesting because you asked about them.  They feel cared about.  If they're a good person, they'll ask about you and over time you might make a friend.  There's an ancient book called "How to win friends and influence people" that talk about this stuff.  It's really dated but the ideas are true.  Then you have to maybe think about what people said.  Were they really mean? or did they just say something to "sound cool" to the other people.  Stay away from people who are cruel. You can find a group of caring people, but it might take time.  Is your family aware of all this?  Are they helpful?  The other commenter is right, cutting is not the answer.  Message me when you're upset instead.  Keep us posted.  If I could I'd give you a big grandma hug and tell you things will get better.
Your voice does matter.    This took strength to post this. Be so proud of yourself!  No matter where you go in life... some people are just miserable A$$ Holes. Let them be in their misery.   I promise there are good people out there. What has helped me is writing with a pen and paper. There is no deleting in a hurry... it's my feelings, thoughts, & emotions all laid out for me to analyze.. re read.. to grow and learn from.   You do matter. You will find things that you are good at. Be kind to yourself. <3  Take it one day at a time & It's okay to not be okay.   \-K
I think you need to practice accepting that people, ALL people, make mistakes, say things poorly, etc. Its ok. Just learn from it and move on. Anyone who is overly aggressive about it *is* an asshole and you shouldn't waste any energy in them.   Obviously it's easier said than done, but you just gotta keep repeating the mantra "it's ok to make mistakes".   It also sounds like you may have social anxiety. Perhaps you could look into some professional help? Idk what kind of resources you have, but it's worth a shot.
I just want to say, as a native English speaker, your English is literally perfect, and better than what most native English speakers would produce, myself included.
Hi tvenus,  First - you have a lot of courage to be this vulnerable with us. Many people wouldn't be brave enough to do this.  Second - see if you can find a DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) based therapist who specializes in teens. My partner is one of those people and she helps people like you in a clinical setting. DBT skills help with emotional regulation to control mood sensitivity and the later skills are good for boosting confidence.   I used the skills to get over my fear of public speaking, to communicate better with my partner, and to be a better parent.    Horse back riding is awesome, I rode a lot in my early teens. You are lucky to have that as an outlet :-)  Best of luck.
Thank you a lot for the advice and kind words.     I indeed am a minor, 16 yo. I'm horse riding, it is an incredible therapy for me. I forget about everything, and I feel a bit more brave to talk. I love drawing, too. These things really help me forget about my problems. But it's not enough. When I feel really down, I feel really down, it kinda has to pass by itself.     I don't really have problems talking with my family. I have a friend tho, I think she's a good way too practice my talking. She talks a lot so there's no problem with awkward silnece. I talk more at the stable too, as I mentioned. I'm not afraid to ask questions there. Even when I feel they might be dumb.  I had therapy, it had to be paused due to the virus. I didn't feel like it helped tho. I take medicine, I don't feel like they help. Nor does talking to my doctor once a few months. I was at a hospital, it just made me feel worse. I'm afraid nothing will help me and I'll be stuck in this forever, since I don't have the guts to take my own life. But at the same time I'm secretly hoping a "miracle" will happen and I'll feel better.    Thanks again
Thank you a lot for the advice and kind words.   My family is aware, and is incredibly supportive and loving. They simply don't understand though. I think mental illnesses are hard to understand, I don't blame them If they're confused about my behaviours sometimes.    What my parents don't know about is my self harm. I cover it with long sleeves. I did consider making a post about it. I'm scared to tell them, I don't know If I'm brave enough. I don't want to worry them.    I have this slight hope things WILL get better. I just don't know if I'm patient enough.    Thank you again.
Thank you a lot
Thank you for your support    I am aware that I'm just human and I make mistakes, like everyone. But I still can't take it when I say something dumb, for example in class. I just can't. I always think what do others think about me. Even though they usually don't even care.     I do have diagnosed social anxiety, I had a therapy, paused due to the virus, but I never felt like it helped. I'm thinking about switching a therapist, and I probably will.     I'm a bit more brave at the stable I horse ride at. I forget about everything and I don't care if I make mistakes there. I also talk to people more. I feel like it's a far better therapy than the actual one.
Thank you so much! It really means a lot!
Thank you a lot for the advice and kind words!     I'll be on lookout for a new therapist.    Have a good one.
When you're able to, I suggest switching therapists. Not everyone is a good fit. They might be great at their job, but not great for you. It's ok, and a positive thing, to try different therapists until you find one who helps you.
I'm so glad they're supportive and loving, even if they don't totally understand.  I'm glad you at least shared it with me.  What situations make you want to do it? and how can we find a way for you to perhaps get your emotional needs met without cutting?  Are you angry or sad when you cut?  Maybe you could tell reddit, me or a trusted person about those feelings or write in a diary you hide away, instead of cutting.  Let me know and I'm here
You'd be surprised how much people really *don't* care about and little thing you do. Think about it. How often are you internally criticizing people over every little thing?
Thank you, I will look for a new one.
Like I said in the post, I'm oversensitive. When something makes me think about life for a few seconds, I start overthinking and cry. It usually leads to self harm. Sometimes my parents say something wrong. I do something bad, they yell. I can't be mad at them. They're just humans. But it breaks my heart when they call me something bad. Or when they say "others have it worse".  My dad lives in a separate house, I can't really talk to him, it's not a conversation for a phone call. I used to talk quite a lot to my mom, but she just can't seem to understand. Sometimes it ends on her dumping on me and me feeling even worse. She didn't have an amazing life herself. I'm afraid about her mental health at this point. Sometimes she says she's done with life herself. So I stopped talking to her.    It could be why I started to cut. I don't really have anyone to talk to. People on internet aren't enough. It has to be a face-to-face conversation. I'm not brave enough to talk to anyone but my parents. I'm not even strong enough to tell them that I wish I wasn't born, and wish I could just kill myself. All I'm able to say is "I feel worse". But they don't get the hint. Yet again, they're not therapists, they don't understand my problems fully. I used to talk to a therapist, she was the smartest therapist/doctor I've met. But she seemed like she thought I'm dumb. Like she thinks a simple "You need to help us if you want us to get you out of this" or "You need to WANT to get out of this" will help. Does she think I wanna suffer like this forever? I wanna be depressed, cut and cry every week when no-one is looking? Maybe she's not so smart after all? I wouldn't talk with her if I didn't want to get out of this in the first place. I really hoped she'll help. She seemed intelligent. Maybe she is, but she thinks I'm more stupid than I really am.    Sorry If I'm repeating myself, those are long texts, I don't remember what I said to which commenter.    I'll go to sleep now. It's 2:20am for me. Thank you yet again.
I more often just feel bad when someone does something wrong and others silently laugh at them. As much as I hate humankind as a whole, I really do feel bad.     Especially about my dad. He's a.... specific human being. A "different breed". He's intelligent, but has some weird behaviours. My mom and my sister make fun of him behind his back. I feel so bad. And I'm kinda mad at them. Despite what he is, he's family.

You know when you are fed up with work, then you take some time off, travel, do other things and then you are able to come back to the office like new? That is what I would love to have, but from myself, like a vacation from my head. There is no place, no people, no talk, no medication, nothing that can help me but myself at this point. It's so many years dealing with depression, that something has to change inside me to move forward. And I am so exhausted of the same thoughts, the same fog in my head preventing me from seeing the good things around me. I wish I could turn my thoughts off for a while to see if I can go back to them rested and ready to tackle the challenges.    Any suggestion on how to do it?

Hi, maybe you need to deal with the root of depression which might require professional help. Self-care is also a good idea, when we give of ourselves we should also take time to regain the strength required to give otherwise we get frustrated when much is required of us and we cannot give any more. We all need to take time to care of ourselves and I love the fact that you raised going to a vacation, I suggest that you really take time and care for self physically. spiritually, emotionally and mentally. If you see necessary discover more of yourself, what you enjoy doing (responsibly), what you are interested in, what you would like to try and the moments you would like to spend and treasure with those around you I suggest that you make a decision to live your life with a purpose, we need you to play that part that you were destined to play in the world, you need you refreshed...Be restored from your past wounds and face tomorrow with healed scars, take time to celebrate yourself, you are unique, you are what is needed in this generation, you are enough and nothing that has ever happened to you defines you, you are worth it. If you need to talk to someone, you can call this number and get free professional help 855-382-5433

Some of my depression I believe stems from my dating life which has taken a hit in the last year as I’m sure many other’s have as well. Today I deleted all of the dating apps from my phone and it gave me a small sense of clarity and freedom that I haven’t had in awhile. This isn’t a cure all but I hope this tip will offer some relief to somebody here. Also may help in dealing with anxiety which I’m sure like me others here deal with alongside depression.

That’s very kind of you
Thank you. I’ve been struggling lately
You are a wonderful person.
You've already helped me! Just know there are people out there willing to help cheers me up! :D  Also, as a non-heterosexual, I love this:   It doesn't matter who you are. **GAY**, straight, skinny, large, short, tall, black, white. I DON'T CARE.  Thank you for being selfless! Take my upvote, I only regret I have one to give to you now! :)
Thank You so much!
Thanks for being here for people who needs someone to talk to ! You're a wonderful person :)
Thanks....possibly too late for me. Don’t know how much I need but I don’t want to wake up tomorrow.  I don’t want this life anymore. Please help someone that will be missed. People only want me for what they can get and I can’t give any more. Xx
I don’t post a lot but thank you. I’m struggling a lot lately. I don’t know where to start.
u can text me! message me! i care about you!!
Talk to me. I don't know you but I care. I can try to help, I just don't want you to lose your life.
Just DM me and I'm free to talk
I’m self conscious on video lol...even lost out on job interview recently and think my camera appearance might have influenced this. Pissed off about that but their loss x
My life not worth keeping. In lockdown, can’t see friends but can work....doing work of 2 people but it’s never enough. Just feel those who do contact me have ulterior motives such as money or sex. Not spoken to friends in long time, have tried but they are busy till they want something. Just want to be loved for who I am but really don’t think that’s going to happen now. Rather be dead than go on like this.
video shit is hard!!! i feel like i am pretty good socially but on the phone i freak out! i get so scared and nervous and perform poorly. it’s so hard to get a reading on people online both ways
Honestly, I think your friends are assholes, because if they take everything from you and then ditch you after you've done what they asked. You deserve a better life and you deserve better friends if that's the way that your friends are gonna be
I keep trying to tell myself that and dumped last partner as he became verbally and emotionally abusive. But I am so lonely...reaching out but nobody there. On Reddit is last option xx
I'm proud of you for dumping an abusive person. You shouldn't have to deal with that, and I'm very proud of you for doing that. Sometimes it's very hard, and I'm very proud of you for having the courage to stand up to someone abusive and to lose them.I don't want you to be lonely, I am here if you ever want to talk
Thanks...I want to run away and start a new life but don’t think it’s possible at the moment. We’re in lockdown till probably end of March (uk) so feel like I’m in prison
I understand, but with how far technology has come and the resources and websites that we have easily available to us, then maybe you could look into something new, maybe find a new hobby that doesn't require many things
I would but so busy with work and trying to keep house clean ( live alone with 2 mucky cats) I don’t have a huge amount of spare time....and I see enough of these 4 walls. I can go for days without seeing another person and feels so isolated
If you want, I can give you my Snapchat and maybe we could video call sometime, and maybe you wouldn't be so lonely
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kt2pjo/tired/
I don’t know how to feel anymore and I’m just freaking tired of everyone here because they can’t do things my way, they make me feel lonely and sad and I don’t want them to see that I’m a loser like this, a loser who just stays in the room the entire day and having no fun in life. I keep trying to be happy but why can’t I be happy genuinely? I want to be a good person but why is it so hard to just pick myself up after people knock me down? My head hurts and my heart hurts, I just want to die in my sleep.

I find people who think socially anxious and shy people as rude moronic. In fact I would love friends and it would have been a lot easier if I wasn't bullied and terrorized daily. I am afraid trusting people and dating due to people constantly talking behind my back and in my face, throwing objects at me and terrorizing me and me having no to be supported until the bullying gets so hostile that I can no longer tolerate it. The irony is that the same people who make me feel not physically safe think I am weird, crazy, autistic and ''rude'' yet they wish other people to die raped, cuss a lot and do amoral things, yet blame me for being asocial and are extremely ignornat. I also hate the people who get me cause their help comes off as insulting. I do realize I can't defend my self, no need to butt it in. I hate the disrespect and harassment that comes with being quiet, inexperienced, shy, socially awkard child. Now I am an adult and I feel broken and find it hard to trust anyone with a penis due to my trauma.  I would love to know how to heal my wounds, be able to assert my self, get more friends, be more likeable and respected and know how and when to tolerate abuse, stand up for my self, improve social skills and conversation skills and be seen as smart and not only nerdy and nice, cause apperently in the stupid extrovert's mind that are my only qualities besides being a good material for bullying.

I’m not usually the type who writes about her personal situation in public. But last night, I felt that sense of extreme hopelessness about my life in general. I felt completely numb, empty, and at the edge of doing it. But then I thought about the people I’ll leave behind, esp my mom. i realized I need help. Seeking a therapist is probably the better option than venting out in this group. but being unemployed 32yo, and without savings, I guess sharing my situation is a more practical way of trying to get away from that urge to end things.   I’m currently in a very cold country in the north, which makes it worse. i’ve no friends here. Its only frustrating and disappointing to make one. I’m educated but because of the language I cant get a job. I dont even know if I want to pursue a career.   I know many who are in this community probably  feel/ have felt the same feeling, thats why youre here. I want to hear your thoughts. How do you deal with this overwhelming pain? How do you trust people and give life another chance?

Hi Clariss,  first - yeah for having the courage to reach out for help. Back when I was depressed, asking for help was impossible, I didn't have the courage.   second - yes, I have been there and it was no fun. I was miserable for a few years AND I learned some skills to get back in control of my life. I'm 99% sure that depression and anxiety happen when we feel we've lost control of our lives - I know I certainly felt that way.   Here's what I did:  * i found people to talk with. These weren't therapists but they had some advice. It wasn't perfect advice but it gave me hope and space to learn and experiment. I also heard other people's struggles in places where I had none.  * i focused on helping other people. Listening to other people can sometimes be all they need, other times it's fixing their plumbing. Shifting my focus outward let me see how I was contributing and I had less time to worry about myself. I did this for friends and at work.  * i learned a bunch of people skills. This took time and I'm still learning. I practice them every opportunity I can get - even during covid.   At the end of the day, this struggle made me a better person, a better parent, and a better contributor to people.   You got this :-)  Ping me any time.

Its good that you are reaching out. I recommend contacting thr loved ones who kept you alive last night. They should care about what you're going through and may help. Its easy to feel lost. I don't have a solution for that, just empathy. You get through the pain one moment at a time, as best you can. I wish you luck and hope.
Thanks for taking your time to write! I didn’t expect people, strangers, would care. this makes me cry again (but for good reason), ive been crying for feeling useless since last night and when I woke up this morning.  I like what you shared. They seem doable to me. I wish I could say Id do them too, but right now I just feel empty, with zero will to do anything. Sorry.
Thanks!
Thank you! Your reply means a lot. I really dont want to burden these people with my situation. They have their own lives, probably even worse problems than what im going through.
What's your desire? If you could do anything, what would it be? And why??
Just because we all have problems does not mean that your problems are any easier for you nor does it mean your struggle is not valid.  Humans survive best together

So here I am 33 , I live in my dads rental house he owns- and last year I lost my job I worked hard for a year to keep due to Covid. In that job I was making $15 I have a masters degree- I can’t find a job in my field HR because no one will hire me I have min experience in HR. I keep applying for jobs and I’m always rejected. I’m deeply depressed because I feel I’m a loser with no job while people younger than me have better jobs and are smarter. I’ve been working a temp job but in the last 3 weeks I’ve worked part time it’s been really slow. (But I norm work 40) I had an interview this week but I felt like they were gonna skip on me because I don’t have enough experience. It’s been two days and I just feel like shit and I feel like my life is worthless.

Hang in there. I know that's shitty to hear. I'm also going through some of the hardest things in my life. Everyday I just try to be better than the day before. Doesn't matter what it is. It means I'm better than I was yesterday. Sometimes I'm able to zone in and focus on what needs to be done. Other days I just watch a new movie and learn a new song on guitar. It gets better if you get better.
That's tough to hear, all i can say is keep applying to jobs, don't give up on that, please. stop saying you're are worthless because you are not, no one is, you are just having a bad time right now and hope you get out of it soon. Hopefully things get a little more normal this year after this whole 2020 mess. And don't compare your life with others, that's the worst thing you can do. It will get better, life has it's ups and downs. Don't be hard on yourself. If you need help try sharing your concerns to someone you trust that could help you go through this.

Hello everyone,   Like a lot of people, I'm struggling with depression since no idea when. I was going better at the beggining of 2020, before that whole shitty situtation. I'm now seeing a psychologist since few months. I worked hard on myself, quit smoking weed, find a new appartement with roomates because living alone became too hard for me after the first quarantine. I used to work in a bar so I can't work since march 20. Luckily, in France we get money if we can't work because of Covid so my financial situation is not that bad.   But now, I just can't deal anymore with my unemployment situation, doing nothing everyday, I'm just getting mad at anything, cry because I broke a glass, feel shitty for asking my roomates to clean after themselves, feeling lonely all the time, I'm just literally losing my mind. So I had the idea to travel to South America to visit some friends living there, but I feel it may be egocentric of me to travel during a pandemic, or maybe it's just me trying to dissuade myself from actually moving because depression makes me feel afraid and coward. And moreover, the situation in january is more than uncertain, countries may close their border again.   I don't really see any other issues for me than moving far away, I could still stay in Europe and spend few days alone in another country or in another city of my country but I'm quite afraid of what could happen when I'm feeling too lonely. I have dark thoughts at least once a day and I really don't know how to deal with that anymore. I could take antidepressants but I feel like I just need someone and some activities to feel good, but unfortunately I can't have any of thoses things. Maybe I just should smoke weed again to numb myself until the end of this pandemic.   I'm not sure my words makes a lot of sense to you but idk I needed some advices, I hope you're all going well

Im with you on this one. I've battled with anxiety and depression since my early teens (now 26) I feel like both my depression and anxiety have overtaken who I really am. I'm so scared I'll be like this forever because its been going on for so long it's all I know.  I think they've become a huge part of how my friends and family view me, i'm the 'sad' child in my family who my parents worry about. I spend half my life joking about being depressed and anxious because if I don't laugh i'll cry - it sometimes makes my friends who are lucky enough not to suffer with either awkward around me.   I'm recently in a new relationship and I'm terrified he will leave me because he will realise that I have no personality and I'm not good at anything.  It also directly impacts my job and what few hobbies I had because - I'm no good and I just don't care anymore.
Sadly it does
I’m bipolar so I don’t trust that I know what my personality is. Who’s the real me?

Hi I live in the UK and earlier this week we were put into another lockdown, we have been told it is likely to go on until March.  I'm trying so hard to be positive and take it one day at a time. I've suffered with depression and anxiety since my early teens (now 26), was on anti-depressants for years and came off them in 2019. I don't want to go back on them if possible but I've been so low this past few months and the news this week has really exacerbated that. I struggled during the last two lockdowns and I'm seriously worried I won't make it through the next few months. If I carry on feeling this way I will go to see a doctor, but with the NHS so overwhelmed I don't want to be a burden/I don't know how long it will be until I can be seen. I would love therapy but can't afford it at the moment.  I've been doing all the things I'm supposed to do, eat healthy, exercise, spend time with my family who I am lucky enough to live with. But I'm really struggling, I've stopped caring about everything, my appearance, my job, my hobbies don't make me happy anymore, I can't fall asleep at night and getting up in the morning takes me hours. Even tasks like brushing my teeth and washing my hair are a chore and I really struggle. I miss my friends and my boyfriend so much, and even though I speak to them all the time I feel so alone.  Does anyone please have any tips on how to get through these next few months

I would recommens you to take a break from time to time, spend time alone and pay attention at your feelings. People will never fill the need of love you can give to yourself. Talk to yourself, say the things you need to hear.   And do whatever you want to do, not stuff you have to do. If you can't think anything, pay attention to the cues life gives you, something will catch your interest, follow it. Maybe is a movie, and ad, or a song. I will suggest that you try new stuff.  Finally, have a thing to look forward to. Do something better everyday or learn something.

I'm such a pathetic loser. I'm so lonely that it's literally paralyzing. I can't work because of the lockdown, even after the lockdown ends I'll probably end up broke because all of the jobs that I'm even remotely interested in pay minimum wage or just above it, I basically have no friends left and I'm a hopeless romantic with basically no chance at all of ever getting a partner because of all my disabilities and mental health issues, all of my hobbies are basically social activities that I can't do alone and definitely can't do during a pandemic, I'll never be able to travel to the places I want to travel to, and I I live with cold unsupportive parents who brush me off or ignore me whenever I try to talk about how I feel with them.  I'm done. My life has always been fucked up and always will be. I'm not suicidal but I wouldn't complain too much about getting struck by lightning or something.

So sorry to hear. Have you tried online gaming? Not just video games but maybe video board games? Just to help for a while?
Hey, this isn't your fault. The pandemic is not your fault. The problems caused by the pandemic is not your fault. The minimum wage being too low is not your fault. Wanting to do jobs that others might not like/ gives minimum wage is not your fault. Having physical disablities and mental illnesses arent your fault. There are people who would love you just as you are, the shitty thing is that some don't get to meet them. But that isnt your fault either. Loving social activities is usually a big help in life (social activities though fun at times are always draining for me), so like I said before, this isn't a fault at all, much less your fault. Having cold parents isnt your fault either. And I know how much of a failure it feels like to have no one to talk to, but having no friends is. Not. Your. Fault. So, I can't argue with the fact that your life doesnt sound like a bed of roses but you are not a loser. You are human, with faults and shortcomings I'm sure, but none of the things listed are your fault.   You seem like someone I'd like to talk to. So,, if you dont mind, and only if you dont mind, can we maybe dm?
Hey, man I have been in your state.  It's hard to live life alone. Just like you, even I long for a woman. And it's  hard,  I agree to find someone who'll accept us in spite of our mental state and flaws and shortcomings. But be patient. Try to take baby steps towards fixing larger issues.  If you manage to develop a passion for something,  life will become far more bearable. To talk with parents, you have to wait for the right time to inititate conversation , when they are in a peaceful state of mind.  Because they also have their own share of tensions in life and may be going through depression as well. So, we really shouldn't overexpect from them.  And I agree with the suggestion above,  video board games are a great way to engross yourself temporarily and get a break from reality. The strategy and logic required will also exercise your mind.
I appreciate that, and yeah I'd be happy to dm.

Been lonely for a pretty dang long time and I decided to check out r/love out of sheer curiosity and I must confess I feel bad after doing so. It's like all the positivity I've been building up over the past few months has just vanished. I'm just trying to draw positivity out of the people who can be happy but it's really hard for me to not be jealous.

Hi Cuz,  loneliness and jealousy are an ugly combo. After my first divorce, that was my daily. And I found a few strategies to improve my life.   * a lot of exercise. Exercise is my default stress relief and back then I was windsurfing as much as possible with the occasional mountain bike ride.  * a lot of work. I took on a bunch of big projects that took up evenings and weekends when I wasn't exercising. I basically had zero free time to focus on being lonely * and I read a ton of books from very different perspectives on relationships. I liked Alison Armstrong's work as well as a good starting point * And I did a lot of work on my confidence. Being confident made meeting women much easier and somehow it also removed my loneliness. This *  took time, I don't think I went on a date for over a year after the divorce.   When I did start dating again, I didn't talk much about myself. I was curious about women and spent more time asking open ended questions because I wanted to understand them better.   Best of luck!  Ping me any time :-)
Actually I'm trying to find some kind of hobby or hobbies to occupy me and make me focus on my own situation and myself only. Can't go to work right now so hobbies are my only option. And I would really love to work on my confidence as well but nowadays it's literally not possible. I've been taking a lot of time talking to people generally online and I think it improved my social skills a bit but I still need to put that to practice in real life. Which is actually why I would have loved to do some kind of social hobby... if the pandemic wasn't a thing. Really bad timing, all that.
I'm an only child and so most of my hobbies were things I can do solo. This has helped throughout my life. I bicycle, surf, hike, run, work on project cars, and sometimes build things.  Any of these you can learn - everyone starts as a beginner :-) I also read a lot of different perspectives on relationships and communication.  Good relationships take learning skills and ongoing investment :-)

No, that’s one of the things that makes depression different from just being sad.  Often I’m depressed for absolutely no reason other than a chemical imbalance in my brain.
Honestly, I got depressed over time. So I think a bunch of stressful events adding up leads to it. But something shocking can also lead to depression. For ex, a loved one passing away. I think the answer varies for each person so you can only know if you ask that person or something.
Oh ok. I was just curious. Sometimes I wonder whether i have depression and I guess its easier for me to disregard that very plausible possibility by telling myself its just me being difficult since I dont have a trigger so uk its just me being a big baby
Oh yeah ik that I meant like....  I guess to give an example, there is a point when someone gets cancer right, like the starting point. Does that have to be triggered by something or can someone just suddenly have depression, though it may get worse over time.
Oh, ok! Thank you!
Hmm.  I don’t really know.  I had symptoms for quite a while before I was officially diagnosed, but surely there was a specific starting point even if I don’t know what it was.  But I still maintain that it wasn’t triggered by anything other than a chemical imbalance.

Like for real. Fuck today. Every single person I have talked to seems to also be having a terrible day? My self talk is horrendous, days like today I am so glad people can’t hear my thoughts. Racing thoughts, obsessing over how terrible I am, my brother is incredibly suicidal today and I don’t know how to be there for him. My mom is trying so hard to handle two very unstable siblings (were both adults out of the house). Ugh. I don’t even know the point of this post, but I guess it’s nice to know I’m not alone sometimes? Anyway, hope you all make it through today, I promise I will too.

Thank you for posting. I’m having a really bad depression day and it helps a lot to know that I’m not as alone as I feel. I hope yours and your brother’s day gets better.
It's probably the sociopolitical climate and pandemic. People are pretty stressed out and fed up.
dude same the last two days have sucked i feel really like at a loss with life atm i feel like i’m lacking motivation but thankfully i myself do not struggle with suicidal thoughts. more like just harming myself in the way of like laying in my bed all day and not doing anything good thatll make me feel good bc i just cant get up and out and do anything
Well you are definitely not alone in this. My day is especially bad today bc of anxiety. Let's all get some good sleep today.
today was utter shit for me too
true, im particularly scatter brained. i really hate those episodes, its getting better toward the end. maybe time for me to just write this day off and get some sleep.
I’m glad I could help you know your not alone. I hope you day does too ♥️
Yes that is a great point. I guess I forget how much the state of the world effects my mental health.
Ugh I know that feeling so well. I wish someone would just find a cure for this bs, I’m so sick of depression 😭
I hope it gets better for both of us. Just getting off work now and that’s always when things get worse some how? So I’ll be playing the fun game of “let’s numb until we can’t feel”.
I should probably do the same thing. Good luck to both of us
And how much mental health affects the world. People like to pretend it doesn't or can't identify when they are struggling, but these are unprecedented hard times for people.
Same, actually. Just finished basketball practice and am now looking at 4 hours of nothing.
I’ll probably try to watch something that can help me distract myself. Been watching a lot of older tv, somehow it takes me out of my head a bit and allows me to make fun of it? Anyway hopefully you can find something like that to do.

I am 16, and I have autism. Home life has been extremely hard, my two "adult" cousins, and one's married, her disabled husband has been living here, whole bunch of animals, the house smells deeply of urine, we've made a rule that all the animals are to stay in their bedroom, that exists because some of the animals like to do their business on the carpet and other pieces of cloth, yet they still let the animals out unattended, and whenever I tell my cousin that the animal has peed/shat, she just yells and screams at me, and says to get the other cousin's husband to clean it, she can't be responsible for her own animal, and she's been sleeping in the living room, and set up a firestick tv, she has her own bedroom, and her own bed, where she originally had the tv, she said that she brought it out was to watch wonder woman 1984 on Christmas. Now it's past Christmas, and it's still there. They don't clean up after themselves, they're always complaining about something so small, like the toilet being clogged, or no toilet paper, and there being pee on the seat, it's not that fucking hard to get another roll, and wipe it up, or unclog it yourself. A while back, my mom made a chore list which included cooking and cleaning, the husband was assigned to take out the trash, load the dishwasher, and unload the clean dishes. So simple right? He puts the clean dishes in the wrong place, he "forgets" to check if they're clean or still wet, he load the dishes in incorrectly, like with the bowls, they face straight up instead of down, so the there's water gathering in it, none of the dishes are ever rinsed, the food is just dried to it, he also just throws the plastic ones in with all the others, so then they're disorganized, this is so simple, he also plays halo and knows the controls and everything, but he simply can't put dishes away. Mom removed me from the cooking/cleaning list because I'm still in high school, and autistic, and apparently that gives my cousins the right to talk shit about me, and compare me(16) to her 40 year old disabled husband, and throwing temper tantrums about how unfair it is. Nobody else had to cook when they were my age, no one. And they're always telling me to do this and that, yet they never do that, they tell me to say "You could've said excuse me" when I walk by someone, and they say this in a rude tone, but whenever they walk by, they just shout "MOVE" at  people, so then I tell them that same thing they said to me "Could've said excuse me" but I say it nicely, according to them, apparently I'm being rude, and they're always telling people to mind they're own business, yet they don't, whenever I point out they're bullshit, I get yelled at by them. And the animals, they have a big-ish dog, and the dog pissed and shat in my older brother's room, and again she had the husband go and clean it, but the husband took the dog out on a walk, so my brother had to clean it himself, and my cousin had to buy him a new mattress. The house stinks so much that I started wearing my covid mask inside the house, and they won't do anything about the cat litterbox, they refuse to use baking soda. I don't want to be in the house at all, I'll do anything to get out, to the store, friend's house, even school, anything, just to escape this hell. They're not just assholes to me, but to my mom, my dad, and my older brother. (I am the youngest, and I have 2 brothers, I am referring to the oldest one) I just spend all my time in my room all day doing nothing, and I don't have a drivers license or car or job yet, so even if I wanted to go somewhere I can't, and I have no money. my cousins are always putting their names on things, and the one time I put my name on something, they yelled at me, it's okay for them to put their names on their things, but I can't put my name on my things, WTF. I thought it would be fun to have them here at first, but now it's a complete nightmare. Here a few positive things though: 1: I technically have a GF. 2: her brother is into some of the same things I'm into. 3: I'm going back to school soon (it's positive because it'll get me out of the house for 7 hours)

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ksskhp/im_15_and_dont_want_to_live_with_my_dad_anymore/
My parents have been divorced for 7 years and I go to my mom’s house weekdays, my dad’s weekends.  The main issue I have with my dad is that I simply can’t trust him. I can’t open up to him without him rejecting my opinion. Growing up with him has made me feel helpless, and living with him feels like giving him all the control. He has threatened to take my phone because I said I value emotional relationships more than comfortable living. He threatened to go to court and call the police if I refused to go to his house. I said I wouldn’t mind going for dinner and such, but he outright rejects my opinions. He said it wasn’t my choice, and that just proves my point where I can’t trust him to respect my feelings. He knows I have depression. He says he’s willing to change, but I don’t have the mental capacity to live with him if he doesn’t change by himself.  I live in BC Canada, so the age requirement for choosing who to live with is 19, but I researched about it and it said that the court will mostly decide for the child’s best interest. I’m terrified of the slightest possibility that my dad will win custody. At that point, I might as well kill myself. My dad is a negative influence, a toxic personality. I cut out most toxicity from my life because it’s caused me to be depressed, and it’s why I don’t want to see him again. I’m trying to compromise but I can’t live with him. I just feel upset and terrified right now.

Hi friend- start talking to your school Counselor or your pediatrician and ask for a therapist. If you start documenting the emotional abuse with a professional, a court would never side with him. It will be a slow process, but you will feel empowered because you are doing something about it.

It will get better. You don't need to live with him forever. You can manage those few years even when it's hard. Just try to focus on preparing your life to the moment you will get your own job. When you get a job, you can get your own place, car and whatnot. Everything will change.   I had really bad relationship with my dad. I just remember myself yelling at him so much. We just didn't get along. He died few years ago and even we had our differences, I do miss him now. I have my own kids now and have realised that it is not that easy to understand a child when you are all grown up - and vice versa. I'm trying hard not to repeat the things I encountered when I was young, but still sometimes I do clash with my boys, hard. And that of course alone is pretty depressing. But I think I am discussing more and trying to understand. More than my dad did.      Before you get your job, one way of making things easier is doing something during the weekends. Pick up Disc Golf or some other easy hobby, spend time on the course. Or something else along those lines. Don't worry. It will change, even if you just hang on.
(25F) My parents were never married. My dad had my brother when he was your age, then him and my mom had me when they were 19. My dad married the lady who broke him and my mom up and she hated him for it.  My dad was all sex, drugs, rock and roll and my mom became incredibly religious. It was incredibly hard living with my mom and stepdad because I couldn’t be my true authentic self without getting grounded for months. I would see my dad on weekends and summers and I loved it. He was the fun guy who let me kiss girls and didn’t care who I loved. He supported my art and all of my dreams.  My mom wanted me to be a part of their perfect little Christian family. But I was a rebel and I fought them until I was 19 or 20 about anything and everything. My mom and step dad were abusive in many ways and moved me across the US multiple times against my dad’s wishes. Things were bad. I tried many times in my youth to end my life because of how much I hated them for treating me like I was a monster.  Fast forward to turning 21, communication got better between my mom and we found common ground. I love that woman with all of my heart but it took a very long time for the mending to happen.  My dad basically stopped caring about me once I graduated and he stopped paying child support. I was devastated. The man that I thought loved me the most abandoned me after all that time. I still can’t believe he barely responds to me. Parents are hard. They have a hard time understanding because sometimes they really do just see you as a kid that they have ownership of. That isn’t right. Everyone’s family’s are so very different. I still have hope that one day my dad will let his walls down again but for now, I just have to let him do his thing.  Have you had any conversations with your mom about how your dad makes you feel? Have you had anyone to vent to about how uncomfortable you are when you’re at his house? Do you have a safe place to retreat to when you are with him?  I have so many questions and I truly feel for you. Please just remember that better days really do come and that no one else can live your life. You have power. You are strong. You are wonderful. And you have a voice, never let anyone make you feel like you don’t. You will do great things!!

No idea if this is allowed, but as the title suggests I am looking for someone to create a digital study and support group with. I personally struggle a lot with anxiety and procrastination before exams which contributes greatly to my depression and general dissatisfaction with life. Frequently my university assignments only get done at the very last minute while I trash my sleep schedule and entertain thoughts of self harm. In my experience it can be quite beneficial to have someone to communicate with, someone with whom you can talk about concrete study goals and timelines you want to follow. Someone who keeps you accountable.  Therefore I would like to find someone who is in the same situation, age range (20s) and time zone (CET), maybe similar area of study (biology, medicine, chemistry etc.).  Feel free to leave a comment or ask further questions.

I'm not in sciences but I'd be down to connect with you! I'm a grad student studying international business. My wife is a doctor so I do know the challenges of your programs and how overwhelming it can be!
I'm in my 20s going through this same thing. I'm EST though(-6 hrs) . I'll be honest though, I just looked at the time there and here and reminding you might get me in the mindset to do my assignments earlier.  I don't know why I can't get moving for myself but if someone else  is involved I'm more willing to participate. Let me know.
I usually have the same problems so I think this is a great idea.  I'm 23 and I'm a forensic anthropology student, the only thing is that I'm in EST, but if you don't mind I would be thrilled.
I have sent you a DM.

Disclaimer before I post, I just wanted to acknowledge how fortunate and lucky I am to have a roof over my head, and I realize there are those that don’t.   Wife I (and our 2 year old) sold our 1260sqft starter home (1950 1.5 story located in the neighborhood I grew up) of 6 years and purchased a 2000 sqft (1993 cabover)  The starter was a total flip job, it looked amazing when we moved in (and still does to the untrained eye), but very quickly we had a myriad of issues, most namely it was freezing in all but the kitchen and living room and we spent lots of time in the family room which was frigid (live in Canadian prairies). Most notably, there was a rodent problem every couple years culminating in the worst infestation last Winter, it drove me out of my mind as I was finding a dead one every couple days. Also burst pipes, and hatchet work behind the nice walls and floors. We managed to sell it for a nice profit in July and stayed with her parents til December when we got possession of new house three weeks ago.  Basically the new house has been a nightmare for me, it’s foundationally sound (albeit a minor slope) but extremely dated, weird main floor layout and needs LOTS of touching up, it is absolutely overwhelming and I miss so much from my old house, the brightness, the aesthetic, my huge back yard and garage that I built. But namely my old hood where I thought my daughter would grow up. If I could pick up this house and move it 5 minute drive north I would feel better, but that’s not an option.  This new house seems like a bigger cheaper, more depressing version of our charming yet cursed flip job. I have lost my routine, stopped doing everything that made me happy, eating less, sleeping more and having to be asked if I’m showering. Simply cause I’m so overwhelmed I cannot stop spinning my tires. This house seems grimy, dingy no matter how much I do and I feel I will never get it to how I want. I even ripped out the floor of daughters room cause of the old grungy carpet and replaced with laminate. I just can’t feel comfortable or settled and miss every inch of our old property. My wife is totally done with me and I see how it’s affecting her, I am looking for counseling but it’s really hard with a total COVID lockdown in my city.   I can’t stop thinking of how much better my old home was than this place, and my poor wife, I have completely ruined this move for her and made this new house a completely unhappy place. This is my biggest regret of my life.  Anyways, the grass is not always greener on the other side, I’d take my mouse infested freezer back if I only could.

So... Like I said I've been putting it off for a while now but hey what could be worse than today.  So I am in my late teens and for the longest time I think from 3rd or so grade I've been quite numb for emotions. Being bullied from 1st grade to today also didn't have a good toll on me.  My grades worsened just like my laziness grew and right now I failed at least half of my classes which I am not proud of, but I could pull it off to at least a decent enough grade to allow me to bounce from class to class. Barely.  But besides that, I have found the help that I so desperately wanted, and well it doesn't help as much as I'd like to since it just seems like too much effort. My body dysmorphia worsened as well so that's fun. and as Of late, I found out that I quite literally can't recognize what kind of emotion I am feeling besides the occasional humor from some old vines from YouTube and stuff like that or that rush of frustration at yourself causing me to often -  (Warning to those sensitive please beware that from this point forward there will be a discussion of stuff like self-h*rm and su*cidal thoughts. I don't want any of you guys to relive any bad moments)  - result in shallow cuts on my arms or shoulder though the latter is a lot rarer and although they are shallow enough to heal quickly they still bleed and scar my arms. Sometimes I bang my head on the wall, sometimes just my hand resulting in bruises and dizziness and sometimes I'll even just...punch myself when I feel like an ungrateful idiot. I started to cry a lot more. And I never cried like that, even when in 1st grade I got a nail stuck in my foot or 2nd grade when j relocated my wrist and have a bad break(there were only stressed tears then I went numb). But today? I got called out for being a part of the LGBTQ+ community and of course, because I am the 'weaker' sex (biologically female not yet out like that), and why? Because in their eyes I'm just "an ugly, salty feminist" but I mean I already live in Poland so that's not very surprising.  Returning to my point it's just as if I was a glass of coke. The emotions kept bubbling and bubbling to the top waiting to be spilled but then they stopped (let's say that's where I was being completely/partially numb) and the cycle repeated itself till the glass was full and it started spilling I started crying having a tantrum, screaming internally for help but on the outside, there were only tears and pathetic sobs coming out of my mouth.   If you'd like any clarification go ahead and ask me questions although Idk if anybody will be that invested in it. Thank you for listening to my ted talk. Have a good night/day.  Edit: My dumbass forgot the whole point of this. Feeling numb, can't understand emotions as well as I'd like to, and constantly feel like school and social interactions(not all some of them are nice if it's not bullying and shit like that) completely drain me physically and emotionally

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ksn2oc/feeling_the_urge_to_cut/
So, this new year I had only one resolution: to try to stop cutting, at least for 6 months. I'm not doing this for myself, I personally don't see why I should stop, but for my best friend, who ironically doesn't even know I cut regularly, but last time I was in a very bad place I told her I had cut myself quite deep and she begged me to stop, so here I am. I'm planning on trying my absolute hardest to get to 6 months to tell her and make her proud, but even just now, barely 8 days clean, I'm feeling the urge to start again. I tried having a rubberband around my wrist and flicking it whenever I feel the urge arise to keep it at bay, but it's only barely working. I haven't been clean for more than three weeks once in the last 5 years, so this is kind of a big step for me, hopefully on the path of recovery.  Wish me luck, any tips on how to resist are appreciated.

I don’t cut so idk the effectiveness of my advice but whenever I feel destructive I change my hair cut/dye. It takes back control. Or I just start scribbling on whatever till the destruction subsides
That's awesome you are trying so hard. Maybe you could tell your friend how much of a struggle this is for you, and it could give you someone to call when the urge gets to be too much.   Also, don't think on terms of 6 months! That's too much for anyone to aim for when they are trying to change their lives. Aim for a day at a time. Don't think ahead to June. Think about tonight. If you can make it until tonight, then tomorrow morning is your next goal. Every day, or even every hour, is an accomplishment. 8 days is incredible. Be proud of yourself every step of this journey.
Occupy your hands. I have a fidget cube and it helps a lot. Clench your hands as hard as you can for as long as you can. Sit on your hands until they're numb. Even punching something is better than cutting.
I tried writing in the past and it only sort of helps, I usually don't know what to write which also doesn't help, but when I end up writing I'm absolutely terrified of people reading what I wrote because it's either cringy or generally sounds weird or it's depressing stuff like suicide letters and I don't want anyone finding out I desire the long sleep for real.  For the hair thing that might work but I used to cut basically every day, every other day on good weeks, and I don't think I can change my hair that often.  Nonetheless thank you very much for your advice.
Thank you so much.  I'm not sure about telling her because I don't want to be a burden, she already worries about me very much, and I don't want to put additional weight on her, also as I said she doesn't know I used to cut quite a lot, I have only told her about two rough periods I had.  I will follow your day to day advice, six months is quite big of a goal, and when (or, being very hopeful, if) I would fail I already know I'd take it badly.  Thank you very much for the advice.
I will try that, tank you for the advice
I will literally just start circling with a pen. Don’t write words. Do a repetitive pattern on paper, skin, clothes etc with a pen crayon etc
I completely understand not wanting to put your struggle on anyone else's shoulders, but this friend sounds very important to you. She worries and cares about you. I'm sure she would rather help you carry this burden than have you try to handle it on your own.   It might be as simple as face timing for 10 minutes when you're feeling down, or having a spontaneous movie night when it's been a particularly hard day. Those are things friends tend to do anyway.
I started drawing with a red marker on my skin because I had found people recommending it on the internet, and it sort of helps
I see, thank you very much

i need help because i am ready to kill myself.  I’m going to try & type this because maybe when I’m done I won’t try to take my life. maybe I’ll see a light or some hope but right now I am done with myself & I have fully given up hope.  (I’m also very aware that my situation could be worse & others have it worse, but I’m done fighting my battle& want to start to try & ask for help here)  I’ve been fighting voices in my head since I was 12. Depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, self harm, substance abuse, trauma, & self hatred have genuinely filled every day of my life since my 6th grade year. That winter when I was 12 was the first time I wanted to kill myself but was too young to know what depression was. All I knew at 12 & in that moment was that I didn’t want to be here anymore.   8 years & many, many, many mistakes later & I cannot do this anymore. I can’t keep disappointing people time & time again. I can’t keep telling myself that my trying to become better is working. Because at the end of the day it kills me inside that the people I’ve hurt have still not given up on me, but I have given up on myself.   I’ve been thinking a lot lately & we all are so insignificant & small in this life. In this world. There are things I can’t understand or grasp like how big space is, how vast the oceans are, or how the butterfly effect impacts us all but I understand this: everyone has their life path & some people live a comfortable life, some end up homeless, some fulfill their dream job aspirations, & some people just don’t care about much.  but I don’t think my story has much more time. I think sometimes you lose in life. I’m losing to my mental health battles & my mind is winning as far as the game of self hatred goes. I don’t like asking for help. going to counseling in the past has been A- the counselor telling me this is apart of life or B- me trying to convince a counselor I’m fine...because I’m an idiot & I wish I could find someone who helps, but most of all I am tired of disappointing & trying to improve myself while hurting others.  As a child I had so many dreams & my parents thought I would be amazing throughout my life. But some people just lose, & I’m losing to my mind & this battle that I cannot continue.   I’ve never posted on here before & don’t know exactly what I’m hoping for but I’m at a point I don’t think I have ever felt. I’ve attempted suicide 3 times in 2020, 5 times in the last 3 years, & should have died in two separate car accidents in 2020. I am now asking why...why & how did i not die in those accidents, because I wish that over how I am feeling now.   I thought I was getting better.   But that’s all, it’s a lot & I don’t know what this will do but I feel a small weight taken off now with admitting this to a bunch of random people on the internet! because I never ask for fucking help..who would if they didn’t care what happened To themselves at the end of the day

You are not alone. The fact that you pushed yourself to write all of this out is STRENGTH.    I've ALWAYS been horrible at asking for help... It often times makes me feel defenseless... in fear of what the response will be... to appear weak...   ITS OKAY TO NOT BE OKAY  I promise. Put your hand over that beating heart of yours. You feel that? YOU MATTER.   Close your eyes and open them. You SEE that? You're still here.   You mean more to people than you will ever realize. I know how hard it is to find something "worth all of this" but... deep breath in... exhale out... There isn't anything that you can't do for yourself. Writing this alone is proof. I BELIEVE IN YOU!  \-K
If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

First of all, please follow the advice given by contacting the Suicide Hotline.   If you want to also hear more than just that, your post seemed to almost immediately click with me and I will tell you why:  The way that I was able to steer myself from doing something irreversible was my telling myself the things that you already mentioned (also with the help of medication, therapy and TMS).  You are right.  We are small.  We are insignificant.  Most importantly, "we" don't matter in the grand scheme of things.  The light bulb went on for me when I realized that those facts are actually the most liberating things in the world.  The reason why?  Because those things that are bringing you down are also meaningless and insignificant. That means that they have no real power over you.  All of it is just perspective.  Know what else?  Every single second that you are alive is a big "screw you" to the cosmos.  Just by being here to type this post, you are a survivor.  You've beaten astronomical odds already.  That means that you are stronger than you think.  The depression is an evil that is trying to cloud those facts from you.  Don't let it beat you, nothing else has been able to yet.  I know this because here you are.  Seek professional help.  There are people out there that care.  I care and I don't even know you.  The reasons for your depression are unique to you, but the depression itself is not.  There are MILLIONS of us that have suffered with you.  There are MILLIONS that are still suffering with you.  We are here because we continue to be survivors. We are here to listen to you.  People want to help you.  I am living breathing proof that there is eventually a light at the end of the tunnel.  You just have to find the best train to get you there and that's what the professionals are for.    Resist the urge to do something final even for 1 second. That is a victory.  As is the second after that and the second after that.  You are beating it every single second.    Worry about NOTHING else but getting yourself to the point that you are "better."  Your mental health is your number 1 priority.    I'm cutting this short because I want you to contact a professional IMMEDIATELY.  Stop reading now and do it.
thank you so much for this..
I never thought someone would reply or care so genuinely thank you so much
i wanted to say thank you. I’ve had such shit luck with counseling & reaching out but maybe this last time? Maybe things will work out..I hate sounding so desperate but fuck i am at this point. thank you again so much.
You are more than welcome. There are good people out there. And you are one of them.    You may have been dealt some bad cards... but writing that alone shows that you want to positively move forward.    And that my friend... is a great step towards getting help, growing, and learning that      whatever you are going through in this moment.... It does not last forever. Feel free to stay in touch <3  \-K
You are welcome. It is never a last time. That's not what a survivor says and we've already determined that you are a survivor. So, if that counseling doesn't work, you're going to try another, and another after that if that one doesn't work. This is a battle we have to fight every single day. Are you taking medications?  I was Mr. Anti-Medicine and then my depression got so bad, it was either take it or do something stupid and we know that survivors do whatever they have to to survive. And know what?  The first few didn't work for me.  The therapy didn't work at first for me, either.  It got so bad for me that they recommended TMS therapy for me.  Google it, I thought it was an absolute scam, but I just did it to shut up people that were doing to me what I'm doing to you. That didn't work at first either and then when I was about to quit, it did. It was a literal miracle to me.  I don't say this to get you try TMS, I know it isn't for everyone, but I say it to show you that you keep going and going and going until you find "it." There is something out there that will work for you. I look at my wife and my kids today and I can't even imagine what their lives would be like without me here today. And I'll stop you before you even think that you don't have anyone, you do even if you haven't met them yet. These things play out when they are supposed to.  KEEP FIGHTING, YOU ARE A SURVIVOR!

Anyone out there for some mental support?  I've been in steady decline for the past few months, with study and job troubles, strains in my relationship ever since we moved in together, my future. These past few weeks I have added sleeping issues (I've been trying to sleep for the past 4 hours, no succes) and hate of my own body in various degrees.  Started crying an hour ago and haven't really stopped. Actually punched myself out of frustration and it only made me feel worse. Every little thing and sound is annoying me right now and I feel like a void. Something just snapped today.  No that anyone has to answer, somehow I sort of hope that typing it out will help at least...

Just as a disclaimer: I am not a doctor/expert on the subject, and these may not be original to you. But I wish someone had told me these tips to being happier a long time ago so that I could be further in my development of these skills!  1. Turn off the device -It would be way too easy to just say these words and expect happiness to flow into your life. But this is definitely a good step. Once again I’m not claiming to be a perfect person, I don’t follow the advice being shared every second of the day. However, putting this tip into practice has drastically changed the direction of my mood on a day-to-day basis. I don’t just mean put the phone on silent. I mean delete social media (if you constantly check it which let’s be honest with ourselves we all do), delete time wasters (biased news sources, games, puzzles, etc.), and one of the most important factors of this step, turn off the notifications and sounds. When I first started breaking the addiction I had to my device, I noticed that every little buzz or flash of the screen would cause an instant reaction towards picking it up. To avoid this I put all alerts on silent with no vibrations, and try to be mindful of not instantly reacting to a message. Part of the importance of doing these things relates to the ways we try to gain approval from our peers. It has been historically hard for me to find happiness on social media specifically because I’m constantly chasing a validation that A. Doesn’t exist, and            B. Everyone else is just chasing too. You’ll find that a couple days, weeks, months into detoxing from technology that you will just stop thinking about your “oh-so-important” follower ratio or who’s gossiping about who. It’s not conducive for maintaining happiness. (I do understand however that social media isn’t all evil and is a good outlet for creativity and social interaction which is also important for happiness).  2. Learn a Martial Art/Exercise -While exercise in general has scientifically shown to improve mood and boost energy, why mention the importance of a martial art? The key factor that  practicing a combat art plays in happiness is overcoming feelings of self-consciousness or self doubt. Once I got over the initial fear and frustration of starting something new, I noticed almost immediately a change in the way I walked, felt, and interacted with others. This step even helped me care less about what others thought, because I had become more sure of myself.  It can be counterproductive and just generally harder to participate in these activities if your diet doesn’t consist of the nutrients your body needs to have energy, so consider doing some research on healthy energy-rich alternatives that you may not have even considered. The more you implement these healthy exercise and eating habits into your life, the more confident and healthy you are likely to feel, further boosting your mood.  3. Be kind to others -Especially if you start to develop skills in a martial art, this step becomes increasingly valuable as you go through daily life. Being kind and open-minded towards others will automatically make you a desirable person to be around, and the interactions you have will generally be more pleasant all around. Radiating a positive attitude can give you a social advantage in endless ways, maybe even a work opportunity that was denied to a less positive thinker. Even when many others won’t follow this advice, the cliche “cooler heads prevail” is cliche for good reason. People want to be around the kind individual that’s going to look for solutions and can calmly/kindly do so.  4. Build a Meditation/Yoga practice -This isn’t necessarily an intense practice that you hear about with many self-help “gurus”. This can simply mean 15 minutes of mindful breathing in the morning, even less depending on your experience. The point is to start consistently adding things into your life that will continue to improve your lifestyle, further closing in on that desired mood level. Mindful breathing right away in the morning is a much more productive start than jumping on Twitter to see who is having what for breakfast. Spend some time with your eyes closed and preferably no music/sounds. Think about your day and the ways you intend to make it a good one. Know that there are almost guaranteed speed bumps that you’ll encounter, but that’s all just a part of the experience. Don’t let it completely shift your mood, acknowledge it, and move on. While you do this, it’s never a bad idea to start short sessions (again based on your experience) of yoga or some other form of stretching, also assuming you are following step #2 which just increases the need for recovery stretching. Yoga has personally been the best method for me to recover and gain more mobility in my fitness ventures. There are countless videos on YouTube for all levels and experience.  5. Don’t take life too seriously -Whether you’re religious, atheist, or what the west think of as spiritual, life is just a game at the end of the day. We’re all here without a guarenteed purpose, and we don’t know how long we’re here. Becoming friendly with the hard parts of life really helps to manage the weight of it. You are guarenteed to face pain and you should absolutely feel it, without struggle you should really let yourself feel whatever emotions arise. But at the same time don’t let the pain make you think that you always have to feel that way, or that pain is really what you’re feeling. Try to avoid jumping to conclusions and letting old perceptions dictate clear thinking.  Therapy is something that many people would benefit from as well, even though it may be stigmatized a bit in our society. But it can be a great and healthy way to deal with traumas and natural fears associated with life. Life is a really beautiful thing and your mindset can change your future in an instant. Perspective is key and don’t be afraid to love the people in your life intensely!

It's been days I feel like I am on auto pilot. I am mostly dissociated through out the whole day. No one has any clue that I am so fucking empty inside and planning a suicide to runaway from it. But even though I wanna dissapear, I am having second thoughts. It's like, if I could dissapear without dying, I would have done that. If I could just cease to exist, I wish there was a way out of my mundane life which will not hurt my mom. I don't wanna hurt her. Well, even though dad and I don't get along very much but I don't wanna hurt him either. I wish I could still be there for my bestie and not exist at the same time. I am scared to hurt these 3 people in my life. Others can move on but these 3 people can not. I wish they would magically forget about me and the fact that I ever existed. I can't go on. I feel suffocated. I need a way out and dying is the only way out I can opt for.

Hello! I am currently 28, and I have been depressed since I can remember. My first suicidal thoughts came when I was around 6 or 7, when I attempted to walk out onto the highway in front of a semi, before my grandparents found the note and came out after me. That wouldn’t be the last time.   I live with depression by keeping things and people around me that need me. I have a special needs pet that needs attention and a job where someone would come looking for me within hours of me not showing up. I also talk about it often to those around me so they can know when I’m having a depressive episode (mine tends to come in waves).  Having goals that are obtainable (sometimes oversupplied just so I can “win”) are a way I cope as well. On the worst times- eat something green three times a week, brush your teeth today or put on makeup and walk to the mail box.   I’ll be honest I don’t escape it. Every time I think I’m ok, I get sucked back down. I have a councilor (I have been to around 5 before finding one that could handle me) and used to take medications (but I can’t with my current job as they make my brain too slow in my opinion). It did however get a tiny bit better when my brain stopped developing around age 25.   Know that just being successful, moving, starting over, are just pieces of a depression puzzle that will not magically solve things- but they can help. I say that as my own experiences. Hope any of that ramble is helpful
Mine is episodic. Had one major one back in high school, then the most recent and worst one yet 10 years later.      Major Depressive Disorder is that way I've been told. Once every few years it comes around and ruins your entire year.  There isnt much I can do about that type of depression other than ride it out untill my brain manages to get back to equilibrium.   I guess I've dealt with alot of situational depression in the years between the two major episodes and that is more a matter of figuring out what's lacking in my life, having something to work towards and trying to put one foot in front of the other.      That's the thing with situational depression, it's often appropriate for the given life circumstance.    In a toxic relationship and feel depressed? Get out.    Got no job and sit around all day feeling depressed? Get a job.    Job sucks the life out of you? Change jobs.   Dont know what to do in life and play video games all day and feel depressed? Get outside.   Okay that's all easier said than done and alot of it can be overwhelming when you're all ready grinding on the axle. But as far as I've managed to realise, alot of situational depression is a lack of something or somethings. Purpose, goals, friendship, safety, intimate relationships etc. It's a matter of identifying what bogs you down in life and finding out what gives you a way forward, even if it's barely anything to go on. A therapist can help you with that. Alot of depression doesnt respond well to anti depressants because it often isnt clinical depression, merely a life lacking and too complicated for it's own good.
Hi! I am 24 years old. I'm sorry that you have experienced depression for such along time. we all need to be loved and you have always been and are worth it.   you are doing well by being proactive to defeat your depression. having a support system is such a vital strategy for overcoming it. expressing your self is paramount! you are not alone, do not bottle up your thoughts and feelings, do not fight it alone!  having goals is such a great way of being productive. i have started running in a park and working on my lap time is helping me to focus on something else besides depressive thoughts and feelings.   i understand what you mean by not escaping it. that's what i fear most. I'm glad that you are seeking professional help. your experience of feeling better after 25 years is actually really interesting! fingers crossed.   your ramble is relatable and valuable. you are right, the puzzle pieces of depression. your life is a gift to the world! you are capable of going the distance! I believe in you! don't fight it on your own. you deserve to be heard and understood. your life is a beautiful adventure filled with success, happiness, and challenges. Never, ever give up.   thanks for your advice!
I'm sorry that you have experienced depressive episodes in your life. your description and analysis is insightful. I can relate to feelings of depression because of life circumstance. the longer that I experience depression, the more that it becomes a way of living. its a terrible cycle. recognizing the causes and being proactive is paramount. we have to work hard to overcome depressive thoughts and feelings.   your life is a gift! share it! you deserve better because you are worth it. express your self, dont fight it alone. you are capable of going the distance. never, ever give up! your life is a beautiful adventure! climb your mountain.    thanks for your advice!
Well it's not fun. A bad situational depression is pretty bad all on it's own, major depressive episode is all that dialed up to 10. The worst part is that you cant do anything about it. You cant make yourself feel better, your brain just doesnt respond to any stimuli like you're used to. You just have to wait it out and hope that you reach remission and stay there. And that can take a whole year.    A word of advice though. Untreated situational depression can potentially go on to develop into Major Depressive Disorder (depending on a number of factors like genetics, upbringing, personality etc) so if you have been struggling for a while, even if it's just mild, it's worth taking a trip to a psychiatrist and maybe see what can and what cant be done about it.  Even if you're not in any risk group, it's unecessary to carry around burdensome baggage. Be it some shit that happened in school 10 years ago, some girl/boy that broke your heart or that you just dont know what to do in life. You're entitled to live a worthwile life. If people go to the psychiatrist because their cat died, you're allowed to go because life isnt quite working out for you right now.     Might not even be that you need therapy, just somebody to talk to.

My ex boyfriend broke up with 4 days ago and my heart feel so broken. He told he didn’t love me anymore & didn’t want to put full effort in the relationship. I feel like I can’t do anything now. I can’t eat. I can’t sleep. I miss him so much. How can I get better? What can I do to help me cope? And I might see him soon , what should I do?

First of all, fuck. I'm sorry. Breakups suck.  This might help you or it might not, but what worked for me was sort of disassociating (to a certain degree I know this is bad, but it worked) from the scenario at hand to look at it, completely objectively, as an outsider looking in on what this person in front of me (me) is feeling. I was still very down, but in the end it really helped get through the first 2 weeks. The whole crux of this situation is moving forward, at whichever pace, and then looking into yourself and acknowledging that you are making progress and that you aren't wallowing in a self-made limbo.  My mom also told me that the state of your heart is in your control. So it's okay that its broken now, but at some stage you have to remember that it's not gonna reassemble itself, and you shouldn't rely or hope that someone else will glue you back together. Only you have the power to do that, you set the terms, you set the pace, you decide how, piece by piece, you make yourself whole.   Good luck!

I tried everything at home at this point. Quarantine gave me enough time to do all sorts of things alone at home and I can tell now that there is nothing that makes me happy. I want to give certain social things a try but that is literally not possible nowadays. I have no idea how I should get out of this depressed state if nothing I can do makes me feel remotely good

What hobbies have you tried?  For social interaction, have you tried looking for a pen pal? They are mostly online these days, but it's still "meeting" new people.   I've seen a lot of apps that let you have online parties where your friends could invite new people for you to chat with.   I know it's not the same as seeing people face to face, but it would be something in the meantime.
If you have a computer, try making mini movies in Da Vinci Resolve or editing pictures in GIMP. It's really relaxing to sit down and just be creative.
I LOVE Adult coloring books... and MUSIC!   I make it a goal to find new songs... artists etc.   Also looking up lyrics to my favorite songs as they play (For some reason I love it!)  Reading self help books (only when I feel like it)  I've taken free online courses of topics I'm interested in as well  Simply going for a walk & downloading an exercise app has helped me Aton.   Watching comedy skits help lighten my mood.  Re organizing folders, pictures, etc. on my computer.   & Breathe. Take one day at a time.   You will not feel this way forever my friend  \-K
I'm socially interacting with online people enough already. As cool as it is to socialize online, I genuinely need some real in person contact.  >What hobbies have you tried?  Drawing, writing, cooking, working out, meditation, heck even knitting. Nothing sticks to me. Feels more like a burden than a hobby to me. Might be my perfectionist self who also absolutely hates how much I suck at basically everything I try. If it involved other people who probably suck just as much or give me kind support like "We all start somewhere" then I actually just might enjoying the things I'm bad at. But not while I'm alone.
I'd rather do anything that is not tied to a computer, honestly
I know so much is out of our control right now, but omg, the world is going to need so much help after this virus is taken care of. The mental health of so many people is really suffering. A lot of people feel like you. Isolation is so bad for us.
I would run then. Or join a book club if COVID is on the decline in your area. I personally really enjoy running. It gives you something to do that lets you think a lot but still he active; because of the endorphines exercise releases, it's also easier to think happy thoughts.
Hm it's nice knowing that I'm not the only one suffering so much during these times. There were times I would have loved to get the opportunity to just play video games the whole day and I'm sure if I was younger right now I'd totally celebrate quarantine. But my mental health worries just had to wake up around when the pandemic happened... Or maybe the pandemic made me realize those things? Not sure if I should be grateful for something that literally costs human lives
Humans are meant to be social creatures. I know spreading this virus, and potentially dying from it is worse, but this isolation is hurting everyone. We need people in our daily lives. We need physical contact.   What video games do you play?  I'm sure the pandemic either intensified or just shed light on existing problems. It really sucks.
I absolutely agree with you. And well I'm currently playing Warframe for the most part and a bit of World of Warcraft with a buddy but I'm not looking for any more people to play with. If that's what you were on about, sorry
Oh, no, just curious. That's nice it's a social game. It's not everything you need right now, but definitely a better outlet than nothing

Ive hit rock bottom twice  I’ve come back twice  For sure there was a time where I felt like you but I did it and I did it diy You can do this  Honestly I know it looks like no way, but there is a way  See it a journey to get back to happiness  It took me 6 years but that was because I was doing it by myself and the journey was fun.

It takes courage to speak hard truths.  And you are still here, the only way to go is up. Please don't go, I'm sure something good will come your way. 🤍
.
God I feel that. If you want to talk about it sometime, I'm on discord and a big fan of taking notes towards progress.
Not sure if this helps... but I have a gratitude journal... every day I write 3 things I’m grateful for...
Hi Maagy,  sometimes life gives us challenges beyond what we had imagined.   I've had a few and so far made it through all of them.    Every time I used a similar process.  * admitted that it sucked. Then I cried a lot - repeatedly.  * accepted that it was what it was. I couldn't change it. Cried a bit more.  * went looking for help. I read books, talked with therapists, took courses, read more books. I also got new friends.  * I learned a ton. I've learned communication, confidence, inquiry, problem solving, outward focus, and how to be a good partner. I cried a bit more.  * every time this happened, I gained more confidence.   I recently learned that there's some science behind this process - it's not just my personal solution. This isn't easy but it does work very well.   Feel free to ping me :-)

I was doing really well this weekend and early in the week but with yesterday’s events I feel like it’s sunk back into a depression and now I can’t even be happy for her on her birthday and I feel like a bad son. I just want to feel happy again and celebrate with her on her special day but I can’t and I feel like a shitty person because of it. I can’t stop having crying spells today and I don’t know why.

Does she know about your struggles? Most parents care more about their children's happiness than their own birthday. I doubt she would want you feeling bad about this. You clearly love her to let this bother you the way it is. It's ok to take this time for yourself, and celebrate with her later.
i am sorry that you are going thru this.  it is ok to try to do something.  its the thought that counts.  small things, simple things mean alot too.  think of something like just spend time.  hold her hand.  smile at her.  she will be happy that you are with her.  i am a mother of 3.  i highly enjoy the presence of my kids and what they say and do.  give it a try.
She does and is very supportive of me as she suffers from this as well at times. I just don’t like not being able to celebrate her birthday with her as “myself” if that makes any sense. I feel like depression robs me of my true self and that’s one of the main things that makes me sad.
That makes perfect sense. The cruelest part of depression is that robs you of these moments. Even if you can go through the motions, it's not the same.   I'm glad she's understanding, although I'm sorry it's because she also suffers in similar ways.

How are you feeling? Do you feel like you're going to hurt yourself or anyone else?
I struggle with suicidal ideation and self harm. Been “clean” for years but a trauma triggered it pretty badly again
Do you feel like you'll act on these feelings soon? Then go to the hospital. Your life is worth it.
Thank you.

First time posting here so have mercy on my clueless ass.  18 here. Male I guess. Am in school still.  So, I am feeling terrible and have been venting and getting advice from friends and my gf for years. Recently, however, they've become less and less responsive. I do not blame them in the slightest as dealing with me would be insufferable since I don't shut up about how worthless etc I am, so I tried to get a therapist but that's taking it's time so now my life has gotten to the stage of posting on Reddit for help because I legitimately don't know how to survive the time between now and then when existing it getting harder and harder and I have very important school work due within that time period. Oh and I don't talk to my parents about it because I don't want to because teen angst I guess.  Sorry if I'm not using this sub correctly, I'm freaking out and this is my way of doing something about it.

First of all, way to go seeking professional help! That is not an easy step to take even admitting that you need it. This sort of help should be more readily available, and affordable. You're not alone in needing the help.  Have you tried talking to your teachers about how you feel? I'm not saying you need to tell everyone, but if you have an understanding teacher, they might be flexible with due dates while you sort things out. Since you're 18, they should be able to keep things between you, not involving your parents.  If that's not possible, try making a to do list working backwards. Take small steps to get things done. BUT remember that you are more important than anything else. Take a day for yourself. Pace yourself. Allow yourself to get the lower grade if it means getting the rest you need.
I've been talking to my teachers. They have been very merciful but have basically said that I won't be getting any more extensions on assignments etc. I've spoken to them about my problems and that's what got me to go seek proper help, 1 of my teachers being seriously worried about me for a number of reasons. I don't think I can afford a lower grade and I don't have any motivation to improve.  I don't think  I can take a day for myself. I've done nothing this whole time. Supremely unproductive. I did at home, write for fun and play video games.  Nothing makes me happy anymore and all my brain is telling me to do is get other people to fix me. Right now, I just want to talk to someone.

I feel like such a goddamn outcast. I’m, from an outside view, a 22 year old taxpayer with a full time job, car, and somewhat of a social life. But I feel increasingly like I’m not. I feel so damn childish all the time because I can’t seem to nail down basic concepts and functions. I’m already at the point now where I’m debating, leaning on doing, alienating myself from my friends because they have their shit together, I don’t. Why can’t I just grow a backbone and be a normal, contributing member of society, without having to join the military or police or some other type of shit?

Hey Polish,  you've got a ton of life ahead of you.   When I was 22, I was still in college, renting a tiny apartment, and generally alone. My tax paying was nominal. I bicycled everywhere.   I had a bunch of stuff to learn. It sounds like you do also.   This stuff is all completely learnable. My parents and schools didn't teach me so I looked for people who could. I learned to be interested, helpful, curious, and confident. I learned to take tiny risks - lots of tiny risks.   Recently I also took up BJJ which I can't recommend enough as a builder of courage. Find a school and start rolling.   In a lot of ways, the things I sought were rites of passage. Challenges that would prove to myself that I was worthy of being an adult and a man. We've lost something in our urbanization.   These are all things you can do. I've learned that spines are earned and never stop being earned.    You have to start with tiny risks. This is the key. Start tiny, trust the process.   You got this.   Ping me any time :-)
You’ve got a backbone imo, just getting out of bed and going to you’re job when you’ve become your own enemy takes a ton of courage. Keep at er, I’m proud of ya  Secondly, (and I’m extremely guilty of this, so please don’t think the irony isn’t lost on me, haha), but I hope you try and not compare yourself to others around. We all move through life at a different pace; there is no right or wrong way when it comes to the time it takes. Hell, I’m 31 and am only now getting parts of my life in order.   My pops always said that it’s expensive trying to keep up with the Joneses, and I feel that fits when comparing ourselves to others; It’s fucking mentally taxing always comparing ourselves to our friends, family etc. So much that it can fog up the truth at times. I feel like this may be one of those times because the way I see it, you’ve a backbone and help contribute to society more so than you may think
What exactly do you mean by normal? I mean you have everything that is expected of you to have to be a normal member of society but you feel like something is missing. Maybe it's because those things aren't the things you actually want? Or what exactly is not normal in your eyes? You see the society puts on false ideals and priorities in people's minds and any deviation from it is considered not normal, but here's the truth, there's no such thing as "normal". I'm sorry if it feels like I'm clinging to that word, that's because I am. I'm 28 now and I went a very long way to truly understand that what I just said. You're free to live your life however you want it, there are no rules (well except law ofc) and no requirements whatsoever. Feeling childish you say, what exactly do you mean? Any psychologist would tell you there are 3 types of personalities that reside in every person: inner adult, inner child and inner parent and depending on the life circumstances one dominates. So feeling childish is completely normal or I'd rather use the word common. If you feel like shutting out from your friends then maybe they're not the right people for you right now. And having their shit together doesn't mean they do not feel what you feel.
I can't think of anything right to say but  I'm the same way with the people I have in my life. It's fine if you have unstable friends but try to make friends that seem stable and can help you
Everyone walks through life differently. When my wife was 25 she was a doctor, when I was 25 I was unemployed, in debt and with no education. Its impossible not to compare yourself to others, and its hard to see everyone around you realizing their dreams, but their path is not your path. I love to say do what makes you happy but that obviously doesn't apply to people in our position. So instead, just try to be okay. Make short term goals that have a real positive affect on your life. Thats how I started to turn my life around, I sought out to get a degree... I started small and went to community College. When I obtained my associates, I realized I could keep going and that I was more capable than I thought.   And unless your friends tell you that you are bringing them down, you are probably not. I'm sure they dont want to lose you as a friend, ignore those thoughts.
Start tiny, trust the process. Awesome!
This is helpful :)
My friends are stable, I just feel like I’m bringing them down
Thank you :-)  What are you working on?
thank you :-)  what are you working on?
If you feel like you are talk to them ask them. "Am I bringing you down" And if that works and if you have further questions about how to go from there I can help you with that anytime. I'm on Reddit everyday and I respond to everyone
Not much. Just trying to get a routine and build discipline.
That's a good start.   We all start as beginners.   And as we advance our skills, we are always finding places where we are beginners again.   Enjoy!!

So first time posting and not sure I'm on the correct subreddit for my question but here goes. I have battled depression for a long time now and feel like I usually have a good handle on it. Doctors found a mass in my mother in law's liver. Her sister passed away from cancer last year so this caused my mother in law to go into a pretty bad depressive state. For the last few weeks my wife has been going over to her mom's daily to help her out. Most of it is helping her get through this episode and hopefully come out of it ok. I understand what she is going through and am ok with her helping her mom. The problem I'm having is that she is the only real support system I have and she has not been here the last couple of bad days I've had. Consciously I am happy that she can be there for her mom, but on those bad days I feel some resentment like she is not there for me. She is going through so much and I don't like bringing it up to her and making her days harder. I don't want to feel that way and it makes me feel bad afterwards. I also don't want it to seem like I'm selfish and don't want her to help her mom because that is the opposite of the truth. Has anyone gone through something similar? Any advice would be appreciated greatly. I also just wanted to vent a little.

Hey man. I find it really great that you want to reach out, it's very respectable. I'm 14, so take it with a grain of salt: I'd say that, as far as advice goes, you should definitely try getting a support team of professionals if you don't already. Maybe a clinical social worker, therapist, psychiatrist, etc. Part of this is your lack of social network and circle, thereby leading to having no one to push you forward, to motivate you, to talk to. I'd say that self-development and investing yourself into your hobbies to make more social connections is a great idea. Maybe joining a support group.  There are a lot of people who can be of support on Discord (a lot of servers), subreddits, forums, and others. The thing I think is happening is codependency. You don't have anyone else so you use your partner, as your only support, to filter and confide in. Problem is that she is swamped and you are also left without adequate care/support for your problem due to her being only one person. It can feel like isolation, abandonment, jealousy, defeating, perhaps even hatred. Your needs also matter, as does her. That's why open communication is quintessential. Just expressing to each other that you're both having problems can make it less lonely and thereafter encouraging each other, pushing each other up. You don't have to confide in her, but having someone nearby for both of you could be useful; knowing you aren't alone. I hope the best for you man. Journaling could also work if you're into that stuff.
While I agree with the other poster about getting a larger support system, I understand that might be easier said than done. It can be really hard to open up to people, and find people you trust enough to go to when you have these feelings.   Did something specific bring on your recent bad days? Are you able to go by your mother in law to help in the evenings? It could take some of the stress off your wife, and distract you for a bit.

Life isn't even fun and loving anymore. NO ONE cares about anyone, there's so much hate and war and carelessness. If I had access to a drug that could cause me to go to sleep and never wake up, I'd take five of them. I'm tired of being here....This world just keeps getting worse and worse.

I don't have the right words to make you feel better but please know that I understand and share your thoughts.  You are not alone.
I absolutely hear you. My mother passed away in May and it has destroyed me. She was my rock and really the only thing keeping me from going through with suicide. And all this madness going on in the US, just reinforces those thoughts that life is pointless and hopeless. I’ve been here too many times to count but I always made it through and there was light,  no matter how little, at the end of the tunnel. I came across a quote from To Write Love on Her Arms (a mental health support website) that I look at everyday and I hope it can help you too - “Any bit of progress, even if it’s simply surviving, is an accomplishment. Everyday you choose to stay alive is a day you choose to believe in hope. That is worth celebrating.”
I feel the same, but after a long time being in such state now I just don't care anymore. I used to be a very positive person, no matter how tough a situation was I always found a positive side of it that gave me strength to overcome it. I always saw people differently from others, always saw good in them even when they didn't, but I'm tired. No matter how much good I do it's never enough. No matter how nice I am it's never enough. People just can't have enough of anything. I just stopped caring anymore and honestly it feels good. It's not like you can change anything, but you can change your surroundings. I cut off a toxic friend, I distanced myself from manipulative relatives, I stopped watching news and only see information I need and life became easier. You can't really change the world or people but you can change your own piece of world you live in. I still feel sometimes they way you do now, there's nowhere to hide from the absence of the meaning of life but here's the thing, you define it.I mean you can always press that "red button" but before you do might as well stick around and see what you can do with the time you have. I mean if it feels that bad and you have nothing to lose might as well do whatever you want? Ofc by "whatever you want" I mean something reasonable like talk to that person you have a crush on or bake a cake or try that food etc. I know it sounds basic, but there's no point thinking and exhausting yourself with things out of your control. Besides even if you could take that drug and fall asleep forever you'd probably won't even know it, you probably won't even see the difference and there's no guarantee its gonna be better than what we call reality.  You can't change other people or what's happening, but you can decide what to do in certain situations. Yeah, it sounds cliché but it's a simple truth.
I always say that since there’s no concrete evidence of the alternative being better or even “something” at all I just realize I gotta keep grinding and mining for those tiny nugs of joy. Elusive but alas: all I got
thanks, I appreciate that.
Yes....I suppose you're right....I'm sorry about your mother. I can't imagine losing my mom. i just wish we could go back to the days of old, when life was better, when people loved each other as brothers and sisters....I just miss, the better life of old.
I will check out the website, by the way, thank you :)
Do you live in the US?  If so, I find it's especially hard right now to see the world as fun and loving when there's so much ugliness.  I can relate to wanting to just opt out and go peacefully in your sleep.  Do you find the near constant stress of trying to be remotely positive exhausting?
Me too. But the most important thing right now is YOU. Take care of yourself and remember you’re not alone
You’re welcome!
Yes, I wish I didn't live in the U.S. though because it is horrible here with all the hate and just warring against each other and no one cares about each other. I'm just....tired
I won't....I just have to keep believing that brighter days are coming, they have to be coming, I have to try hard to believe that. Thank you so much for your words of encouragement.

Hi, my ex boyfriend just broke up with me about four days ago. He told me he didn't want to put in the effort anymore and he didn't love me anymore. He just didn't want to keep going for us. We still have tickets for the Detroit zoo on the 10th of January. He still wants to go even though we're not together. But I don't know if I should go, I'm scared it's going to ruin all my healing process but I'm also scared it's going to be the last time I'm gonna be able to hang out with him. What should I do?

I'm sorry. Break ups are never easy. I can imagine right now it's even harder with the pandemic limiting social interactions.  That said, no, do not go to the zoo with him. It won't be the same going as "friends" especially this soon after breaking up. It'll blur lines, and feel uncomfortable. He told you how he feels, which I'm sure was very painful, but now is the time to walk away, heal, and find someone who will want to put in the effort.

I posted this on 2 other subs cause i want help. ok. So i am 15, and i am in not a very good spot. I just want my life to be better, but it just spirals down 10 times for every time it gets better. so i wont really care about the grammar etc on this post as i am currently in a post breakdown mood i guess? idk im not about to bother with punctuations and capitalizations. Also this is a long post pls read i need help. The grammar isnt bad its just the punctuations and stuff lol.  I have a mom, dad and an older brother who is 21. I live in India. Although our household isnt really indian, but a lot of things would be uncommon elsewhere i guess. So anyway, since i was really young, my brother would beat me a lot, not exactly in an angry way, but he would basically choke me, beat me, scratch me in the name of fun, and i would just cry and do nothing i guess lol. what else was i supposed to do? He was 9 and i was like 3. But the choking began later like when i was 5 or 7 or something but yeah. My mom and dad would see this, and usually just dont care. There is more, but ill get on to that later.  My dad. He is probably the best out of all the 3, but i still dislike him, like, i would be sad if he died, but mostly cause of money and stuff ngl. But even if money wasnt an issue, i would still be sort of sad. But yeah. He has an addiction to tobacco, not smoking, but the one where you chew and spit it out idk im not well versed in this area. He is mostly problematic, because he just doesnt care, he used to, but now he doesnt. He just screams when there is an issue and goes back.  My mom. She is an actual piece of shit. I dislike her the most. She is so hypocritical, so abusive, i dont even wanna talk about it. She is the one who teaches me, and i would get good marks. Ok ill get onto the main deal now that the characters have been set lol.  I was born with a dark skin tone, and i was ugly. I mean, i still am lol. I dont remember much of my life before i was 4, and i dont remember much about my life till like 6, but i still rmember it somewhat. So, i was made fun of for my skin colour, not as a racist way, but i was called black insultingly in hindi as a way of teasing. I was called ugly, and i became pretty self aware at a very young age. My method to deal with this? To act like i dont care about my looks at all. Whereas in reality, i did. I knew from a young age that my looks were a bad first impression, and i could do nothing about it. This isnt even my greatest problem, but might as well start here. Ok, so second thing. I am really emotionally sensitive. now this is not really a thing i can explain properly, like, i wont get mad if a guy on the internet calls me stupid, its moreso when a friend does, or someone i care about, and when its front of some people and they laugh or something. So from a young age, i was made fun of for my skin colour, i would cry, i was made fun of for being a crybaby, i cried(lol). Then, eventually shit happens, and i wasnt sensitive enough to cry everytime, but i would cry over emotional things still. And that is still present.  This is mostly everything that has led to my ruin, oh wait, more things lol.  I \*think\* I have anxiety, i sweat whenever my teacher calls on me, no matter how much i know the teacher. And i also have a sweating problem lol but that doesnt really matter. But my heart beats faster, i get really nervous etc. Same thing when im talking to someone popular or someone i had never talked to etc. Its just not good. Also i have this thing, where i think, like, a lot. I literally fall deep into random thoughts jumping from one topic to another with a very weak link between them. I also talk to myself, talk about shit as though if i were a youtuber or something. This might be ADHD but idk. ok so that should be everything but i might add more info as i go along  Hopefully, that covers all the prerequisites to understand my situation and make a based judgement.  So, i was born in 2005. I have basically no memories up until 3 so skip. So, what i can remember is, my brother would beat me, my mom was very strict, she would beat me if i lost an eraser or a pencil, she would beat me if i was late, even by a minute for studying( I study according to a time table), and for various other tiny things. She would also beat me when i got hurt while playing, which is just..... ok. My mom was a sorta teacher, has a degree in maths. She takes tuitions at home, like extra stuff to help students.( and im ngl she is good at it even though her morals are pretty messed up). Ok so my dad was pretty nice back then, he was nice, would protect me from my mom, my brother and would basically give into buying what i wanted most of the times. As i grew older, the situation changed of course. My brother started doing more crazy shit, like choking and stuff, my mom and dad started caring less and less. My brother was hella smart about it. There would basically be no scratch marks or any sort of visible signs of injury. Whereas while trying to escape, i would scratch him a lot and whenever i would complain, he would scream about that. He has a liking for power. My mom knows that he beat me, but would think that i did pretty much worse to him, and i would get beat. OH FUCK, i remember! Up until i was like 11, my mom would beat me when we i screamed for help while fighting. Bruh. But yeah a lot of her actions didnt make sense whatsoever. My dad was the same as he was up until i was like 11 or 12 i dont quite remember but yeah. I diagnosed myself with depression (lol) as i was sad all the time, at like 10 maybe? and the online quizzes seemed to prove it although they were pretty fking generic ngl. So yeah. As i entered into my double digits age, i found myself being worse day by day. But before i continue, here is another factor! lol life isnt that linear i just have to say all of this if i want help lol.  So, my mom taught me. In jr kg(Kindergarten) i got like 60 or 70 percent or something. oh yeah btw we measure in percent and not grades so keep that in mind. In sr kg i got like 85, and in 1st standard i got 90. Also grade=standard. Those numbers kept going up until 4th, where i peaked with 99 in my second to last exam then went to 96 for my finals.. From 5th standard they sorta floated at 92-93 for a while. In 7th, for the first time in a while, I got 89. I got below 90. I was devastated and my parents, obviously judging me only based on my marks, scolded me. Then in 8th.... oh boy...... i really dont want to talk about this year. The shit i did in school was deplorable to say the lease. But this is about my parents so i think i can safely avoid it. If you are curious, just... dont. Its not something like murder lol. its legal but its embarrassing as hell. But, in 8th i dropped below 90 pretty permanently, and i got a grand total of 79 percent which was just sad. I then went up back to 89.8 in 9th and now im in 10th with 90 and 89.9 percent for my 1st and 2nd exam. So yeah, just know that, the validity of my statements are measured with my marks being an aspect.  Also, after like 11 yrs old, or 6th standard, my parents dropped the beating basically. but it still happened.  Ok so now, this is going to be a mess, i have laid out everything you need to know, now im bout to go all out  My mom is a piece of actual fucking dogshit. She is so fking abusive. She knows that im emotionally sensitive and takes full advantage of that. She has this look that she uses which basically makes me feel guilty as fuck. She uses it to and a bunch of other sayings, like "do you have any shame?" "Why dont you go die" " This is why your marks have dropped" and various other things that i cant quite translate without losing its meaning. She uses these sayings to make me study longer(its so stupid cause i wont fking study if she makes me sit for longer. Ill just look at the book and be lost in my thoughts) and to make me do shit, like bring her glasses. She uses this in petty arguements and hugely guilt trips me. I dont remember exactly whats wrong right now as my mind is blurred with my bro and my dad so yeah. But my mom is my biggest problem, ill hopefully edit that in. But i think ill get bored or something  My brother is also a person whom i thoroughly dislike. He beats me a lot, makes jokes and acts as a friend, but when we get into a fight, not a physical one, but one where we are just screaming, he says so many things which are just plain wrong. E.g. on new years, he wanted to order pizza. I am extremely scared of covid and i honestly just dont want to take any chances. LIke i know the chances are pretty low, but just why risk it? Why does it matter? Its just pizza. Losing convenience isnt a big deal. So we broke into a fight, and i said no lol. So he called me a scaredy cat, there are no better ways to put it. Its a lot more aggressive and shit but thats essentially what he said. He said that if i grow up like this and go to a hostel in college, i will be bullied hard( which imma be honest, i am very well aware of it. I just cant do anything about it like, what can i do about anxiety and social awkwardness if there is no one to help me?) But it had nothing to do with this, like, I was scared of a fucking life taking virus, and just because you want some pizza doesnt mean ill risk my life, no matter how small the chances. I know its slim, but i honestly wish it wasnt like this. If he ordered pizza and only he got the virus, i would be glad to let him. But obviously itll spread to me, thats what i care about. And then, my mom said that a person who is very close to us(not to me. I literally have no one i care about. Maybe my 2 best friends but not even that much) is gonna come back to our city, as she had married and now lived in a different state. And there is actually just no excuse for that. You cannot tell me that a person who fucking travelled through 5 states or so in a train (check out indian trains lol. They are hella crowded) is safe. He wants to look cool and say a lot of dialogues, so he said " She will come here no matter what". I lost my shit. I started beating him, he beat me, we went toe to toe until we just stopped after like 10 seconds. He screamed at me, as i was literally not able to talk because i was gasping so much while talking, which happens pretty often, and he got a few statements about me being a piece of garbage and so on. Then today, ah yes, the fateful day. So, he has had the laptop 24/7 for a year now, and i could only take while he was asleep, and had to give it back to him whenever he woke up. Because he was 'studying'. which tbf he was, but not all the time. He was only studying 50 percent of the time. He jus watched videos in the meantime, which he could have done on his phone(which was also mine which he took because he broke his but, i dont rlly care about it since i just watched youtube on my mom or dads phone instead). He would literally wake up while i was taking the laptop, just so that i couldnt take it. I remember i took it for my classes because he was asleep, he literally saw me taking it, woke up, and took it back. Then later when i saw the history he was fking watching videos. That made me mad. Just know that i cried for a lot of these incidents lol. So, today, his studying is over, he was watching videos on his laptop, and i wanted it, because now he isnt 'studying'. And you know what happens? Ok ive started crying now lol. But yeah lets get on to the incident which sparked me to write this. I knoked on the door. He didnt answer. I knocked again and again and he refused to open. I started crying. My mom was telling him to give it to me. He didnt open the door. After like 5 mins of aggressive knocking he opens the door. He stands there looking dominant and says "what?". i ask for the laptop and he refuses. I burst in and just try to take it. He pushes me around. I struggle back. I take it in my hand. He threatens me. I refuse to keep it down. He then says such shit that im on the verge of going back in his room rn and stabbing him. See the thing is, Im not mad because he didnt give me the laptop. I mean i am, but that isnt what makes me cry so much. Its his lies. He says he was studying for a while, and he was just watching videos for like half an hour.(of course, he didnt have that book there 15 mins ago when i checked, and he shut the lights and closed the door 10 mins ago.) I dont care. I just wanted to kill him and myself. I ask him, why he didnt open the door then? his answer? "Why am i obliged to answer you?" Not even in our language but in english. Pissed me off so much. "why am i obliged to answer you?" huh? Im not a brother, im not a family member, just some random guy knocking on the door right? im not someone who said 15 mins ago that i will take the laptop in 15 mins huh? I wasnt the guy who didnt cry for the laptop for a whole year huh? And you know what he else he says during this shit? " I just wanted to watch some videos for half an hour and then i would go to sleep. "Couldnt you just wait? Didnt i wait for you when you had the laptop?" OH WHAT A NOBLE FUCKING DEED YOU DID YOU AABSOLUETE PIECE OF HUMAN SCUM. YOU WAITED FOR 15 MINS ONCE WHEN YOU DIDNT EVEN HAVE TO STUDY FOR ME TO FINISH MY GAME OH WHAT A NOBLE KING YOU ARE! HOW STUPID AM I TO NOT WAIT HALF AN HOUR FOR YOU TO FINISH YOUR VIDEOS WHICH YOU COULD WATCH ON YOUR FUCKING PHONE RiGHT????? alright now that i ranted, let me break down what is wrong with the statement. First off, it was videos which he could watch on his phone. He has taken the laptop from me for this exact reason. Second off, he has given me the laptop for an extra 15 mins like thrice maybe. Third off, he has scolded me for making him wait. Fourth off, he wasnt opening the fucking door. How would i know that he was watching only for 30 mins? Do you know something worse? he did this just for show. Just to seem right in frony of me and my parents. He was laughing when i was screaming at him to open the door. He was laughing up until he opened the door. OK then, he closed the door, i said i would beat him, he said jsut touch me, i pushed him and he almost fell, he slapped me and i almost got knocked out. My dad comes in, hears our arguement, and yknow what he does? Scold me for sleeping at 1 30 am. Wha? I have been doing that for literal fucking years. I am only 15 and I HAVE BEEN DOING GTHAT FOR YEARSSSSSS. Then i lose my shit yet again and scream, make a bunch of valid arguments which im jsut not about to write here ok? im tired bro. Then my bro chimes in and says that im making too many dialogues for my age(ah yes, my age. Just because im 15 means my feelings and opinions arent valid anymore, totally agree) Then he goes into his room and i go to my dad and tell him what actually happened. Of course he cuts me off in the middle, and brings up the sleeping late thing again( Note that i was crying so hard that i was gasping every single time i said a word). I make an analogy to his tobacco addiction he gets mad. He asks rhetorically " whats your age?" . I literally(no like literally) threw my hands in the air and was about to go. He didnt let me, i said a bit more, my bro came in, and i was like "of course now this guy will come in this argumnet, support my parents and make me have a bad time". He then says go and take the laptop cause it was better than listening to you. OK. I took it. And here i am. Writing a reddit post instead of playing games. I wanna die. Help me. my brother isnt even my problem here man, its my mom. I just dont want to expend my energy on writing. Im tireddd. I might edit it in if it gets enough traction. Ill also post this on depression and depression help. If, like, i get 1 reply only, and that reply is like " Idk man, go see a therapist" i stg. ok. thats about it. ill play minecraft because i only have 30 mins of play time as i spent 1 and a half hour writing this post wooooooooooooooooooooo. So pls tell me that if i write about my mom ill get some help lol idk

Finally home after a 12 hours shift and all I can think of is, what's the point? On my way back I couldn't stop crying... and I don't even know why I was crying in the first place. It wasn't even a stressful day, it was busy enough to pass the time quickly but I guess I'm so broken and messed up. My thoughts are dark, it's a bad place inside my head. Now I'm drinking and writing this crap, like I'm a piece of garbage!!! I'm nothing, nothing matters, this cold hungry world will never change!!! I'll never feel safe.

I'm sorry you had a bad day. Do you have these a lot? If it wasn't a particularly stressful day, was there anything else that could have triggered this?   Do you have any other outlets to help you cope? While I am NOT judging you for drinking after a bad day, it's not a long term solution for your problems.   Why don't you feel safe?
Yes, those days are everyday for some time now. I believe things around me, certain words (that may not be directed at me) anything can be a trigger, as it usually goes into flashbacks (emotional flashbacks too)  Helping others help me cope, but with covid still around, not many ask for my help. I'm aware it's not ideal to keep this habit of drinking going, I'm trying.  Because of my past, hypervigilance.  Thank you so much for taking the time to reply to my post.

tldr: The title sums it up  some context: Ive got some genuine issues im trying to adress in therapy but the progress has been very slow. I drink way too often, going through 20 bottles of beer a day, because i cant cope with the thoughts sometimes. Ive been drinking a fair amount the past 8 hours and i dont feel drunk but i do feel very down. I know im not in the right frame of mind to tackle the root of my issues at the minute, so if anyone has any tips for getting through the day without feeling so down i would appreciate it.

For right now, stop drinking. Get some water into you, and eat something if you can, even if it’s just some toast.   What time is it? Are you at work or at home? Try to go out for a walk if you can, get some sun on you.
Alcohol is the worst enemy in trying to treat depression. If gives you an illusion of emotional raise then pulls you back lower than when you started. I mean you probably know that. I would say find a way to stop drinking. I mean duuuh, you probably tried, but this is why the progress is so slow. There are better ways of getting through the shitty day and it varies from person to person. For me it's a good movie or a favourite series (there are series I rewatched several times), favourite food or a warm bath/shower. I used to have a really stressful job during the exact time when my depression was at its worse and first thing I did after coming home is just take off all my clothes and go to bathroom and take a nice warm shower, just stood under warm stream for half an hour, crying sometimes but when I got out, put on something comfy, eat something tasty, drink some tea, watch something and the day didn't feel that bad anymore. Fresh air certainly helps, you don't have to even walk though it would do you good, just sit outside for some time and take a deep breath, try to isolate from anything that's going on. I don't know your circumstances but a loving pet like a cat or dog could also be a solution. Hope something of this was helpful.
I'm with this, stop drinking alcohol and get some good ol' water and food in your system.   If you feel like it maybe a little sef care like taking a shower or brushing your teeth. I find when I have no motivation these things help me get going.
Agree with this. On really bad days I try to do even just one positive thing, even if just a shower or laundry or cleaning up, and if I need to go back to bed then at least there is some sense of accomplishment if I have done something positive.

On the face of it my life is alright, I’m studying for a pretty good degree and have a decent range of friends and hobbies, but I still feel alone and listless all the time. Everything feels tiring and useless and I hate existing. On top of that, I haven’t touched another human (consensually and outside of cordialities) in years, and despite how much I want to, do not have the trust in anyone to do so. Between the emotional difficulty caused by this and frequent hallucinations, nightmares and delusions, I sleep  poorly and wake up feeling tired.  I have a lot I want to do with myself but rarely feel able to do anything, and I want to stop it, but I don’t think I can. My current financial situation does not afford me the luxury of therapy, or the medication I almost certainly should be on. Not sure what I’m expecting, and I doubt anything can be done for me, but maybe someone can offer me help here.

I'm sorry you're going through this. I know it's not easy.  Do you try anything for your sleep? There are natural options like melatonin or sleepy time tea that might help you relax. Or exercising before bed. Try writing down your nightmares when they happen. That could help you getting the thoughts out of your head, but if you do get into therapy, that'll be useful to have.  Speaking of which, you mentioned studying for a degree. Does your school offer any consoling? Some colleges offer that kind of help to students for free. It could be worth checking into
Melatonin has helped me a little but I either still stay up too late with lower dosages or feel even worse the next day with higher ones. Exercise doesn’t really help me either in my experience. I don’t remember much of them usually, though from how I feel when I wake up my assumption is they’re extremely common...maybe recording it would help though.  I didnt think to check with university but I shall look into it.

Take a deep breath. How often do you have episodes like this? Do you have any coping techniques ready to use?  Try the 5 senses one. When you start to feel overwhelmed, go through your 5 senses. List in your head 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.  Or try looking around and finding something for each color you can think of.  Close your eyes and try to identify each of the sounds you can hear.
Hey, you have a job that still gives you pto during these hectic times. That's definitely a blessing you can count.   Mind if I ask what your job is about?
Thank you for your reply and great tips.     I wanted to go to the doctor today, but as I am the only one in the office again, my boss nixed that plan. 😢     He was always kind, so I was quite shocked by his reply. Anyway, I cancelled the appointment and I'm seriously considering looking for a different job...there are too many stress-triggers here, but that's a whole different can of worms!
Actually it's an abbreviated apprenticeship in a company that recruites and provides temporary and permanent workers/employees to other companies. I have no idea what to call it in English, though. 😊     Not quite what I like, I'm more of a "working quietly on my computer" kind of person. 😁
No idea what to call it?.. Third party recruiter maybe?

I'm going to mostly address your confidence, because I think you need that the most. You have a graduate degree! That's a lot of work, and you did it! It's in STEM, which is not easy for most people. You got straight A's. That's incredible, and you must have worked so hard to accomplish all of that.   I suggest you look at personal development class on Edx. They're free, and they have some about decision making, and time management. Stock up on those, and start looking for a job with clear paths for advancement. Go into interviews talking about how incredibly smart you are, your amazing resume, and the extra class you took.   You deserve a better job that makes you happy. You deserve financial security. You can do it!
Hi Triple D,  Skills are the difference between where you are and where you want to be.   If you got straight A's, you can learn skills.   I've had social anxiety, career paralysis, and relationship nightmares. Skills solved all of those. You know how to learn.   If I can do it, so can you. I wasn't a straight A student.   You got this.  Ping me any time.
I feel you on this one... except I did not get into graduate school... got rejected. Haven’t found a job i’d like to do with a bio degree. Everything else I can relate 100% specially with the bills.

I’m 51 and have no direction or purpose in life. I’ve always said I never asked to be here and I’m just waiting to go back wherever I came from. I’ve got everything anyone would want, just no real reason to be here.
I moved away from my friends and family to be with my husband only for him to be shipped off. He's in the navy and now I'm alone. I cant function most days. I've never been away from home like this. I've lost all my resources to keep my depression at bay. It's been months now dealing with the loneliness i feel in my heart. I don't have a job atm or a hobby to keep me busy. I just wake up and move from the bed to the couch until the day is over and I go back to bed only lie awake with my thoughts and cry myself to sleep. Idk what to do other than just exist.
I don't have any horrible things going on or trauma yet I'm still feeling depressed. I have a good job with a wonderful employer, I have a relationship and friends and family. I rent a nice home. I am almost done paying off college debt. Why can't I just be happy with all of these things? I feel like a pathetic loser.
I'm 21 and I don't know if I'm just straight up lazy or if there is something wrong with me. I really need to get up and do my school works because I can't afford to lose my scholarship but I just can't find the motivation and strength to do so. I don't think I'm brave enough to end my life but I would welcome death with open arms at any day.
I'm too weak to do anything meaningful, but I can't have a meaningful life otherwise. Anger and desperation are the things I feel most of the time. I'm on my knees despising, cursing myself and my choices to fuck this wonderful life up so badly.
I tried to kill myself and the hospital and my family couldn't give any less of a shit. I was there for less than two days and they just let me go like I was any old patient. I know they're busy, but... i desperately needed and need to feel cared for and it was just a kick in the teeth. Sat here wondering why the fuck I shouldnt just do it again.
I feel you. You know, no one, including myself, ever asked to be here. But we are, and some people care about it. That, itself is a reason to be here. Courage and have a hug.

I don’t know how I managed to fuck myself over so badly. Last year I got pressured into enrolling into a performing arts class, which I knew would trigger my social anxiety in school, and I ended up asking for a schedule change a day late because of a typo on the schedule change form I got. My counselor basically told me she wouldn’t do shit about it, handed me a stress ball, and called it a day. Said I’m smart so I’ll be able to handle it.   TL;DR I had so many breakdowns in that class, the teacher told the counseling team he didn’t want me in his class anymore. And THEN they choose to do something about it?? I spent the entire semester begging for my counselor to do something, and they did absolute jack shit about it besides getting some schmuck in ASB to hand me a piece of candy once, but god forbid a teacher be annoyed that one of his students is being a “distraction” to the rest of class. All of my grades in other classes started dropping like flies. I went from having a 95% in AP Calculus to a 44%. All they did about it was put me in the detention room for 4th period every day and promise to get the school psych to speak with me. He never did.   Honestly despite the shitty schedule change, I felt like I had a shot at improving my grades. At this point I was halfway through the semester, but I had a strategy to fix everything up by the end of the year.   But then corona happened, and everything got worse.   My plans for recovery were out the window. My teachers rarely held zoom calls for us. The district tried to put a band-aid on the issue by making a policy where a student’s grades couldn’t get lower than they were pre-corona, which was fine for everyone else, except, of course, the poor bastards who were already doing poorly. At this point life was just a haze, with my depression and anxiety duking it out to see which could make me feel worse on any given day.   I tried to get back up again for the new school year, but I got crushed again from a combination of huge amounts of schoolwork, insomnia, newly-prescribed meds that only made me feel worse, and plain apathy. It’s weird because I’m so furious at myself for fucking up so badly in life, and at the same time I’m too numb to do anything about it.   Now my new counselor got my mom to switch me out of most of my classes, without consulting me first. And I just feel so defeated. The only thing I had that I could remotely pride myself upon were my classes. Yeah, they were so mind-numbingly difficult my brain turned to mush, but they were so fun, and felt so rewarding. We built ourselves our own community. The same group of nerds and dorks I’ve grown up and studied with since middle school is gonna be stripped away from me in about 7 hours.   My only redeeming quality, being a “gifted” child, is nothing but a cruel joke now and it hurts like a bitch. How did I fall so far from grace? How did I fuck myself over so badly with one stupid decision I made in freshman year of high school? After all these years of trying to become someone successful, I’m now just some disappointment who’s probably not even gonna pass high school. I wish I could turn back time and beat the shit out of myself and fix everything, but that’s impossible now. Everything feels impossible now

I'm writing this after pulling an all nighter so sorry if its not fully comprehensible, or very vague. I can't remember the last time i got a full nights sleep. I am kept up at night filled with anxiety and sadness. There is literally nothing good about me and even when i try to do good  things i just mess it up. I know i'm a bad person and yet i just can't stop being an asshole. I don't enjoy doing things that hurt people I'm close to. I genuinely have never felt more hopeless/worthless in my entire life and i don't know whats happening. I'm constantly dreading the future, and i know that if i end up a lone its entirely my fault, but i just can't stop. i just want to tell my friends how sorry i am over and over till i lose my voice, but theres no point if i just do the same thing again. I want to get better but i just can't find out whats wrong with me, and I was wondering if anyone else felt the same way.

First of all, you are really self aware, and that's awesome. You identify a lot of aspects of yourself that not everyone would, including that apologies aren't enough.   Next, you aren't a bad person. Your actions do not define you, especially as you deal with mental health issues. You said you try to do good things. That's great! That shows you have the right intentions even if they don't always work out. That's ok.   Do you do anything to help yourself relax at night for sleep? Write down your worries or anxieties before going to bed. Drink sleepy time tea, or take melatonin. Watch a mindfulness video on YouTube. Exercise. Try yoga.   What sort of good things do you try doing that don't work out? You could try something simple for your friends. Each day pick a different friend and write them a short, nice message. Just "hey, you're really great, and I'm thankful to have you in my life" or something. It might make you feel better to say these things, and would make them feel good, too.
I do actually do things before bed, mainly watching dumb video on youtube or maybe some video games. I don't really know why but sometimes i'm happy as can be then another moment i'm just filled with anxiety, and i can't stop thinking about how people think about me. I stay up most nights because i have to make myself tired enough to sleep without having time to think about this stuff, otherwise i cannot sleep at all. I want to try and do some of the things that you mentioned like working out, or writing my friends a nice message. Sometimes i just get overwhelmed  by these emotions that i start thinking worse about myself, last night was a particularly hard night. every time i make a simple mistake i constantly fear that i have completely messed up. I don't actually know if im as bad as i say, but i view myself as a horrible person. I feel so bad for the people around me sometimes, and sometimes i feel like i hurt myself more than they get hurt whenever i make tiny mistakes.
Working out could help you in a lot of ways. It releases endorphins that make you happier. It could help your body feel more tired, and sleep more restfully. Often times when we take care of ourselves, we feel better. It also gives you goals to work toward, which can help you feel accomplished.  This can be such a hard concept for people to accept, even if it sounds simple and cliche, but no one is perfect. We all make mistakes. But really, no single action will ever define you or your life. You will always give more thought to these mistakes than anyone else. While you lay awake dwelling on something you said or did, anyone else involved is off dwelling on their own problems. You need to learn to forgive yourself for being human.   You care about your friends, and you care about how they view you. That tells me you have a good heart. Remember that. That is most important. Bad people don't feel bad for others.

I am living in Germany and since the first lockdown my mental health gets worse. It got better when there was some normal life again. I went to the gym and gained strength over some months and could structure my life again.   Now that that fell apart again i can not maintain any real structure in life. I do the things i need to do for my studies but i am not emotionally involved at all. It does just exaust me.   I am anxious and have the feeling that everything i live for is falling appart. I feel like there is a demon in me that is sabotaging my actions and especially my relationship with my loving and caring girlfriend. At my lowest I project my problems on her and claim that she makes me miserable. When I realise that I feel like the biggest asshole on the planet. I explained to her that I am ill and that i am so sorry for my toxic behaviour but I can't control it. It is like an outburst of toxicity which i accumalate because there is just nothing except work, sleep and nothingness at the moment.   Nonetheless she holds onto me for which i am on the hand extremely grateful for but on the other hand i worry that it isn't good at all for her. She says she can deal with it but i know that my outburst are hurtful and that it destroys our trust.  I am thinking about leaving her because I feel toxic and i love her. She said leaving her would be the most horrible thing I could do to her.  On monday I've got an appointment with my therapist. I do not take any antidepressants and never have. Do u think they could help me to get myself back on track? I really do just see antidepressants as the only solution at the moment because the general situation will not improve in a short time period.

It sounds like antidepressants could certainly help. They would definitely be worth a try while you continue to work with your therapist. The root of your issues would still need professional help, which I'm glad you are getting.  Your girlfriend is a tough situation. You can't make choices for someone else, and I'm happy you are able to talk through some of this with her. Have you considered a couples therapy session with her? It is hard/impossible to say what is really best here. If you are as hurtful as you say when you have these outbursts, and if she says that about you potentially leaving her... I worry what she might be going through. I can't tell from your post if she's being loving and supportive, or accepting abuse based on her own issues. She might not know either, and therapy could help resolve that. A therapist could also give her the tools to help you better when things get rough.

Hey man, this must be really difficult for you. I'm sorry you're going through this. Don't mind your English, it's quite good to be honest. I want to go through this so maybe it helps you out, feel free to share your thoughts.  So it's okay to doubt what I'm saying as your parents have said this repeatedly into your head, but in my opinion, that is totally false regarding the permanent sadness. What is happening is that they are treating your mental health like it's insignificant; like it doesn't matter. That is really bad man.  I'm glad you decided to reach out, even to the internet. It can be really intimidating. I'm 14 so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt, but hopefully I can relate in someway.  What's happening, in my opinion,  is you're depressed and filtering your time into what seems like the only fun thing that makes you happy accordingly (depressed as a mood, not disorder as you shouldn't self diagnose without a therapist's opinion). You're sad so you do what makes you happy. Say man, do you have any hobbies or interests? Maybe you could try out a new one, or practice a new passion. Maybe exercise, a sport, programming, music, writing , drawing, helping others, whatever it is that makes you happy asides from your computer? Or maybe you're really into gaming. To get better you have to find some things you really enjoy to do, that makes you happy. Then you can use them to push yourself forwards and use them as a motivator, something that can make you prideful and be extra driven. You could even meet some new people in these hobbies and make friends.  It feel's like you can do nothing right with all this yelling and these lessons, right man? I really sympathize for you, it sounds really terrible. The way you're being treated probably make you feel terrible. Do they not listen to you when you ask them to stop?  Is it possible to start seeing a therapist (a mental health professional)? They can help you out and help you feel happier. We're here for you man. Please let it off your mind.
Hi, thanks you to have replied, first of all, I have 2 hobbies: shooting and programming, I can't do shooting because of covid and I enjoyed Les programming than before. Apart from my computer, talk with my friends is the only things that make me happy, but because the halves of then live in a other country, i need to use discord to talk to them. Expect these things, nothing really make me happy...   For the last part of your answer, they began to tell at me maybe 2 weeks ago but it's do 3-4 years that I have suicidal thought, but I never talked to them about that because my mother can't handle the fact that I think that, so I says nothing. I feel stupid all the time and capable of nothing. I never ask them to stop because idk, I just don't have the strength to do it. And for the therapist, idk why but I absolutely don't want to go to one.   Thanks you very much to answered me

Hello everyone,  I will share an abbreviated version of my story, so you could understand better where I'm coming from, so to speak.  I was born with a cleft lip and I've always had a  complex due to its degeneration. Other kids and teenagers weren't exactly supportive in that context. My parents broke up when I was about three years of age and I lived with my mother which ,at the time, had struggled really hard to support us.  During my later childhood years I was being moved to my grandparents and back due to the fact that my mother did not or could not or would not accept the responsibility of taking care of a child anymore. She often left me alone at night to go party with friends. I was constantly in fear for her safety and that of my own. My father seldom came to visit me and I feel that there is a gap there.  Later on in my life I always felt strong pull towards the pleasures and comfort life has to offer, like sex and alcohol and, relationships in general, because I was looking for a family. I think, it was just a way for me to escape, I was searching for something that cold help me forget fear. Fear of living. Due to my lifestyle in later years I was constantly held back at school (3 years).  4 years ago I've suffered from a major brain trauma and my perception of life has changed and, so have my mental abilities. I try to do things the right way, to not fear responsibility, but you see - now I'm in a position where I'm someone without education to get any job that would make my life meaningful, without any status to get any friends, girlfriends (which makes me even more anxious near people and even more lonely). I have no friends that I can talk to and no relatives which could support me, my mother is an alcoholic refusing to seek help now.  I'm a loser, but the most important (for me) thing is, that I see no way I can get out of this. Well, say you, get an education. The thing is - my mind is too lazy do even pass final math exam in school, so I cannot get higher education. So either I take a step forward and waste my time learning something that I am unable to remember and ,in these circumstances, not be able to use ,or I take another path and get a low-income,  belittling job and face that I am cursed to spend all of my life collecting dust of superficial pleasure on the knees.  When I think about my life I only feel anger and desperation. The only thing that comes to mind is that maybe being six feet under ground is better than being neck deep in this cesspool.  Please, help. Any advice how to get my life together would be greatly valued.

I don't really have an advice for you simply because it's difficult to give an advice to a stranger and over the internet, it is difficult to give advice even to a closest friend because advice always comes with a share of responsibility. All I can offer is support for what it's worth. I was too in a difficult situation where I was too depressed to do anything and spent a few years doing nothing but blaming and hating myself for being so worthless and as you can guess it didn't help anyone. I was lucky I had a place to live and some support from my parents that also got divorced in my absence. there's no universal recipe for life, nor fixing it, nor for finding a meaning not even for depression. But in a away, when we're at our lowest we're on the verge of self discovery and true freedom. The answer is not anyone out there, it's you. You say friends and family but you can't really offer anyone anything for now because you need to become a friend and a family for yourself first. Heal yourself, find something that brings you if not joy then at least relief or some kind of satisfaction and I'm not talking about short-term euphoria but actual feeling. As paradoxically as it sounds but helping others might make you feel better too, it actually has a therapy effect not to mention you'll be making someone else's life better. There's no shame in having a simple job and simple life as long as it is enough for you. It's not much help I know but maybe something of this was a little useful.
Your words are wise and well received. Thank you! :)
I am happy to know you found them so. You're very welcome and I hope you will find a way to be happy.

I don't know but my work colleagues are making fun of me trying to make me quit my job.  This whole deal is freaking me out. I am in a very bad mood and they saw that.  I hate the situation.   What is your story?
My ex boyfriend said, "I DON'T DESERVE TO BE HAPPY YOU ARE GOING TO NEED THIS MONEY!!!!!!"
My ex boyfriend said, " Come . Get. Your FUCKING  CAT!!!!!!!!!!!"
What happened if may ask?
Damn what did I do?
Life is like that, maybe someday you will find something worthwhile, just don't get discouraged here we are all friends and support each other, if you want to talk (I warn you my English is not good) I am here
People are people.
Many people are cruel. But many people are also compassionate. I'm sorry about what has happened to you. However if you go through life assuming all people are horrible, then they will be.
Sorry to hear that, it sounds like a miserable waste of oxygen.
I'm having a difficult time right now. I have people breaking into my apartment and stealing stuff.
Ok. Thank you.
Is it you ex boyfriend or boyfriend?
Neither. My ex lives in another state.  Whoever is stealing from me is somewhere nearby.
I even have an alarm system and they still managed to break in undetected.
Have you had any friends over?
No. Nobody but me.
Do you hav a generic alarm code that someone close to you might know?

What you are experiencing is actually called Emotional Hangovers from Dreaming. Example let's say You're running away from Godzilla and he is also destroying your favorite pond and you wake up your brain will suddenly be flooded with the stress hormones cortisol and adrenaline. Just as you would responding to a real life threat, these hormones will make your heart rate super fast, tense up your muscles, and make your hair stand on end. These hormones do not diminish straight away, and can actually linger in the body for hours after the fact.... Making you feel like shit. I am actually dealing with the same thing. I guess people with narcolepsy have this problem.  You are very good describing things in writing....  I hope you find some help. I find not dreaming helps but you have to see a doctor Rx for that. I was trying alternative ways but it didn't work out. Maybe see a neurologist that knows about dreaming disorders or check into the whole narcolepsy thing. Thats actually what I was searching for, if other people have narcolepsy and feel these emotions and how they deal with it.

I am going to ask this question here, because I don't know where to put it. For a year or so, I been imaging me being hurt or stuff. I been bullied for all my life and still going. I got used to it. I am just so scared ask for help.   When people laugh and tell jokes about or at me. I laugh with them, I agree with them. They say, am annoying, stupid, short(am 4'10), and weak.  I just want to be hurt by people, emotionally or physically. I want a reason for being annoying, stupid, short, and weak. I hate myself.  I want to feel pain. What is wrong with me.  Sorry for grammar and spelling. You can delete this if you want.

its likely that if you didnt have a very good childhood where you didnt get enough support then you already are familiar with that feeling so you are more or less okay with going through it. new feelings can be uncomfortable to feel even if they are positive ones. you like staying in your comfort zone a lot more than getting out of it regarding emotions.  do let me know if it makes sense. i just want you to understand yourself better :)  edit: grammatical error
Thank you, helping me understand

I don't have a job anymore because my depression, anxiety, nightmares, CTPSD and epilepsy are all too intense to perform well.  And the past few days I just feel like a useless, worthless piece of trash most of the day. There are occasional times when I feel *alright* I guess...but the default setting in my brain when I'm thinking to myself is this:  *"Why can't you just take your plate to the kitchen? Why can't you get up and go to the bathroom? You should be doing some laundry or vacuuming or literally any household chore. Are you going to let everyone take care of you forever? You're just a giant baby who needs tending to 24/7. At least play some video games or something. No? Then how about doing something musical? No? How bout exercise or play with the cat? Still nothing? Then what's the point in even existing? You're a piece of sh\*t."*  It just feels like this mountain of crushing responsibilities and I'm failing at every one of them. Even stuff I haven't thought of for a while like..."oh yeah I wanted to clean out the junk drawer...well I'm not doing that either so I guess I'm worthless."  I know what I usually tell other people when they're feeling this way... *"don't fault yourself...let today be a bad day and let tomorrow be better...it's okay to be depressed."*  But today nothing seems to be working to dig me out of this hole. I feel like the biggest waste of space :( .

What time do you wake up and does your alarm wake you up or do you wake up before your alarm? If you got a lot to do , go to get up early. Got to go to bed early, turn off phone, if you hit snooze you’ll feel 10 times worse.  Never fear failure and know we feel the way we feel because of the value you assign to that event. If you constantly talk down to yourself they record will play over and over. Imagine yourself in high standard , I actually picture a crown on my head because who feels bad with a crown 😂 Here if you’d like to chat!
I'm sorry you're feeling this way. I have a couple ideas if you're interested. You must be doing something each day, like eating, drinking, going to the bathroom eventually. Make a list of everything you do, even if it seems simple or unimportant. See how many things you can list tomorrow. And yes, making the list itself definitely counts!Then just try to add one more thing the next day. It's ok if you do less, too. But each day you'll get to see just how much you actually accomplish. Even feeding yourself, washing your hands, drinking a cup of water... Those are all things to be proud of when you're feeling this way.   You mentioned having a cat. Try getting a bottle of multiple vitamins, and a bag of cat treats. Every day at the same time, give your cat a treat, and take a vitamin. You'll be taking care of yourself, and your cat will get used to the routine and remind you to do it.   Do you have a laser pointer for your cat? You could lay in bed, barely move, and still interact with your cat. Sometimes that little effort is enough to get you moving forward. Or even to make you smile watching your cat.
I usually just let my body wake me up...
Yeah those are all really great ideas! I'll try that tomorrow. It has been tough since I'm home alone most of the daytime...I rely on my cat quite a bit for emotional support
Brushed my teeth and flossed already tonight 💪🏼 I'm on fire haha
What’s first thing you do?
Emotional support cats should be a much more widely accepted thing. They are incredible.  Even if you don't mean it, any little thing you do for yourself is awesome, and I'm over here cheering for you
Wake up, check my phone, get up, brush my teeth and shower
I would say avoid the phone , use that time for yourself . Meditation , do somthing you want done that day, workout anything but pick phone
How’re you today?

They will, it may take a while but they will get better, the hate of man will pass and dictators die, the bitterness of man who fear the way of human progress will pass. Hold on tight because the happiness you look for exist and can be obtained, sadly no one knows exactly how, however I am here to help you, and I can say with confidence that things are hard now, but it gets better it may take one day or decades but it is always worth to be here when it happens. I don't know if it will work on you, but I try to always seek happiness on little things in life, a little ant working in my bedroom, a bee that came to visit my plants, a bird that made its nest in a nearby tree, all of it brings me joy and I hope that they can do the same to you. No matter what you think, there are people who will always love you, please be strong because the happiness you want so bad will eventually make its way to you. Have a blessed day and happy life, I wish that in your path you won't find darkness.
I learnt I can’t get to happiness straight away from my depressed state  It’s a journey  First my depression went  Then I felt something a little better  Then I moved up a bit and felt something a bit better than that  Eventually I got to relief and satisfaction  Satisfaction feels so good  Satisfaction isn’t happiness - no way near but it’s a sort of contentment feeling  Then from that achievement of contentment I started moving to happiness excitement now it’s love joy bliss  It’s a journey  Honestly when depression went from me I felt a great achievement even though I was still in negative emotion  You can do this  Don’t mark your results if you are happy Mark your results on am I feeling better? Has there been an improvement? It may not be perfect but is there an improvement? Good luck Honestly you can do this
Hi Querulous,  I found happiness by finding a purpose.   I found something to struggle for and that lead to me being happy. I found a desire and a willingness to work for it. It wasn't easy but it was very worthwhile for me.   I received a lot of pride and happiness that I was able to persist and improve and ultimately start to have impact in the world.    I've made some shifts in my purpose over the years - first responder, mechanic, realtor, software development - and always at the core my purpose was to help people. Strangely it took me over a decade to recognize my core.   The different work taught me skills, exposed me to different people, and made me struggle for success. I don't think there is an "easy path" for real happiness.   When I started as a first responder, it was because friends said I would be good at it. They were right. And after a few years I was getting both happy with my work and bored and needing something new - so I shifted. Shifting is fine.   You can find happiness on the path of purpose and struggle.   I don't think there is a better way :-)  Ping me any time.
I am in a similar position. I hope it get's better for both of us.  I am almost certain of the answer that ,maybe, I should give, but that would mean accepting that God is dead, so to speak.
Thank you, you're so sweet.  Many blessings.
What a great msg thanks
Explain? Are you a Nihilist or something along those lines?
I don't know. I hope not. I try to see the bright side, to live, you see. I want to help others, but I cannot even help myself. I can lie, but I won't - I can't see the point, so I wish that at least others could live a better life.
I believe there's much to live for and much life (and existence) has to offer. The problem is we aren't truly free to live.   I'm a prisoner in my home.  I literally cannot leave my apartment or people will break into my home and vandalise my home.  Just yesterday I found a frying pan in my kitchen that isn't mine. Someone else put it there. Scary, but there's nothing I can do to make them stop.   I want to drive down to the river and watch the sun set. I want to run, exercise and feel the wind on my face again.  But I can't do those things because I'm trapped in my home just trying to protect everything that is so basic to life. Feeling  safe in your home and safe and free to leave your home and go out and do the things you want to do is the one of the most basic elements to life and ultimately,  to happiness.   I feel like I have to beg for the most basic things that others take for granted. Please can I leave my home in peace for more than 5 minutes without having to worry about finding other people's stuff in my apartment? Please? Please don't put frying pans in my apartment? Please? Is that so much to ask?  K? THANK YOU!!
Those are very harsh conditions that you have to live in. Can you at least invite other people, like friends to your house to hang out? Or is it quarantine in your country as well?
Maybe you should get a security cam or a nanny cam. At least then you'd find out who's entering you apt.
I don't have any friends.  Family won't associate with me. They refuse to visit.  It's not my fault people!!! FUCK!!!  LEAVE ME ALONE!!! IT'S NOT MY FAULT I DESERVE THIS. I AM A SWEET GIRL,  A GOOD PERSON.  I DON'T DESERVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME.  PLEASE STAY OUT OF MY APARTMENT.  LEAVE ME AND MY STUFF ALONE.  PLEASE!!!!!!    Puzzleheaded: sorry I am taking my frustration out on you. Thanks for listening.
Uh, well  I have a security system with motion detectors and they were somehow able to bypass that :(  So not sure how much good a camera will do. These people seem pretty clever, they might even be hackers  :(
It's alright, I understand (I think I do).  We're in quite a similar position. Hold on in there, please. Maybe life or God is testing us.
Well now I feel like you're just trying to play stupid. I thought you were a nice person I guess I was wrong.  You're dishonest. Please don't reply to me anymore.

I'm 22 and have been dealing with depression since I was around 15. Around two years ago I started some medicine and it has really helped me. I can tell my moods are alot better and I feel alot better about life. However, my problem is I feel very unmotivated to do anything a majority of the time. I lost my job in march of last year and have only been working a part time job since then. I have plenty of free time but I feel no motivation to look for a better job or take care of myself (shower, brush my teeth, eat regular meals etc.) or keep my apartment clean. Some days I will feel really productive. I'd say maybe one day a week. I will get alot done cleaning, picking up the place and  running errands. Otherwise I just dont feel like/want to do anything. I just sleep alot, watch tv and play video games. I feel like I've tried alot to take better care of myself but after a few days I just always loose the motivation. Does anyone have advice on how to break this pattern? I'm just not sure how to fix my problem. Thank you in advance.

What's your desire?  Like really - what do you want? And what are you willing to do to get it?  In my early 20s a good friend asked me the same question. I told him I wanted to race cars. That started me down an incremental path of learning about racing, working on cars, racing school, and ultimately racing. Going after that desire changed everything. I had a lot of late nights, frustration, and scraped knuckles - but it was all worth it.   Along the way, I learned some preventative mental wellness skills which have pretty well inoculated me against depression and anxiety. The skills require practice and some times have been a struggle - but in the long run, they worked incredibly well.   You can do this.  Ping me any time :-)

Hello! It sounds like you’re having issues figuring out where to go from here. I’m feeling that as well and actually brought it up to my councilor. Here is her advice: basically a vision board. You can write it down or go all out with the glue and markers or whatever makes your heart happy. Write what you want out of life (family, kids (adopted or not), a castle, 100 dogs, whatever!). Go backwards from there.   Simplified  Ex: *I want to adopt and love a dog*—> how much does good daily care cost (food, water, monthly preventions, emergency care) and do I have a job to support that cost? —> Which veterinarian do you want to use? —> what type, size and age of dog would fit your lifestyle, home and poss allergens? —-> what color collar/bed/food dish will your dog have? —> are you buying from a breeder or adopting from a shelter? ..... then when you have the game plan you’ve established mini goals to reach your main objective.   Only you know what that is. Depression can hide those visions from us and make it difficult to see where we’re going and what we want to do. Self reflection and saying  “I enjoy traveling and the bustle of other countries” or “The curiosity of children amazes me” or “Bars and social interactions bring me joy” can help you figure out what jobs may be available in those things that make life tolerable.  Hope any of my rambling was helpful

I can feel myself breaking down right now. I just want a day where I can relax but I  keep getting more and more events that's way out of my comfort zone. I don't know if I'm prioritizing my mental health or just running away from all my fears if I don't attend. I'm so tired. Is it even considered a good opportunity if I really fear it? I envy others so much, social butterflies must have it easy to decide. I'm just the weird one who gets overwhelmed by things others considered easy. Then I can hear their slight remarks making fun of me. Maybe I'm just too sensitive and not meant for this. I just wonder if quitting something is considered good or bad. Generally quitting is seen in a negative light. But I wonder if quitting will benefit my mental health or I'm just running away.

REQUESTING SUPPORT
Everyone has different needs, and that's ok. Take time to figure out yours. If you need one day a week just for you, take it. Two days? Go for it. Maybe you can't handle social events two days in a row, and you need breaks in between. That's ok, too.   I will say, though, avoiding all your fears won't do you any favors. You can put yourself out there within your own limits. Know when to say no, or when to just go home.  Even the most confident people can experience social anxieties. Some just hide it better than others. Don't compare yourself to anyone else. You are not alone, and you're perfect just the way you are.
Hi Meh,  quitting is fine, it gives you an opportunity to focus your attention somewhere else.   I've quit jobs, housemates, and careers. Every time something better came along.   Eventually I started being more pro-active about what I wanted and about how to get it. Basically I had to learn a stack of skills for self awareness, curiosity, tiny risks, and outward focus (helping others). The skills make all the difference.   Skills meant I could solve problems (starting with very small problems). I've learned carpentry, plumbing, mechanicing, coding, plumbing, electrical, raising kids, and helping the elderly. I also wash dishes at every party (pre covid). I never start fancy, just "how can I help you".   Helping other people is an awesome skill and it makes you popular.   Try it :-)  Ping me any time

What did you make a mistake on? I'm curious because it's only January. I know most colleges let you apply pretty late for admission. Is this something you can call to correct? Or send an email?   Take a deep breath. Try to think through all your options.
Many registrars have online help or toll free phone numbers. Give it a try. Colleges want you (and your tuition) so I am sure you can get help or answers.

Are you seeing a therapist along with the medication you are taking? Medicine can make a huge difference in your daily life, and I'm glad it's helped you. Unfortunately, in some cases, it can be a band-aid to a much deeper problem that still needs to be addressed.  Is there something that works to motivate you specifically? Rewarding yourself? You bake your favorite treat on Saturdays if your apartment is clean. Competing with yourself? Make a list of accomplishments each day (eating and showering included!), And try to beat your list the next day. Accountability? Maybe you have a trusted friend or family member you can send daily pictures to in order to prove your cleaned your kitchen.   Do you exercise? You could start your day with an exercise video on YouTube, and once you get moving, it's often easier to keep moving.

I’m so sorry for the long post ahead.   I just need to get this off my chest now as I feel like I’m going to burst and cry any second. It’s almost 1 AM as I’m typing this and I have no one to talk to, as my family is already asleep. My next therapy appointment is this weekend so this is my only outlet for now.   It’s only been 7 days since 2021 started but I’ve been stuck in a depressing loop of waking up, dreading work, being stressed during work, stressing about work and pending work even after office hours, sleeping late then waking up to continue the cycle again.  I’m really grateful and fortunate to still have a job during this pandemic but lately, my job has taken a toll on my mental health. I’ve been stressed as work keeps piling up and I can’t keep up. I feel pressured as everything is urgent and I’m the only one handling it all, as my 2 team mates are still on maternity leave.  I don’t feel capable to handle all of this work especially as I’m still quite junior in my workplace.   I feel pressure because a lot of people are depending on me and I know the stress I feel right now, is nothing compared to the stress they are experiencing because they are in much higher positions. I really want to help them and do my best for the company, but everything just feels draining right now. I can’t perform to the best of my ability which leads me to have a lot of pending work. It’s so frustrating too because due to the big workload, I am unable to put my attention to other tasks and I leave them pending. I’m scared of the result if I leave them on pending any further.   I also can’t afford to take a leave i have a never-ending workload and especially, as I’m the only one left in our team for now.   I feel so paralyzed. Even though I know there’s a lot of work to do, I still worry and worry instead of actually taking action. I feel stuck.   I wish I can be one of those people who can work under pressure and under tight deadlines. I wish I can be one of those people who can still push through despite challenge in life. I wish I was not beaten up so easily by my problem. I am a weak and anxious person, and that is a fact.   I just honestly feel so unmotivated and burnt out. It’s dreadful to do any task, when there’s so many people depending on you and I can’t do everything with the limited time and abilities that I have.   I don’t know how I am going to get through this.   I know I just need to suck it up and power through this work, but right now - I just want to wallow in this sadness and self pity....then hopefully get over this slump and actually get it together.   Thank you for listening to my rant, if you have made it this far

I am experiencing something similar. You can send me a private message. We can maybe help each other. Ranting or just sharing what works best for you. You’re not alone in this. You got it!
Not sure if it will help but look up the 'prioritising work matrix', it's a good way of organising work.  Also speak to your Manager if you can.  I struggled as had other things going on and ended up off sick as I became overwhelmed, don't want you dealing with the same.
Thank you so so much! You’re very kind. I’ll DM you if ever I get the chance after all this craziness and busyness!
Thank you so much!! I’ll definitely check it out Everything just feels so crazy and overwhelming right now that even thinking about organizing, is a struggle 😅  Thank you for the recommendation, I appreciate it!

I have nothing particularly great about myself, and I've prided myself on my personality and for the most part I think I've been pretty nice. I've always wanted to be a person who can help friends when they are in need, or someone that others can rely on. I also really like dark/edgy humor which in itself isn't that bad because a lot of people like it to. The problem comes when I open my mouth. I try so hard not to say anything that someone might take offense to and yet I constantly hurt other people. It makes me feel so fucking useless because being nice to people is the only way I'm of any use to people and it's getting to the point where I just want to kill myself every single time I do something to someone. It physically and mentally hurts me whenever I slip up with the wording of a sentence I'm saying and it comes off as an insult. I just don't want to hurt people and yet that seems to be all I do and I can't stop. It doesn't matter how many good things I do or say if I just fuck it up every time I open my mouth. It's getting to the point where I just don't want to talk anymore. I'm starting to wonder if my presence is bothersome to people. I don't know how long I can keep doing this. My mental health has taken a turn for the worse and I can't help but think that people would just be better off without me.

So I have this habit of checking what my old school friends/people I used to know are doing these days on a semi regular basis. Every single time it makes me feel so worthless and like I should be achieving something like those people have (going to university mainly). I have dropped out twice from uni and have only a part time job now. I finished high school with the schools best diploma and I know I have all this potential that Im just wasting. Just writing this out makes me feel so awful and spikes my anxiety really bad. I dont know what to do, I feel like its embarassing that Im not in a university and all those other people are (Ik this is horribly selfish).   So if any of you is studying or have studied while having depression, how the hell do you do it? I feel like its never going to work out for me.

For the love of God, delete your socials, I did this not too long ago and it feels like a weight off your shoulders and that curiosity soon goes away.
I think the best first step is to acknowledge that even though your acquaintances seem to be doing well and succeeding, no one is going to show or tell the bad things are going through. It can be really damaging to fall into this hole of comparison, especially when you don’t even know all of the details about who you’re “up against”. Everyone’s got some type of shit that they don’t want to talk about going on. I would suggest deleting social media if that causes your stress. Also, it can be really motivating to focus on what you are doing and how you can be better in your current path of life than focusing on where you think you should be or where you went wrong.
It took me 8 years to get my undergrad degree, while everybody I went to high school with got it in 4 or under (and now I can’t even find a job in my career field, which is a whole other issue) It’s tough, but everybody is different and has to go at different paces. I think just going at my own pace really helped. There were some semesters I’d only take one or two classes and others where I took none, but I still got it completed eventually. it gets a lot easier once you get past all the gen ed courses and can start taking courses on what you’re really interested in.  I would also say branching out (which can be so difficult sometimes) and making friends in your classes can be really helpful. Lean on each other and work through the classes together, I wouldn’t of finished my degree without my classmates!  I also had to delete ALL my social media about 4 years in because I’d get so depressed and feel worthless because I wasn’t even near where all my old acquaintances were. Just try to focus on yourself and not look too much into whats posted on social media.
Instead of taking a full load do half a load or even one class. Maybe start off at a community college. Most legit schools have a mental health counselor talk to them for help. Get rid of your social media. I'm. In trade school and it's hard as hell when you feel like shit all the time trying to work full time and going to school.
I too deleted all of my social media (I just started reddit). You have to remember that social media is basically the highlights of everyone's life. No one posts when they're constipated or when their kid got an F on a math test.   I have a B.A., a B.S., a J.D. and an LL.M. and quite honestly, I don't remember how I coped during those stressful times.  Now that I'm on the cusp of 50, I've come to realize that all of that work, all of the material things, all the prestige is really meaningless. You can never compete with the world, so you need to find the things that don't make you depressed and you need to focus on those things. In the long run the only thing that matters is your mental and physical well-being. Forget about what you do, how much you make, even your grades.  Do your best of course, but you know what? A "D" in a creative writing elective means ZERO in the grand scheme of things. Focus on the things that are actually in your control, keep taking your meds (if any), talk to someone that understands you, keep a few meaningful relationships and work on them. You will see that once you lock in on yourself that what everyone else does will no longer matter to you because you'll be content with your own well-being.   Good luck to you!
Same but ive been exercising consistently for a few months now.   Just need to stop smoking weed and iil really feel ive made it.
I haven’t gotten to that age yet, but I have a similar problem. Something of an inferiority complex I suppose. Like some other people have said, deleting social media or just blocking them seems to be a good idea. And I’ve read a lot that going to a good university or college doesn’t make you successful. You definitely be very successful without it.   Best of luck to you, and I hope you get more helpful advice!
The best solution you have is also the simplest (but not the easiest, because this is far from easy) is to stop comparing to others. Because you will ALWAYS find an old friend that will perform better than you. Life is so. But if you define your life on how you perform compared to others... You will live only to do better than them. Not for yourself.   You have to find a path that fits YOU. Not a path to do better than others.  Stay yourself. Live for yourself.  Quit social media if needed.  But stop comparing to others, for the Lord's sake!

Medication and therapy would both be super useful. You can’t be happy comparing yourself to other people.  Whether you succeed or fail at anything, comparison will ruin it. A therapist will help you work through your insecurities and your thought pattern that defaults to this bad habit so you can craft better thought patterns.  The correct medication will help you do better in school.
In your case I think the quick band aid fix is to get off of social media (Facebook is probably the biggest one). What you see someone post on their profiles is sort of like when a person writes their own autobiography. They're often going to leave out the nasty coke habit, or drinking, their own personal depression, or anxiety. People post on those FB their job promotions or their vacations i.e. they're mostly just going to be showing off all the good parts of their lives, and little if any of the bad. You can't look at those people's profile and believe it all. It's a load of crap anyways. I got rid of FB like my profile part but I keep messenger for a couple old friends I keep in contact that way through. My mental health got so much better (although the main reason was because we were at about 3 months from Election Day here in the states and the toxicity and us vs them mentality was just so toxic to see from all these friends and family who I actually respect and care about). The effect was nearly instant on my headspace but I noticed not seeing all these lame ass humble brags from my peers on social media all the time. It felt good. Who cares I'll likely never see them again they're virtual strangers.  The tougher fix here is stitching up the wounds of depression. I, speaking just for myself, took SSRIs for many years and while they did help me be less depressed, I noticed they also seemed cause me to not experience joy the way I used to. I noticed it just dulled all my emotions, which was good because I wanted to die when I started taking them. My brain's only emotions were sadness and fatigue, the occasional panic attack. So those being my only real emotions, if we can just call them that, I was helped greatly by the SSRIs. They got me to where I could get out of bed and do things and be productive and do things that made me proud of myself. But after a while when my life got better I wanted to come off them so I did. No horror story here, the only real effect was my bowel movement schedule changed and I lost weight, and of course the dreaded but basically harmless brain zaps. The mildest of mild when it comes to drug withdrawal effects (speaking as an American former heroin user from the NE section of the country, the brain zaps are an annoyance at worst). Now that my life is in a better place with my job and family and all that, I manage my depression by taking what you could call psilocybin therapy. I grow mushrooms but I have no interest in becoming a drug dealer again, so I have more magic mushrooms than I know what to do with. I give them to friends away for free or I try to most people feel weird taking them for free so they'll donate me some goodies, like a few pills of some narcotic they've had in the medicine cabinet for years. It is going well so far a few months into it.  I hope this helps. Best of luck to you.
Get away from your triggers. Get the fuck off social media, all you're doing is purposefully hurting yourself. Find something that excited you. Study it.   Also get professional help, as much as you can. Try talking to a pcp about antidepressants. Seek out a therapist if you can.  As for feeling like a failure or like you're wasting your time, I find that journaling helps. I'd make a small list of small tasks to complete in a day and check them off. It helps to have a visual for the things I am actually doing. And it could be as simple as taking a shower. It may not seem like much, but its practicing self care and healthy habits which *is* important. This helps build self motivation.   Btw, I'm 23 and just started college last year. It's not a race. There's no set timeline. Just focus on you and *your* timeline.
Delete Facebook. The best thing I ever did
Same with me, everyone I know is doing better than I am. I used to be really smart and ambitious but now I’m doing worse than everyone and I can’t blame anyone but myself. It’s on me at the end of the day
The best advice.
I deleted most of them a few years ago, still have facebook though. I really need to delete it too.
I deleted all social media close to 6 months ago now that seems forever! Lol. Then I downloaded reddit for the first time and don’t get that extra anxiety from scrolling anymore 😇🌈
Thank you for the advice! Ik comparison is really damaging for my self esteem. I just cant seem to get over it. I have deleted most of my social media although I still have facebook because I needed it for the second university I dropped out of...
Thank you this really helped. Im just not that social and being in the beginning activities the last time gave me so much anxiety, I couldnt believe it. Also I dont really have any interestes so deciding what to possibly try to study is also very difficult.
Upvoted esp for the comment about mental health counseling. Many uni’s (at least in the states) offer free mh to students for a certain number of sessions. Idk if this is something that would work for you, but tbh a strong motivator for me to keep going to class and studying was knowing that if I dropped out, I wouldn’t have access to that resource any more.
Yes that could be very helpful, the problem is that the first few weeks are so chaotic and overwhelming that I feel so like quitting right there and that it will never work out. The anxiety of those first weeks are so bad. Maybe I need some counselling so I can get through it.
Thanks you! Thats really difficult to do but I can always try.
Comparasion is the thief of joy I know. Its just so hard to let go of it.
This is exactly how I feel, I have this stupid sense of pride or whatever that I SHOULD be highly educated already and in a good job. Good to know Im not the only one. And yes I really should just delete my facebook, its the only social I have left.
Ive been on meds for about a year or so and they do help a lot. And Im also in process of getting to therapy (its a bit tricky where I live). But yes these are the things Im definitely going to try to work on in therapy.
Thank you, Im happy you got past your difficulties. Im on meds but the goal is to definitely get off of them some day. And yes I know people dont tend to share their struggles publically but they are still acheiving something great and Im not.
Journaling is something I havent tried in a while, but I should try it again, thank you. Its just seems that the small things arent enough. And Ive taken some of those other steps but weirdly I feel like theres no chance of ever "recovering" whatever that means.
Delete facebook too. And spend some time with yourself (not alone). Spending time with yourself is very helpful.  And read BHAHWAD GEETA AS IT IS. (not modified version). It will give your clarity of life.
Yes, the ‘get to know you activities’ are ridiculous lol with my anxiety it always helped to have pre-picked facts about me in my mind, or even written down, before going so I didn’t feel as unprepared and didn’t have an anxiety attack trying to come up with something before my turn. In regards to not knowing what to study, I took some introductory courses to different subjects before deciding on my major. I would take the 100 level course on any more specified subject I had ever thought of having a career in so I could see if I actually enjoyed it. I know that’s not the best for some people because it is work, but it was fun to learn about different things and being able to know for sure I was moving into the right field. Some gen ed courses also helped me with this, as I knew I didn’t wanna do anything in science because I hated all my science courses
For sure, it's difficult to do.  I didn't mean to imply that it was easy for me or should be for you. There were times I couldn't even bring myself to get out of bed because life just seemed so pointless. And people told me, like I'm telling you, that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  At that point in my life I just couldn't see it, like you probably can't.  The tunnel is different lengths for everyone, but I am proof that there truly is an end to it.  You just have to do whatever it is you have to do to get there.  The hell with what anyone thinks about you or how you feel. No one knows what it's like unless they've walked a mile in your shoes.  Just find a way to fight, even if it's for a second.  Every second you don't give in to dark thoughts is a victory. Never forget that and find what works for you. There are free services if you can't afford a Dr. and/or therapy.  Confide in someone beyond reddit.  It is ok to ask for and to seek help.  Even though you think it's pointless, I'm telling you that you NEED to do it. You can and you WILL beat this terrible thing.  Just the simple fact that you posted on here proves that there is a glimmer in you that knows you want to and, more importantly, that you know you CAN.
I know.   But I also know that you will manage to let it go.  Stay strong champ!
Folks rise and fall. You sound like you’ve got nowhere else to go but up. Enroll in a uni class, take a hands on interest in something that takes you out of your head. I did hard drugs for 10 years and afterwards I got very depressed from just not having anywhere to put all that energy. I realized I had no real hobbies or interests, depression and addiction made drugs my only “hobby.” Someone got me a cheesy little aerogarden for Xmas the year I stopped (automates indoor plant growing system but done cheaply you can get them for $100) and it developed into this huge interest in growing plants and then eventually fungi cultivation as well. I think without out that hobby I would have hit the block at some time in these last 3 years (hit the block meaning scoring drugs. All the street corners where to score have stayed the same in Philly for years so I know where to go and don’t need to know any one to score. It’s an open air market in multi block sections of a certain neighborhood in the city). But anyways really delving into something new and learning it helped my depression greatly. I started this while still on the meds.
Well that's why you gotta find that thing that excites you. Find something to look forward to. What did you try studying before?
Thanks for the advice!
Unfortunately in my country you cant choose a major after going to uni, you apply to certain major and cant change it. I would love to have a system like that here too. And all the get to know you stuff here is basically hazing and revolves around drinking which makes it sooo much more uncomfortable.
This really helps. Thank you!!
Thank you!
I was in law school and then physical therapy school. I could see my self doing both of them but nothing has ever really excited me. And I dont think the problem was the subjects necessarily.
May I also recommend the book “A course in Miracles”. Something that’s helping me right now
Keep fighting!
Do you have any hobbies?
I used to have a lot. I like a lot of sports, muay thai is the most recent one. Also I like reading and playing drums. But I dont really do those I dont know why and the covid stopped my muay thai practise and now Im too scared to go back for whatever reason.
Have you considered studying education? You could literally teach anything if you're ok working with kids/teenagers. That's always been my back up honestly. Right now I'm studying engineering but I do still plan on teaching at some point in my life.   Hell you could even study music. You dont need to go into some super money making field to be successful.
Teaching is definitely a possibility since I work with kids now. The field isnt the main problem is more like the ability to actually be in school and study. Both times it has felt just so incredibly overwhelming to physically be there and I have this strong feeling to just get the hell out of there. Also Im not musical enough to study it. Its stupid hard to get into art/music universities here.
Community college is the way to go. Maybe that's why you're overwhelmed.

So I’m just honestly kinda Grey towards everything that happening right now where my depression kicks it self up to 11 just so I don’t know how to feel. Let me explain   So I’m an 18 male about to go to college I should be happy I got into such a good school and i can use things like tinder and other adult ish items. Then the news comes on, pro trump rally raids the fucking congress building and all hell let’s loose I can help but state feeling nothing as my mind absorbs all of the chaos and I just can’t stop myself it’s everywhere, and I fear civil war 2 or ssm like that may be among us. Idk I could honestly just use a friend or anything like that right now or at least help understanding what will actually happen

Each day gets worse than the day before. My life has fallen apart over the last 9 months. I had everything and failed to realize it. I’m at the bottom. I’m going to lose my job, I have no place to live. I want to die. I hope I die. The only thing that would help is turning back the clock. I cannot handle this anymore. I want to die.

Everyone hits the bottom every now and then, I just did too. You just have to start again and learn from your mistakes. These things happening to you can be turned around or atleast worked through until they get better. Don’t worry. You’ll see the other side
I have been feeling the same way from the past 2 months. I can actually feel you. But please hold on. I really don't know what to say but I am sure it's not the best decision. Please hold on and seek help. Please reach out.
Chill! It's hard but you're gonna manage to do things right. I had the same mentality these days. I'm still not well, but I got over the idea of getting fired. It's an ugly job anyway so I'll probably leave this job at some point in the future. I live with my parents and 30 cats and dogs so. .
I hear you and I've been there and I got better and you can too.  Suicide is a permanent solution to what is hopefully a temporary problem.  When I feel horrible, I can only seen why things won't get better.  But, when you feel better, you may be able to glimpse the possibility that you will get another job, that you might be able to sleep on a friend's couch or go to a shelter if need be.  I don't know you or your circumstances but believe me you are not alone. People care. I care. Please reach out to a friend, therapist or help line.  Please write more and let us know how else we can help.
If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out. You can find help at a National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  USA: 18002738255 US Crisis textline: 741741 text HOME  United Kingdom: 116 123  Trans Lifeline (877-565-8860)  Others: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines  https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org
It can get a little better. And then some simple attractive distraction comes
How are you coping with what's been happening in your life?  What are you doing?   I know it can feel like there's nothing you can do (I watched the Capital of our country be overrun today) but what is there that you have done (I voted, that's all I can do).  We got a horribly high bill today for utilities. We adjusted our way of living to reduce it in the future.   Concentrate on what you Have already Done or Can Do.   The world is crazy right now. It sucks. You're not going through this suck alone. It sucks for everyone. You have to outlive this suck. Outlive this era.  2020 didn't kill you. You survived it. That's an accomplishment in itself.   I don't know what hardships 2020 brought to you especially but I know it was unbearable. That's legit. Feeling awful about the state of the world and the last year is Reasonable and Healthy.   It will get better.   You can find help from a support group, crisis center, faith community, teacher or other trusted person.   What's causing you to feel so bad, you specifically?   What would make you feel better?  How can others help you? Honestly, it seems silly,  sometimes I just need someone to make a phone call for me. Ask for the help you need, even if it seems impossible or silly.  You can develop new ways to cope and you can feel better about life again.   If you are in the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (800-273-8255) to reach a trained counselor.
Thank you for the kind words. The problem is no one or nothing can help me. Nothing changes the facts. It may sound silly to some, but I ruined my own life for dumb reasons and lost someone, the only thing that mattered. I lost my whole future and one of the the worst parts is that now I see it was all my own fault. There is no getting better, moving forward, coping or otherwise feeling any differently. I’ve been trying to “get better” and things just get worse. I don’t want any life except the one I stupidly gave up. The only way past this is not be on this earth anymore which is the relief I beg for every day.

I quit my job due to depression, anxiety and overall stress, along with sleep problems. I do have a second income, it just isn't very much. I would go to work, sleep, wake up and eat, then sleep again, then work and repeat. I'm always very tired, I always fall asleep driving, usually many many micro-sleeps. I have disturbing dreams. I have disturbing intrusive thoughts.... my panic attacks involve crying and gagging uncontrollably. I've never had any type of therapy but my general doctor recommended me try to get psychiatric help.. I can't afford it right now. I don't really know why I'm posting this here I guess just to see what other people think about it, or have any sort of advice.   22 yo , female

First of all, good job walking away from a job that wasn't right for you. Your mental health is more important than a pay check. Money is obviously necessary, but not at the expense of your well being. Other jobs, maybe with fewer hours, might be better for you right now.  How are you currently handling your nightmares? I suggest writing them down when you wake up. Writing down the details might help you face them, and take away their power.   Have you tried this method for panic attacks... When they start, go through your 5 senses. List 5 things you can see, 4 things you can hear, 3 things you can feel, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. It might help bring you back to the present, and help calm you.  Have you noticed any triggers for your panic attacks? Things you could avoid for now?
I was in a state you described. I would recommend doing a simple blood test if it's affordable to check your iron and vitamins level. If what you described also goes along with something of the following symptoms: difficulty to concentrate, hair loss, constant fatigue, cold hands/feet, weight loss, etc then maybe your depression and anxiety and sleep problem are caused by insufficiency of certain vital elements. If so then it's pretty easy to fix. It might not be the magic pill but it will certainly help and gives you strength to fix mental health as well. A lot of people with depression and anxiety suffer from vitamins and minerals deficiency and are unaware that simply correcting their diet can make a huge difference. Ofc I'm not saying that will make everything go away but it will make you feel better, stronger, healthier. It will give you that energy you're lacking to start improving your life. I hope you'll give it a chance and I hope it helps and you feel better.
I did not write this but I think it might be something you could use right now.  &#x200B;   Right now, there are people all over the world who are just like you. They’re either lonely, they’re missing somebody, they’re depressed, they’re hurt, they’re scared of the past, they’re having personal issues no one knows about, they have secrets you wouldn’t believe. They wish, they dream and they hope. And right now, they are sitting here reading these words, and I’m writing this for you so you don’t feel alone anymore. Always remember, don’t be depressed about the past, don’t worry about the future, and just focus on today. If today’s not so great don’t worry! Tomorrow’s a new chance. If you are reading this, be sure to share this around to make others feel better. Have a nice day! One of the ways to feel positive energy is to take your attention away from the negative and focus on everything that transmits positivity to you. Have a beautiful day!
I get my blood checked regularly as I have hypothyroidism, and everything has been normal lately. thank you for the advice!
Well it could be other hormone or element you do not normally check, because well human body has a lot of them. I also can suggest get a second opinion of your blood test if not from another doctor then somewhere online, because recently my specialist explained that what you see in test results as normal might not be normal at all, it's all connected and depends on one another, to interpret it correctly the doctor needs to know a lot about you in order not to miss anything. I've been searching for a problem for years until I came across one specialist who explained me that I was seeing it all wrong and most docs are too lazy to see a complex pattern. When it comes to mental health it's even more complex. I heard there's a discord server (posted in the beginning of this community page) that helps people. I had no money on therapist when I really needed it, but internet can provide a lot to help. Best of luck to you!

Hi there, I'm laying on my couch unable to get up as I type this. I've suffered from depression and  social anxiety for about two years now and have never quite found a way to battle the extreme fatigue that i experience bause of my illnesses.  How can I get stuff done in spite of my fatigue? Its extremely important for me to focus on school right now, as my finals are coming up. I know exercise is said to be helping with fatigue, but like i said i cant even get up right now, because revising for an hour exhausted me so much.  Im sorry for any mistakes in spelling english is my second languague and im just too tired to care

I have the same problem due to depression/anxiety/fibromyalgia. My psychologist has suggested stimulants in the past but is worried that the stimulant will make my anxiety worse. Really I just try to get as much sleep as I can at night and then I try to take a small nap during the day.   Sorry that's not much help but I feel your pain.
Thanks, at least we're not alone in this :)

I have battled depression and anxiety most of my life; after kids it has increased to the point of needing medication. While I’m on 150mg of Zoloft for two years now, I have begun to have random moments of depression or random anxiety. Mostly depression though; just moments that feel bleak and sad. They tend to resolve in a few hours, and crop up about once a week. Normal? Not normal? Something I should consider upping my dosage for?

I'm on zoloft (sertraline), 300mg.  I started at 100mg 25 yrs ago and slowly had to increase as for me it tends not work as well over time.  I've experienced exactly what you are describing and for me, an increase in dosage solved it (at least for a number of years)
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kru72b/self_caused_depressioninsecurities/
I've struggled with my appearance for years. It didn't really become apparent until I really started noticing my flaws. I think it stems from my fear of being a lone, because a part of me is afraid to be a lone. But at the same time I've had countless people tell me I'm not ugly, I'm cute, sexy etc. I also hate to admit this but I've dated and done other things with over 28 different people (I'm not bragging I actually hate this about me), and I'm only usually single long enough for me to actually try to date which is usually a few months or a little longer, so its not like I'm waiting years or countless months for a new person so I really don't understand why I hate my appearance? I'm also constantly changing my appearance whether it be my hair style, facial hair, whatever because of the fear of being a lone and when the panic attacks happen I change my appearance to what I think people will like. So how do I just go with the flow and be myself appearance wise? Basically how do I stop trying to fit in and please people and stop hating my appearance.  I've also had it pounded into my head that no one wants to be friends with people who they don't find attractive (please tell me this is not how it actually is) so I'm also worried about looking good enough for just friends.

I’m really sorry to hear that you feel this way too :(  Having extreme insecurities sucks especially because so many people just don’t understand how bad it is and think it’s just “overreacting”.  But I have a little quote that I thought of a few months ago that really really helped me improve and it’s “people may appreciate you for your looks but they will truly love you for what your soul is and the things you do”. So basically just look at your outside appearance as a way of expressing your true self, your soul and change your looks based on how *you* like it. People will look at you and see who you really are and if they don’t like it then so be it, real friends and people who really will love you will see you as your unique self and that, unlike looks, will never fade :)  (and friendship is never about looks but about personality and uniqueness!) I hope this can help a little bit, I really hope you’ll be able to feel better and realize that you are beautiful because you are yourself!
I'm so proud of you writing this. Your heart and your desire to be in healthy relationships with others -- and yourself -- is beautiful, powerful, and also rare which is why it's causing you so much agony. You weren't made to fit it. You were created to stand out, to be unapologetically you, to use YOUR voice, and to lead rather than follow. Your vulnerability is a superpower, and I celebrate you using it.  I wrote this for another friend going through something similar, and it applies to you 100% as well:  You. Reading this right now.  Yes...YOU!  I’m going to tell you something, and I need you to pay close attention.  I need you to tune out every distraction, and I need you to be here with me right now.  Are you ready?  This is huge.  This is life-changing.  This might also be terrifying for you, but you need to hear it.  IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT.  I don’t care what it is you’re blaming yourself for. Whether it’s for your best never being good enough or your life not turning out the way you wanted it to, it doesn’t matter.  IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT.  You’ve made mistakes you based solely on the information you had to go on at the time,  IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT.  If you’ve never been taught the truth of who you are or how to unapologetically show up in life, how can you blame yourself for not knowing?  Or maybe you’re blaming yourself for knowing better, but you’ve never been taught the skills to actually do better.  Maybe you’ve tried a few (hundred) self-help books, courses, seminars, but nothing ever sticks.  IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT.  We live in a very selfish, hurried, distracted, society that’s set up for surviving rather than thriving. Segregation over community. Judgment instead of understanding. Conclusions without conversations.  If you’ve never had anyone speak life into you, to pay attention to you and acknowledge you for just you being you, it’s really hard to believe you’re worthy of anything good happening to you. It becomes a struggle to want to try.  I’ll say it again...  IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT.  There are no longer boundaries, and morals are faded shades of grey. We’ve all become masterful dancers as we try to avoid stepping on anyone’s feeling all in the name of “love.”  So IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT you don’t know how to use your own voice, to confidently offer your wisdom, or to just get through a day without hearing the voices of your past reminding you of all your flaws and shortcomings.  IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT you didn’t even know you HAVE a voice. And IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT you didn’t know you have a CHOICE.  So the first thing I want you to do for me right now is say something out loud. I don’t care where you are, who you’re with, or how stupid you might feel.  I’ll give you another three seconds to quit fighting with me and yourself about doing it. Ready?  One.  Two...  Three!  “IT’S NOT MY FAULT, AND I FORGIVE MYSELF FOR NOT KNOWING WHAT I DIDN’T KNOW!”  Okay, now I want you to actually say it out loud.  DO IT.  GO!  “IT’S NOT MY FAULT, AND I FORGIVE MYSELF FOR NOT KNOWING WHAT I DIDN’T KNOW!”  And then I’d start journaling. I’d get all the lies, blame, hurt, and gunk out of my head and onto paper…and I’d burn it! Then I’d “lather, rinse, repeat.” I’d do this as many times as I needed to in order to get all the emotions and anger out so I could make space for truth and my real self to show up, unpack, and take up residence. I’d stick with it until I started to believe, then almost believed, then believed a little more, then believed enough to try it out, then believed enough to trust that I have a purpose and I was created for such a time as this.  You know how why I’d give my younger self this advice? Because it’s what I did to now be free from depression, bulimia, and the "lie-dentity."  Rabbi Daniel Lapin says, “The opposite of depression is not happiness. The opposite of depression is purpose.”  Find your voice. Speak your truth with love and respect. Renew your mind. Refresh your perspective. Restore your true identity. Walk in your purpose (which will become more and more clear the more you embrace your true self).  I believe in you, and I can promise you it's 10000% not true that people don't want to be friends with "unattractive" people. Those are the types of people who don't know how to show up authentically and are looking for ways to make themselves feel better because they too have been taught wrong.  ...and that's not your fault either.  I really am proud of you, and I know you've got amazing things you want to do with your life and in this world. You now have permission to leave the lies behind you and start living your life "off mute." We need to hear what you have to say. You matter, and so do your words.

I haven’t left my apartment in over a week. I haven’t spoken to anyone in over a week.  I am out of meds that help me sleep so I only fall asleep maybe in the morning and sleep for an hour or more than 12 hours. I have some other meds that don’t even help and I am thinking of taking them all at the same time so I could sleep. I am just laying in my bed, I eat maybe once a day, I dont really do anything. I make plans but they’re good for nothing. I am sick, I feel trapped.  I am a 27 year-old female. I live in Scandinavia, I am beautiful, tall and skinny, I study in university.   I feel like there is no space for people like me to talk about their problems on the internet (or is there, I wouldnt know because I am too ashamed of myself as a person to even talk anonymously online).  I am not taken seriously even though I’m very sick and have been for over ten years now. I suffer from severe depression, eating disorder and personslity disorders. I’ve tried everything, all kinds of meds, psychotherapy, ECT. I can’t take it anymore, I don’t know what to do.   This isn’t life

I don’t know why I wrote this. There isnt anyone to talk to. Even if there were I would be too embarassed as all I ever talk about is how sick I am. I visited family in christmas. I couldn’t stay for long as I am so ashamed of myself and a burden to everyone. Me being there only reminds them of everything bad I have caused.   I was messaging few friends in a group chat but it has been over a week and I just disappeared, no one notices. I could have been dead for days, I could be lying here dead for like two weeks at least. It is nighttime now and I have been awake only a few hours. I just want to sleep

I've come to learn setting goals is a good way to make myself proud. I say something I want to do and when I do it I feel a little bit of pride in myself rather than hatred for myself.   So a couple days ago, I wrote down all my goals for this year and I want to encourage everyone else to do it too. The rules I made for my goals are:  1) I have all year to do them 2) Don't get too discouraged, just try my best  3) The goals can't be in regards to other people. Ex. No "make new friends"  So I decided I'll try to finish my book, work out 3-4x a week, learn a new instrument, work on my youtube channel, try journaling and so on.  I wanted to share this with everyone and encourage everyone to try too. Set some goals that are reachable in the year's time. Write them down and keep it with you.  Good luck everyone. Let's try to have a good year :)

My depression and anxiety is something I have always battled with, however after suffering a job loss in 2018 and a relapse after that in 2019, I am at the end of my ropes.   My lack of interest in everything scares me. I feel like I don't care about anyone or anything, especially myself. Nor do I care about my old hobbies: playing piano, singing, writing music, driving my car down new roads, socializing, & may I also note I have completely isolated myself in my room. Being in your late 30s and doing this is something I never thought would happen to me.   The word unwell is defined as being in poor health. Depression could not be described better. I feel like my health has deteriorated ever since my depression started.  MatchBox 20's song "Unwell" is now playing on repeat in my head.   I took another job this year and guess what?! I lasted a WHOPPING TWO DAYS! The meds aren't working, all I want to do is sleep, and I was never a lazy person before, but as a famous celebrity depression sufferer once said,"with depression you just want to crawl in a corner and die."-Chester Bennington  I want my old life back so badly with my old career...Any advice on how to get this black cloud above my head to turn blue again?  And in case you're wondering the lyrics to Matchbox 20's "Unwell" song I listed below:  All day starin' at the ceilin' makin' Friends with shadows on my wall All night hearing voices tellin' me That I should get some sleep Because tomorrow might be good for somethin' Hold on, feelin' like I'm headed for a breakdown And I don't know why  But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell I know, right now you can't tell But stay a while and maybe then you'll see A different side of me  I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired I know, right now you don't care But soon enough you're gonna think of me And how I used to be, me  I'm talkin' to myself in public, dodging glances on the train And I know, I know they've all been talkin' about me I can hear them whisper, and it makes me think There must be somethin' wrong with me Out of all the hours thinkin',…  Chorus repeat.

Sorry to hear you are struggling with this. May I ask what your previous career was?
Thank you for your concern.   My career was in management for a renound retail chain working my way up the corporate ladder.

It made my body to itch every time when i get stressed even in small things, that you don’t even notice but your body does and it’s affecting my daily life. I have healthy lifestyle exercise often, sleep well but It doesn’t change anything. I lost my emotions, no interest in everything.i have every possible symptoms of depression. It made my personalty reversed. I’m naturally open-minded extrovert but now i cant even make eye contact with strangers if i do i feel dizzy . I have depression like 4 years, and recently I noticed i got OCD and signs of bipolar. People see im getting better outside, but the thing is my view of life and meaning gets worser and worser overtime.

Hey man. I find it respectable that you're seeking help for this, it is a very tough time for you and can be utter anguish to endure.   I actually do the same thing during stress or when overly hot and break into itches. I'd like to ask if you're right now receiving mental support from any professionals? Losing emotions, lost interest, all of that is very concerning. I'd say seeing someone is a really great idea, and also checking in with your doctor as there are physical things that can cause this though very unlikely. I heavily implore you to do so if you're not already. Being more secure in what you're experiencing is never a bad thing and eliminating other causes.   Secondly, I'd say also trying to pursue your hobbies and interests more and investing yourself into them would be really good to do in spite of the lost of interest. You don't have to make yourself do anything if it would actively make you feel worse, but retaining a sense of normality can be very helpful in these types of situations.    If something in your life is making you stressed - and it's not causeless - as to where it's affecting you on a daily basis then please ask for accommodations, take a break, or stop doing it if it's causing you this much distress. Taking a break isn't weakness, it's recognizing your mental health is important. With the cause of this being either physiological or mental, there aren't many things you can do physically to stop it. However, there are certainly things you can help get along with it in the meantime.   Asides from that, there is a couple coping mechanisms. One is intellectualization. In short, it's using rationality to  block confrontation with negative emotions;  it involves removing one's self, emotionally, from a stressful event, and thinking about it logically. There is something called over-intellectualization where it's used in excess, but in moderance it's good to regain control. Mindfulness is also highly recommended by psychologists.   I really hope you can find relief man. Best of luck.
First of all thank you for your reply. Right now Im not receiving any mental support from professionals. Second of all, I found about that I have a depression 2 years ago. I did some research “what is depression?” , “how to cure it” so after doing it I stopped playing video games that was making me more distant from people, I was addicted to it. And started doing workout, read, meditate, to invest myself, i started listen to podcasts (totally about 100-200hours). I finally found what I like and i was kind of happy, ambitious. I finally set goals and dreams that I never had before. I got great body, good grooming and etc. but all these things didn’t gave me any confidence.  And lastly, one of things that makes me sad or stressed is my family, it’s uncomfortable to talk like this but they’re kinda toxic, recently i had  weeks that everyday i had panic attack and crying few hours before sleep. Then i decided its bad to be with my family around 6pm-10pm so I started to sleep at 6pm to not cry and panic. And to add, Im so confused every time when i stressed. It feels like I have to person inside me which have opposite personalities. For example Im having kind and caring thoughts then suddenly egoistic and different like every thoughts of mine is mixed wired its hard to explain. Feels like im going crazy. (I had OCD in so stressful times before like  thinking about “am i gay?” but hardest is like im going to kill somebody like instant thoughts it was so bad that i self-harmed to stop that kind of thoughts. I think im okay now but im scared that that thought will come back because of quarantine or virus.
No worries man. I'm happy to help. Definitely give yourself props for doing so much and really changing your lifestyle for the better. You really did well and it takes a lot of dedication man. Good on you.  Gotcha. So, what are your thoughts on receiving support from a professional and seeing your GP for some testing? If you have any concerns I'd be happy to squash em with you. Because I know that personally, when I started seeing someone it was intimidating as ever and felt like it would do nothing. The first one didn't. But I'm trying with another and I have high hopes; being able to just tell someone about these things can help a lot.   I saw you mentioned that your family is toxic. Now, I'm not sure to what extent you're talking about, but seems like it could be a major roadblock for recovery. Take it as what it is as I'm only 14, so y'know. If they are giving your panic attacks, anxiety, stress, and - seems like to me - depression, then I'd really try to spend as much time to yourself as possible. Spending less time with them, getting a professional to make them stop, cutting contact (if possible), and/or talking about it with them I'd definitely recommend. I'd say to try and surround yourself with positive people in contrast to your family's toxicity, it can really help balance their negativity on you.   And as for these thoughts that just pop in, I think what you're talking about, and I'll link to a page about it, is intrusive thoughts. This isn't a diagnosis or anything, but it's basically thoughts that appear usually repeatedly, randomly, and persistently. And they're usually dark or related to harm or fears/worries. Therapists are usually actually really good with dealing with those, regardless of if it's OCD, depression, or whatever.  I know I personally don't want to see you hurt yourself to get relief from what you're experiencing, so I hope we can talk this over. And this is my opinion, I'd say to try to avoid self-diagnosing if you are doing it. Saying you have traits of something or using it as a guide is fine, but using it as set in stone is kinda bad without professional guidance.
Thank you for your time dude.

I'm looking for some advice. I've really been struggling over the last couple of weeks. I live alone, I don't have any friends or partner and I have spent the majority of the last year isolated and alone.   Spending so much time alone means that I'm constantly over thinking things, dwelling on the past, beating myself up over mistakes, even things that happened years ago, everything feels like it's a much bigger problem than it is.   How can I leave all this behind? I know that I can't change the past, what's done is done, I can only learn from my mistakes in the future, but I just can't let things go.   I don't enjoy life and I have nothing to look forward to. I don't want to die or anything like that, but I am sick of constantly being miserable and worrying about everything, unfortunately distractions only work for so long. I'm not just alone as in I'm the only person here but I feel alone, I feel cut off from the outside world.   Can anyone suggest a way to feel better?

I'm pretty much in the same place as you and wish I had the answer. It feels like being given a locked chest and a sack full of keys with only one that might work. I know it's not great but the only strategy I have is seeing how the land lies each day. Even opening the curtains counts as a plus.
I can say what I think - emphasis on think - would be best in the situation. What you've already done is identified the problem, you know why and what's happening. That's the first half of the battle. Now you have to problem solve while additionally taking care of your emotional health. I'm sorry that you're dealing with this.  First off, isolation and people. Overthinking and isolation come hand and hand. I know, it's always recommended, but therapy or a doctor isn't a bad thing to do here. However, I do think there isn't necessarily-necessity for it or a precedent to need it, as you haven't yet tried out other solutions. At least from what it seems you're saying here; if you've gotten professional help or tried particular things please share. From my perspective, due to all of this together, it seems you are having some problems with yourself, as it is. Your brain is analyzing everything that's happening and is knocking you down. That implies something is amiss. Whether intrusive thoughts, low self-confidence, or whatever it may be, it's something. I would like to ask why do you think you're doing this, whether subconsciously or intentionally. Why is it you feel you don't know many people? I feel this is a significant portion of it.  Secondly,  I'd say self-development is almost always something beneficial: it'd take up time spent with intrusive thoughts and overthinking, it'd help you improve yourself and your self-confidence (even if that is not the issue here), plus help socially. Self-development is very wide, so it can be fitness oriented, socializing, discovering new hobbies, improving your environment (an extension of yourself; so like food, security, rest, financials, etc), or just whatever you'd like to pursue. Thereafter, you can invest yourself or push yourself into them. Something that can drive you and you're passionate about.   I really respect your drive to get better, it can be very hard to take that initial step and can be the difference between getting better or not. I like suggesting going by the Human Hierarchy of Human Needs when finding directions to go in and achieving each one (save for reproduction). Though the stages may overlap at times or be pursued in different orders. That's just me. Pursuing what your interested in is truly the main thing. Once you find that one thing that can improve your mood even a bit, investing yourself into it and using it as your drive or passion is vital, at least in my perspective. I really hope the best for you. Feel free to let me know your thoughts.
Thanks for your reply. Sorry to hear you're struggling too. Some days are better than others for me but over the last few weeks things have been worse than ever, hopefully things will get better soon.
Thanks for your reply, the reason I feel so alone is because I am alone, I have social anxiety and I haven't been able to make any friends over the last decade, I've been unemployed for over a year and my country has been in and out of lockdown over the past year meaning I've been stuck at home, on my own. The only person I've had regular contact with over the last year is my Mother and while I do appreciate everything she has done for me, the contact we've had has only been once or twice a week.   I like your suggestion of self development, I've tried different ways to keep myself occupied over the last year and although it starts off well I soon lose interest and end up back where I started, it seems to be a never ending cycle. I am trying to leave the house atleast a couple of times a week now, I've been going on short walks and I always feel a bit better afterwards, once the weather starts to improve I'll be able to go on longer walks.

I want to help someone who doesn't want to visit therapists. Often talks and confines in me. It's taking a tow on me to, but I'm happy to take a part of burden. Is there someone who could give me some advice and points how to help this person.

I'm sorry to hear about what's happening, along with the toll it's taking. It can be really stressful and you seem like a really good person. I think more information would be really helpful; but with what we have, I'll have to answer in a lot of hypothetical "if" advices.  If you're ultimately seeking them to have progression and to see betterment then them refusing to seek professional support is very limiting. However, if they are open to advice and not just venting, then ultimately it's what you think is best for their issue. Suggesting them to find more hobbies or participating in self-developmental interests, finding friends along the way, getting closer to family, calling a hotline, practicing mindfulness, etc.  Although, them being open to advice and changing their situation may not happen. They may just be venting and not wanting any advice or thoughts. What then? Well, then them having progression is very, very unknowable. Because they would not be changing or open to putting in effort they wouldn't be "fixing" the issue (not sure what's happening to them, so not sure if it's caused by something). Therefore, it would have to be taken care of by a 3rd party/fix itself - or, if the issue is purely mental, then you could only hope it resolves by itself somehow.  Essentially, without having much knowledge of the situation, if it's close to the last paragraph then I could only recommend accepting that them getting better is essentially unknowable - or, possibly unlikely - if you're opposed to stopping helping them or being a soundboard. Otherwise, if you're not opposed, then I'd personally suggest being straightforward with them. Asking them to please seek help sympathetically but matter-of-factly and saying that you cannot help them solely yourself and you'd need them to get help for your support to be effective.  If it's closer to the second paragraph, then it's must simpler. Simply listening and giving advice in a positive way, and without judging (depending on how tolerable they are/stable).  This is my opinion.
Il dm you with more details, i can't send u message. If u could send it to me id be grateful.

Ok but you have a lovely room. Easier said than done but you gotta keep it clean. Keeping things clean is what helps me get by. But I live with my big family and they're lowkey lazy. But they can't touch my room. I always try to at least keep my room clean. I'm so proud of it. I find pride in something to be a big help for me.   But I also think a nice clean environment can help you from constantly saying, "I hate this place"  Good job on picking yourself up. It's hard but you did it!
I’m so proud of you, that’s one of the most difficult things to accomplish but it’s relieving once you do it :)
SO! proud! of! you! that’s huge! and it’s inspiring me to get rid of my broken dresser (which... broke because i loaded it with too many identical black sweatshirts / leggings for Bad Days) 👍
Nice, that's one of the hardest things to do.
Oooh that was a very satisfying before and after! I'll try to do the same!
Now that's what's up! Remember that you succeeded today and that it's okay to not always be at 100% of all time, but just 100% of what you can give that day.
It’s a great feeling when the cleaning finally gets done eh? My depression was horrible these last few months, and my area got absolutely cluttered. Yesterday I cleaned my bed area, today I did a little bit of my living areas, tomorrow is the bathroom (a tough one, so may be a multi day one).   Be proud of yourself for your work :) it looks amazing
That looks amazing and you should be proud of yourself. It can be so hard to clean sometimes. Depression might win a battle here and there, but today you won.
Great job!
your room is so cute!!!
Your room is so aesthetically pleasing when it’s clean! I cleaned mine today too and feels like clean room=clean mind. I love it
This is awesome! Getting started can be so hard!
"sometimes depression wins, but today was a good day". Thank you for that sentence. Literally the simplest tasks feel so hard and heavy to do but treating them as small wins goes a long way.
Brilliant!!! You done an amazing job. I also struggle with depression and at my worst my home got like this, I’m doing not to bad these days and the feeling of pride you get after a hard clean, seeing the results and having somewhere thats clean and comfortable to relax, is some of the best feelings in the world. Well for me they are lol but I’ve sound little and often helps.  Come out the shower, that you’ve finally managed to climb in, and put the dirty washing in the machine. I know it sounds easy coming from me but this method helped me through some of my worst days. May your good days continue ☺️
I wanna say you're doing an awesome job and also thanks for reminding me I need to take my meds with your post 😄
Awesome! It feels calm. And I really like the floor!
WOW! Awesome job!
nice, a lot of people don't understand it's really hard to 'just do it'...I'm sleeping on a floor mattress over 10 yrs old with the resources to get a new bad but I just dont
Holy shit my guy, what an improvement between the before and after! Great job with pushing yourself past your thoughts and to actually get shit clean. It can be one of the most therapeutic things to do, but also one of the most difficult.
It looks SO much better!  Great job!
Gotta do what needs to be done.
Hell yeah kicking depressions ass it’s hard to stay motivated and I tip my hat to you!
So proud of you!! Looks fantastic!!
That was so strong of you! You've done what a lot of us can't. Youre an inspiration :)
Keep up the good work!
That fresh feeling is amazing! I bet you feel so much lighter! It's hard to remember but I try to think to myself that I wouldn't be able to go without brushing my teeth, then I added flossing and now I can't skip that step either, then I added picking up a few things and putting them away right after brushing my teeth. If you stack habits like that they become more ingrained a lot faster.
Totally inspirational. If you only knew what a disaster my bedroom is... I’m going to use your post as my inspiration, tomorrow, to finally start cleaning up my spaces.   BTW: do you know where the metal ring/wreath form in image 3 is from. Someone else on Reddit made a wreath like yours and I believe she purchased hers from Walmart, but mine didn’t have anything like it. Curious if you know where one could find such a building block?
Im really really proud of you! I started cleaning up my room 2 weeks ago, but haven’t finished it yet. But I’m proud of your outcome!
Congratulations with having a good day. Don't forget to treat yourself, too. :)
Hooray! My anxiety usually wins and I anxiety clean. But depression makes it completely chaotic. I got rid of a bunch of old junk but now I have new piles to go through. 😭
I know the feeling meh.. 🐑😩
you did such a good job :D!!!
great job!!
<3 <3 <3
This is such an achievement. You’ve done really great here! Well done.
good job! I'm proud of you ♡
I agree depression wins when you don't take care of your room and you don't manage your life.
this is the worst it’s ever gotten, but from now on i’ve promised to myself that i’ll take a few minutes every day to tidy up and avoid the stress that it caused. thank you!
thank you!
this was the first (and after the nightmare it was to put together/terrible quality) thing i bought off of wayfair and didn’t even last 6 months. looking at it would make me anxious. i’m glad it’s gone!
it took several days but once i started it was easier to keep going. you got this!
truth! i completely agree. thank you!
thank you! doing a little at a time helps. the thought of doing it all at once gets overwhelming and pushes me off from doing it even longer.
thank you!
thank you! i had a few days off of work at the hospital and i go back tomorrow. it will be much easier knowing i have a clean room to come home too
thank you, and agreed! even the act of laying in bed and reading brings me so much more joy when it’s clean.
agreed! my depression makes leaving my bed seem like the hardest task in the world, especially when there’s a big task like this at hand.
i try to remember that sometimes you don’t have to check off every thing you set out to do that day and it’s okay to give yourself grace. sometimes even something small is worthy of calling it a “good day”. Hang in there! 🤍
thank you! i had a few days off from the hospital and this was the one thing i knew i had to do. it really helped clear my head and a huge relief to get done.
thank you! i’m a little embarrassed it got that bad, but between being a nurse at a busy hospital right now and dealing with my mental health in general, it’s just hard. but i’m happy to go back to work tomorrow knowing i have a clean room.
one way or another. i agree!
It was from target, it came with the wreath attached! But I bet you could find something similar on etsy or even Amazon. Most craft stores wild also probably have a ring like that.
If I may suggest something that's worked for me *keeping* it somewhat cleaner. If you've ever had someone prepare something for you that you weren't expecting - hotel staff that tie your towels into animal shapes on the bed, someone picking up your favorite candy just for you, coming home from a long day & finding out someone has already cooked and it's a nice warm pasta dinner.   If you think about how nice it felt to receive that. It almost makes you want to return the favor. And then do that for your future self.   Set out fresh towels so your future self can feel clean after a shower. Return stuff to its place so that future self always can find it and doesn't have to get frustrated looking. Make your bed Sunday morning so when future self has anxieties about the upcoming week, theyll have a nice, clean, cozy bed to crawl into before they have to face the storm. It's helped me and I still get little pockets of relief when I come across things I previously prepared. I hope that helps you keep your beautiful room staying beautiful.
i also work at a hospital. it’s so difficult to keep my room clean with three 12s a week.
I get bed locked so often when a major episode comes through. You are fucking doing it! You are doing the big small things to feel good. It’s all part of the wellness puzzle. This will be some inspiration for me!
It feels so good to come home to.  I struggle with the same thing, and when it gets away from you, it’s just so hard to get it back under control.  It always nice to make your room something you enjoy vs something you dread.  Depression sucks but you beat it today!

This message is for people with true depression, not sadness or narcissism, but that brain based, win the lottery, lose the lottery, get the lover, lose the lover, it doesn’t matter, still feel the same, depression.  This morning you woke up with your 500lb backpack full of hell on your back and went about your day, when most people would collapse under one day of that burden.  You went out of your way to make someone feel good, knowing that is a feeling no one can return to you.  You passed a test or completed a work assignment despite every voice surrounding you 24/7 telling you that you couldn’t and you would fail.  You built some sort of bridge to your future despite seeing only darkness ahead.  You listened to others and  genuinely tried to help, despite your absolute to your core knowledge you are alone and helpless.  You smiled and tried to lift people up, despite life crushing you down.   The worst diseases out there give moments of reprieve, but not yours. All feel sympathy and compassion for the diseased, but yours receives none, or worse, dismissal. The Ill are forgiven, understood, covered and supported, but you receive disgust, anger, or frustration.  Those facing other diseases are viewed as brave and strong, while you are viewed as weak. Despite all of that, you fought through another day!  Today you showed strength few on this planet possess.  You bravely fought the demon hoard that would have easily felled a lesser person.  Your mind can tell you how horrible you are, but the fact that you made it through today argues directly against that.  Today you showed heart beyond measure.  As a fellow sufferer I want you to know that I love you for all that you are and all you overcome! You are a champion, a wonder, an absolute f’ing miracle!

Thank you! Reading this made me feel a little better
I haven't thought about it this way. Instead, I mainly focus on how defective I feel as a person, especially because from my society's standards I am successful and yet I feel horrible all the time. Most days, it just feels like an anchor is tearing through my insides. The subjective nature of depression only amplifies the self-doubts and crushing feelings of inadequacy. My myopic perspective doesn't allow me to realize the obvious: most people don't go about their lives with regular suicidal ideation. (I am safe; don't worry.)   Thank you OP for the message of courage and for reminding me that I am stronger than I think I am. Have a blessed day.
I know exactly how you feel and I also know that 90% of the people would collapse after just one day of what we face every day. You are a miracle!

i no longer really feel a flow of time at this point it’s the same thing every day in a constant loop and I don’t even know how to describe it, it just feels like time is gone and everything is constantly moving really fast. Along with this everything feels pointless and I have no clue on what to do to feel fulfillment.  Everyday is the same thing Wake up Go to school  Homework Exercise for an hour Find something to do to improve myself for an hour Play games Sleep  I know this is just a long rant but I don’t know where to begin or where to start I can’t really get any professional help because I don’t have the greatest of relationships with my parents due to reasons out of their control and my control and I can’t really talk about it with them

for the past couple years ive been practicing this religion and it was helping me with my depression but I am still a loser and it dosnt matter. I graduated college last May and I still haven't been able to find hold and keep a job . I dont even apply to jobs anymore. I signed up for a bootcamp thinking it would be great for my cv and help w a job but I couldnt afford it.  I wasnt going to sign but this guy from my religious organization gave me money for the deposit and I would feel really guilty if I used the money for anything else except the organization and I felt like I had to sign. Then I was hoping I could get an income share agreement with the program but today they told me I cant get the ISA . I literally cannot afford this program at all and I signed an agreement that says I have to pay for it. I was going to message the guy who is the head of the program and tell him I have to withdrawl from it , I hope I can get out of the agreement somehow. Im just an idiot. I have ADHD and I can never do anything right .

It feels like every  single relationship of mines just fails. I can never be a good enough daughter for my parents - everything I do is always wrong.   My first boyfriend cheating on me, again not good enough.  The next almost relationship (I guess I wasn't even good enough to make things official) he lied to me over and over again, and. when he got caught he disappeared, blocked me on all social media platforms, new number, just entirely disappeared.  My last relationship I reallly thought was going to be different, but he ghosted me. No surprise there, I wasn't good enough again.  I can't even pass my courses, because I have a supplementary exam.  I feel like a complete failure. I fail at everything, relationships, school, life.  I'm just so, so tired... I feel all alone and so lonely...  I don't want to do this anymore. I can't...

It’s not you. A good partner will not cheat, ghost, or lie to you. Sadly, we meet people that are not good for us. I have been with a partner that emotionally abused me and I always though it was because I wasn’t good enough, I realized he did this to all his partners— it was him and not me.  Academics also do not define your worth. I know it is easy to say, but it’s true.   I don’t know your specific circumstance but I hope you find it in your heart to know that you are in fact, good enough.
I understand where you are coming from every relationship I have been in has been terrible. First one cheated, second one was an unmedicated schizophrenic who tried to kill herself daily, third cheated on me and gave me an std, forth left me but always said she loved me too much to date, last one was addicted to meth. So I give up I feel like I'll be alone forever.  I am super lonely also my only contact is my mom. My only friend just took a job where he travels 24/7 so who knows when I'll see or talk to him. It's tough to keep going I just do it for my parents I take care of my dad who has dementia/alzheimer's and my mom who has chronic pain. Also for my cat I can't abandon her.  Try to find something to keep you going. It's not easy though.
Are you on medication? If so, you NEED to keep taking them or if you are and they aren't working, you need to have your Dr. change them. Meds are not an end all but when you get to the point where you just don't want to do "it" anymore, you need something external to get you past that feeling so you don't do something unreasonable.    Exercise, meditate, get therapy, make a new friend.  Take a break from relationships for a while and keep things platonic.  Until you get your head together, eliminate these outside influences that are bringing you down.  You'll see that these relationships didn't work out for you because they weren't meant to. Would you really want to be with a person that could do those things to you?  When you are content with the person that you are and in a good place physically and mentally, the right person come along.  Think about how amazing that person will be and what would happen to that person if you aren't there to meet them when the time is right.  Literally take it one day, one hour, one minute, one second, one whatever it takes to get you past this time when everything SEEMS hopeless.  Good luck to you and please don't give up!
Whenever I'm feeling like this I listen to a Badflower song to help me feel like I'm not so alone. It's called "Ghost"  *I am afraid that all the blood escaping me won't end the pain // and I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me // I died to be the white ghost of the [wo]man that I was meant to be*   I let myself be afraid of what would happen if I left this world and haunted everyone I love...wasting the chance to become who I was meant to be. Idk what the future holds but it holds *something.*
Honestly, I can't see myself making it out of this this time. I'm too exhausted. And I don't really see the point... It feels like everything I touch fails so even I do manage to crawl out of this it's not actually worth it... What would it be for? Just to set myself up for more failures and disappointment?   I'm sorry if I sound too negative and whine-y I just don't really have anywhere/anyone else to go to.
Thank you for replying. No, I'm not on any medication, I was in therapy at my uni, but I kind of stopped it last month as I felt like I wasn't making any progress... And honestly it was the second time I tried, but wasn't getting anywhere.  I used to gym and workout every day (Covid ruined that, I still try to do it at home, but to be honest most days I skip and don't feel like it or don't have the energy). I've taken up meditation again recently, hopefully that helps.  I did take a break from relationships, it was a year between the previous one and this one and before this last one, I honestly thought that I was in a wayy better space. I had some sort of plan. Even platonic and family relationships seem to be failing if I'm honest. Which is why I think it's just me that's the problem.  And no, I definitely don't want a person who can do these things, but honestly at a stage I thought he could be the one, and I even thought that if it doesn't work out he'd be adult enough to do it in a civilised manner. He always said the right thing and seemed like a breath of fresh air compared to my other exes. In the beginning I tried really, really hard not to get attached. But, somehow it happened anyway.  Once again, I just want to thank you for your time.
Thank you I'll check it out!
It is tiring, I understand. Not being able to live up to expectations wether your own or someone else’s is tiring. I cant say with certainty that it gets better in a specific number of days or months, but I still feel it’s worth it to push through.   I also believe that everything we do will have different results. You might be in an unfortunate situation now but not all situations will have that outcome. I have read in another sub, it’s written in some way like this “good things will happen and bad things will happen too, but it is the exception and not the rule”. I know if feels the other way around, but it can change.   And no, you are not whiney. Your feelings are valid. I would be thankful if I had partners like yours that are not in my life anymore. I met my amazing, close to perfect husband a couple years after my ex boyfriend and I broke up and now I am so thankful that that relationship ended. It might not be the same outcome for all of us, but just being without toxic, lying, cheating people is already a positive outcome.  I hope you feel better, just message me if I can help.
You are welcome.  It is my pleasure to try to help you.  I've been there (albeit under different circumstances) and I know that everything seems hopeless.  Honestly, if I didn't have people basically dragging me to a Dr. and therapy, I would have never went on my own. Even when I did finally agree to go, it seemed like nothing was still working and I was a hamster on a wheel, spinning and running and getting nowhere. I eventually let them talk me into something called T.M.S., which I honestly thought was a complete bunch of b.s. and it ended up saving my life. Research it, it isn't for everyone and I don't mean to imply that it will be for you, but I want you to know that this is 2021 and there are people and things out there to help you get past these feelings.  You just have to realize it and NOT QUIT.  Don't let what other people define who you are.  You're stronger and better than that even if you don't think you are right now.  Look at what your mind is doing to you right now.  The human brain is amazingly powerful.  You see how it is bringing you down?  It also has the power to lift you up.  It is not an easy road and everyone's journey is different but I am proof that you can do it. Keep seeking help until you find something that works.  Try everything: exercise, meditation, medicine, therapy, posting on reddit, whatever.  Something (or a combo) will eventually work.  Every moment you don't give in to dark thoughts is a victory. Know that and build from it.  You are a survivor and you will beat it.

Hello there, I'm 15 living in the UK, alt account for obvious reasons.   Over the last few months I've really been struggling, shit just sort of collapsed all at once. I lost somebody close to me, had to sit my mocks the next day, and the only friend that I had moved away. The mocks wouldn't have been an issue before, but with the grief and the added pressure that school has put on is this year honestly just crippled me. It started with small thoughts, just a general feeling of shit, but it spiralled into constant self loathing and suicidal thoughts. I went though a similar situation a couple years ago, but then I had friends that helped me at least get away from my own head.   Now I don't even have that. I used to try to hide myself from them, but people started to notice slightly. So I pushed them away because having others realise my state right now it's the biggest fear that I have. Not that they'd care. Except now I feel trapped in my own head, and it's killing me piece by piece. I think about suicide all the time. There's not really intent, more a constant obsession with it. It's always an option just in case, but I'd probably be too pathetic to ever go through with it.   Now the UK has give back into lockdown, so I'm now even more isolated then before. Even if I wanted to reconnect with those "friends" I can't anymore. Combined with my GCSE exams getting cancelled and I'm not sure that there's much point left living tbh. Especially because my final grade will be based on a mock exam that I had a panic attack in. Fun.  Both the pressure from school and the loneliness created what I am now, it feels like most people consider me as a lazy, inconsiderate jerk. To their credit they're probably right. It's gotten to the point where I honestly can't give any positives about myself. I hate my appearance, clothing, the way I talk, everything. It feels like I'm drowning silently inside my head.   The issue is that I can't even go about getting some sort of help right now, because I'm underage any system that could help me would report back to my parents, or I have to go through them to even get the help in the first place. I can't have anybody knowing how I am right now. I'm not putting that weight on people.  Any kind of advice would be appreciated. I'm not really sure where to go from here.

I’m sorry that this is happening to you. I wish there were some magical thing I could do to make it all better for you. I am in a similar situation right now. Although I have friends, they all live far away and I don’t feel like I can talk to them about how I feel. I feel so incredibly lonely. I’ve also been thinking about suicide a lot recently. I don’t necessarily want to kill myself but at the same time I want to be released from this life. Everything feels terrible. I just want you to know that I understand. I’m a bit older than you and can’t imagine how anyone younger than me can deal with the stress of the current world. Please realize that you are wonderful for making it this far. Eventually you will find good people that will always be your friends. I truly wish for you that you’ll be able to start being more accepting of yourself.   Even though I don’t know you I can see that you’re really trying to just live. Sometimes the best we can do is exist and sometimes that’s okay. Also please PLEASE know that it’s okay to let others know how you’re feeling. I don’t particularly like to talk to my parents about certain things but I know I needed to start somewhere. I don’t know what your situation with your parents but I know most parents would want their children to say something instead of keep everything inside. Regardless, you definitely need to talk to someone. The discord might help you, or you could try calling some different hotlines about where to go from here. I strongly suggest you try to find a doctor or therapist who will work with you through this.  Also, don’t worry too much about those exams. I had to take some standardized exams here in the US and failed hard. I’m graduating college next semester.

Ever since I’ve graduated high school in 2017 I’ve done nothing. I wouldn’t commit to my studies and all I have to show for my college career is three completed prerequisite classes, two failed classes, and two withdrawn classes. I’ve wasted over $10,000 of my father’s money. Despite having every opportunity given to me, I’ve squandered it all. My father told me that he will no longer support me and we don’t talk anymore. I’ve cut myself off from my family and friends, and spend the majority of my time in my room. In three years my father will retire to New Mexico, and I will be on my own in Nevada. I’m running out of time and yet I have no drive to succeed. I’m 22(m) and I feel like my life is already over. At this point I think that I would be better off dead.

Hi friend. What are your happiest times over the past 2 months? College isn’t for everyone. Sounds like you just need a little help finding direction
Hey... I second what the above poster said, college is not the only way to make a career.  While I am not qualified to give career guided advice, I can say that my job/s before weren’t related to what I took in college. I made decent money and was able to support myself. I think everyone has something they are good at, we just all have to find out what it is.   22 is very young. You have time to make those choices wether on not what you’re doing is right for you. I know you feel you are old, but you’re not. Not in the grand scheme of things in the world. You have started pre reqs, it may sound like a small thing now, but that’s the start (if you want to continue college). Everyone starts someone. I have co workers that went to school at 40’s to start a new career.   I’m rooting for you!
Agree with the other posters.  There are so many other great options out there other than college.  You can always go back later on in life.  Seek out the different trades.  Some pay very well, and will train you with pay.  You may find you love getting your hands dirty, and a good days work will make you feel accomplished.

I know it’s a big symptom to push away our friends and family members, but I have recently started developing feelings of annoyance and disgust with my friends. My closest friend I just unadded off of an app from social media for no reason other than I don’t want to talk to her. I don’t want to talk to anyone. I just want to be left alone. At the same time, I remember all of the things she said she would do, and she’s stuck by me for so long. I don’t know why I am starting to feel a little contempt of her; it may be jealousy that she’s happy and I am not. And I don’t want to be that way. In my head, I guess, my thoughts are screaming, ‘Push her away and you won’t have to be hurt by her happiness.’ I shouldn’t feel this way. I don’t want to be a bad friend. But all I can feel is hurt and sadness and I don’t know how to fix it or if it is even from my dark depression thoughts.

I’m not in a great place right now and I’ve been ignoring a lot of people the last few days because I just want to be left alone for a while. By a lot of people, I mean everyone except my mom (who I live with and obviously can’t ignore), and that includes my best friend.   She sent me a bunch of messages on Snapchat yesterday and the day before, just pictures, videos, and chats, like we usually would, but I wasn’t even opening them, let alone responding. After about a day and a half of not hearing from me she kept sending me snaps, called me and text me (I was in the shower so I missed those two when they happened otherwise I would’ve texted her back), then she messaged my mom and tagged me in a post on Facebook all in about a 15 minute time period.  After I was done with my shower I was pretty annoyed by all that, but I messaged her and I told her that I was okay, I’m just going through some stuff and I’m really stressed so I haven’t been talking to anyone, but it’s not anything she did and I appreciated her checking on me.   The problem is that I literally just want to be left alone right now, and I guess I assumed that was clear in my message to her, but I guess not. She has snap chatted me like we normally would (about 10 times) today, but I haven’t opened any of them, and it’s getting past the point of being annoying to low key pissing me off. Like the notifications popping up feel like nails on a chalk board and I just want to chunk my phone across the room every time they pop up. I know it’s not her fault that I’m feeling like this, and I don’t know why I am, but I just want the messages to stop.   So how do I politely tell her that I appreciate her concern, but just leave me alone for now?

I wouldn't, because you don't want to hurt your friend's feelings, which is probably how that would be taken.  If you don't want to see her snaps keep popping up on your phone, turn your phone off.  Disable snap notifications.  Take a little time to yourself, but don't tell your friend to get bent, because you will then be less one friend.

Before anything else. I'm not looking for medical advice. I have requested a meeting with my doctor. I just feel very lost right now and I just want support and if any of you have been through the same, how have you handled it.  I switched medication. Not because my previous medication didn't work. I had used it for 2 years, but because I had stopped taking it (without talking to my doctor), and when I then talked to my doctor 4 weeks without taking any medication, I felt like I had to switch meds. But right now I am on a starter dose of my new medication, but I don't feel as good as I did on my previous medication. I have no side effects which at least is good.  So the real trouble here is that I feel ashamed of stopping my medication and I miss my own medication. I am considering asking to go back on it. But maybe I will find out that I get the unwanted side effects. And I would have to stop using medication for at least a week or two. Which isn't ideal because I am sudicidal. So adjusting my current dose of medication is probably better then. But what if that doesn't work and I just made it all worse because I am ashamed.   So there's just a lot of shame and confusion surrounding my medication. I feel like it is all my fault. Even though I didn't know any better.   And if any of you are anti medication. Please do not write here. You do not know my medical needs. I've been to therapy multiple times in my life. I am seeing a therapist right now. Thinking I know better than multiple professionals is what got me here.

Whenever I switch meds, I don’t feel great for a minimum of a couple of weeks. The package says it may take up to 6 weeks to stabilize. I think stopping the first med is what actually causes the bad side effects. I’d give it a month or two and ask to switch back, if it isn’t working as well.   The right antidepressant can be an actual life saver, so ignore the naysayers. You just hafta do you.
Switching helped me. I was also in the same boat where I stopped my meds that worked okay for two years then my psychiatrist switched me to latuda as my first meds back and it worked wonders after being upped a couple of times and after some time I was put back on my original meds to work on my depression. Things are looking up for me. So I guess don’t feel too bad about it. My original meds did work okay and it gave me back my life but being put on latuda has been great for my diagnosis and I just need to take them as prescribed and follow my doctors orders.
most medications, especially when it comes to something as complex as mental health, need time to work.. A long time ago I was prescribed medication and my doctor warned me (it was written on the instruction as well) that it will most likely get even worse at first, in a couple of weeks after it will start working. at that time I had a job that required constant focus and clear mind and my medication was seriously messing that up, so when I finally felt better I stopped it without consulting. That was a mistake we have in common I guess. for weeks I've felt like I'm gonna pass out, my head was woozy all the time and I had very weird thoughts. But I don't regret my choice because after some time my mind was my own again. I only wish I would do it gradually. So what  I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't feel ashamed, it's your body and your medication, so it's your choice as well. Since you abruptly stopped your previous medication and now want it back after receiving another, maybe you have withdrawal symptoms (I'm no expert, but it's possible). I would just follow your doctor's recommendations and stick with prescribed meds. Give it some time to work.
I had switched medications so ma y times when I started my treatment and nothing was working, so there is no reason to feel any shame whatsoever.  As you can see by the other posts, MANY people have to change meds until they find a med (or combination of meds) that works.  And I'm not here to sell you anything, but do some research on T.M.S. therapy. If I'm being honest, I thought it was an absolute crock of $#!÷ scam. My wife basically forces me to try it and it ended up saving my life and got me over the "hump" to a place where we finally found a med combo that worked.  Good luck to you and don't give up!
Yes. I'm gonna look up how long it was since I started my medication. It will have been six weeks once a time with my doctor. Maybe even two months. Depends on when I get an appointment. Hopefully soon bc the emergency doctor said she would contact my regular clinic and tell them I was there and came from the police (yes it was that bad yesterday).   I always go after what can give the quickest and best effects (with the least amount of possible negative side effects) and do that first. And that's adjusting the dosage. I think my doctor will agree on that.    And yes. You just gotta do you.   Anyways thank you. It did help with the chaos a bit.
Yes  Also i talked to a doctor yesterday and they were ironically telling me to not do my therapy. They're not my general physician so they didn't want to adjust the dosage, but they did tell me not to actively induce anxiety upon myself (exposure therapy) and that i should wait with that. I mean it makes sense when i say that now. But i got very caught up with everything.   Hopefully this medication will work. It works the same as my previous medication (SRRI and SNRI) so it shouldn't be withdrawal symtpoms. But it might also be that the dosage of my new medication is too low to fully treat the withdrawal. Something to ask my doctor. So thank you!  Nice to know I'm not alone with this.
Yeah, well as my doctor explained to me same type of medication can still work very differently depending on how and what they're made of, so yeah. Doctors can be pretty cynical, but it has nothing to do with you personally, it's just their job. So I hope you'll feel better! You're very welcome.

Is it food poisoning? Indigestion? My hormones? That shot of Aimovig for my migraines? The scent of my cheap fabric softener?   Hi, I’m feeling super nauseous and have vomited the night away. The lack of sleep makes me more nauseous and the smell of food makes it worse. I’m pretty sure it’s the Aimovig because the same thing happened last month. Still, I worry about being pregnant in spite of having an IUD but I’m too dehydrated from the vomiting to confidently pee on the stick I have stashed for this EXACT reason.   Anyone have an Android body lying around? I will donate my shitty body to science and if I suffer brain death in the process you can have that too.

Hey. I'm 26F and I've had depression since I was a child, and I know how that works on me, I know myself pretty well, but this time I need help towards another person.  There's this 32M who he says we're friends. I have strong feelings for him but that doesn't matter now. The thing is that over the weeks he changed 180 degrees and today after complaining about that he told me not to shove that at his face, that he was struggling himself with depression and he knew he had changed quite a lot.  That killed me. I mean, I know the story of his life and all the shit he had been through and I believe him, of course, cause depression hits every person in a different way. So I need you to help me to see it from the outside. Because in my POV all I wanna do is to "save him" from aching but I can't. What can I do? Is it seriously that a person can change towards another one because of that? Personally, I'm always the same.  I want to understand him and support him. Thank you.

Hey there, I don’t quite understand from your post what the change in him was but regardless, the best way to deal with other people’s feelings is to give them space to be exactly as they are, including any and all changes. I know this can seem difficult when you’re in the position of wanting something from someone but what’s weird about this is that it’s actually super attractive to people when you let them be exactly as they are. I don’t recommend doing it with an ulterior motive– it’s good for you as well– but who knows, feelings may change again... ❤️
Hi. Depression can manifest itself in many different ways, especially if one hasn't dealt with it in the past. For example, I (27M \[not sure how much gender plays a role in response\]) tend to isolate myself and binge watch TV for an absurd amount of time. Everything becomes abstract to the point that of absolute nihilism in the most negative sense. Motivation is a huge issue; drug use increases. This is a huge change from my usual self who loves to learn new things and likes to read a lot. I really dislike the person I become, but it can be quite difficult for me to get away from my heavy anchor. I tend to just hate myself more when I realize how I am behaving compared to who I want to be. Moreover, I have a friend who gets uncontrollably angry and yells at her significant other. She says things she doesn't mean, but in the moment, it still can get nasty. She always regrets it afterward as her SO has been such an important part of her life. So yeah in my experience people can change a lot.  Trying to save someone from aching doesn't tend to work well, at least for me. This strategy gets close to repetitions of positive messages like "it will get better." In a way, it invalidates the internal suffering someone has. I realize it comes from a good place, but even good intentions can have bad outcomes. For some reason, (again at least for me) one of the best things someone can do for me is meet me where I am. Things like, "I am sorry to hear that."; "it sounds like you are going through a tough time."; "I am here if you want to talk."; etc. For other people, pointing out good things may help them broaden their vision, which can be helpful as people in the pits of depression tend to have horrible tunnel vision. People are different, so it only makes sense that the same intervention will not work for different people. You are going to have to try different strategies.  It is clear you care about him. Tell him. Offer a hug. They can do wonders. I would recommend meeting him where he is emotionally in a nonjudgmental way. Listening can be be medicine in itself. Good luck!
I was very selfish yesterday, I see. I'm in Iceland and he's in Finland. I'd love to go and hug him but I understand he wants to isolate himself. Anyway, thanks a lot for the advice. I'm gonna write him a msg showing I care about his struggle and apologizing. Thanks a lot, really.
I wouldn't say you were selfish. Wanting to end another person's pain is in no way selfish. It shows you care. But just not in the most helpful way for him.
I just told him that I was sorry for bringing up the fact that he changed a lot towards me, instead of asking him how he was feeling or if there was something I could do even there's nothing. That didn't understand him but just trying to Empathize with him and most importantly, that I didn't care if he wouldn't reply. Your message changed my view quite a lot. Again, thanks.
It is always difficult to carry on relationships through text. I am glad I could help. :)

So, i suffer form depression nearly 18 years now. I was in therapy and i was a few weeks in a  psychiatry. But the only advice an help i get was: think at somethingelse.    My problem is that everthing can trigger my  suicide toughts. I try always tries to do something that make me happy. But over these years it become much harder.  I want to do things and its like something is holding me back. Its hart to fight it, i try.  Its good thats only toughts how i go kill myself but i dont know how to handle it. Some days its not that hard but i cant even remember a day without that thoughts anymore.  My toughts are like these  annoying advertising pop up windows, these toughts sometimes appear out of nowhere and hit me hard.  The  psychologist who told me to think about somethingelse,... idk i can think about many things at the same time.. even if i try to get ried of these pictures in my head... it takes i while and the dissapear. Until then i sometimes wish i let these toughts become the reality... i dont harm myself so you dont need to worry about this!  but i do not want to live with these toughts until i died.  i could search for another therapist but i only get  disappionted. its hard to find someone.  hopfully someone can help me.  sry for any bad gramma or spelling mistaks.

I’m not a psychologist or a therapist, but I’ve been through what you are going through and I’ve studied it to help me get better which I did. Just my opinion  These thoughts are habitual thoughts that get triggered. They can be weakened. Just my guess but when they said think about something else - this weakens that thought and eventually it will fade away like it did with me  But if we keep thinking about it that thought becomes stronger  What I would do is Constantly ask my myself what can I do to feel better in this moment  Or even think about something that feels better in this moment  Why in this moment? Because I am where I am and you are where you are  Trying to do happy things may not work as it’s too far from anxiety or depression, so I would just pick something that feels a little better then do something after that that feels better and so on  Eventually this will become a habit and them thoughts will weaken even more  And the best bit is that say something happens that throws me back down I can start again  and ask my self what can I do to feel better in this moment and then after that and so on  I wish you all the best honestly  I have been through it and I am out of it and I now have regained control of myself  You can do the same  We are all human  No matter where we are
You have to switch your doctor. If you tell them about these thoughts they HAVE to help you— and not just to say “think about something else”. While diversion can be a helpful tool if you are far into these thoughts and now have suicidal ideations, this is not the right course.  It’s good that you are posting on this sub and talking to people that can understand. I’m just so confused why your therapist will react this way, it’s so disappointing. Are you on medications? If you are not comfortable to answer, I understand. I hope you feel better.
most of the time i think there is nothing that i can do to feel better. but i will try your suggestion, maybe there is something i didnt know about what can help me to feel better.
na.. i am to disappointed to look for another one. i found early 2020 one and see her one time. it was great but she closed a little bit after because of corona. was little bit bad, i hoped she could really help but...stuiped 2020 \^\^ i quit take medications, the didnt really help and caused more trouble then they acctualy help.
I think I struggled with this  I tried to get like happy but happiness was too far  So say for example (not saying you) I was in depression  Then I’d make a cup of tea. This feels better for me  After that I think I’ll just get some fresh air - maybe have my vape outside  So I do that  Then I think I wouldn’t mind a small takeaway so I’d get that and have that  Then I would be like you know what I don’t mind watching my favourite comedy  So hours have passed and each time I ask what can I do to feel a little better in this moment? Now say I was in depression and I jumped straight to getting a take away or watching a comedy it wouldn’t work - it’s too far off  But you will see the momentum of feeling better and better  And the best bit Say during that time I got knocked back down. Before I would panic  Now I start again the process  Soon it becomes a habit  My mind wants to find a way to feel better  And in the feeling good ideas come. Ideas of solutions etc I really wish you all the best  I’ve learnt this from experts  And if this helps you it would make me very happy

I am well aware that I have depression. I've been diagnosed and all that good stuff. But when my doctor was checking me and my symptoms she asked if I saw shadows or people out of the corner of my eyes or anything like that. At the time it seemed like such a bizarre question and sounded like hallucinations and I said no. Looking back I was wrong. It is beginning to happen a little more frequently. I also smell things no one else seems to smell and hear things no one else hears sometimes. I recently saw a thing somewhere that said if you have depression and the things I just talked about that I need to see a doctor asap. Does anyone care to explain what the heck is happening to me and why am I hallucinating?

I've experienced the same and come to realize it was my anxiety causing my senses to be heightened. I was hypersensitive and started feeling "presences" when i thought I saw the dark figures in the corners of my eyes. But realized they were items and objects that had slight movements and my senses were extremely heightened in flight or fight mode. Same for my hearing and sense of smell. I felt like I was hearing ever little sound that was being made and smells were coming from all over. I've noticed that when I get depression spells, I tend to get really anxious right before and all my senses and feelings are sensitive and heightened then the depression kicks in and everything feels numb compared to the heightened senses.
I haven't been diagnosed but I know that I have depression... That is the strangest thing...   I too have been experiencing very similar things but have been blowing it off... it's more just like the feeling of something there & shadows.. plus some smells... wtf  I would really appreciate if someone else with maybe an answer could chime in.
Thank you this actually really helps. My anxiety has been pretty bad lately so this would actually makes a lot of sense, thanks lol
For me its seeing shadow people out of the corner of my eyes or in my peripheral vision and then today I could've sworn I saw a tall masculine shaped shadow in my kitchen and that scared the shit out of me so thats when I decided to post here lol.

I feel like I just read my own post. I am also looking for someone to connect with. Honestly just to feel like I am not alone. Thank you for posting this because I wrote mine like 40 times and just never ended up doing it. I hope knowing you made me feel less alone brings you some sort of peace.
It feels that way, I know, I've been there. There are people that care, though, you just haven't found them. Start with your family.  You fears may be totally unfounded.  If they aren't willing to help you, there are free services.  Hell, reddit is free and I've never even met you, but I already care because I've been in your shoes. And I'm sure that I'm not the only one. Believe me, there are people that want to help you.  No one should feel that way.  Don't give up and no matter how bad it seems, there eventually will be a light at the end of the tunnel.  You job for now is just to do whatever you have to to not do something that you can never take back. That's it for now. Take it 1 second at a time if you have to.  Every second you still fight is a victory.  EVERY.  SECOND.
You’re welcome to message me if you like. You aren’t alone and I know that doesn’t make anything better but maybe venting could help

So basically I got depression and I've been trying to do something about it for the past months ever since quarantine began. I tried making basic healthy habits, socializing, improving myself generally like becoming more positive and openminded, and so on and so forth. There are so many things I need to consider - be that by literally doing them or merely focusing on certain thoughts and letting go of negative ones. I noticed that I kept getting burned out eventually and with every week of constantly working and improving myself, the next week is an utter failure because I couldn't manage to focus on everything I needed to in the past week. There is just too much I need to think about. I need to get healthy habits, quit unhealthy ones, meditate, focus on some thought patterns, etc etc but if I do focus on one thing, I can no longer focus on another thing because of my ADHD brain. And if I don't focus on everything I need to, eventually my mental health just collapses again and I need to start over as if I learned nothing from it

This is me x100. I can’t stay focused at work, and I try more and more to get myself back in focus and all I do is end up burning myself completely out. I have ADHD and my attention goes quickly.  I know what I should do (changing patterns, quitting unhealthy habits) but doing them seems meaningless.  I need to rethink my life...

I literally cant even write this because my dad said this "doesn't matter" and is "exactly why I am struggling" cftgyhyu. This society was made so people with mental illness cant thrive. It was. I can't. I am just in pain but I have to keep up with school and a social life- I have to keep up with my home life and my hobbys. I just want a break. I am going to get kicked out of school because I went through a really bad low and was contemplating suicide. I got behind in my school work. My grades are pretty much all Fs and Ds. In the past I got great grades and was a "star" student- I don't even know what I am now- I am just tired.

*long read, im sorry. but thank you if you do read this.   this started out by me watching fleabag, a triggering show but i get so emotionally invested i still need to watch it, getting stoned, deciding to finally paint my boyfriends portrait for his birthday present, when i poured out the bag that the paints were in dirt came along with it. it was the bag from the dirt used in my repotting a plant earlier. it freaked me out. and i started just wiping the paints off with the dirt on the ground to sweep up later, then more and more dirt kept falling so i got more intense with the cleaning and wiping and there was still more and more dirt and i was scraping it off the sides of the paint tubes and kept getting too into it and worried about the mess, but i stopped myself and sat down to take a breath in the hallway, trying to avoid thinking about how dusty it was. just my breaths. but then i thought it would be more comfortable in bed, so i slowly crawled there but it was too hot so i opened the window, then realized i stepped in the dirt again. i tried to ignore it, i took off my socks and sweatpants that were probably pretty dusty, wiped my feet and got in bed. but i felt crumbs and i was cold and i started to get obsessed with the cleanliness even though ive been so depressed i havent been able to wash my face in days, let alone shower. i just kinda relaxed again and my old friend from high school called. I havent talked to him in so long, him and a few others and i were best friends. we graduated about 4 years ago. He realized something was off and asked if this was a bad time. i, as calmly as i could told him im mid having a panic attack. he said ok, but wanted to stay on the phone with me, i got the feeling he knew it was bad. he tried to occupy me for a while but after me barely being able to answer any questions, maybe because of the weed or maybe because of the overwhelming anxiety i was feeling, so he said he would go, he loves me, and to text me at any time. i cant believe he actually loves or cares about me as a person after all this time, because i dont feel deserving or think he of all people would still think about me, i feel like i dont exist to anyone. i thought for a quick second that he was just flirting because why else would he want to talk to me? i got super overwhelmed by that too so then i started calling people because it was getting bad, i was thinking about killing myself with my prescribed klonopin for anxiety which i only recently gave in to taking a bit more than my dose sometimes because it makes me feel relaxed, less anxious and actually works. i didnt want to do this though because i was scared that i would take so much and it would actually start working, which it is, but also means now a normal dose wont do enough. i dont know if i care or not.  but finally i called my boyfriend, then my close friend who lives across the street, sibling to my boyfriend, my friend from college last year who recently moved back but i havent been super close with him, we were the type of friends to mainly hang out in groups. he wants to be closer but for some reason im scared, but then i called my other close friend from high school (C). his girlfriend, my girlfriend at the time and I became such good friends for the last year of high school. our own little group. i always feel weird calling him though because, for a point in high school, even though i was with my girlfriend, i liked him. i tried to get over it and i am, but i still feel like maybe i act weird. after him i was gonna call his girlfriend but he answered and saved my life. earlier, when my boyfriend answered he seemed out of it, or like he didnt want to see me yet, (i made a dumb mistake and were in a small argument, he needs space, but we still text and love each other, he just needs room to be angry) or like he didnt want to help, and that made me very disappointed. perhaps unfairly, but still. my close friend (boyfriends sister) didnt answer, and hasnt answered me all day, i think theyre mad at me because of what happened with their brother, or they just dont want to hang out. while i was talking to camden called and said he would be on his way from queens. i felt embarrassed about it so i called C again and he calmed me down, reassured me that people do love me and want to be there for me. he said his girlfriend wouldve done the same thing if i called her next. i always thought im too triggering for her or that she doesnt care about me as much, i think i was jealous. he even helped me see, at least for a second, that my other old friend from high school still cares about me, at least i think. my boyfriend and their sibling not answering is their problem (not necessarily problem but i cant think of a better word) not mine at all. doesnt make them a bad person though, or someone to be angry at for not answering or understanding. he said all those things that make me feel like a bad person or like the problem is my fault is not true, theyre trivial, theyre bad but understandable. just my very own mistake. you arent defined by what you do. you are a good person. everyone is. when arlo asked me the question of, if your friends called you asking you for the same thing though, you would answer right? i said yes and i think i would. think of my ex when she was going through the same mental state as me AND C’s girlfriends at the same time in highschool, but i hesitated and even doubt myself because i was thinking about people im angry at, people im shy to be alone around, people i barely know who want to be my friend, people i dont like, does this make me a bad person?  im writing all this down because it really does calm me, and i want to be honest for once in my life. ill change the names i guess because i feel like that makes it too personal? this is personal enough. is me wanting to share this bad too? i dont know. maybe itll help. or maybe i just want it to help. As im waiting for my friend to come over and spend the night so i dont kill myself, i want to ask.  whats wrong with me? please be honest about your thoughts, i cant take any more lies. what do you, as a stranger, think of me?

This is literally so long and I'm sorry I made it so long....  There are a lot of places that can give you help. I'm not sure what age you are but if you are in school or college they usually have a counselor or therapist and with the pandemic its probably online but if that is something you can access definitely try that. If you're not comfortable with that or do not go to either then there are a lot of online therapist and hotlines that can help walk you through things and find help. There are even texting ones if you feel more comfortable with that.   If you can't find the help from your family I definitely recommend confiding in a good friend so someone knows what is going on and can be aware to help. I stopped trying for help and I really don't recommend that. Even if using reddit and connecting with someone is a source of talking and venting that would be great. I highly recommend sourcing options for a therapist even if your family doesn't understand, disagrees, or even if you need to keep it secret.  For a long time I gave up and kept things to myself. I sh for a really long time and became really destructive. I have found a few things that have helped me in times where I couldn't talk to anyone or didn't have help and maybe one of these could help.  Finding a hobby like drawing, writing, baking, literally anything can help. I have had several different ones but my current one is making clay earrings. It might seem silly but each different hobby I've had has put me into a different space in my depression and anxiety. It helps me relieve stress and focus on something else and the outcome, even if you don't like how it turned out, is something you made or did and that's something to be proud of.   If you feel like sh you could try refocusing that feeling to something that is healthy like a hobby. That definitely is hard to do, but it really puts a negative into a positive and can bring a feeling of success after awhile.   If you can't do things right now understand that it is okay, you can try doing one small thing a day like picking up a couple of clothes that have been there for days, even if it's not all of them, you have to see it is an achievement. It's small baby steps and if you can't do it today try again tomorrow.  This is something I struggled with but accepting who you are is really important. I thought I was worthless, ugly, pathetic etc and still do once in awhile but the truth is you're not. It took a long time for me to realize I was good enough. If you can try to think of positives about yourself when you are feeling negative about yourself. Like if you feel alone and as if no one loves you or would be better off, if you have pets or good friends think about them, or a plant even, think about how you care about those items or people and how you give them care. Or say you feel down about yourself think about how you have nice eyes or how you look great in that one shirt or anything that helps tell those thoughts hey this one thing even if it's small is good about me. It's hard but it does get better and sometimes you can see the larger things about yourself that are amazing.   If you are having an anxiety attack I found and still do find counting to help. I count by 3 and take a breathe between numbers. This is how I do it.. 3 (breathe) 6 (breathe) 9(breathe) 12 (breathe) and then I count back down to 3. It doesn't have to be numbers it can be names, colors or slowly saying the words to a song you love. It helps by having your mind to focus on something and the breathing helps you control and can help you calm your attack and heart rate down some, at least for me.   If you feel like sh, maybe you can try replacing sh with something else like chewing gum or snapping a hairbow on a water bottle. I sh for a really long time and have tried several things. This was one of the hardest things for me to try to stop. If it is possible please try to find a healthy alternative even if it is going and doing a hobby or something to refocus that desire. To me it became a need and an addiction almost like it was something that I fought to stop but look for healthy alternatives.   Right now I am struggling with taking care of myself again. Some days I can't brush my hair so my fiance has started braiding it to help me. I can't take a shower so I take a bath and relax myself with a bathbomb or bubble bath. I feel alone and useless right now but I remember my dogs and how they never judge me. I can't get up and they lay with me and take care of me, once I can get up they try to help push me. My plants are dying but I can still save them. My depression has hit hard again but at this moment I have support and small things to remember that I am loved or I have things to protect and need to keep trying. Find those things that you have to keep trying for even if it's for yourself, or a plant, or a project you are working on etc. Sometimes things won't work like you won't finish that project or my plant might die but that's okay try again when you can. It sucks but you just have to keep trying.  Depression is a war with several battles, you might not win them all but don't give up. I have chronic depression and have dealt with it for over a decade now. I have failed classes over it, lost friends, lost myself, quit jobs and everything. But when you find those small things you can see that it is worth fighting. I always said it was like a Rollercoaster. It has its ups and downs and I'm stuck on it, but out of everything my greatest accomplishment is realizing depression is not going to stop me. I am worth something and so are you.   You will find the friends, loved ones, hobbies, happiness etc it takes time but start with baby steps and if it hits you again remember you've gotten back up before you can do it again.   I hope somewhere in my overly long post something will help. I have by no means the information that a therapist would or consider myself to know that much about depression. Each person is different and these are some of the things that I have found helpful for myself. I hope that you can find the help you need.  Also if you haven't asked for help yet try. I thought my dad didn't believe in it but he does. Both of my parents now know that I have had chronic depression and I have never felt so much support before. If they don't understand at first maybe they will after a few talks. I'm not sure how your family is though. But if not at least look into hotlines they are trained and can help give advice on how to talk with your family.
I'm with you, friend. I had the exact same situation. I sought help myself over the internet. My family also doesn't believe there's such thing as depression, they just think I have a bad temper, heh.. I was lucky to have a job to pay for the help I needed. I don't know your age or situation. if you need money from your family to seek help I would try to talk to them and if it's pointless then try to come up with something they could believe. Internet also has a lot to offer, don't waste time on motivation articles, try to look for help you can get for free depending on where you live. Try to talk to someone you trust, teacher, colleagues, friend. It's normal to go what you're going through, but don't let it bring you down. Best of luck to you!
Sweetface, I'm trying to ascertain what age you might be since you didn't mention anything about your employment or whether you might be in school or college.  Since you have only mentioned your status I wonder if I might ask you a few questions or at least have you elaborate more.  I've had time in my life where I wasn't  motivated to get up in the morning and get going but those were times when I was not committed to a job or someone depending on me.  So many over the last 9 months are dealing with isolation and fear.  So, until  you share more I'd suggest you at least share  your feelings with a friend, parent, or someone  you can confide in.  I'm hoping you will give me some further insight.  I'm listening and will be here to share with you in your walk out of this.

I’m am pretty sure you’re an amazing person. You don’t have to feel like you need to offer more than yourself to other people. You need to learn to trust yourself more, because you deserve it. After you start treating yourself right, any social interaction will feel natural. Just remember that you don’t have anything to prove.
First, try to understand that people are like puzzles- you just need to find the right part to get them. Im sure that even if you don't see it you are an interesting person with a lot of hobbies and you share those hobbies and interests with a lot of other people. Try to start by talking to an old friend or someone you don't really know but wants to get close to. After some time you will see the difference!
As others have said, I can definitely concur with them and encourage you to follow their advice. You are like many other people and almost definitely have enough interests to be enjoyable to interact with. Having hobbies and interests aren't bad as it can help find more people, but actually making friends is largely about how you view yourself and how you interact with others. If you genuinely find you don't have much to talk about when talking to people it very likely to be anxiety or awkwardness, but if taking that into consideration and seeking help for it-it still remains, exploring other interests is definitely not a bad thing.  Otherwise called self-development, it can be really good for having more fun in your life and finding a passion. Of course, this is assuming that working on your anxiety, getting higher self-confidence, and related doesn't help. For example, I used to do nothing all day, period. It left me with nothing to discuss or flesh myself out with. Therefore, in scenarios like that doing self-development isn't bad and can be really helpful. It's just knowing when that's actually the case versus you just bringing yourself down or underestimating yourself. Best of luck man.

To make a long story short I am currently working more than one job to make ends meet (teacher and tutor), but my tutor job is making my depression worse. My boss does not decorate so it's 4 blank walls with you and a student in them (no shelves, refrigerator, coffee machine, break room, etc). My state doesn't have break laws, so I can be scheduled for 6 hours with no break. I've tried talking to my boss about this and other issues but they refuse to help (ignore my texts since they never show up to work, give impractical advice, etc). I'm past burnout and even thinking about this job makes my suicidal thoughts come back. I can't quit because I need the money, but I don't know what to do. Any advice would be great. Thank you.

It sounds like the job, although necessary for your finances, is causing you more harm than benefit.  Can you give students something to work on so you can step outside for a little fresh air?  How about bringing things with you to this blank room.  Hang a few things on the wall... take them home with you when you are done.  Are you seeking alternate employment?  How life saving is this second job?  Can you tell your boss if work conditions aren't improved, you will be seeking new employment elsewhere and they will be seeking a new tutor to work in their jail cell?

I’m currently going through a valley after having a good peak few days ago. I dont feel like doing anything, my sleep cycle is a mess and my personal hygiene needs to be addressed soon. Knowing all this I have 0 energy.   I blame  the movie your name engraved herein  from triggering god knows what emotions but I cant stop crying and feeling sad. In a bad funk these days

Bad periods happen, it certainly feels bad but it's normal. Don't throw yourself down and try taking life on one small step at a time, take your time. You don't have to get perfectly clean, do your laundry and tidy your room all at once, if you can manage to get out of the bed try just sitting under the shower, and if not don't be too harsh on yourself. Mental health is a journey and a fight, you can't expect to always be winning but the important thing is that you keep on fighting. Best of luck.
\^ This is excellent advice! I for sure have these bad funks as well to the point that I lay in bed for days at a time drinking excessively and binge watching TV just to stop feeling. It's awful. Moreover, numbing doesn't help in the long term. What seems to help is doing exactly what HeeHoo is recommending. Do one thing at a time. Take the small steps and allow them to add up. I would also point out that motivation is not an arrow; it is a circle, paraphrasing the writings of Mark Manson, who is the author of *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a #@%!* . Sometimes motivation follows action rather than the other way around. I have found that putting the cart in front of the horse can help me gain motivation. So, OP, the take home is this: just do one concrete thing today. Brush your teeth. If you do that, then today is a win, a small win, but still a win. Then tomorrow brush your teeth *and* set an alarm for a reasonable time in the morning. (I found that getting up at a consistent time is the best way for me to reset my sleeping schedule. Eventually, I will be tired enough to fall asleep at a reasonable time again.) Keep building up like this. We can do this together. I believe in you!   I will close with a short dialectic between two characters in a DFW short story:   "There is a reason perfectionist rhymes with paralysis."   "But it doesn't--"   "CLOSE ENOUGH!"

Uhm, hi. Lets start by saying I’m sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, as the title states I’m desperate. Also, if I’m breaking any rules (I have read them and I don’t think so) I hereby apologise.    My friend is suffering from depression and at the moment it’s bad, really bad. The past few years I’ve tried my best to support them, love them and hopefully brighten their day a bit, but now I’ve come to a point where I feel like I can no longer do anything. I am fully aware that I am not a/their psychologist or therapist and I know it’s not my job to help them, because quite frankly, I am not qualified to do so. (Quick note, they are already receiving professional help)   Nevertheless, I am a concerned friend and am searching for ways I can still reach/ support them from the sidelines. Would anyone be willing to help me out with some advice?    UPDATE Someone was interested, so a little update without giving away too much. They have been very down lately, but just today they told me they were feeling a bit better, so I’m counting that as a little victory for the time being.  I’m still very worried but I am aware that I really can’t do anything for them but show them I care, so that’s what I’ll keep doing. Their fight is not over yet and I’m not giving up on them

I'll say in advance I'm also not trained nor am I a professional on this matter, but I'll try my best to help.  I obviously don't know the person you're talking about and that's the tricky part of depression, it hits different people in their own different way, so there's not an universally right thing to do.  Try talking to them about this, voice your concerns reassuring them they're not a burden, and that what you want isn't to make them hide that side of them but rather to help them, and ask how you can to that best. If they want to isolate because they feel like they are a burden or that they don't deserve others reassure them that you don't agree and that instead you care about them and value them as friends. If they feel they just want to be alone offer to keep them company without having to talk, my best friend has done that for me and it helped me greatly, but if they really do need to stay alone respect that. Generally make them feel that they're loved and that you truly value them.   Once again I'm not a specialist so please take this as a grain of salt. I hope I could help, keep us updated
I can say from experience that just sending them a message asking them how's their day been once in a while can make a huge difference  Remember that he have professional help but it dosen't solve everything (am saying this without knowing the guy though) so just try to be there for him
You’ve made some good points and while I’ve always tried to make sure they do not feel like a burden, I might just remind them of that again. The asking how I can help them part is also something I think would help them. In general I already  try to give them “options” when I know they’re down like, “do you want to talk about it or would you rather have a distraction?” but maybe straight up asking what works best for them would do them good.  Thanks for answering!
Thank you for your reply. I try to ask how their day was every other day or so, it’s nice to hear it might actually make some difference.
Glad I could help, once again please keep us updated

I've just been diagnosed with anxiety/depression.  When relating my history to the psychiatrist I began to realize that I've probably had some aspects of both for just about as far back as my memory stretches.  Unfortunately my family history is kind of murky. My father was an alcoholic who essentially drank himself to death (or rather died from complications of alcohol). I can only assume that there's something that drove him to drink.  My mom is just about the most gloomy person I have ever met. She is constantly pessimistic. But she refuses to acknowledge that anything's wrong or seek mental health care.   I have a pretty good feeling that my anxiety / depression stems from bad genetics. But unfortunately I have no real way to investigate whether this is the case given that I'm not in contact with the paternal side of the family and my mom refuses to discuss the issue.  Anybody in a similar situation? It would be nice to be able to provide psychiatrists with a complete family history, but I'm not in a position to be able to provide one.

Well, it sounds like your Mom may be depressed. Also, sometimes alcoholics became that way because they initially drink to relieve stress or calm down. The term “self-medicating” is literal. After a time, they’re not able to stop. So the chances that at least one parent has depression in their family is pretty high.

hi there  make sure to take care of yourself, like clean your space and eat well. write your feelings down. if you have a dog, take a walk with them to clear your head a little bit and so you don't insolate yourself all day in your room. one thing I do lately is make breakfast for me and my mom and share time with her. It's not easy but little things like that make a difference. if you can, talk about your suicidal thoughts with a professional, who will help you with therapy and medicine maybe.  I really hope you feel better today and know you can do this. xx
Thank you <3
big hug pal ♡

I've got exam next week and I haven't studied (except for one of them out of six). If it was last year I would have been fine because i could study for hours on hand without care but now I get tired easily, get distracted and lose concentration easily and very much panick and feel miserable if i push myself to study. Worst thing is that i've already taken school at 50% last month so i only have half the subject to do but i still feel like i can't. I feel miserable and ashamed of myself.

Is the thought of studying so much overwhelming?  Have you tried changing up your setting?  Go somewhere else to study, and break it up into smaller bits.  Tell yourself you are going to study one section, then do something else for a bit.  Something pleasurable.  After a few cycles of that, you will feel some accomplishment and hopefully that will give you the motivation to keep going.

I've felt depressed for as long as I can remember, but I only got diagnosed early last year. I've been on meds, seen multiple counselors, and even been to a psychiatric hospital. I'm currently months behind in school, none of my "friends" talk to me, I can't really make new ones because I'm not supposed to have social media and even when we're supposed to go, back to school in person, I can't because I'm so behind and my brother just tested positive for Covid,  I was dumped a month ago but it still hurts because he was my best friend and the only person I could really go to for anything anyway. My stepmother has taken away my phone and my playstation and I'm too anxious to ask for them back because I feel like she's going to say that I can't have my playstation until I'm caught up with school, and she has some dumb app that lets her see everything I do on my phone. I'm logged into a separate reddit account on my computer, which is why I'm able to post this. I don't know what to do anymore. They've locked up all of the medication and knives so I can't hurt myself. We don't have any strong rope. Everything hurts so much and I can't do anything to make it stop. I don't know what I can do anymore.

I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few months ago. The medicines make me majorly sleepy. I keep asking for new meds and whatever we have tried so far doesn't work without making me drowsy. I stopped them recently because I have exams and cannot sleep so much. The consequence being an absolute lack of motivation to do anything. I didn't brush or shower for days, stopped cleaning, studying, everything. I have been having major bouts of crying. I am starting them again but I just feel so hopeless. I am forever going to be dependent on these meds and they will ruin my quality of life. I just won't have a normal life ever. How do I deal with that realization?

I'll be dead soon from multiple infections, I've tried my entire life to get help from family but they don't listen/punish me for being disabled/physically/mentally.  I haven't been to the doctor or had any meds for several years since kicked off insurance, I've been on ADHD/antidepressants meds since I was 8 and can't function without it (family could have changed something about that but never cared to no matter my pleas). My ADHD med helped more with depression than anything, I've tried 100's of anti-depressants and was told my last resort was some machine to reset my brain chemistry (cost more than my life was worth). I've been sick my entire life and called a liar even when I was diagnosed in my 20's with arthritis's/fibromyalgia and already had many other diagnoses from a kid, I got too sick to work and tried telling - but I couldn't possible know what my body could handle and I just had to be "lazy". I had a couple of minor cavities at the time but was going to get no help from family, instead my stepfather bought his real son an entire house (he's the lazy one), basically told me to go fuck myself. That's what pressured me to make money any way I could legal or not (and payed a steep price), now I'm nearly 30? Every tooth needs to be pulled but no way for that to happen, I've tried getting disability but am judged because I'm white, look 16 (somehow still) have a tattoo and background (yet I know people who've cheated the system and have disability even though they fail drug tests).  &#x200B;  I've had to live with a psychopath who's tried to kill me multiple times (he even smiled once) my entire life, no way to take care of myself, my mom can't get her meds without him and half "brothers" think it's every person for themselves. I've even gone to jail for defending myself when he was strangling me to death, my mom came in after, I told her he was going to kill me and he smiled while she was looking at me, so I turned her head and she saw that wicked smile. I got sent to jail with a protective custody vs me, illegally sold my things, I tried multiple gov departments to get a escort to get some of my things ( cause I knew he would do this) but they all intentionally gave me the run-around.  &#x200B;  In court he was lying and shedding crocodile tears, saying he's tried everything to help me (yet I was sleeping on a childs bed with a giant hole in the center for years, rotting teeth and no meds). He knew the judge and some of the other people there already so I didn't stand a chance in defending myself, their minds were made up.  &#x200B;  I was physically beaten by my stepbrother when I was a toddler (why I have scoliosis, a doctor told me if it gets worse it'll start affecting major internal organs, that was several years ago.), when I wasn't being hit by an abusive principle in a Christian school (because I was Satan incarnate for constantly questioning) which just made me act out with everything else going on and would give her a reason to hit me with this rugby(?) bat that had holes drilled (3 spaced apart). I was being attacked (just one of the many concussions I got was from being pile drived head first onto the trunk of my moms blue trans-am after they were making goat noises at her and I told em to go fuck themselves), pepper sprayed him and they called the cops on me (got a family cop so they got off scott free and their racism continued for years until I just stopped leaving the house).  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Everyday I remember everything and it's not by choice it just runs on loops, I'm in my room knee's-to-chin and my stepbrother is breaking things and screaming at my mom and I hope I'm not next. We've even slept with knives under our pillows because of them, yet he's had EVERYONE believing I'm the evil one my entire life.  &#x200B;  His real son has gotten off with things that would have left me homeless (again), like selling a thousand dollar bag of coke when he was 16, I remember when he punched a hole in his wall to hide it and my mom found it. Of course he was never punished by his dad, just one of dozens of instances.  &#x200B;  He would give me things and after I got attached would take them away and act like he never gave them to me. His son used to have a key and would come when we were gone and steal stuff, can't tell you how many gifts I've had stolen when he was automatically given better gifts to begin with.  &#x200B;  when I was around 5, we were walking down a sidewalk and found a bird with an injured wing. He put his shoe over its head and slowly pressed until a "pop" was heard, and he smiled. That really messed me up and I think was when my depression really started (sleeping with cockroaches in the ghetto before my stepdad didn't really stick with me like that did)  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  When I was 14 it looked like my mom was dying and my stepdad spared no time to tell me it's my fault she's sick (I still blame myself). Recently my mom told him you know he has so many problems because of you right, and he just played it off like he NEVER knew what he was doing, and of course my mom just easily forgets everything, never told anyone about the abuse and still won't get me help somehow (other family members or otherwise).  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  For a short time when I had my ADHD meds I was making content and was in a partnership, then my pc fried and my stepbrother gave me his "spare gaming pc" after I cut myself to the bone and was abused in a mental hospital. It's a pretty old machine so haven't been able to do anything with it really. All my stepbrother does is play fallout 76 on a nice PC, I'm too depressed to eat or have the energy to clean and I'm still called lazy. Everyone acts like I choose to live like this, they tell me how THEY think I should live my life without ever actually spending time to see what my life has been like, only what they THINK they see. When I had protective order vs me I lived in a "friends" storage shed in the laziest worst environment I've seen that was actually a choice. They'd just smoke weed and play games bumming off their mom, their actual floor (the entire floor in the entire house) was covered in dog crap, even the bathroom. Just horrible living conditions in general and I had nothing to do but the few times they let me play a game in the year I stayed there, I couldn't sit down and read with my nerves and the fact it was always around 90+ degrees. I asked one of my half brothers if he could get me a phone with unlimited internet so I could at least watch youtube while I'm in this hell hole. His response was to get me a phone with only a few gigs on it, and I would get a phone with internet when I moved back to the house (even though there's wifi at the house so I wouldn't need it then). Instead of trying to understand and help me, he just tried to control me more.  &#x200B;  My other half-brother,  when I tried to open up to him he just went off saying I choose to live like this and I intentionally think about everything that's happened to me and I'm lazy and this and that just yelling at me. It's kind of not hard to think about things that are still physically affecting you, he told me "you don't know what I've been through, I've been through worse", yet never even once tried opening up to me and I would've listened. He instantly made it about him then said I only care about myself when I spent the previous 3 days killing myself cleaning the animal hair out of carpets so he wouldn't have severe allergies. I've put up with not asking my mom to get a divorce so she has medicine and a roof over her head. I've only stuck around this long because of my mom, and somedays that doesn't feel like it's enough.  &#x200B;  It's not easy living off of everyone's generosity, mainly because it always comes with their conditions which might only make sense in their head.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  I wish I had the energy to do many things, and I've had the same dream since I picked up a sega gen controller, but I've been told my entire life I could do things I can't and I can't do things I can. When I was 12 I taught myself blender (the program) and did many things I was passionate about, I'd give anything to be able to do what I know (art/games), but still family just calls me lazy, so I guess I'm just lazy.  &#x200B;  There's so much more but I dont' feel like I could keep going. I just wanted to tell my side of things even if it doesn't change anything, maybe someone's been in a similar spot?

I am sorry for what happened to you. Nothing is more painful than knowing you cannot help someone. I can't say I've been in the same situation but to certain degree I know what it's like to be blamed for something that is out of your control, be named lazy while you have so little energy that even getting out of bed was a great effort. I know what it's like to be told how to live by people who think they know better. I know what it's like to live on someone's generosity and given conditions.. I cannot say it was as bad as what you've been through because honestly it wasn't, but it brought me a lot of pain nonetheless. I don't know how things work where you live. Maybe there's a chance you can address to some services that help people in tough situations.I wish I could be of help. I hope things will get better for you.

Thank you so much. I've tried to get help from permiacare, but they don't prescribe narcotics (my ADHD med was vyvanse since a teenager and ritalin when I was 8). They don't have a single male in the entire building and have been treated poorly for being male, they've made me wait 4 hours in a examination room when I was in dying pain before from fibromyalgia (I was ready to start screaming and throwing things), the entire time I could hear nurses making jokes and having fun while I was waiting.      My mom talked to some of the patients in the waiting room and apparently they can get pain meds (I've had rx's before so not like I was asking for something new just couldn't afford it anymore), just not me. They told me I would have to go to a doctor (when they know that's not possible).     They own the same mental hospital where I was abused, I'd tell them I'm lactose intolerant and they'd microwave cheese on a sandwich so I couldn't peel it off. They would make me walk a block or more to the other side to get water to the point where I was so dehydrated they ordered saline for me instead of just bringing me water like I asked.     They made people with skin cancer go outside for rec time (even though they asked not to, they didn't want to split man power because they are lazy), they served uncooked corndogs, frenchfries, so much abuse was going on at that place. The whole system here is broken.     Basically my city/state is 3rd world conditions when it comes to getting any help, esp during corona now. If I get corona I doubt I would survive but I wouldn't want to as I've seen what it does.

I have h.pylori, which is a gut bacteria that I've has for over a year now. It causes me to burp frequently and is worsening this chronic medical condition I have that makes me vomit alot.  I did antibiotics for this a year ago but I didn't take the medicines as much as i was supposed to for the 2 weeks window I had to let the medicine cure it. I ignored it and my doctor recently tested me again and I still have it and I've been given another set of medicine for 2 weeks. It's been more than 2 weeks and I've barely ever taken them as prescribed. The pills taste terrible, and the most I've ever taken them was 3 times a day and I only managed to do that once.  Taking my medicine at the same time everyday is hard enough, it's even harder I don't have a routine wake up and sleep schedule. I'm feeling helpless that I don't know how im going to be able to ever get myself to consistently take all these medicines as prescribed to finally get rid of this gut problem that could grow worse. Now that I've been ineffectively taking some of the medicines in a non consistent way, I probably have no hope left for the medicine I have left to be useful enough to eradicate it because the process won't work unless I do it exactly as prescribed.

I have no clue what’s going on or what your situation is  But I can say that you’re not pathetic, you’re not useless, you’re not lazy. I can’t help you with your specific situation, but I hope I can be an external voice saying you can do this. Not some fake self-talk that feels hollow, but a real other person who believes in you. It’s gonna be hard. Hopefully someone else who knows what they’re doing can help your specific problem. But don’t lose hope. Try and force yourself to start. Maybe use alarms or reminders to force yourself to do it. I’m sorry I’m not an expert.  Love you bro.
Hi. I use habit tracker apps on my phone as a virtual pillbox. At exact times, it asks if I have taken my medication yet. I only mark yes once the pills are in my mouth. I hope that helps.

There are times that I wish I was dead, not because I think no one would miss me but the exact opposite. I feel like my death is the only way for my life to be appreciated. I daydream a lot about what people say about me when I’m not present (both good and bad). This is definitely an extension of that. I imagine my friends gathering around at my funeral talking about how much they miss me. It’s really fucked up and I hate it. I don’t want to have these thoughts but when I get really there’s a strange level of comfort I feel when thinking about it.

I had this too. At certain point it's normal to think about death as long as you don't attempt it. But harsh truth is that once you're dead you probably won't see anything that happens after, won't feel anything, it won't be even you. That thought kinda stopped me from such thinking. When you have such ideas as you described that means that you seek to be appreciated by other people, which is a false beacon to follow. You have to appreciate yourself first then maybe give some reason for others to appreciate you. If you feel like you do a lot for someone and they don't seem to notice then maybe distance yourself from them if not forever then for some time and do something for yourself because you deserve it.

I’ve been having very tough years. About 1.5 years ago I felt things are getting out of hand and I went to see a doctor. He got a detailed history and told me that I’m not clinically depressed, but I have reactionary or situational depression due to the conditions I’m in. He put me on 5mg Lexapro/Escitalopram. I had been doing pretty well and earlier in this pandemic I could see how easily I could get chores done that previously seemed very tough.   This autumn things were getting ugly with my abusive ex and my toxic parents and I was having a very very tough time coping. I decided to change my location for a while as I could work remotely, and I knew that would help me with my moods. However I visited my doctor and he told me that it is up to me and if I feel the need, I can double up the dose, as 5mg is quite low and most of his patients have increased their antidepressant doses during the pandemic.   I increased the dose for a few weeks but I felt I was having the adaptability issues again with the new dose (sleep, etc.) and in the meanwhile I got a safety order from the court that protected me from my abusive ex and things calmed down a bit. So I consulted the doctor and he said I can stay on 5mg if I don’t feel the need.   A month or so has passed and I have very little drive to do things. Mind you, I have a crappy job that I hate with passion, I’m working from home for almost a year now, which is good in saving me from seeing the asshole managers on a daily basis, but also is getting tough to stay motivated and disciplined in doing things and getting out of bed.   If I go outside, I can spend hours walking around and exploring, but when I’m at home, and I have to work and study and apply for jobs and do my tax returns, I do my best to crawl in bed instead and do anything but avoid getting the must-do things done.   Am I depressed? Shall I increase the pills dose? What if I get used to the new dose after a while? Will I just keep increasing the dose for the rest of my life then?  TL; DR: I’m not clinically, but situationally depressed. I’ve been on 5mg Escitalopram and my doctor is flexible about increasing or keeping the dose. I’m struggling with doing boring crap done while I’m fully alone and lonely and have no support system. Shall I increase the dose? If not, how can I keep going?

That's up to you.  If you already tried increasing the dosage and it didnt work well, I wouldn't try it again, but rather ask for another anti depressant.   Also If you up the dosage, the side effects may be stronger or could come, If you didnt have any.
When I initially started on the 5mg, I was extremely sleepy for so long and it took me a long while for it to kick in. I increase it to 10mg just for a couple of weeks back in November, but I was feeling quite well back then due to some slight changes, so I can’t tell if it was the higher dose or just life improvement impact.   The problem is that I don’t have any family or friends where I live. I was feeling horrible all day yesterday till I managed to make some plans with someone for the weekend, and that totally boosted me up. But it’s not easy connecting with people and getting things done. So I end up being miserable just because I have no external motivations or stimulations and life gets extremely exhausting and frustrating.
When the only negative thing you've experienced was sleepiness, that should be allright. That will go away, after you get used to the new dosage.   The problem ist, that anti depressants arent the happy pill. You cant rely on them to make you happy, there has to be a change in your personal life too. An as long as this isnt the case, anti depressants can give you a small boost, to change a few things, but it wont make everything good, if your life is at the lowest.  I'd say to try it again, even if it's just a few weeks, until things change.   Sure, this whole pandemic thing sucks and your problems probally won't be solved within a few weeks. But a few weeks can help to at least change your mindset a little bit.   And allways remeber, that you are worth it and you can make it, even if life might seem rough at the moment and the repetition of being fucking exhausted and tired every day sucks, but that will be go away soon.
Thanks a lot. Your first paragraph explained it very well. I got myself out to the nature over the weekend, and that was my fix instead of the antidepressant double dose.  My life should hopefully change this year once I can dissolve this marriage and cut ties forever with my abuser, but of course I still have my toxic family on the other side that I’ve set aside for now and I have to deal with at some point.   Pandemic has helped me in some ways, but it’s also getting very very exhausting in some other ways...

Hi, One of my main symptoms with depression is a lack of motivation. When I started getting treatment for my depression I made good progress and started studying regularly with minor ups and downs. Like most people I stopped studying over the christmas break. I have assignments due in by the end of the month but I'm finding it really hard to do them. I just have no desire to do them. I know I can because I have done before but I can't remember how I started.  Does anyone have any advice ?

It sounds as if you are electing not to complete your tasks because you simply have no desire to do so.  We all do things that we don't enjoy.  Sometimes I am not motivated directly to get up early and get dressed and go to my job.  I do not desire this.  But I do it anyway, without motivation because this is what responsibility is.  I would advise you create yourself a schedule for the remainder of the month, and follow it.  Allow yourself some free time in the morning, but not too much.  Getting some work done in the morning will make you feel accomplished the rest of the day.  You may find after a few days of following the schedule that you created by yourself that you can actually be quite productive when you set your mind to it.

I need assistance with accountability. I’m Bipolar I and am currently only on a mood stabilizer. I am almost always on depression side of the disorder and am constantly struggling to do ANYTHING – just typing out this post took days of thinking about before finally actually writing it. I am physically capable of doing the things that would help alleviate my current state, just have a hard time finding the motivation to do so.   I’d like to have positive support to help keep me accountable for improving my current situation. I haven’t reached out to anyone I know personally because of the shame, self-disgust and loathing that comes with living with a mental illness. I would feel anxious and guilty about them seeing how much I’ve let everything go. I live alone and avoid dealing with how awful and appalling my apartment has become because it mostly affects only me.   I read the the rules of this sub and I think it would be allowed for me to post a weekly goal and then provide progress pictures to show completion. I realize that this might typically be a task to share with a therapist but am not financially able to afford an appointment. And maybe posting would inspire someone to do the same?  It would definitely be a huge help to me. Would this be okay?  Thoughts?

They keep having fun of me, almost straight in my face.  They didn't actually wanted to teach me anything during the time I worked here. Just handed me some papers and that's all.  I think they are balancing between me and some other guy. They didn't actually said that one of us should go, or move to some other department, but they are not happy at all.

It doesn't sound like your life is collapsing.  It sounds like you have a crappy job and you should seek new employment.  We have all had crappy jobs.  I can think of several I have had.  When you secure new employment, give them whatever notice time is expected where you live, do your job the best you can until your last day, tell everyone good luck and walk about with your head held high.

When you NEED your job to pay bills and eat, that is motivation enough.  Motivation for not being fired for sub-par work, then requiring you to seek new employment without a good reference from your previous employer is also very motivating.

I also have 2 kids who I treasure I would do anything for them but giving up my time with them just makes me feel terrible. I have a really good opportunity to get my family out of a bad living arrangement but I feel like im doing something wrong. On top of all of it I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety which I have been dealing with for the past 6 years and last year I stopped taking my meds because the area I live in doesn't have many places to go and none with openings

**Hi, I'm Adrian, I'm 15 years old, I want to put you in a position if you read this. At the beginning of the year, so far I have felt as if my life did not belong to me. Let me explain, I feel lost. There is something inside me that seeks something, I don't know what it is. A few months ago I lost my girlfriend, and it has gotten worse, I have injured myself 2 times so far this year on a smaller scale. I have recently had anxiety attacks that luckily, because of the holidays, I have not had an entire week. I have come to walk with my family, cross the street, see a car drive, and think what would happen if it disappeared, if the people I care about would be happier without me by their side. Because of these thoughts I have become very isolated, and stay up late at night, and this has affected and continues to affect my mental health, if I don't do something I feel useless, and it makes me want to cry. I hate myself once again, for being so selfish, thinking about me ... just me, and me, and me and me. But I just want to get to release it at once, the pain becomes intense at times. I just hope to get up in the morning and not wonder why I'm here, or have fun and wonder if I deserve it or not. Thank you for reading this far**

Hey Adrian,  Just wanted to pop in and let you know that you're not alone. I'm sorry to hear about your relationship. Break ups are never easy so we can't expect to simply "get over it" but that's how we experience life. Life is experience the good, bad and ugly. You're still young and have a whole life ahead of you. It looks like you're going through some bad and ugly right now, but remember there's some good in it. I've had the same thoughts when I walks across the street or drive around. What if I just disappeared? Everyone would be happy... But I wouldn't completely know that. Since I'm not everyone. I am me. I think about someone I really care about (my parents, siblings, or friends) and wonder if I would cry if they disappeared. They would. So allow those thoughts to flow in, but so long as you don't take action then you're not being selfish. You're existing another day for you and for those who care about you.   And selfishness. Only thinking about yourself. That's perfectly fine. Right now you're hurting and struggling and you're trying to take care of yourself the best you can. You think about yourself because you're mentally struggling and you're doing your best to ease the pain you feel. Don't be afraid to be selfish and talk about yourself and your struggles to others and those you can trust. They care so much about you and they can help. You're not alone. You're not selfish. You are going through a hard time and you're doing your best to heal and love yourself.

I have triggers that cause me to shut down. Currently, it is me living with the man who partook in the baby-making process with my mother and created me. We do not have a relationship as he did not raise me and I had know idea he existed until I was 10. He is also a Jehovah’s Witness. I telework and I stay in the bedroom all day. I don’t talk to him because he only talks about his religion in hopes of trying to sway me into being in that religion as well. I can honestly admit that I only love him because he is my father, other than that...well.  I haven’t cried hard in several years and when I find myself on the brink of breaking down, I stop crying immediately. The tears well up in my eyes and sting, but not one teardrop falls. What is wrong with me? I hold back so many tears that it makes my ears and throat swell and tighten. I’ve spoken with a psychologist and a psychiatrist...all was well until those 8 weeks were up. I’ve also been on three types of meds, which only made me sleepy. I fear that I may need longtime therapy, but it has to be more of a cure than that.   Somebody please just help me by offering some type of relief. I’m so tired.   Thanks.

Are you saying that you are unable to cry? Because I can relate to that. I've gone through at least 10 years of depression and mental health issues without crying not because I didn't want to, but because I simply couldn't.  The past couple of years I've been putting a lot of energy in my therapy and I found out I was actually pretty detached from my feelings without realizing it. I became an expert in going on and trying to hide my pain, even from myself. Now I have these moments where I can feel really bad and actually allow that feeling to be there instead of shutting me out from it and.. I can cry. Only sometimes, but I can now. Do you think this could be the case for you as well? Maybe it's hard to tell if you've only had 8 weeks of 'therapy', but I thought writing this may at least feel you less alone in your situation.  &#x200B;  Take care. Mental health issues are tough to deal with and everyone who keeps doing so gets so much of my respect.
As a long time sufferer of depression and anxiety I had a hard lesson that took almost two decades to learn that changed my life for the better.  We cannot control our emotions. When we hide them or suppress them over the years they find another way to DEMAND our attention.  I even fought this after being hospitalized for uncontrollable thoughts.  It turns out I have a controlling personality. Not towards other people, just myself. I had to be in total control of my outside appearance since I was a child. That mostly worked until I became an adult and life threw more at me than my ability to process it. Things like death in the family, being the smartest and level headed person all the time. Showing the world a fake personality that I was always fine and you can come to me for help, be it psychological or physical.  It ended up taking the last 3 years of my 20's, from being athletic and happy go lucky to chronic fatigue and depression. Which transformed into panic attacks at 30.  Do your best to let yourself feel the bad, sad, painful emotions and float through them. They are part of our mind on purpose!!! They are our minds solution to problems that must be felt.  I wish you all the best and feel your pain.
I was just thinking about that yesterday how I can’t cry anymore. I wish I knew why. I’m assuming it’s due to unprocessed trauma, but I’m not sure. It’s a very numb existence.
Yes, I believe that to be the case as I’ve held I a lot of pain and really good at putting on this facade as though things are fine. I don’t share my feelings/thoughts to people as they always have the perfect answers to everything and they don’t deal with the things that I deal with (or so it seems). I have had these issues as long as I can remember.   I really appreciate your input. I really do.
Thank you so much. This sounds like me😞
It sounds like you're in a sub-optimal situation to overcome this issue.. I don't mean to discourage you or anything, but like I said from my experience it can take quite a bit of therapy to break through that facade/mask/wall. It becomes second nature to subconsciously protect yourself from the pain, but in the long term it's not healthy nor helpful anymore. You said " I fear that I may need longtime therapy, but it has to be more of a cure than that.", would something like that be viable where you are from? I'm guessing/assuming you're from the US and from what I've heard it's not that easy or affordable to have those kinds of therapy?  I wish I could actually help, unfortunately all I can do is listen and talk to you.

(edits**) My partner(M17)** and I(F16)** had a really simple argument that exploded by 1. My partner getting really upset 2. Me getting really emotional  To sum up the problem that turned into many problems It came down to seeing that I accpected I was wrong for simply mentioning something and they are acussing me that I am still hurt by it and that I won't move on, because of that I keep "annoying" them about how THEY are making me feel  My partner dissmised how I felt about them reacting to me speaking up about my concerns   And after going through that really flight or fight type of a moment My friend has told me she wants to support my decision if I leave my partner She has stated that they is 1. Being a jerk 2. Dissmissing how I feel 3. Maniuplating the situation to make themself victim and unintentionally or intentionally making me feel like I owe my partner to apologize to them  My mother told me " (My partner) does not know what they want, they are lazy and depend on someone else for their simple needs "  If a relationship really is two ways Then why does my partner tell me that they want to be the shoulder I can cry and rest on Yet when the time comes they confess they don't care and avoid talking to me  I hope this doesn't really blow up but as of right now I really don't know what I have to do yet or even what to know even if I break up with my partner today or tomorrow or later or sooner or whenever I know no one else I only have friends and maybe that's all I need but I'm scared of a life without this specific person, I told them everything there is to know I ask them if they are ever bothered or hurt to come to me and I will be more than happy enough to help them through their struggles I tell them I love them and do anything for them At the end of the day I want to be happy with them  (Short): partner has been a jerk as of last month and this month and it really stresses me out that they haven't been supportive of me even if I was sad over something they thought as "insignificant" or  "little"   Am I wrong or an asshole or something?  Some background info: they haven't been violent with me at all other than getting upset at video games and taking something out of my hand and throwing it with a snarky comment like " no one told you to do this " or " stop " in a irritated tone which has happened once or twice.

For Sure this situation sucks.  You are 16, you're still a teenager. Dont rely on someone who doesnt make you feel good and doesn't care about you. If you had an argument and he kinda exploded, this can happen here and there to eveyone. But he at least should've excused himself.  If he keeps acting like that, I'd rather leave a toxic relationship that keep it, this will only destroy you in the long run, until it's too late.  And like I said, you're 16, and you have the time of your life to find another one.   I hate to tell ya that, but if he's toxic, I would go trough all that and I'd rather have my peace.  May I ask how long he is your partner?

Hi. So I’m scheduled to start classes in two weeks, and I’m starting to get cold feet. This is my third time going to college. I was 18 on my first attempt, and the experience was horrible. I was so miserable and lonely. I didn’t make any friends, and I barely went to class. I really wasted me and mom’s money. The second time, I went online only as I worked. It was easier as I didn’t have to go face to face. Now I’m attempting to go for a third time, but I have to go on campus. So I quit my job (starting to think that was a mistake). I have enough money saved up to support myself while I go, but I honestly don’t even know what I want to do. I’m majoring in English, which people say is a horrible choice for a degree, but nothing else interests me. I just feel completely lost. I feel overwhelmed with the thought of networking, being around younger students who probably (most definitely) have more life experience, talking to professors, speaking up in class, etc. I’m 26, and still feel like a 12 year old girl. So pathetic. On top of being depressed almost all day every day, I’m really thinking about just not going, but I know I need to do something. If I’m not working or going to school, that’s embarrassing. Does anyone have advice for me? Thank you for reading this far.

Hi! I’m also a college student and it can be really overwhelming sometimes. What’s helped for me is Keeping a whiteboard that I wrote down all my due dates on to stay organized. I’d also recommending looking into what psychological resources your university. They’re usually pretty effective and those organizations often host events where you can meet people who have depression where you can talk aboht your experience! Good luck, you’ve got this!
I agree with the previous poster. Keeping a planner has helped me keep organized. Talking to someone has really helped me too. I tend to get really stressed and anxious near the middle of the semester. Having someone to go to and talk about life has helped. For me that’s been my girlfriend. A counselor could also be a good idea. Praying for you.
I literally dropped all my classes this semester and next for the same reasons today.
Hi there, suggesting an odd viewpoint here but I've come to learn a couple of things: First of all, just fuck it (pardon my french), we are all going to die in the end, right? Why not live life to the fullest, choosing your own way, "the greatest prison people live in, is the fear of what other people think". Secondly, maybe it's all as it is supposed to be? Fate perhaps? Maybe it was meant to be that you didn't succeed the first 2 times. We may never know. And last but not least, I think you'll be an amazing extrovert in the future to come, you're just warming up. Wish you the best
From the way you talk I sense you care about people alot. You can't make friends and you don't speak up in the class so what? That's not your fault it is just your personality and you're a quiet person. Just go to the classroom in the mindset you're going to LEARN something. I always had the same problem, I couldn't make friends in college either but I just followed my passion, I filled my time reading and doing homework between classes because I didn't have people I can talk to. It sucks, it's depressing, I'm not cool in the eyes of these people and i was depressed too. But i forgot all that when i graduated, it's all memories now. So try to enjoy your life this will be memorable. I'm sorry that's happening to you, but don't give up from college, try joining clubs you might know people with same passion and open up to them just keep trying.

I have a lot of online friends, but I still feel so lonely.  I don't have many friends in real life as I did virtual school so I never really got to mingle. Having online friends is good, but having friends you can hangout with just hits differently.  I just don't know how to tackle my loneliness, I'm just a mess.

I’ve been on Prozac (Fluoxetine) for about 3 years now and it was working pretty well, but I’m the last few months my mental health has been declining rapidly for no apparent cause. My doctor upped my prescription pretty drastically 4 weeks ago and I’m still getting worse every day. I know it’s possible for medication to stop working over time due to my body becoming used to it, but is it possible for it to swing the other way into the side effects of actually making you more depressed?  I’m talking to my doctor in a few days I’m just curious now and want to know if anyone has ever heard of this happening.   Thanks in advance for any help.

yup, i’ve gone through this: an increased dose making certain symptoms worse, or giving me more energy / capacity in a way that fuels the anxiety or depression. i do also think that (depending on the med) it can take more than 4 weeks to fully see its impact? (for better, or for worse.)  also: the last few months have just been pretty challenging at a macro level. everyone i know is seeing some form of decline in their mental, emotional, physical health.  good luck with finetuning your meds; i know how frustrating the process can be.

I'll take the honors if you don't mind. You are going to wake up feeling like a million bucks knowing you are too fresh and so clean clean to let that institution bring you down. You got this. School is just a light smudge on the story that is your bright life. Remind it that you are the boss. Hope that helps.
Find something about school that is fun and keep thinking about it  It will overtake in your mind the things that you hate  I do this all the time with many things  I changed my habitual thoughts to focus on what I like and make that the dominant feeling and things by itself improves  You have the power  Good luck!

I need to be on anti-depressants. I am obviously going to talk about this with my doctor, but what advice do you have for what has worked for you? I was on Celexa years ago (prescribed for anxiety, for some reason), but I don’t want to take that again. I would like to have some options in mind when I talk to my doctor, because the general medical advice where I live is, “go on a walk”.

I'm currently 16 years old and I have to decide on my future educational programme to follow after I finish secondary school this year. I have no clue what I should choose because I don't have any interests that align with a programme. I thought I wanted to do game art, but I haven't drawn anything since early november. And now that I finally began drawing something I absolutely hate it and I don't expect any school to even consider approving my application if I were to even send one in. I don't see any other options though, journalism requires me to make video's for example, which I absolutely despise because it makes me extremely uncomfortable (probably because of my autism). Spacial planning or architecture seemed interesting to me for like a month, but I was just hyperfixated on it and now I don't see myself doing anything in that sector.    I know I set my expectations for myself too high, but I doubt it's possible for me to lower them, I've always been a perfectionist and don't know how I would change that. And even what is/was my goal is impossible to achieve because it is way to specific and I could only dream of getting said specific job in the future.  I truly don't see myself even having a future, I can't even imagine what my life could be like 5 years from now, so why should I keep on living? Rotting away, being miserable and doing nothing all day aren't it for me, I'd rather have it all end, but I can't push myself to make it end.  How do I find the will to go on when there's no future in sight? And why should I even go on when all I would be doing is bother my parents by keeping living with them because I don't have the motivation to anything and when my life is meaningless anyways.  Sorry if this is the wrong flair and if this is dumb.

I'm sorry for your situation and pray that you are blessed with healing.  This post is not dumb, and I understand what you are feeling. I don't know if I can give you advice because I too have felt like it when young, and life happened... I am not a very independent ambitious person, but still had to live at least for myself, earn money for myself and not being a burden on others.  You might be feeling low, so just do things you love and relax. Don't hold too high standards for yourself (I did too) which is going to make your life harder and sadder while losing your confidence. Take care of yourself.  I'm going to continue this answer but will stop as I have work.

Hello! I am Zack! I myself am not depressed myself and am lucky enough to be very optimistic when it comes to most things but on the other hand my girlfriend is not as good at looking at the brighter side of things. We’ve been together for a little over a year but for the past 4-5 months she’s been severely depressed and I notice it getting worse and worse. She’s become very unmotivated, not folding clothes, cooking, doing dishes, or really anything besides the gym and work. I find that okay because I know she’s been going through things so I do as much as I possibly can. She lives with her parents still and they basically hate each others guts. They sleep in separate rooms, always argue and nag eachother. They don’t divorce because her mom has always been a stay at home mom so she wouldn’t be able to support herself (I believe). My girlfriend has heard the arguing all of her life and now she just shuts down whenever she hears them argue. It affects her daily agenda and she can’t seem to find a balance anymore. I just truthfully want to help. I suggested therapy, which she’s done twice months ago, but stopped going. Last night she was in bed crying while facing away from me and I told her I believe she should go back. She says she doesn’t like it and doesn’t know what to talk about. I told her most people don’t but it’s very necessary. How can I get my old girlfriend back? I still love her so very much but I miss when I could make her laugh all the time. We don’t really do much besides watch tv and sleep together nowadays because our work shifts are mostly opposite. Any suggestions would be very very appreciated! ❤️

My online friend severely suicidal, and I'm completely useless to help her.   My attempt to use advice from the depression/suicide talking tips sounds like a hotline script.   Any advice is insulting, I know "finding a hobby" is not going to make her magically want to live.   Telling her that I will miss her is just a selfish guilt trip.  I find that just listening and asking basic questions doesn't help because I know a depressing response will follow, and it comes off as cold/uncaring.  I have trouble countering the negative thoughts as she will often say, "nobody cares about me" and that's hard to hear as I care about her, but I do not want to invalidate her thoughts.  I once told her that I thought she was amazing, and she just responded that she knows herself better than I do and that she will never feel that way.   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  **What do you want to hear from a friend?** I am in an endless loop of telling her that I am here, and that I care.

Just having her talk about it is a massive help and trying to help her already makes her feel better. It's the simple things like when my friends send me good morning texts or memes it really makes me feel included and they never treat me as an outsider.
Hi there.  I would suggest that your friend find a peer support group!  Groups have done so, so much for me over the years.  They can search the websites of NAMI (national alliance on mental illness) or the DBSA (depression and bipolar support alliance) to find free virtual groups by location.  Having peer support can be really transformative, especially if one sticks with a group for a period of time.  Best wishes, -F.
Thank you, I mentioned trying a peer support group!  She went to one many years ago and felt ignored, but I think she should give it ago again. Do you have any ideas on how I could convince her, or should I let her come to the realization on her own?   For the online ones, can friendships still form easily in that setting? Do you have any insight?   I'm in college and with Zoom classes I found it hard to connect with peers, or feel comfortable sharing, thus I am nervous about recommending that to her.
Yeah, it's definitely easier to feel connected in person, but I'd keep trying until you find a group that feels good.  It definitely depends on the facilitator doing a good job, but finding a group that feels right can make a world of difference, in particular with feeling alone with ones symptoms.  Since they're virtual and free, I'd recommend that your friend try a few and see which group/facilitator she vibes with, and stick with that group for a bit!  As for friendships, again I think that's easier if they groups are in person, to have a chat afterwards or something, but I know that people in groups I do these days get used to seeing each other every week and have expressed that they have become integral parts of each other's support systems.  Also, in regard to sharing, you never need to share in a group.  If just listening is more comfortable for a while, that's totally fine!  I didn't really share in groups for a while until I felt comfortable.

For context I am studying abroad at an early age and I've already been an outcast in my old school and I could deal with it but now it hurts being the outcast, having immense pressure of getting a scholarship, having to deal with abuse its all to much I didn't want this i didn't want to be labeled a 'teacher pet' or 'a suck up'i have no friends other than one and I feel like I'm not good enough for her, that I'm a horrible friend and I'm trying to be a good friend, everyone in my class either hates me or ignores me and it hurts I don't want to feel invisible like I'm not there I hate it but I know I'm annoying, selfish, greedy and I'm trying to change I'm not trying to be like my abuser and I'm trying to make myself a better person and I know I need to see a therapist, that I ned to stand up to my abuser but I always feel so powerless because I'm just a child and what power do I hold that can fix this mess. I just want proper comfort for someone to relate to me or just tell me it will be alright I don't think can handle this pressure.

All I do is make people upset. I was told through my life that I was a good person but I guess they were wrong. I'm delusional and all I do is hurt people. I wish I could just work up the courage to die already but I'm too chicken of being caught. I fuck up everything why wouldn't I fuck up this? All I'm good at is being miserable and self sabotage

Please take a deep breath. Remember that depression is an illness, and that you are sick. As with any illness, others and yourself will get tired of it and it is not anyone's fault.   An amazing thing about humanity is the capacity to change.

I'm sorry to hear that you feel this way.  It sounds like you have already made some progress by acknowledging something may be off.  Is it as severe as you say it is?  If you really think it's that bad, do you think it's something that you can work on?
Imagine how sad your snugglebugs would feel if they couldn't snuggle with their favorite snuggler? Animals are good judges of character. If you cant believe you're a good person, believe that your pets KNOW you are. Hang in there my friend. It may not feel like it now, but life can and will get better.
I feel you on the self sabotage 😔 I do that to myself a lot too, especially in relationships because I have a tendency to push others away first in fear of future rejection
I'm feeling the same way right now. I always say or do things and mess everything up. I thought I was one of the lucky ones for having such great friends but that just makes it harder on me whenever I hurt them. It feels like I'm bothering them and I don't know why they are sticking around. I know this isn't really help but I just wanted you to know that you aren't alone in feeling this way.
JUST DOOOO IT!!!!! Make your dreams come true. I mean do things that are important to you. That will make you grow.
If the people currently around me are right then yeah, it's pretty bad. I was on medication but changed because I was suicidal. All that's happened is that I've become a worse person. I'm trying to call someone about it but I can't get anyone to answer
Please, i am here for you, if you need to talk or anything else please pm me, I've seen good people thinking they were bad people, and I've seen terrible and awful become very good people, But please don't let this destroy your life, I'm willing to help you no matter what, I don't care about what you did in the past, however I am here now to help you find a good path." We all want to help one another, human beings are like that, we want to live by each other happiness not by each other misery, We don't want to hate and despise one another"- Charlie Chaplin.

Motivation comes with the expectation of reward (which is already rewarding actually, it gives you a little dopamine hit in your nucleus accumbens).  If you don't have motivation, it means your reward system is "unbalanced". You don't have enought dopamine to reward yourself with the expectation of doing whatever you usually enjoy.  So what can you do, to get your reward system balanced again, and have enough dopamine, so when you think about doing something, you get motivated. It's really easy but stupid at the same time.  You have to force yourself to do things that YOU ENJOY. So when you do it, you will create the dopamine we are talking about. So the more you do, the more you will be motivated to do it, plus you will enjoy it more while you are doing it.  It can help also, to write down your goals and visualize getting it. Imagine what it feals like to have all what you want. Also watch motivation videos of people that already made it.  And about energy, do moderate physical exercise for 45 minutes and eat enought calories and healthy of course.  &#x200B;  That's some basic advice that I can think of right now.  Btw if what you feel is "Apathy", I recommend you to watch on youtube:  # How to Cure Apathy - Teal Swan  It helped me a lot. The best one was to get angry. Watch it, you'll understand later.
Hi there.  When I'm depressed, I try to think about things in terms of "I will have wanted to have done that" rather than trying to muster up desire in the moment.  Like, I might not want to get out of bed and take a shower right now, but I know I'll feel better this evening if I took a shower at some point today.  It shifts the thinking a little more toward how I'll feel later as a result of doing something right now that I still might not want to do.    I'd also recommend finding a peer support group.  Hearing from and sharing with peers has done so, so much for me over the years.   To find free virtual groups, you can search the websites of NAMI (national alliance on mental illness) or the DBSA (depression and bipolar support alliance) by location.    Best wishes, -F.

I have been facing depression over the past couple of years but it only accelerated last 6 months when I lost my job and moved back with my narcissistic parents.    Thanks to my **over protective and overly concerned parents**, I turned out to be an adult who cannot standup to himself, who turned out to be a weakling, lack basic social skills and more importantly does not have the faintest idea who he is, what makes him happy, or the very least what he wants to do with his life.  I have been living **suicidal over the past 2 months**, researching on methods I could deploy to end this no good life, having no point in living. But to be honest, I guess somewhere down there, there is something that tells me that not all doors have closed. I recently had  a quick convo with a therapist and with the intial analysis she put forward with my situation, she mentioned that the probable root caus,e that is prone for a quick fix is my lack of self awareness and self esteem. I felt that is true, because I sort of feel like **I do not have an identity**, like.. Having an opinion on something/anything, having the strength to stand up to myself, knowing what it is that makes me happy, be it a hobby or an interest.  I mean when I spend time with people, maybe friends, or colleagues. **They tend to know a lot about the world.** Some may be knowledgeble about basic things people should know, some maybe a youtube content provider or some other maybe a social point of source. I want to do something with my life as well like being good at something, but **all I do is consume data/information** (reddit,trivial information etc..) and not produce any (maybe writing a blog) because I can't understand what fancies me.  &#x200B;  I want to make my life better, but **I just don't know where to begin** and I feel like so Lost !

First of all, only the fact that you opened yourself with people you don't know (this subreddit) says that you are not a lost cause. I can feel your emotions because i've been there too, and maybe i am, but the fact is that you come to a point where you cannot take it anymore. All the hate, the offensive things, you cannot take them anymore. When you feel that thing, that kind of break point, you gotta stop, think about it, all that you've been throught, and take a breath. Start with going to live in a new house. Think with your own mind, start doing things indipendently, do not ask people what to do, think "maybe this thing is better if done in this way", and do it by yourself. Start off with little things, like with your house or your clothes, and do a lot of changes, do what you like the most. Do not accept works that are not healty for you. You'll notice that you've kinda built your own life, and *don't be pessimistic*. You don't need anybody but yourself. Remember that, you are beautiful and unique in your own way. Talking about the fact that you feel "ignorant", i can feel you, but you can't do anything but read and study. Read a lot of books, watch documentaries and it'll all feel better in a year or two. Let me know, i've been in a similar situation lately, and i hope you can recover from your depression. (Sorry for the bad english, but i'm a 17years old italian boy)  Love yourself, always.
This post was your first step in “creating.” You are already doing it. I recommend a digital fast for 48hrs, and in that time just start writing, to yourself, to a friend... let the ideas flow out of you on paper.
Thank you for those caring words and for what its worth, trust me, your english isn't all that bad :)  > Start with going to live in a new house.   This is part of my next plan. I'm desperately trying to look for at least a temp job so that I could move out of my house and loose the horrible chains I have with my family. Although it does scare me, probably because throughout my life I only had to follow what my parents told me, no more or no less. But I guess it could be a start.  > You don't need anybody but yourself.   Its ironical to say that I had lived a good chunk of my life like this, but it turned out to be a bit more extreme I guess. Let me say this.  I have been very skinny, underweight person from childhood and continuing still, possible eating disorders I suppose. So all through my life I have only heard people make fun of me, be it in school, college or at work. It only made me a person who was weak not only physically, but mentally too, not able to stand up for myself or to face a conversation conflict. To suppress them, I sort of started alienating people so that no opportunity would arise to make me feel bad.  An year ago, I got into a relationship with a girl, workplace romance. And although it is not going well (because I have been the jackass in not putting enough effort into it, or that is what she says), she was the one who made me understand the importance of making connections with people. I mean she is the exact opposite of what I am, extroverted, peoples person. And many a times when I see how many friends and people she got, it envys me and makes me depressed further. Its like when there is an event, our mutual colleagues may invite her, but not me. It was pretty evident, no one wanted my presence near them which made me conclude I have serious socializing issue.  > Read a lot of books, watch documentaries   To be honest, that is what I mostly do my friend. I mean I'm not an active member in any social media (insta, fb). Most of the time, I read forums or watch trivial videos on youtube. But that's it. All the information seems to be trivial and not something that coincides with what others talk about.  Personally I haven't been a fan of social media, because it has been the greatest source of depression for me when I see people having an active life and I don't. Abondoning this media, made me an outcast honestly. Because when people ask "Hey whats your insta?" and I'm like "umm.. Sorry I don't use one, perhaps you could email me? or call maybe?".  So people around me generally knows what is happening around, maybe a new cake shop in town, or someone they know got married. I am like a hermit these days lol !  I'm sorry if I'm venting out a lot. Just bottled up emotions I suppose !
So... Is it like some sort of journal ? Or diary entry kind?   Sorry I'm just curious when you mentioned Digital fast and how I could bring it into my betterment.
So I was focusing in on your sentence of consuming data but not creating. Take a 48window to consume NOTHING digital. A fast from screens. Grab paper and make it whatever you want. Journal, doodle, color. Create and not consume. At the end of the 48hrs, evaluate what you learned from the experience.
That sounds absolutely interesting!  Thanks for that idea. I'll give it a shot.  😊

My husband and I have been together for 6 years, married for 5 and overall have a wonderful relationship. He truly is my best friend. We have worked through numerous issues and he's done a lot of work on his mental health, but refuses to go to any type of treatment (we also can't afford anything). He quit his job about a month prior to the pandemic hitting and has been unemployed since. He tries to supplement income with doing food delivery, but even that has slowed down as time has progressed (through no fault of his own, he schedules and works, but orders are far and few between). He has always struggled with anger and depression and has narcissistic tendendacies, but recognizes that and tries to work through it. How can I currently support him? He recognizes that he's spiraling into his dark place but doesn't think anything can help. Lack of income contributes greatly.   At the start of the pandemic I helped him start a YouTube channel to give him something to focus on and have goals, but now that has just turned into more frustration and it's work as opposed to fun.   Is there anything I can do to help him? I feel like my positive attitude is just making things worse.   TL/DR My husband is spiraling into a dark place, how can I help him?

Hi there.  I would recommend finding a peer support group.  There are actually peer groups that would be appropriate for both you and your partner, i.e. groups for people struggling with their mental health as well as for family/friends of people struggling with their mental health.  Both NAMI (national alliance on mental illness) and the DBSA (depression and bipolar support alliance) offer both types of groups, which are free and virtual these days.  You can search their websites by location!  Best wishes, -F.
You mentioned your positive attitude, and your suggestions to help him, which all seem like they are coming from a good place. Has he been able to properly grieve this change in his life? Or been able to express his anger, which can be healthy. This all depends on his personality, but can you clear an evening to give him a long back rub, and just let him vent? Don't be positive or optimistic at this time. Just listen. Let him say anything he's feeling, and get it off his chest. Does he run or work out? If he's frustrated, physical activity might help him calm down to think things through.   This pandemic has been hard on so many people. I really hope it's under control soon, because the opportunities that'll bring will help so many people.
I was the other way around  The husband going through it  I couldn’t work. When I did I quit because I couldn’t handle it due to depression. It was tough. I found that if I did things that I enjoyed like watching something or doing something that was fun to me I didn’t understand it at fully then 6 yrs ago, but it helped me cut off and good things would happen. I’d focus on fun hobbies to help me take my mind off things for hours and to create some fun momentum. There may be short relapses but things will be better than now. An improvement and you could spend time with him doing those hobbies or watching things he likes. It means there would be something in the day that is fun  I also found that the more fun things I did things naturally would just improve  Like ideas would come  Maybe even some fun job opportunities could come  So key is finding a way to feel better  I hope this helps  You as a positive person already knew this anyway but I thought I’d share
This is me with my husband too. I’ve been in it for a long time and am currently in the thick of it as we speak. I second the suggestions for NAMI. Does he have any other support besides you who we could spend time with and get a mental break? I’ve found it to be important to be supportive without treating him like a child and bringing him stuff he didn’t ask for. Now I try to wait for him to ask for help.   Also want to turn it around and ask how you’re taking care of yourself. As a caregiver this is an extremely heavy burden to feel responsible for another human’s happiness and well-being/safety at times, especially when they don’t have the motivation and desire to want that for themselves. Please remember to hydrate yourself, ground yourself (google 5-4-3-2-1 calming technique), journal, feed yourself, etc. It gets very lonely, please feel free to DM me anytime.
First and foremost I want to celebrate you for wanting to support your husband through this. It speaks volumes to your character and your value of relationships which is rare in today's society.  You said something that struck a cord with me: "I feel like my positive attitude is just making things worse."  When I was depressed, hopeless, and spiraling to my dark places and people tried to help with positivity, I felt so guilty for not knowing how to or being able to get better, feel better, show up for everyone else. The thought of someone else having to feel pain because of me made me feel even more depressed. With me, too, they're wired to be providers, so if he's feeling "less than" because he believes he's not able to provide, that's going to add to the darkness.  I say that to hopefully shed some light on his perspective and to also help you understand it's not your fault!  What helped me, and what I believe with everything in me will help him as well, is if he were to know he matters and is acknowledged and accepted simply for who he is and not what he does (or doesn't do). If the spiral seems to have gotten worse since he's not had a job (aka felt like he can provide), maybe start by together creating a budget (if you haven't already) that works with what you're getting now (which is subject to change at any given moment!). Dave Ramsey is the master with helping people manage their money as opposed to being managed by their money. His Every Dollar app is free and is a game-changer for any financial situation.  Seeing things in writing or in print helps consolidate the overwhelm and calms the spiral long enough to offer even a glimmer of hope, which is what he needs now more than anything.  From there and once he can see life is manageable and he's able to contribute again, maybe he'll even be able to use this down time to allow himself to FINALLY work toward that dream he's been talking himself out of for so long. The "how will I" and the "what will people think" and the "what if" questions that have been keeping him "on mute" will still come. With a plan and starting from where he is with what he has to take one single step in the direction of his dream, though, like with the budget, those questions will be silenced by results and replaced with happiness.  Here's something I wrote when someone asked about how to accomplish big goals with small habits. I know it can help in this situation because it helped me immeasurably!  As a Ziglar Coach, we talk about the seven spokes of the Wheel of Life (mental, spiritual, physical, family, financial, personal, career) and creating Purpose Producing Activities (PPAs) in each spoke, aka small choices made over and over again until they become a habit.  For example, in the mental spoke of the Wheel, one small habit shift (PPA) could be reading a book about goal setting or sometime related to your goals, career, or personal development for one hour instead of watching the news for that hour. It’s measurable and repeatable…and simple!  For the spiritual spoke, find a character trait you’d like to develop, such as gratitude, and each morning and evening write down three things you’re grateful for and why. Do this before picking up your phone and getting sucked into the black hole of social media and see if makes a difference in your perspective and also notice how it builds on the mental spoke.  Do this with each spoke of the wheel for seven weeks in a row and you’ve developed seven new habits that will get you closer to your goals before you even realize it.  Mr. Ziglar said, “Hurricanes and tornadoes get all the publicity, but termites do more damage and they take such itty bitty bites.”  &#x200B;  I have no doubt you'll know exactly how to talk with your husband about these ideas and the reasons behind them. I'm praying for you both, and I trust that he'll hear the meaning behind your words regardless of how they come out. :)   In case no one's told you today: I'm really proud of you.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kpw1zx/a_helpful_guide_to_hospital_admission_in_crisis/
I am an ER Tech and i have worked in 2 hospitals with inpatient short term behavioral health wards. For a long time I've been wanting to write something up to help anyone reading who is in crisis and feels that they need to go to the ER to prevent hurting themselves.     1: First and foremost, good for you, its a scary thong to do but it can be the first step in getting well. Please if you are actively suicidal go to the hospital the staff want to help you     2: What ever you do, do not drink or get high beforehand. I know its tempting to get some liquid courage but no behavioral health assessor will speak to you unless you're 100% sober. You could spend as much as 16 hours in an ER room depending on where you live and whether your local hospital has mental health providers 24-7.      3: Be honest. The staff will not judge what ever you say, trust me they've heard it all. Its a hard job to shock an ER employee.      4. The most gaurenteed way to get an admission is if you have a specific plan and means to harm yourself. If you WANT to get admitted share this but if you DONT WANT to get admitted and just want to get hooked up with outpatient care dont share this bit.      5. Be prepared to have your blood drawn and to give a urine sample. This is standard practice as far as I know. The urine is for drugs and the blood is to detect imbalances that may medically explain your symptoms beyond mdd, bpd, or ocd.      6. Dont bring much with you, you will not be premitted to have your phone or laptop at least in the ER and probably not on the unit. Books are probably fine as long as they aren't to dark or weird. Hobbies are tricky because pencils and knitting needles are often used as weapons, anything with string is a no go because of hanging potential. This isn't to punish you, it's to protect you. I had to pull the cord on a patients phone once because it was clear the person on the other line was being hurtful to them. (they did thanked me) the outside world is not a theraputic place and we limit it as much as possible for people in mental health crisis     7. Just because you sign a voluntary admission form does not mean you can change your mind. If you tell the staff you changed your mind they will just change the paperwork to involuntary, it takes like 2 seconds. Telling a nurse you are suicidal is like getting on a rollercoaster. Once you're on, you have no choice but ride to the end.      8. Settle in. If you live in a small town or a state with poor funding for mental health you may have to wait a long time before someone can speak to you. Like hours. Being sober speeds up the process but wheels can move slowly. Relax maybe bring a book (if you're chill and nice they will probably let you have that)   I cannot stress this enough, if you feel like you're at the end of your rope and like you may harm yourself please please seek help. I'm sorry this only applies to the US bc thats where i have experience.

Thank you so much for posting this!!
about number seven.     whats going to happen if somebody tries to leave? like seriously, im free to go wherever i want as long as im not breaking the law.
I've been considering writing this up for a long time. I've never been admitted myself, mostly because i wouldnt be able to avoid being admitted at my own job. but i've gotten very close in the past. If i had read something like this a decade ago i probably would be in a better place today
I tried that and got handcuffed to the bed. When I wouldn't stop trying to get away I had a cop hold me down as they sedated me. 🤷‍♀️
There are laws in the US that make the hospital responsible if you are suicidal, they are legally obligated to detain you until you are considered stable. As soon as you go in a staff member will be assigned to watch you, you could not leave and if you get too aggressive in trying to leave they may place you in locked restraints.
thats fucked up.
That's not fucked up, it's medical care. Trust me you don't want someone close to you killing themselves or get killed in an accident because they let them walk free. Someone i know went through a psychosis, wanted to leave and was restrained and I'm damn glad they did.  Edit: I want to clarify that that person who had a psychosis hadn't slept for days and had no idea what was real anymore and thought they were being pursued by nazis. If he had just walked around like that, he could have gotten in big trouble. He told me he doesn't even remember all of his stay and while it was scary, he understands why the staff acted the way they did. He is in treatment now and I am forever thankful that there was a place that could provide safety and make him finally sleep.
This is a biiiig reason I avoided and continue (to a lesser degree) to avoid seeking mental health care. I will not put myself into a situation where I can be held captive like an animal until someone else decides I can leave.   As someone who gets depressed from feeling powerless to change things, the threat of not being able to leave is utterly horrifying
I'm saying from a personal perspective,  being held against my will is a sentance worse than death.
The hospital is obligated to take you seriously if you state that you are a danger to yourself, personally the last time i was trying to get help while in crisis when asked if i was suicidal i would state simply "I'm safe"
We're talking about something very specific here, not, mental health care in general. If you go to an emergency room, say you're suicidal, mention a plan, sign a consent form and then change your mind and act in a way that the staff thinks is unstable, you should expect that they will make sure you don't kill yourself. You will not be restrained or forced to do anything if you talk to your general doctor about depression or if you start therapy or if you make an appointment with a psychiatrist.
Honestly, I didn't want to scare you with that comment. I really encourage you to reach out as I have done that recently for depression and it has helped tremendously. The situation you fear only happens in extreme cases, not the majority of people with depression.
Yes of course no one wants to be held against their will. But what are the hospital staff supposed to say to the family of the patient if they decide to commit suicide as soon as they leave the hospital, when it was clear they were experiencing a mental health crisis? You can't revive a dead person. You can always recover mentally from having been held in a hospital for a couple of hours, especially if it with your best interest in mind.
I posite that having the information that, once in, you cannot leave unless you are safe and stable, you are not in fact being held against your will. You chose to be there. You asked for help. They are giving you help. They are protecting you from yourself.

I've hit a very rough patch these last 4 months and fallen into a deep depression. One of the reasons to why is because my friends have distanced themselves from me because I've been sad, negative, anxious, and are overthinking about a lot. I'm very sensitive,  so when I see my three friends being more together and more close then with me I always fall deep into myself and can't get out of the sadness.   An example of this is that we do art and sit in a square shape. My friend who sits the closest to me walks to pee and when she comes back checks on our two other friends and then ignores me. (I went to the bathroom and cried like 3 times and they never checked up on me.)  Another example is one of my friends is always filming Snapchat videos and for some reasons always ignore me or skips over me with the camera.   Idk if I'm just being hypersensitive to everything but I know that the hurt I feel is nothing they should just gloss over.

I'm sorry you're feeling rejected or neglected by your friends. That's a terrible feeling that we never seem to grow out of. It follows us through life, popping up occasionally, and it always stings.   I have some advice, and I know it won't be easy to take, but please hear me out. These are hard truths that I realize will not make your situation less painful.  Your happiness is not dependant on anyone else. Your friends might very well be insensitive or oblivious, but you can't let them dictate your happiness.   If they distance themselves when you need support the most, or they make you feel unwanted, it's ok to take a step back and expand your friendship circle. Maybe these girls will become fun casual friends you see once a month. Maybe less. You don't need to surround yourself with people who lead you making posts like this. There are other fish in the sea.

I have major depressive disorder and am in a low mood most of the time, but I do have some days where I feel kind of ok and sometimes even positive. But whenever I'm feeling this way I don't really trust the positive feelings or I'm anxious about how long it will last. Does anyone else have this, if yes how do you deal with it? How can I just enjoy having a good day?

YUP! Every time I feel “good”, it’s ruined by waiting for the mania to start. I’m bipolar.
I am the exact same way. I think it’s part of the depression thinking the worst case scenario. It’s a symptom just like a runny nose.   Good work keeping on. It’s so hard to live like this. Pat yourself on the back. Know you aren’t alone.
Yeah I can relate to this and I would imagine that many other people can. However, I'm in my early forties now so I've been doing this depression thing for a while and I'm far more chilled with it nowadays.  My good days outweigh my bad days and I would class myself as mostly happy. But of course I still have bad days and I do wonder if I will experience another serious bout of depression any time soon. However, it's just that . . I wonder. I dont stress or worry about it anymore and I lean right into the joy.   Thats been a big lesson over the years . . . leaning into the joy and accepting that what will be, will be. I don't mean don't try or strive, but do your best and accept that things will turn out however they do.   Once I got the hang of that, the worry gradually got less and I started to become much more happy.
Yeah but it is the negetive feelings you shouldnt trust. They are usually the ones that are distorted.
I used to have this very extremely, any time I felt happy I was just fearing the moment I'd feel bad again. What sucks most about it is that it makes it worse - the anxiety makes the good moments last less long, which confirms the perception that good moments are temporary, which makes the anxiety worse the next time around. But you've probably realised that already.  For me it's mostly passed with time and as I learned to deal with depression better in general. I think I will always have my moments, but mostly I feel okay nowadays. One thing that does help (both when I feel anxious about being happy and when I feel depressed) is focussing very consciously on the small good things. When I'm doing bad it might be "I got out of bed today and that's a good thing". But in good moments it can be things like "I'm smiling" and "I like [thing you're doing]". Make it about these tiny things that are happening instead of the overall feeling - you don't have to be anxious about a smile or laughing or enjoying a hobby. At first this'll be very difficult and cost a lot of energy, but after a while it'll feel more natural and that's when you'll notice it making a difference. At least, that's how it was for me!
I try to tell myself, yes I'll probably feel bad tomorrow, but right now I feel good and I'm going to enjoy it while I can.
I did when I was recovering, yes.
I have MDD too, treatment resistant, and have been in a bad way for about two years. About a week ago though, I started waking up each day feeling  less dread, more motivated and just happier in general. I’m trying to enjoy it, and I work hard on my thoughts while do my best to live in the present, but I’m terrified the darkness will return.   I also get scared when I feel good, because feeling happy is not a feeling I’m familiar with. I feel like I’ve been so down for so long, don’t know any different at this point. It’s almost like I’m comfortable in my depression because it’s all I know. Even when I’m feeling ok, the depressive thoughts are always there, it’s been my constant companion for 30 years.   I hope you continue to feel well.
I don't trust any of my feelings. I'm always doubtful about how I feel. I'm on meds and I'm not always sure if I'm actually happy or if my meds are doing it for me.
yeah i get you. it’s this feeling of “i’m feeling ok today, what’s going to happen?” “something must be coming back to bite me if i’m feeling ok” just try to convince yourself that you deserve this break, that’s what i try to do.
Yes most likely almost everyday I feel very sad,I deal with it by wandering around in my mind,until It eventually wears off,but I’d like to recommend you some dark chocolate and water,so that you’d stay fresh from it.
Totally relate. It gets so bad that I feel like if I accept the feelings and let in a little happiness, that I am going to jinx myself and something bad will happen to even it out. Negative thoughts are tough.
Yea It is completely natural to feel.so... I just challenge my.own emotions and tell myself "ok let's see how long this lasts, have nothing to lose when I enjoy cz I was feeling down anyway" so feel happy for as long as possible and when things go south you'll have the new happy times to look forward to
I get imposter syndrome.. not really the same but I can empathize.
I know exactly what you mean, from experience.  I don't exactly deal with it, I just accept it. Whenever I am in my lowest mood I just try to analyze my situation and think if it's indeed that bad or it's just in my head. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't, but it's a good exercise nonetheless.  When I have something good in my life I just mentally prepare myself that it's not forever and that sooner or later I will have to deal with the opposite. Sorry if it's not much help.  I would go to professional if I could, but for me for now it's not an option. If you can, I recommend trying something. If you're like me, can't really do anything about it at the moment, then I'd suggest trying to do something, that usually brings you comfort at least.
Yes! It’s like my brain is made of memory foam and depression is a dumbbell on it. Sometimes the dumbbell is lifted, but the foam can’t automatically just “pop up” again. But then the weight returns too fast and the indent remains. :/  Reading Man’s Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl helped me a bit with this. It sucks tho.
Life is all about faith ,man ! Problems and things trying to make you sad will aways come its on you how you make your problems cry and laugh on your problem , and chill and smile ! Life is simple ,just keep a smile and be thougher than yesterday !
Thank you for your reply!
Thank you for your reply!
Thank you for the reply. How do you feel thankful for the small achievements? I try to practice Gratitude, but on days where I didn't do anything really, I find it very hard to be thankful for getting out of bed, or taking a shower. I kind of think that these things should be self-evident and easy for me, although often they aren't.
Thank you for the reply. I hope you continue to feel better too.
That must be really hard. I feel like there is this weird stigma around antidepressants, that you're not really yourself anymore when you take them. But for me personally I don't think that my depression is really who I'm supposed to be when healthy, and I'd rather have a pill that helps me be in a better mood.   Hope it gets better for you. Thank you for the reply!
Thank you for your reply. This describes how I feel very well.
Thank you for the reply. I tend to try and do the same, but it's really hard to think clear when I'm in depression, makes me feel like I can't trust my thoughts either way.
I like that Metaphor, it describes how I feel pretty good. Thank you for the Reply! Hope it gets better for you.
When I started I didn't feel it at all, it was very much an 'actions first feeling it will come" type of thing. I usually said it out loud or wrote it down, and feel absolutely ridiculous and stupid for it, but eventually that changed. I'd get up and say "I'm proud of myself for getting out of bed" even though I definitely wasn't proud. But when I started dwelling on that (that it should be easy) I'd try to cut myself off. Again by saying something out loud, or by listening to music, stuff like that. Actually feeling it was true came much later, once thinking it was natural.
The support from my husband and my family helps tremendously. I'm still recovering from years of trauma and I'm just working on building up trust, in myself and others. Not just anyone of course, but my doctor's, family, etc. It's a lot better than it was five years ago!
I'm suffering from depression too and I know it's hard. but you don't have to think clearly, just try to think and gradually your thoughts will come back to you

I really don't. I've looked up stuff like "how to get my life together" and all the advice was very unhelpful. I know what I want and where I wanna be, I just don't know how to actually get there or anything. I mean, I'd do it myself but it's kinda hard, not to mention I'd like help with something for a change.   My parents barely helped with anything before, and their eagerness to do so now is sort of annoying. I dont know what else to do really. I'm just lost, but I dont know how to get back on track. Not a lot of direction in my life, and I dont know how to give it to myself.  At the same time, I want help, but I also realize how stupid wanting help is. For a lot of things, I need help, but I can do a lot of things myself. I guess it's just feelings. I have some shit sorted out though, so that's neat.  Any advice someone is willing to offer?

Hi friend- getting your life together is a broad topic. Is there a focus you would like to tackle for the next 90 days?
Getting rid of missing school assignments would be great. I consider school almost my entire life since it technically is. I don't have 90 days to do that, and I want good grades by the end of the first semester. School is my main focus, and that isn't going to change for a while.   Other than that, I'm still trying to figure it out. I've got some of it, but it's jumbled word vomit rn.
Talk to your teachers/lecturer face to face and discuss how you are going to tackle this issue together. I never liked reaching out to lecturers for the fear of being annoying but they were always super eager to help and really supported me and guided me into passing.
I'll reach out to my teachers so I can get some help with classwork and stuff. Thanks
Yes, that’s a great starting point. Come up with a plan together so you know you aren’t alone in accomplishing your goals. I think this is a perfect goal to tackle. It will provide you with a sense of accomplishment and ownership of the results.

I’m just so upset right now. I would never hurt myself or anything, but I’m overwhelmed right now. I’m only a junior in high school, and I love running. I run Track and Cross Country for my school. I use running to cope with my stress, and it works well for me. My only problem is that I frequently get injured. My freshman year, I missed a large portion of my season and I was severely depressed. Luckily I was able to run my sophomore year, and it was the best time of my life. I ran great times and made so many great friends. My track season was supposed to start for me today, but literally last week I got diagnosed with a stress fracture from an MRI. I feel hopeless, and the fact that there is nothing in my power that I can do to fix this is driving me crazy. I’m just so upset right now, and I feel like I’m letting my coach and teammates down. I’m constantly thinking about how I’m missing track, and ever since I got diagnosed with this injury I have this sick feeling in my stomach I can’t get rid off. I’m feeling depressed again, just like how I was in 9th grade when I missed track. I don’t know what to do.

I've been in your situation multiple times before where my semester marks were so bad and I got this overwhelming surge of anxiety realizing how bad I messed up. Consult your teacher as this will help them focus on you and they can guide you as they know what will be required from you. I was always too shy to ask but they really have been angels and so vital in me passing classes it's also good to build a relationship with these people.
Hey there, school can be really tough. There's more than one way to respond to what you're going through, and I'll just give you my suggestion. One, is how you are handling the stress of school.  And two, is how you can do better in school, to minimize future stress.   First, the stress can be really hard because obviously school is really important. Please remember that you can always find a way to the career that you want, even if you fail. You can always try again, try at another school, or try something else. Life is so much bigger than just this. I hope taking a step back and seeing the big picture of your life will help.    Second, there are a lot of tips out there to simply help you succeed, if that is what you're looking for.  If there is a tutoring center in your school or area, they can help you build good studying habits.  It could be that you can improve your time management and minimize distractions so that you study productively.  Or it could be that you could use flash cards, notes, talk through questions with the teacher, and many other things to understand the material.    I hope that helps.  I know I don't understand your situation completely, so what I've described may just be a starting point.  Either way I think it's a great achievement that you are seeking help and that you realize there's a problem that could use fixing.  That is a baby step but a big baby step. Don't lose hope.  You can do this!

My point of no return was when my mind kept coming up with different ways for me to end my life. I couldn't stop it nor meditate out of it. I was beginning to give in so I called 911 and told the operator that the police better not try to rough me up.   They were exceptional and the ambulance drivers were professional. Spent five days in a hospital and my meds were changed as well as my psychiatrist and psychologist.  I've improved on an upward curve for over the last three years.
I too am looking for help regarding these issues. I don't understand how to navigate the discord server...left me further discouraged.  I'm sorry you're feeling so empty, too.
Just remember, it's ok to not be ok. There's nothing wrong with coping.   We all have to cope if we want to live.
Sorry for the late reply but due to embarrassment of my parents knowing I have big problems I don’t have the courage to call for help sometimes, my parents are Hispanic so they didn’t even believe mental illnesses is even that big of a deal
I'm sorry to hear that. Having family or close friends not believe that this is real and painful is horrible. I was married when I first started having problems. It was getting in the way of her life and would tell me to just snap out of it. That only made it worse.  Be strong. I wish you all the best. You will get past this. You have shown the resolve needed by asking for help here on Reddit. Take care of yourself!!!

They have often trialed the TCA antidepressants, the newer SSRI and SNRI antidepressants, and even electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)- all without any success. **Therefore, Nardil is the ONLY drug that works for them, and without it, they would not be able to function or, sadly, would take their own lives.**  As a result of this global shortage, thousands of people, who have either had to cease Nardil or substantially reduce their dose, are now suffering greatly. They have relapsed into depression and anxiety, and have often become suicidal.  **If action is not taken to remedy the shortage of Nardil, it is inevitable that many lives will be lost by suicide.** The Nardil shortage situation is becoming progressively worse. Many lives are hanging by a thread.   Thank you for reading

I am 20f and have been struggling with depression and PTSD since I was 13 or 14 years old. Recently I developed a severe alcohol problem that I am trying really hard to beat. Without the  old expectations of school, I find myself really unmotivated. I don't get out of bed until hours after I wake up and I have trouble finding a routine during the day. I live with my bf(23) and he is very supportive but he works a lot. On the days that he is home, we do all kinds of things together and I will even wake up early to clean or make breakfast. But when I'm alone, all that goes out the window and I don't even have the motivation to feed myself, brush my teeth, or much of anything. All I do is scroll through social media and look at everyone doing productive things with their lives.   How do I get past this? How do I get up in the morning and do something with my life every day?

Isolation? That’s going to get better with the end of covid, right? Not for me. I only see people at school anyways. haven’t hung out with anyone irl since late 2018, and I have no fucking clue how to start. People think I’m a good dude and all, and I have friends, but it never really goes anywhere. I don’t know what people even fucking do, and I never think I’m at that point in a friendship where I can ask people to hang or go do something, and I just turned 16 and I don’t even have a fucking permit, no job either. Yeah, I’m also one of those retards who think everyone secretly hates him and only puts up with his bullshit to not seem like an asshole. Same with asking people out: I can’t do it anymore because a: I’ve been fucked with emotionally so much that in my mind it’s just not worth trying, and b: self-hatred. So it’s always just me. Extroverted by nature, introverted by circumstance.  I have no motivation to do anything at this point. I’m one of the burned out “gifted” kids who doesn’t give a flying fuck anymore. I just sit at the back of the class with 1 earbud in, listening to everything but the teacher. Some lessons and classes genuinely interest me, but some are a literal nightmare without background shit. Grades drop because of it, and my relationship with family gets so much worse. And they’re the only ones I see on a daily basis outside of school. Can’t stand being with them, shut myself in my room, alone with my own head, mental state worse, wash rinse and fucking repeat.  What’s going to be the real difference in my life anyways? I’m just going to school, going home, doing homework, playing counter-strike, jacking off, practicing saxophone, showering, etc. for the entire day. Same shit every day, either way. Only difference is I wake up 2 hours later and stay in my pajamas for the entirety of it. I DO NOTHING FOR MYSELF OR SOCIETY WITH OR WITHOUT CORONAVIRUS.   The final problem is my own head. I am never enough for myself. In some people, this’d push them to work harder, and make themselves better people. For people like me, it just sends me even fucking deeper. I’ve tried to ignore it in terms of my work, but then it has the side effect of a complete lack of anything getting done. I’m always too fat (even though I’ve actually *lost* some weight during quarantine), I’m always too ugly (even though I’ve started finally wrangling my acne in), too much of a stranger (even when I’ve known them for 10 years and been friends for 3), just genuinely irrational thoughts, and when I think them I send myself deeper by getting mad at myself for thinking them.  So what the hell do I do? I know my mental state is going to be somewhat better when I go back and spring comes (SED), but the problems are still there. I feel like a piece of shit even posting this, because my problems are fucking ridiculous compared to some of the stuff on here. Even though I have diagnosed fucking depression, I still sometimes feel like I’m just faking it for attention because I haven’t ever cut myself or genuinely felt suicidal. I have these moments when I feel happy, but then look back and completely invalidate them in my mind, but then I still feel guilty about being able to both feel “happy” and have depression. Idk how to end this, so...  If you read all the way through this, thanks. I don’t know what I want from this, just maybe a word of support, or a way out, but all comments are massively appreciated. Love you all.

I don‘t think that you can be “not depressed enough“ for this sort of post. Your problems are real and it takes a lot of courage for you to talk about them. Just because you didn‘t self-harm yet doesn‘t mean that you fake your depression for attention. Talking about your problems in a place where people can genuinely offer support just proves that. And that you‘re willing to fight those problems.  Even though I don‘t have the perfect solution to all of your problems, I know how you feel. For years I was the outsider in school with no friends or anyone I could talk to. I also thought that my family hated me. And I too saw my grades drop without anything to do against it. But my family and some people from school who I didn‘t consider friends at all helped me to get me out of depression. And I learned one important lesson: it‘s never too late to restart your life. Just because you consider yourself “one of the burned out gifted kids“ doesn‘t mean that you have to stay that way. When I was in 2nd grade the teacher offered my parents that I should skip the 3rd grade. And when I was depressed I too thought that I‘ll never be smart enough to accomplish anything in my life. And even though even now I don‘t know what I want to do after finishing school, and even though I struggle a lot with the ”simple“ task of studying, my grades improved over the years. You don‘t have to be fully absorbed in every single lesson but if you start to care about it, I‘m sure you‘ll find some fun in them.  The same is true for your free time: you don‘t have to invest your every moment to try to help others. When I look at my brother who has a stable job, my father who was a fireman for 30 years (and still is) and my mother who works all the time, either in her job or around the house, and then I look back at me with my latest accomplishment being dropping out of the local sports club half a year ago, I shouldn‘t feel good either. But what I realized is that your family doesn‘t expect you to do nothing but work. Of course that doesn‘t mean that you should be lazy all day, but it means that you shouldn‘t feel bad for every moment you try to relax.   All these problems, as you said yourself, originate from yourself. But that actually means that you can fight them. Not even alone.Your family and the people around you will be happy to reconcile with you even though at the moment you don‘t think they will. Depression will always say that you‘re too fat, too ugly, too lazy, but you should know that depression just causes you to be unable to truly see yourself. Just remember that there‘s not just black and white. You don‘t have to be perfect to not be a failure. Mistakes are accepted. Even though people can initially lash out on you this doesn‘t mean that they hold a grudge against you. In my opinion the key to battling depression is to reconcile. With yourself and with others.  Of course I don‘t know who you are. I don‘t know the details of your problems. But I try to help you, just because you need it. If you want to talk to me, feel free to contact me. Just remember that I too am imperfect. Everyone is. But that doesn‘t mean that you have to feel bad about it.

“A bird in the cage in spring knows quite well that there is something he would be good at, he feels strongly that there is something to be done, but he can't do it. What is it? He can't quite remember, then he gets some vague ideas, and says to himself, "The others are building their nests and producing their young, and raising their brood." Then he bangs his head against the bars of his cage. And the cage is still there, and the bird is mad with grief. "There's a lazybones," says another bird who is passing. "He's comfortably off." However, the prisoner lives and does not die, nothing shows on the outside of what is going on inside him. He is in good health, he is more or less cheerful while the sun shines. Then the migration season comes and a bout of melacholy. "But," say the children who look after him in his cage, "he has everything he needs." Yet for him it means looking out at the swollen, stormy skies and feeling the revolt against his fate within himself. "I am in a cage, I am in a cage, and so I lack nothing, fools! I have everything I need! Oh, for pity's sake, give me freedom, to be a bird like other birds." That idle fellow is like that idle bird.” -Vincent Van Gogh

My dog Olive really kept me from losing my sanity this year and quite frankly she saved my life. I have lost everything that mattred to me in 2020 and have isolated myself from everyone who loves me. She has given me hope when all seemed lost and was always a shoulder for me to cry on.  She is such an amazing loyal companion, I will never forget what she has done for me this year.  I'm trying my best to keep going after a year full of loss, grief, misery, and despair.  I have to keep going for my son Kai but the will to and internal struggle is becoming more and more difficult.  Trying to see the good in each day and trying my best to turn a new corner this year. Here's to a more positive and more fulfilling 2021.    - Anthony

Hey guys, I want to tell my story  In seventh grade my depression started, it wasn't very bad but I was declining slowly. That's when I met my first boyfriend and he left me twice for another girl. Now I know that it was just seventh grade and blah blah but that hurt a lot. I was also very insecure about my body and bad acne.  Eigth grade is when It got really bad. I was so depressed, everyday it felt like I was floating through school, through life. I wasn't there. I WAS WATCHING MYSELF FROM A FAR. The only thing that brought me down to the ground and back to my body were guys. I would use relationships as flotation devices but unfortunately that couldn't last forever.   I was underwater, air escaping my lungs, another air bubble drifting up to the surface everyday. Trying to swim up but being frozen, eventually I didn't even want to try to swim. The guys, they were a boat in the waters of depression. Finally, after a really bad break up, I decided that I needed to swim. I had to push myself to the surface as fast as possible. And I did just that. It was a long road but I made it! I gave it my all and made it to the top. Of course everyday for the rest of my life im going to be swimming, keeping my head above the water. I can't say that I'll find an island and  never swim again because that's just not how this whole depression thing works.   Current day. I'm swimming, my head above the surface, but my arms are getting tired and I'm afraid that I'm going to start drowning again. My progress will be lost and I'll have to start all over again. I have severe acne and while I'm not fat I feel like I'm 6,000 lbs but I have no right to be upset about feeling that way because I don't do anything about it. I need help. I can't sink under the water again.  Thankyou for reading this. I'm sorry that it's so long and probably poorly written but I needed to put my feelings into words. Thankyou guys so much for just being here.

I am here and I am listening. You are not alone.  I first got depressed in high school. I'm now 61 and have had really bad (major depressions) with bad situations i.e after my heart surgery. The fact that you're holding on is good.  If the acne is a big issue, try a dermatologist or accutane.     Things that have helped my depression stay away are: Get up in the morning and get light, either outside or light box.  Exercise, even just take a walk, in the morning.  CBT, which is cognitive behavioral therapy.  It's 3-4 months and they show you how your negative thoughts might not be accurate and have you focus on not seeing everything in a frightening way.  I have taken meds for small periods of time and they help if you have a bad event and you feel really depressed.    Also if you have bad acne and weight issues you might have metabolic problem (I do) and you can check with an endocrinologist.  You can do this.  You are not alone.  If I could, I'd give you a hug and tell you things will be ok.
Thankyou! This is so helpful. Also I'm like 5ft and 115lbs.

I'm 19 male, and I've had depression since I was 13, and its never really gotten better.  I have no energy to do anything, even the things I really want to do. I just find that I don't have the energy or motivation to do my favorite things.  And then there's the latter.   I just can't wrap my head around the fact that I will grow old, and then die. How are people so okay with this? Why so I have to die? Will I have kids? Will I be able to do the things I want?   Its just all so much. I just find myself always in tears when I think about it. I just don't know what to do anymore.  Some advice is needed.

This is probably going to be very long, and very brutally honest about how fucking weird I am. So thanks if you read it and bear with me.   I have struggled with major depression and social anxiety since I was a young teenager. Somehow, I always made it through. I'd have times where I was doing better or worse. I made a sort of 'fake' suicide attempt as a 16-year-old. Basically, I just took like 6 Asprin, so looking back I don't really classify it as one. I cut superficially a bit, but nothing really consistent or scarring. 16 was also when I started drinking. And pretty much since then, I've struggled with substance abuse as well. I was/(still am) extremely shy. Most of my relationships have been formed online, as it's easier for me to not feel as anxious that way. This has probably allowed me to stay quite awkward/weird in regular social situations. Anyway, other shit happened throughout then until now, but I'll mostly focus on my recent years and months.  I am 31 now. I have been in therapy throughout this time. I've tried meds on and off. Again, I've had some great months interspersed, but ever since this 'disaster' (my brain still tells me it is even though I understand CBT could help me to come out of that perspective) I've just been unable to bounce back. See, when I had this long-term therapist about 4 years ago, she helped me with values-based stuff (ACT therapy). We identified my values, my passions, and from there did some work on what I really wanted to do with my life. At that time, I was still working in behavioral and mental health (I got my B.A. in Psychology, lol). I had decided I didn't want that career anymore, and it was partly due to overwhelming anxiety with being in such a socially demanding role. It was destroying me, for multiple reasons but I won't go into all of them. My passion has been history for a long time. I received my minor in it and it fascinates me (well, maybe the passion has died down since this 'disaster'). So, in therapy I came up with an idea to do what people say to do; follow what you love. I knew my interest was in Medieval history of the British Isles. I chose to go to Ireland. I up-ended my already not so stable life. I sold my car, I saved money (probably not enough). I enrolled in University there.  Some perspectives could say that's cool and brave. I initially thought so. But I still dealt with my mental health issues. I became very shy and nervous while I was there. I only really made one friend and had a boyfriend from UK who I had met online. My drinking was still an issue on and off. I was a recluse and my dorm-mates probably thought I was very strange and stuff. I did try to get jobs. I thought I'd be able to find something in mental health over there with my experience. But nothing really panned out. I found a job cleaning for a dentist's office once a week. Clearly, that was not enough. Then, I found something a bit more promising; helping with retail inventory stuff. That was a huge letdown, because it was sort of something where you pick up shifts every week. I kept trying to do this through the website, but it wasn't working. I emailed so many times about it, with no response. When I finally got a shift, it was too late anyway. The semester had started in September and was ending in June, which is when my dorm stay ended as well. I hadn't found suitable work, so it was time to cut my losses and ask my family for help with a plane ticket. My UK boyfriend had also broken up with me in March, which sent me into a horrendous, lonely depression. It was a miracle that I got decent grades. I had to ask my professors for extensions and stuff, it was quite embarrassing.   Other than the stop-over in Portugal, my trip home was agonizing. My UK ex was now messaging me about how he's suicidal and I thought I'd have to try to get him help while I was staying at this Airbnb with very inhospitable hosts. All while this crushing weight of what I had failed to do was all around me. I literally had to force myself to take each next step forward to make it home. I was devastated, utterly.  I had lived with my father before my move to Ireland, so I went back to stay with him to figure things out. However, nothing really was getting figured out. This was in June 2019, by the way. So it's been a year and a half. My self-confidence was and still is, completely shot to pieces. I can hardly find one decent thing about myself anymore. I just exist. I think I'm too scared to become truly suicidal, but it's certainly an avenue that is in the back of my head.  The first job I got when I returned was a remote Customer Service position doing tech support for Apple. It seemed like it'd be ok, but once again the anxiety of working with people and having to be so fast, trying to troubleshoot for two people at once, and then the micromanagement, feeling like I had to do everything perfectly really got to me. When the holidays hit that year, they upped the number of customers to 3 at a time and I couldn't take it. Left that job and worked some odd temp jobs. Then worked for Instacart for several months, but my social anxiety and depression fucked that up too. I was late to work too much because I'm a dumbass who can't fix that as hard as I try, it seems. Which then made me extremely anxious to be around managers and stuff. I know, this all sounds ridiculous. But I assure you, I would rather have the discipline and strength to work a job just like everyone else has to. So I left instacart and started doing a terrible food delivery job called Postmates. Keep in mind, I'm now using my dad's old Subaru from 1996 which has like 250k miles on it, so that's not sustainable. Obviously, at this point, I'm not able to pay rent at my dad's, so I feel incredibly terrible about this. And just adds to my shame and humiliation.  I don't want to go back to mental health jobs, because I feel that I am EXTREMELY anxious and therefore come across as super strange to most people. I feel that I don't provide clients the help they deserve because of my anxiety.  After a while of being unemployed with very little means of making money, I file for unemployment. I also got back on food stamps (had been on them when I first got back to the US, too). It has helped, but obviously, that won't be forever.  The only thoughts for a way forward are:   * maybe go back to school to once more try to be an Archivist (that was my dream before the 'disaster', but the wind has been knocked out of my sails with regards to that and I don't know if I'll have the discipline to succeed, plus there's the idea of adding to my school debt) * Get a job where I can manage anxiety somehow and that could lead to something I'm good at. Preferably something that isn't super interactive with people. * Bite the bullet and go back into Mental Health. Stop being a pussy and be strong, everyone has to do shit they don't like.  During Thanksgiving, I went to my step-dad's house. I got very, very drunk and started sobbing to my sister about how I feel. I don't remember everything I said, but I think it was worrying for everyone. Clearly, my family knows all is not well with me, but they don't really know what to do. I am very much a recluse and isolate even more when I'm ashamed. I also don't get along amazingly with all of them. I feel different from most of them other than my bio-father, who is similarly avoidant and reclusive, so he doesn't approach me about how I've been acting/struggling either.  Anyway, after that breakdown, my brother-in-law invited me to come surprise my sister for her birthday on November 28th (they live in a different state). I still don't know if this was prompted by what happened on Thanksgiving (don't quite remember the timeline of events), but it could have been. On my second night there, he invited me to live with them for a month to help me get back on track. I could stay rent-free and not have to pay for food. In this month, we would all work on ourselves, eat healthy, stay substance-free, create routines, and support each other. Honestly, it sounded like something I really needed. I will preface by saying I did accept, and I'll get into that. Just wanted to back-track for a second.  Now, before this offer I had been going along with my very unhealthy habits and inabilities to move forward (though I had just gotten offered an Amazon delivery job). Drinking too much, spending too much time sedentary, and just all around very depressed and anxious all the time. However, I had also recently met this group of friends from an online game. We all got along really well from the first time meeting. I'm going to be honest, it felt VERY good to start having this friend-group and to feel well-liked. I had a couple of other friends, like an old irl BFF, but they hadn't felt very fulfilling for a while for reasons I won't go into. Met this new group back in October and we just started hanging out and talking more and more throughout the month. Now, I try to be quite self-aware, and so I knew that I was probably a little too eager about it, but they seemed to be too. It felt like a lot of dopamine hits every time they talked to me or asked me to play a game with them. It was honestly the most fun I'd had in a long time. The most cared for and liked I'd felt in a long time. One night, one of them actually sat and talked to me for about three hours about what was going on for me, like he was genuinely curious because he could tell something was going on with me. That was one of the kindest gestures I've had in such a long time, it meant so, so much to me. That's why I wanted to explain that, because it's been at the forefront of my mind and a big part of my life lately.  So, making the decision to live with my sister and her husband for a month was very difficult, when I know it shouldn't have been. Well, that's not true because I also know they aren't mental health professionals, so I was apprehensive about how it would be for them if I wasn't doing as well as they wanted. I was also just honestly terrified of losing this new friend-group, and not having time to talk/hang-out/drink with them. Yes, very unhealthy. But I guess I didn't realize how much I had been craving connection until that all happened. It made me very sad and still does, to think of losing them after having just found them. Irrational of course, because they stuck around.  So I moved in with my sister and her husband. Things started out well, I thought. I was getting up during the day, which had been a big issue for me prior. I wasn't drinking, I started exercising and moving everyday. We weren't eating out, I was cooking my own meals and eating at regular times. For someone with the depths of depression I was in before this, this was amazing. I was feeling actually happy. And I still had my lovely new friends to talk to. One thing I had a lot of issues with was sleep and waking up, as I always have. I also probably had issues with being in front of screens too much. I felt that considering everything else that I was doing, these wouldn't be the end of the world and I'd keep working on it throughout the month. Then, about two weeks in I sensed that my sis and her husband seemed not too happy with me. They brought it up in one of our nightly meetings. Brother in law told me he thought I was taking advantage of him. I think because of the sleep/waking up thing. I got very emotional because it feels like complete shit to be told that someone feels that way about you. Keep in mind, I had offered to pay for some food and stuff but they kept refusing so it was somewhat baffling to me. But anyway, I (very emotionally) explained my side of things and told him I hadn't felt this healthy or happy in a long time. He seemed to gain a new understanding and apologized, said he needed to hear all that. I thought things would be okay again. Obviously, though, it added to my anxiety and I began to feel increasingly uncomfortable.  Things went on as usual for a little while. Then, on Christmas Eve my sister came out and said the same thing. She was really mad. I kind of got mad/sad back at her. I thought we had talked about these things? I tried to reiterate what I had said and explain depression and insomnia. But we were heated. I was ready to go home at that point, basically feeling very unwelcome and freaked out. However, her husband came down and hugged me. He gave me reassurance and such and said he'd be devastated if I didn't stay for the whole month. So I agreed. Then, my sister and I had an open discussion about expectations for me. But basically, my discomfort levels were very high and things didn't seem the same. They stopped caring about nightly meetings, and on Christmas Eve her husband smoked weed without mentioning it or having a talk about it (he had been struggling with the lack of his preferred substance, as well). It's hard to explain, like I'm not mad at him for doing that, I just felt like, "okay, I guess the rules have just changed overnight and nothing has been discussed." It felt a bit disrespectful, but again they aren't psychology people. He probably didn't think that was insanely triggering for me.  Of course, I didn't have to react the way I did. I could have tried harder to be an adult, but as you can see, that's not a skill of mine I guess. After Christmas I felt homesick, uncomfortable, unwelcome, etc. I got some wine and drank it at night. The next day I reclused in my room and ordered food (which they had done as well on Christmas Eve, once again without any offer or communication about forgoing that 'rule'). Yes, I'm a dumb, petulant child for doing so. I could have done much better and been the bigger person. Everything just felt terrible though, and I guess at that point I probably wanted to go home anyway.  The next day bro in law had a talk with me and said he would be sending me home tomorrow. I was relieved at the same time as ashamed. It was a strange feeling.  Going to backtrack and make a little side-note here, as it pertains to how I've been feeling currently: The night after Christmas I had also had a falling-out with one of my other close friends. Now, this is weird, because I have been questioning his friendship for a long time, feeling that we simply enable each other and don't have a real healthy connection. I go back and forth with this because it's hard to leave a friend you talk to every day for about 6 years. What happened, though, was that I invited him to a game with my new group of friends that I mentioned before. My new friend is a great DM and was supporting him to give his first one-shot at D&D a try. Well, my old friend took forever and eventually the new friend asked him about it. Apparently old friend then DM'd him weird stuff and eventually started insulting him. The new friend bit back, and then my old friend sent a bunch of insults my way, telling me how horrible I am and how he hopes I die. So, that was the nail in the coffin. Blocked him and all that. I expressed that this felt weird even though it was a long time coming, and new friend is very kind and reassuring saying, "Well don't worry, you've got us now!" It made me feel special, once again.  So even though he said that, I can't help but be afraid of pushing them away. They don't know the details of everything I've been going through. They know enough, but I don't think it's wise to burden them everytime I'm feeling down or lonely. I don't want them to think I only bring negativity and drama to the group. So I'm trying my best to not bombard them with everything. But honestly, it's starting to feel extremely difficult, because I could usually just call up that old friend who I cut ties with and just say whatever or distract myself. I know, that's a horrible way to treat a friend and why I considered saying goodbye for so long. My irl BFF and I don't have the same friendship we once did either, so I avoid bringing much up to her as well. I guess what I'm saying is that during the time shit wasn't working out with my sister and her husband, I was already starting to feel extremely alone and lonely.  I left to catch the plane on the 29th, and then drank basically every day until the 1st. This is also contributing to how I'm feeling, obviously. My family knows and has talked to me about how I will be going forward. I'm going to try to get back onto a good routine and not ruin what I had going there. But Since I've returned, I've felt like I'm in hell. Well, other than drinking and having some fun with my friends. New Year's was actually quite nice, too. But ever since that has been over, I'm fucking dying under my nerves and anxiety. I could barely eat the past three days as I lost my appetite. I'm literally obsessing over my friend group and it's making me disgusted with myself. Like, I wish I could talk to them all the time and tell them how I'm feeling, but since it's a pretty new group, like I said, I am trying so hard to avoid scaring them away. I feel like I've already done that slightly which I why I'm freaking out trying to do damage control, while at the same time holding my breath for any messages from them. It's really bad, I know. And I know this is all amplified by how much I drank, so I hope I can just wait it out and my brain will even out again.   Meanwhile, I've gotten that job and Amazon delivery lined up. Training starts tomorrow. I should be glad and relieved that I have something already, but I'm just freaking out that my mental health will ruin things again. This evening I was able to actually eat a little bit of a substantial meal, so first steps to maybe restoring some stable feelings. I hope. All I've wanted to do the past few days is sleep as much as possible and hope to wake up feeling some semblance of normalcy.  I'm embarrassed by myself, of my choices, of my thoughts and feelings currently. I want nothing more than to be a good person, but I think I am legitimately a bad person and I just never really understood how bad. I hope I can take these excruciating baby steps forward, and that those first couple of weeks I had with my sister won't be in vain. I hope I get to keep these new friends and don't let my extreme insecurity and deep yearning to talk to them all the time ruin my behavior with them. I honestly remember a time when I wasn't like that, when I could be healthy regarding friendships. I want that back, I want to be light, positive, and natural with them. They are such kind, creative, special people. I hope they know that and that I don't mean to be weird or over-bearing with them ever.  Sorry, this has become a weird mess of a journal entry. I just really, really, needed maybe someone to see it and read it. I feel incredibly alone and scared. I just want to be better.  I wish I could feel loved right now, I wish someone would come hold me, stroke my hair and lay with me and just let me let all of this out. I'm scared I'll never be loved again because I'm too unhealthy for anyone to put up with me for long. I wish I knew how to love myself again, it feels so far away and impossible. I feel incredibly alone, and it's all my fault.   I hope my training goes well tomorrow and I can put on a bright face.  Thank you very much if you read this and if you respond.  tl;dr: I'm off-my-rocker, depressed, socially anxious, lonely, and lost. I don't want to ruin relationships and want to get back on track. Just venting, I guess. Any kind words are appreciated.

I’m sorry life is so hard. It’s okay that you’re not okay and it’s okay to struggle. No advice but solidarity and sunshine, and cat purrs if you’d like.
I read it and soaked it up.  I'm sorry to hear you are struggling like this.  I don't have any advice... nothing you probably don't already know, but it sounded like toward the end of your post that there is an uptick you are feeling, and that is such a great thing.  Please keep the positive momentum going, and I hope your new job works out well for you!

I just came to the realization that I have done nothing with my life. I've been a lazy kid doing whatevers on my mind for as long as i can remember. I never really cared where I end up.   I'm meaningless. My laziness threw me into a repeated cycle of unhealthy actions and I just realized that. It feels like my life was wasted. Like i have no purpose. I've never felt this much emotion in my life and I don't know how to get myself back on track. I've been living my by parents thoughts and dreams of me and I never came to the point that I have my own life. Now that I realized this, i know im gonna go back to my meaningless life tomorrow morning. I need to fix this but I don't know how. Someone please help me. I'm 19 years old and I had to leave college because of covid and i work at a pizza shop. Delivering pizzas. This is almost the lowest ive been in life.

Is it normal for me to believe that every time someone says something positive to me they're lying? Because I always feel like they are, and in all honesty I've experienced that many times growing up and that holds true to this day. I will say that, in all honesty, they're probably right to not say anything positive about me. Why would they?

Hey, it can be really tough when we feel lonely. That loneliness can put a "filter" on the things that go on around us- feeling sad can make us feel like the things we see and hear are more negative than they are.   Sometimes too, living in a society encourages us to avoid "egotistical" views of ourselves, but it's also not fair to discount or diminish the strengths we have in ourselves.  I say that because your feeling of self-love will absolutely affect the way you interpret things around you.  If you are not feeling so great about yourself, it's easy for that self-criticising voice in your head to take over.  That same voice could be telling you that positive comments from other people are disingenuous.   Remember to try to love yourself, because you have strengths that you may not appreciate enough or not even realize.  I don't know you personally, but the fact that you are addressing what other people think of you means that you are selfless in a way- it suggests that you care about how you affect other people.  That is a trait of a compassionate person. Selfish people just think about themselves.   There's a lot of answers to your question, and I've just provided one example.  I hope this helps. Please do not give up hope!
Thank you for the positive words but I have a question. Is there any way for self love that doesn't involve others? From my understanding, and I have no idea if this is right or wrong, isn't it easier to get a sense of value from others? Like, I need evidence that I'm worthwhile.
People are social animals after all. It's not unusual that we feel validated when others support us, it helps us feel like we belong. But yes, absolutely- you can learn to realize appreciation and love for the things you do or are- or can work towards becoming. It's likely that you just haven't had practice on feeling appreciation for yourself, and that practice is something you can manage and work on.   You can start by just taking a breath when thoughts of doubt arise and stand up to those negative thoughts or use them in a constructive way.   Be gentle with yourself. Enjoy the things you enjoy doing. Appreciate the uniqueness of all that you are. Try to avoid obsessing over classifying things as "bad" about yourself or "good"' -we're all just people trying to so the best we can at the end of the day, and we can always try to be better from the mistakes we make. Flaws are just opportunities to be better.    You're on the right path. Keep going. You can do this!

I am a 60 y/o male, divorced, living alone, feeling terribly isolated and depressed at the moment. I know there are mostly young folks reading this, but I hope there are Redditors who can relate to a senior.   Long story short I have been ostracized by most of my family for recently (finally) standing up to the 90 y/o wanna be bully and wise guy who was my sperm donor. He’s an ignorant pathological liar and sociopath who bullied and abused me as a kid both mentally and physically, and who has now convinced my mom and sister that I somehow abused and otherwise victimized him when recently standing my ground. Initially my mother was supportive of my holding up for myself - I think she saw in me something she was never able to do for herself. But she has since turned on me, feeling as if I’ve abandoned her. She today accused me of being the most selfish person she’s ever known and said she hoped my son abandons me in my old age like I’m doing to her. I don’t know what to do. I’m legitimately concerned for my safety and/or that of the sperm donor should I visit my parents’ house. The old man may be 90 but he has lots of guns and I’m genuinely afraid in his demented state he might pull some kind of honor killing shit. If I never again see or speak to my sperm donor or my traitorous Judas/Karen of a sister, I’m reconciled to that. But it is crippling to me that I can’t see my mom and that she has now turned on me.   I went through a deep depressive period several years ago after my divorce and am feeling like that blackness is returning. I don’t want to be in that dark place again because I’m not sure I can come out the other side this time. There’s so much more to the saga, obviously.  But from what you have here, do you have any thoughts or advice to share?  Thanks in advance.

So I am not a kid (63 years old M) Professional Photographer 41 years from New York / New Jersey area I was first diagnosed when I was a teen with a depresive Neurosis and feel like I outgrew that for many years with a successful career as a photographer in Manhattan, traveling working for magazines and shooting models in New York for good money.  Time went by in a flash and my then Wife and I moved to Mexico where she is from and where we met when she was a model for a media company in Mexico.  She came back to NY with me on one of my trips and a year later we married and she became my soulmate, assitant, model and scene stylist for almost all my shoots.  Later she went on to be a buyer for Rolex and Tag, we were living the dream, at least once a month we skipped off to the Caymen Islands to scuba dive and play golf on occassions to other islands as well.  We made a decision to move to Mexico and give life there a try, her family ws politically connected as was she so moving all our stuff and me getting work papers and setting up my photography business was easy, I was teaching underwater photography.  Somewhere along the line, she started to get sick, where we lived there was no real treatment so she flew back to Mexico City and started treatment, she had hyperthyroid which I had dealt with as a child with my mother.  Paranoid episodes, odd behaviour and massive weight loss, treatment was working fine and eventually she stopped taking the meds upon doctors advice.  She was great for a couple years but she had a brief relapse.  One day she told me she wanted to see what it was like to live alone since she never did, she lived with her parents and we moved in together when she was 19 and had just returned from school in switzerland.  I was floored but we talked and I understood she wanted to see if she loved me or depended on me for everything. so she found an apartment and moved out of our house that we built.  It was supposed to be a 3 month thing and we were supposed to break off complete contact.  We did see each other from time to time as in her company there was a media consultant whom I worked with in NYC who wanted me to do some editorial work and cover events that she was a key player at.  Soon 3 months turned to 6 months and I told her that she needed to make a decision on us, in or out so she said IN.  She moved home and nothing was the same, our incredible life was now gone, I am a talker, I think talking out problems solves everything so we talked against her better judgment and she told me she was aquiring a taste for a girlfriend but that she loved me and if we could be together and take the sex thing off the table she would live with me forever.  I wasn't down for that, I think I was 40 at the time and she 29.  So I asked her to stay at the house since I was traveling alot at the time working for 2 latin american magazines and some government advertising projects in different parts of Mexico and I could rent on the fly.  I was travelling on a 3 month project when 3 hurricanes hit the area almost back to back where my studio was located as well as a condo I rented and the house we built.  I lost everything that I physically didn't have with me.  Studio lighting, cameras, lenses, as well as all my electronic devices.  So now I was starting over with the clothes in my car, no condo, no studio equipment and looking for someplace to call home.  I was still fine, I was dealing with it and I did deal with it and rebuilt and met someone else who became a part of my life and helped me rebuild equipment and business.  We were living in a very affuent part of Mexico City and we had an entire floor near the embassays and half was the studio and half our living area. My Live in GF wanted to try wedding planning as she was doing all the event planning for me and my clients and we built the largest wedding and event planning company in Mexico serving, artists, record labels and people from around the world coming to Mexico.  10 years ago my brain I guess was on overdrive and I stopped sleeping, I was waking up with ideas and on the computer at 3AM, finally it got to the point where I couldn't sleep and sought professional help.  The Psychiatrist diagnosed me with depression and Anxiety and put me on Sertralina in the morning and Alprazolam at night.  Got me under control in about 2 months and I stayed on treatment until he worked me slowly off it 3 years ago.    in 2016 my life started falling apart my GF moved full time to our apartment near the beach leaving me in Mexico City alone with my photography business and cut off from our planning business even though our lawyer drew up an agreemnet and we had it entered into the courts that she refused to honor.  My Paid photography work was getting less and less and I was doing more of my hobby or passion than I was getting paid for it.  in 2016 I was featured in Esquire Magazine, GQ and VICE for my erotic photography and since then I have had nothing but small catalog projects and low paying weddings and events.  I lost my apartment and studio in Mexico City and ended up moving to the mountains for cheaper rents and now in a 1 room cabin on someones property.  I do Social Media Work to pay the bills and photography never took a back seat just income dwindled.    on my birthday 2019 62 years old I came back from running with my dog and my neighbor / friend noticed I was "Walking Drunk" and asked me if I was drinking (I wasn't) so I spent the day trying to regain control of my fingers and feet they didn't seem to be doing what my brain wanted.  The next day she took me to the doctor and he said I had a small stroke, he wanted me to go to the hospital but without money and insurance I couldn't so I went home on meds for 30 days of bedrest.  Beginning of December I was forcing myself back out to try to get running or walking again which I was doing well until Christmas Eve 2019 when I had a heart attack, same thing doctor sent me back to my cabin with more meds to rest.    I considered myself very lucky and in January I followed up with a cardiologist who put me on a diet and excercise plan in addition to the meds and by march I was ready to work.  But low and behold COVID Hit and we went into complete lockdown here.  So needless to say I haven't had a paid photography job in 2 years, because of the lockdown my social media work is getting me about $100 USD a month which covers my meds and some food, but I haven't paid rent or utilities since May when my savings ran out and my passport expired and can't renew it to get out of this economically crashed country.  This year as my birthday neared and COVID was making a big come back here being alone, no family here and in the US my sister and I don't speak we went back into complete lockdown until at least March 1, 2021 No christmas tree or decorations for 2 years and no companionship since t¡I had my stroke and suddenly the severity of it hit today when I looked in my wallet and saw I had 200 pesos or $10 USD until the 26th of January. I wanted to buy Coffee Filters and couldn't because on Monday I have to buy my meds and just have enough to buy 1.  Its been months since I slept through the night and more than a year going to sleep before 1am and waking up after 7AM.  I find myself working everyday in Bed instead of at my desk. and I stopped Running completely.  I feel like I have fallen into depression again and I am tempted to start sertralina again but don't have the $$ to buy alprazolam anymore. The doctor who treated me told me one was useless in my case without the other.  I feel sometimes like I lost my edge in photography and my creativity is going away, and where I live I can't even get people to commit to a free photo shoot just to experiment.  I mean I have done incredible work for so long and now I feel like I don't even want to get out of bed.  I know Holidays are tough on all of us! But I feel so Alone if I didn't have my dog I prolly would have ended it already.  Sorry about the length, Happy New Year

I’ve cried almost everyday now when working.   Doesn’t matter if it’s after, before, and during my shifts.   I’ve cried over minuscule mistakes I’ve made and I’ve also cried over huge chaotic stress inducing mistakes I’ve done. Work is stressful. Any type of work is stressful for me.   Me driving to work is just another heart pounding anxiety attack. (I pull over to sob if anxiety happens of course)  Me getting ready for work is my ADHD making me late and panicked, resulting in tears to overcome and get myself prepared. I almost always forget something whilst getting ready for work. I’m almost always late to work because of this.  I mess up the times and days of my shifts even if I written it down and knew the morning of, I had it correct. Wrong. Thank you dyslexia, for telling me I’m correct about a time frame and putting it into my alerts when it wasn’t right to begin with.  I miss shifts and break down into a literal ball of shameful tears when it happens. I’ve almost been let go for this reason alone.   Then the depression starts. It hits hard after every stressful moment. And loves telling me to look at myself and see how much of a failure I am. How much people would be better off if I wasn’t there working beside them or working to cater to the customers there, because of how clustered my mind is.    Forgetting to do my lunches. Having to sit in multiple times in the managers office with tears rolling down my face. They tell me why am I late for the day. Or why am I so flustered. I give them excuses because being depressed and having anxiety and ADHD isn’t seen as a good thing and I’d most likely be let go for it.  Some supervisors knew still and would be delighted to put me in the busiest shifts for the week and weekends.   However; Today I have realized, I probably won’t ever stop crying over something. Whether it be major or small that I did. That messing something up for myself at work just makes me feel terrible inside and my way of coping is crying loud and I’m very ugly when I cry.   I wanted to post this just to remind myself to not look back at my old ways of thinking. Because I most likely will while at work and while working if I start crying over something. And maybe it might help someone else out too. I don’t know if it will I’m guessing it won’t now that I think more into it.   I’m just now maturing I feel, to the fact that this may not change and I shouldn’t be scolded by myself to this fact to change it, because it does help.   Thank you for reading my terrible mobile post. Grammar and spelling mistakes galore.   TLTR: depression makes me cry lots at work, and I’m finally okay with allowing myself to do it without such constant bitter hate towards myself.

Very physical for me too. You could, but there’s a lot of other things I’ve learned that over time help relieve my more physical symptoms of anxiety/depression.  yoga/stretching, exercise, eating good nutrient dense foods, a warm bath, napping, cuddling, anything really that activates your parasympathetic nervous system and gets you feeling safe and social (mainly for anxiety tho)   I’m really sorry you’re struggling, remember that it always gets better. HMU if u need someone to talk to.
Just be careful with how many you take and how often you take them. If you do to much you could damage your stomach. Talk to you doctor before you do anything.

I wake up everyday with intentions to do things and get things done. I end up just going back to sleep and stay in bed all day. This has been about a month now. Am I alone? I feel so stuck no matter how hard I try. I can’t get anything done other than showering and eating. I had breast cancer at 24 now 32, I was just diagnosed with an AVM (malformation) in my brain and an unruptured aneurysm. I am anxious and have intrusive thoughts. I also legit feel tired no matter what amount of sleep I get. I can’t get going in the mornings and just sleep and stay in bed. I had to take LOA from work, which I also am down about I have my Masters and make shit. Like $13/hr. I feel like such a failure. 13 is nothing to live off of and support. I am over 100k in debt of student loans and thousands in medical bills. I am afraid to become homeless. How do I get up? This isn’t the first time. I am stuck and need help. Yes I have Drs and therapists. I know all the coping skills and still can’t apply them. Any advice appreciated.

This morning I woke up feeling a little happier than I have the past few mornings so I went for a run. I had tried going for a run a couple days before but I didn’t feel the endorphins rush I thought I would and it made me sad. But this morning I left my house to start running and the endorphins started to flow. I felt like I was me inside my own body and mind again. I was going fast and could feel my legs working to propel me forward. And I’m going to try to run again tomorrow morning with hopefully the same or a similar result 🏃‍♂️☺️

Get after it!!
Good for you!
Amazing !!!! Congrats !!!! I really want to get back at rock climbing I think it will help maybe
I'm happy for you! Many runners agree that running is what helps them stay sane. Which let's face it has not been an easy task recently. If you decide to stick with running for a longer period/need some motivation I'd recommend checking out r/running. Best of luck!
Good for you! Very happy for you. A runners high is literally the most amazing feeling in the world, it’s like being on drugs but the rush is purely from the appreciation of the power of your own body. Keep it up, friend!
Hey that's great! Running is not my thing admittedly so that sounds like a massive accomplishment! However, I'm here to encourge you - keep going!
Exercise is amazing. When it's warm I walk/run and it's enjoyable and makes me feel good. I also do work out videos and lift weights. That is also great for me I've found.   Exercise is really great for depression. Glad you discovered that!
Yaaaay  I will try that
Hell motherfcking YES!!! So excited to hear you had such a lovely moment in your own body <3 manifesting as many of these moments as possible for your life! sending love!
I thought I was the only one to get tears of joy after small victories! I did the dishes for the first time in a week and cried for like an hour lol good for you! If you keep at it, running can help your depression stay away longer. It can get better. You can get better.
Thank you so much! Just joined that sub 😊
Yay that’s amazing! I’m proud of you :) Running and cleaning are both great things to do when you suffer from depression. The other night I decided to get my dishes put away then get my laundry started and for the first time in days I began to feel like myself again. Hope you have many more victories soon!!! 😊
Thanks! My depression is kind of on and off lately. I have good weeks and bad weeks. All I know is I've felt content before and I can feel it again.

Pretty much explained it in the title.    I'm a 23F who suffers from GAD and ADHD. Due to several tragedies within the last year, I'm very depressed. Looking for a new counselor; I had an amazing one, but it was through my college as a graduate program and my counselor finished that part of his degree. I've had two appointments with someone through a counseling office (not part of the college) but it felt like they didn't know what to say or ask me (I'll explain a problem that I'm having - including this one, but they didn't give me any advice on how to handle or solve it). I'm also working on getting a doctor appointment. I've been on an anti-depressant before but I didn't like how it made me feel.   Anyways, my depression is rough. Have a hard time doing anything - just getting up to get a glass of water is too hard sometimes. I feel mostly mentally awake, but my body is too tired to do anything.    My biggest problem is my appetite. (It's not an eating disorder, so please don't mention that in any advice.) I have a hard time eating anything. I'll be hungry, but won't know what to eat. I'll finally pick something, but the time that I pick it, I am either too hungry that I'm nauseous or I try to eat it, but I can only eat a few bites before I get to the point where I'm forcing myself to eat. I try to make sure I'm eating enough, but it's hard. Sometimes I also feel full after only taking a few bites.    I am taking Adderall for my ADHD so I know that low appetite can be a side effect, however, the low appetite is very recent and hasn't always been the case while on my current Adderall dosage.    I've been trying to search for tips and advice online, but everything I try to search results in pages explaining the symptoms of depression - no tips for low appetite.   Thank you in advance for any advice! I really appreciate it!!

First off, I don't know if the 'requesting support' is the right flair or not so I'm sorry if this is flaired incorrectly.  I have massive anxiety. The pandemic has only increased this but the problem was severe before. I haven't been to the doctors in 2 years. I am petrified to my core of doing it. I was put on medication for a couple of months two years ago, which was Setraline I think and also Propranolol. These medications clearly weren't right for me. They gave me very, very intense mania and very, very intense depressive episodes. So I informed my doctor and I stopped taking them.  (A funny memory I have of describing these effects to the doctor, who wasn't my usual, was asking her "have you ever seen the boat ride scene in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?" because to me that disconcerting spinning and lack of control is exactly how I felt, I genuinely felt like the boat ride scene in CatCF. It was only until later that I realised how mental a question like that is)  I then went 2 years without being medicated, but I really really need help again and have done for over a year. I still haven't spoken to my doctor.  Asking me to pick up the phone to call them is like asking me to go on a skydive into an active volcano without a parachute. It's not even a mental decision at that point its 'FUCK NO FUCK NO FUCK NO I'M NOT DOING THAT I CAN'T DO THAT FUCK FUCK FUCK'  My mother doesn't care. She just says 'you need to ring the doctors' and i keep trying to explain to her that it's not that simple but either she's washed her hands of it completely or she genuinely doesn't understand.  I need encouragement (i guess?) or just SOMETHING that doesn't make it feel like you're asking me to rip my own heart out and eat it.

I understand, I hate calling/talking to people. I usually don't do it, until I have to. I have been avoiding calling the bank and my uncle :D  Is there a way to get the appointment online? Or make them call you?   If there isn't, maybe you can get ready to call in advance. Like find your insurance card, credit card, write down what you need to say etc. Then you won't have to worry about those. You can take it slow. You can write down a clear excerpt one day, go over it the next day.   Then all you need to do is to hit call. After you call them, you have to talk to them and you will be ready. It is ok, if you are awkward on the phone. They are dealing with hundreds of people, they will not remember the conversation. So, go to a place where you will be most comfortable. I usually like to be alone, so no one can judge me. Or I make a call, while I am driving, so I cannot worry about how awkward I am. Then take a few deep breaths, then hit call. The dialing noise period is the worst, but then once you have someone on the other end, you will only suffer a couple minutes.   Sometimes, if it is a specialized office, outside of working hours, the calls go to voicemail. You can call them and leave a message. They will probably have to call you back, but you won't have to deal with the finding encouragement process.  Hopefully it helps! You can do it. Then, celebrate, you did something you couldn't do. Celebrating the little things is the way to go!
Right now because of COVID their waiting times are awful, potentially hours at a time for a relatively small area. Being on hold will just feel like purgatory to me, waiting to try and explain shit.   Plus I tend to undersell a lot, back in my therapy that I pretty much ghosted after one or two sessions I was having a full blown panic attack in the waiting room during one of the worst periods in my personal psyche up until that point just to go in there and basically say what amounts to 'ah im a little stressed and unhappy with my job'  It's like going to A&E with a arrow through your leg and when you get in there you start telling the nurse you've just got a bit of a sore throat lol

The best thing you could do for yourself is to talk to a professional and get a diagnosis. Intrusive thoughts may or may not be OCD. OCD is not just a cleaning thing for those who think it is - the cleaning is a result of the thoughts.  You may or may not have depression but the only way to know is to talk to someone who can diagnose you. If it turns out that you do then you can start treatment which may involve medication and should involve some form of talking therapy.  If you do this ASAP then you stand a much better chance of a faster recovery which in turn will help your relationship survive. Depression is not an easy thing to handle on your own and I cant give you any advice specifically on how not to lose someone in your life. However I can tell you how you stand the best chance of keeping your relationship stable and thats to get professional help.   I'm really sorry that you are feeling like this. I understand that you must be feeling very scared and alone. I hope that you find a way through this. Good luck.
Thank you so so much  Im soon starting therapy hope will go well I appreciate so much that you took the time to write this(:
Hey, you are welcome. I'm so glad to hear that you are starting therapy soon.   One thing I can tell you though, is the top reason that relationships fail is because of lack of communication. Just make sure that you keep talking about what's going on with both of you and be honest about your struggles.  When people talk, it makes them feel connected and prevents misunderstandings. I advocate for complete honesty and transparency in relationships although this isnt the view of everyone! When you have mental health issues it can be easy to shut people out so I'd just advise you not to do this with your partner.  Most of all, keep being pro active. This can be difficult when you are depressed but it's so important. Keep trying new things and see what works for you because not everything will and that's ok. Meds dont work for me for example but I respond incredibly well to gratitude practices.  I truly wish you all the luck in the world 😊

I’m suffering from depression and I usually try to cope through art. I haven’t been painting or creating enough art like I feel I should be, and I think that’s part of my problem. I was told to do what I love, not just when I want to, simply because you’ll want to do whatever it is you love when you can’t possibly do it, whether it’s because of time constraints or money.   I feel like my depression has made me a shell of the person I’m supposed to be, and I’ve filled what parts of myself I’m missing with silly, random bits and pieces of information and ways to escape my reality. It feels like life is slipping away, a silken slide where I have no grip to slow myself, and I cannot change where I’m going. I don’t want to be stuck where I am in life, no place to go, a labyrinth inside my head, running from a beast that isn’t chasing me but is trapped in my head too.

Someone made this statement to me and I think they were dropping a hint to my ex boyfriend because I'm ugly.  So in a way it's like saying,  "You had intimacy with her? Eww! You poor thing, are you okay?"  But my question doesn't relate specifically to that comment but rather to the lack of support I've received from people online.   I look in the mirror and cry but I know I have a beautiful heart and I deserve better than this. Again,I'm surprised by the lack of support. I guess I can understand why a segment of the population might sympathize with the view that ugly people should be shunned but I don't understand why EVERYONE  seems to support that view.  It seems to me there ought to be at least a few good hearted people out there who aren't shallow. Where are they? Where are the good hearted people in the world?

Oh, honey, I think you are reading way too much into that statement.  You said they said it to you - so how could it be dropping a hint to your ex?  It sounds like you have extremely low self-esteem and I hate that you feel that way.  I understand it, because I suffer from it also.  Getting support online may not be the greatest idea though, because the anonymity of the online world enables people to be quite cruel sometimes.  (. Do you have any kind of support system IRL?

IDK what to do anymore, I'm giving up. I really hope atleast one person responds to this, I've posted about this before but no one answers. I feel like a ghost. I'm lonely, and I just want a single friend. I don't even have friends online. I have asked in groups, forums, etc and nobody responds. What's wrong with me? Am i even here? Am i a ghost? I'm so lonely and I just want a single friend. It all started in 2017, when i graduated highschool. My friend group quickly feel apart. People moved, went to college, worked, etc. It eventually just became my two friends. Then my one friend left and joined the army, I've tried to talk to him but he ignores my messages. So it was down to just me and my best friend. Long story short he was a dick. I got married and he was suppoused to show up to my wedding as my best man, he never came. My wife and i then decided to move away and start our own lives. We moved from Texas to Northern Wisconsin. Idk anyone here. My wife is my only friend honestly, but i need real friends. I have no one and it sucks being this lonely, I'm depressed a lot of the time honestly. Idk what to do. This depression is killing me, and the loneliness doesnt help. I feel so tired, bored, and sad. I just want a single friend.

Hey man, why don’t you try get yourself out there a bit? You’re in a new place where you don’t know anyone but your wife.. have you thought about what you love ? What are you passionate about? Perhaps look at going to a local pub for a trivia night, try a social club or volunteer somewhere? I can relate to this and you’re not alone. Keep being you and the right people will come into your life
I feel like a ghost much of the time, too. These days it feels almost normal. It used to feel sad, like I was slowly disappearing. Things would feel a lot worse now without my spouse. It is good to have a life partner.   It's hard to establish connections in a new place, especially given the pandemic. I'm sorry you're dealing with this loneliness and sadness.
You're not alone. It sounds like you're not completely alone since you have a wife, but understandably you'd want friends too. I can understand where you're coming from. I just moved away from all my friends to a new state too but covid certainly makes it hard to make new friends, thats for sure. could be time to reconnect with old acquaintances or check out meetup groups? I think making friends outside of school or work will always be challenging, but keep trying. Not all people will be a good match, but that's why you gotta keep searching. Connect with a hobby or game you like, maybe?
Also I heavily suggest seeing someone about your depression if you can. It may help you figure out what you do enjoy or provide you some kind of motivation.
I have tried connecting through games and stuff but nobody talks to me.
Yeah I hear you, I don't have the answers to fix that but I think if you find the right friend and connection, the conversation won't be forced or pressured. It just may take time. I know that doesn't help but in the meantime, I saw something online that I want to share about loneliness. I think it has a good message -- that being lonely isn't because there is something wrong with you.  https://www.instagram.com/tv/CJoXerbH45W/?igshid=1szl580oeyvwj

I’ll try to keep this at a decent length, but a lot has happened. I’ve beat around the bush letting anyone know how I’m feeling. I try to stay optimistic for everyone, but it hasn’t helped me at all. Even I know my optimism is a lie. Today, I found out my husband is depressed. It doesn’t help with my own, but I don’t want to tell him more than he already knows about how I feel. He can’t handle me as an extra stressor and I don’t want to do that to him, so I’m hiding it. I don’t know what to do. I feel bad hiding it, but there’s so much going in for him. The military has been hard on him, a potential deployment has been hard on him, he seeked out therapy himself which I am really proud of. I’ve tried to show him as much support as I possibly can, but I feel like I’m going down with all this new information. Depression is heavy on both sides of my family. Both of my grandmothers have it, my aunts on my dads side all have it, my dad does but won’t admit it, my mom has it, but she’s also a hypochondriac. When anyone says they have anything, she suddenly has it. If I do decide to tell him, I feel like now is the worst time. He just came clean to me. I don’t want him to think everything that’s been building up for me, is suddenly because he’s depressed. If I were him, that’s probably how it would appear to me. I’ve been struggling with it without ever mentioning it openly. I’ve tried to work through everything on my own, but I know there’s a point where you need to open up. I’m just not ready. My connection with my husband, my dad, my aunt, and my cat is what keeps me going. I can’t stand the thought of me making rash decisions forcing them to wonder what they did, or for my cat to wonder where I am and why I abandoned him. Reddit’s not the best place for advice, but I just wanted to talk. I needed to get it off my chest and put it out there, but any advice on what to do or how to cope would help me immensely. Thank you for reading.

I’ve been struggling with my depression for the past couple of years, and lately I haven’t been feeling myself, I noticed I get really irritable from time to time, often paranoid, anxious. The whole nine yards. I’ve just got my drivers license, which was hard to do because of my depression and anxiety holding me back (I mean who wouldn’t be afraid to drive a massive block of metal that could unintentionally cause harm) but yay! I got my license. I don’t have a car, and often times, I don’t like change. Change is scary, and sometimes I don’t react because I don’t like the change. I’m starting to think that I don’t have basic run-of-the-mill depression. Does anyone have any helpful media or tips? Maybe a hotline or recommended course of action? I don’t know what to do.

*I'm currently writing up some notes for my psychiatrist appointment tomorrow. I've jotted down some bullet points under a heading "history" and wanted to share the story here in case it resonated with other sufferers. If this point has no other point, I hope it illustrates why self-medication is a bad approach, how difficult it is to maintain, and why it's prudent to seek better treatment options:*  One of the issues that drew me to treatment six months ago was the fact that I needed to greatly cut back on the amount of alcohol I was drinking. To cut it down to a bear minimum. I was diagnosed with gastritis after a surgery a year ago (unrelated to alcohol!) and, to keep it in remission, I've realized that I don't have much leeway.   After spending a bit of time thinking about why I was continuing to drink alcohol despite the fact that it was causing me health problems, I concluded that the root of the problem appeared to be that I was drinking a ton of coffee every day. Why? In order to get work done and focus.  I'm sorry to say that I was stuck on the caffeine:alcohol seesaw for many years. Potentially as many as 10. Over time, I found that I needed to ingest more caffeine, and drink alcohol more frequently, in order to maintain the desired effect. In other words, there was a tolerance effect.   This approach was so unsustainable (the stress of being constantly caffeinated multiplied by the physiological stress from drinking) that it led to periodic "mini breakdowns" about once every few months during which I felt that I couldn't go on (before regaining composure). It was after the last of these that my GF basically gave me an ultimatum and told me that I had to seek help.  How did this work in practice?  By day, I would drink about 5 to 6 cups of coffee depending on my workload in order to focus. By night I would have a beer or two in order to come down from the physical anxiety that the coffee produced and get to sleep. When I say physical anxiety I mean it. As the day went on I began to get shakiness, bursts of tinnitus, and a weird sense of pressure in my head. I began negative and depressed too. I was also of course stimulated like crazy. I *needed* that beer both to get rid of the physical sensations and to come back to planet earth.  The longer this went on the more I came to hate this daily routine. I can honestly say that the only drinking I've ever enjoyed is the drinks I have shared with friends socially. Drinking by night (alone) to get to sleep when I was insanely buzzed from coffee at 1 in the morning (just to get a normal day's work done) wasn't enjoyable in the slightest. It was tortuous - particularly when I came to understand that this was impacting my physical health.  After several attempts to figure ways out of this mess on a whiteboard, I concluded that there was no way that I was going to be able to figure this out on my own. I had tried everything from meditation to exercise and supplements. Nothing matched coffee's ability to actually get me in a state to focus on tasks. Or alcohol's ability to dial down that anxiety and return me to homeostasis.  If I cut out coffee, I simply couldn't focus on anything or get anything done (which in turn made me stressed out and anxious). I tried this a few times and would lie in bed uselessly depressed. If I cut out the alcohol, I would have severe insomnia and anxiety because there was nothing to balance out the coffee.  This madness persisted for 5 years or so and another five years if you include the time when I was drinking coffee but not much alcohol and was just anxious a lot of the time.   I finally saw a psychiatrist last summer who agreed that I probably have ADHD and wanted me to try Ritalin and then an SSRI if that didn't work.  I'm now doing the more complicated business of trying to figure out what's causing what. I was initially diagnosed with ADHD but my ADHD doc now things I have primary mixed anxiety/depression and secondary focus issues. Or possibly both. But he wants me to treat the anxiety before resuming treatment as when I tried Concerta I had horrible depression and anxiety.  I'm sharing this in case anybody else has been on the same self-medication "combo" of alcohol and caffeine. Given that these are some of the most commonly ingested substances in the world, and both legal, I reckon there have to be plenty out there.  Whether you were a fan of espresso and beer or lattes and vodka doesn't matter. I reckon there have to be plenty of people out there that have relied upon these two opposing chemicals to balance their neurochemistry. And if you tried it, you'll probably suffer the same unsuccessful outcome as I did.  I'm really hoping that pharmaceutical treatment works for me. If it does, you can bet that I'll be kicking myself for spending years drinking coffee and alcohol when a couple of tiny pills could likely have taken care of the same issues.   If you managed to get off the seesaw, as I'm hoping to do, then kindly share how you did that and what worked for you.   So that others who are looking to replace self-medication with actual medication can be encouraged that there are answers out there.  Thanks for reading!

I'm in my second year of High School and don't know what to do with my life. The obvious answer is study. I don't want to go college/university in my country, I don't even want to live here. Then where do I go? Well, I have no clue. I want to go to college/university because I guess that's the next step. What would I do otherwise? Travel maybe. And then what? Find a job (wether or not I have a degree) but how could I be happy. I don't want to live in this world. This pandemic has made me spend too much time in my own head and I just want to skip the next 10 years of my life. All I want is a stress-free life, a family, a house and happiness damn it. I just want to disappear, not die/commit suicide but just stop existing.  Has anyone been through something similar and or overcome it?

I think I understand what you're talking about. Lately I've been thinking that it would be good if I could just blink out of existence. With the pandemic, I've lost my job and I've barely left the house. There isn't any jobs going as so many businesses are closing down. It's been a very lonely time at home, and I can't see it getting any better any more.

Its a rant, i need a bit of advice.  I am 18 years opd trans girl and have been diagnosed with depression for 2 years now.   Back then when i first considered therapy and stuff like that I didn’t knew what was wrong with me, school stressed me through the roof and I really hated how i look (it was gender dysphoria I just didn’t know that yet). I had very good friends back then that supported me dearly and were a HUGE help.  Unfortunately I have started lose contact with them since I transitioned, it was exactly one year ago although I stopped talking with them until few months ago. For some unknown to me reason my best friend started to treat me badly, they didn’t care about my problems like they did before and they were overall very shitty towards me. Because of that I started to feel worse and worse.   Fortunately i met someone that i fell in love with, they are non-binary (she/they) and we were dating since October. I was in a very bad mood for most of the time but they always made me smile and made my day a little bit better.   The thing is i still suffered from suicide thoughts and i was very anxious at the thought of going to school, now even more when i have noone there to help me when i am in a bad mood.   Me and my SO planned to meet this holidays unfortunately it didn’t work out because they dont have any means of transportation to where i live. I fell into huge despair because of that fact, i have been crying every day and my suicide thoughts went from “i want to die” to actuall planing how I’ll do it.   Because of how I reacted to the thought that we won’t be able to see each other’s until they move from their parents, it would take AT LEAST half of a year. I just couldn’t stand the thought of that... I tried to tell them that i am very saddened by that and that we should use the help of my father (he said he can take her to our place), she refused, she didn’t want to do that because she felt that it would be too much help, and she couldn’t just take it. I kept saying that it is fine and all but she just didn’t listen.   I was very devastated and said some sad stuff to them. Because of that she decided that we should breakup until we get better (she does have some mental issues aswell). I am really sad that we won’t talk for that time, and i dont even know how long it will be, because i just can’t see myself getting better. I am doing all I can, i go to the therapy weekly, i did come out to my family as trans woman and transitioned, i take mediations for depression... I think I did everything that i could, but still i am just a human garbage, I can’t stop crying, my head hurts so much... I have in plans to go to the psychiatric hospital, and i hope there i will able to get better but if that doesn’t work out, i will just kill my self, there is nothing for me to live for.  Sorry if that is hard to understand, I am full of emotions rn and can’t write properly xddd

excuse me if i used the wrong flair.  i’m out of depression now, or at least, i think i am... for the last 3-4 months. it’s just whenever i do something and i end up getting in trouble for it even though i genuinely thought what i was doing would help people out, i feel extremely mad at myself. (that scenario i just gave was an example.) usually i’d feel mad, angry, frustrated, or sad about myself. it’s not a feeling of wanting to self harm all the time, but i feel as if my heart sinks, my chest heats up, and i feel the urge to cut myself or kill myself.  honestly when i used to self harm, it made me feel like i was in control. it helped me channel out the inner anger and frustration i had towards myself... onto myself. it felt so fucking good.   am i still depressed? i don’t think i am, and that these occurrences of negative thoughts are an outlier, but i’d like to know input from others.   happy 2021 :)

I (29 F) personally accepted, maybe a year or two ago, that I will always have depression and its not something that can be cured for me. Sometimes it’s better, and sometimes it’s worse, and I just manage it the best I can. I also struggle with self harm, and I have noticed that it is usually when I am overwhelmed with painful emotions that I wish to control, and not feel, that I cut. I don’t know if you are still depressed or not, but I just wanted to say that mental health is not a straight line progression. Each day will not always be better that the one before it. But it’s a journey and you need to be kind and patient with yourself!
Sometimes just seeking guidance from an adult in the mental health department can help you need to just work with them and tell them what your feeling and how to help you
Sometimes being depressed is okay if we can’t get out of it it’s not our fault or anyone else’s it just happens to the best people in this world it’s how we always end up coping that could tell how we are
A lot of mood disorders, if not all of them, don’t go away forever. They’re like chronic illnesses where you have flares. You may go a while without feeling the disorder, but it generally eventually comes back.   The key is not to search for a cure. The key is to learn how to live with it. Bill Hader said it best. It’s like a pet monster. At first it’s intimidating but once you learn how to live with it, you can move forward. If it’s back, it’s back, and your best option is to figure out what mechanisms help you. Don’t let the monster control you. It’s not the head of house—you are. You’re still in the driver’s seat, even if your passenger is being an ass.   Best of luck to you, OP.
you dont sound depressed, but you do sound like you have some kind of self defeating disorder.     i never got formally diagnosed with anything but i used to do and feel the same way, if i got away with something bad my concious would get hte best of me and i would feel like i need punished, so i would use a razer blade on myself.     the trick, atleast for me, is to use those negative energies positively, i would work out, so i would still get the effect of punishment through the pain of excersize, and in the end be better off and feel better due to the release of hormones/endorphins, and its a great way to stay in shape.
I think that would be depression but none of us are experts.  We can only draw from our experiences.  I think depression can be extreme mood swings, which this would be.  You go from a high of finishing a project at work or helping out a friend, thinking you did a good job, only to find out it was all wrong so you go to the extreme low of wanting to slice your arm open.  A person who does not have depression does not think this way at all.  They think "Oh, darn, disappointed but I'll do better next time.   People with depression think a small set back is the end of the world and cry their eyes out or revert to anger against themselves.  This is not a proper action to the situation.
I'm not an expert, but that sounds like it could be similar to Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)? I personally have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I am also questioning whether I have BPD or not.
thank you u/thegabby for your insight and advice. i appreciate it a lot. here’s to a better 2021 :)
perhaps i’ll take up jogging. besides i need to shed a couple of pounds heh. i do really feel tho that whenever i make a mistake, specifically around my dad, i believe the way he responds to it triggers my self-defeating thoughts. it happens sometimes around my mom when i make a mistake and she gets upset, but i feel it more often with my dad.  i choose not to act upon my self harm urges because i know i’m stronger than that, but i get the feelings so intense sometimes. thank you for your insight.
thank you. i feel like this might be something i have however i wouldn’t know for sure. i know my doctor said something about me being really sad when i told him about my depression a while back and that if talking it out w my parents doesn’t work then he might have to try medications on me. i’m alright now, or so i think i am, but it’s those strong mood swings that get to me sometimes. thank you.
maybe, or just extreme mood swings. i don’t know but i appreciate the insight you all have.
for me it was never a specific person, it was crime, i used to live off of theft because i had no job, so i would steal everything i could to survive, and i was good at it so i never got caught.  glad i could give you some help though, good luck on the jogging, i always did pushups, but whatever works works. stay safe freind.

Alright, so, you want to die. Let's think about this rationally. Why?  &#x200B;  ... Death isn't fucking rational. Death feels like peace, death feels like sleeping, because you've learnt that life is so much bleaker than it is. You're trapped in a goddamn rat race, where numbers on a page, numbers on a clock, fucking numbers control everything you are. What's the point of living if you can't live? What's the point of learning if you can't learn? I lie on the head of universe, and it seems so large, and I'm so small in comparison. The world seems like it wants to swallow me whole, and I let it. I'm but a martyr for my own sins, the sin of gluttony, of wanting to become more than I'll ever be, I want to swallow my heart and choke out my soul, gore out my eyes and deafen my ears so I'll finally have an excuse to be useless. The world is so large, and I am so small, and I seek to understand it all. But what's the point? You're in a maze of human construction, in which learning for the sake of learning has become obsolete. I don't want to learn for a job, I don't want to learn for money, the synapses in my brain balking at that thought.   &#x200B;  And as I study the chemical structure of strychnine and a thousand other ways to poison myself, I learn because... I want to learn. I don't want to be measured in productivity, my life reduced to a personal GDP, numbers on a page in some government file, because... is that all I am? No, it isn't, and I feel time slipping out of my hand and wrapping it around my neck in a chokehold, because if I'm not productive, if I'm not a product in the world that we call society, then I can't be anything. Oh, how Atlas holds up this world. And I lie on his head, looking up at the universe until it seems like I'm looking down, and the only thing tethering me to the world is the weight of my responsibilities. I know I am no different than 50 others, 50 million others who hold the same thought, each of us a gray hair on His head, and the universe is so beautiful, each supernova and quasi star the beginning of another life.   &#x200B;  If I were to die, would I become a star in the universe? Would I be born again, made out of carbon and helium and oxygen and all the things that I can understand, shining because for once, I can shine of my own volition? Tack me to board, split me open from sternum to stomach, and what do you see? The flesh of some mortal child who wanted to become a star, ate the whole fucking galaxy in order to get a chance. Mother made me a knife, Father told me to hurt (he never said who) and I've found myself as a weapon, searching for blood, even if it's just my own. And I eat and eat, and eat, because if I don't who am I? Perhaps we are not measured in what we make, but what we devour, money, lives, rapid combustion and dismantlement of bones and fluids and oh, how Icarus laments, an eulogy, for he's but another Sisyphus. And when I die, I'll join them, Dante's Inferno, another death, another pain, flayed open for the world to see, but I am not human, but I am a desecration, a martyr, a song for the damned and I am bursting at the seams to be more then I'll ever be, and I fucking eat, devour, taste the blood dripping off my maws and down into my throat, where I scratched a poem of the words that I will never say, and I cry. Who wants to end, the world or I? I can't decide, but I know that I shall hold the knife.

The title pretty much sums it up. Im 14 and I've been depressed since I was eight. I have been contemplating suicide and pretty much the only thing keeping here is music and gaming but I have nobody to share anything with. Everyone at my school hates me and that's not an understatement. Im just tired of all this

You do not need friends at any part of your life. Growing up you quickly realise people are pretty much a waste of time it's just hard to get it in your mind that people are not worth the time because everyone is brainwashed into thinking that having friends/girls or guys (for women) chasing them is being succesful.     You are young you have a lot of extra free time and less responsibilities which will allow you to build yourself up both mentally and physically and thats what life is all about, if you manage to realise it while young you simply gonna have a better jump start unlike others myself included whom only realise it in their 20's 30's. It is not easy but nothing in life is ever gonna be easy and it's not something to scare you it's the reason for you to grow up and be stronger.     People are mostly fake and will take advantage of you even if you make \*friends\* now by the time you change schools they wont give a poop unless it's in their interest to keep you around.      Try reading some books on your own and work on yourself physically and you will get over your depression rather fast,by no means it will make it dissapear it doesnt work like that but you will feel much better overall and your relapses will be smaller and shorter.
I am so sorry to hear this.  14 is just too young to be feeling so helpless and alone.  If I could, I’d like to offer some advice.  First, try joining a club that interests you at school - drama club, or the yearbook staff, or whatever other club catches your eye.  It’s easier to make friends when you share an interest in common.  Next, please keep in mind that high school is god-awful and should be considered a form of torture, but college is COMPLETELY different.  I don’t speak to many people I was ‘friends’ with in high school anymore, but made life-long friends at college.  Kids in high school can be cruel and they haven’t fully developed empathy.  By college most of them have worked that mess out.  It will get better, I promise.  The last bit of advice I can offer is to use the free time that you have to learn a new skill or meet a goal.  Learn a language, practice art, learn karate - I don’t know what interests you, but do not let this time go to waste.  Picking up some interesting skills now will help in the future - not only will it give you something interesting to talk about, but you might find others who have the same skill, or are interested in learning it.    Good luck.  I am pulling for you!

Hello everybody,  I’m a 16 year old girl, live with my parents, and am depressed (and seeing a therapist). I have a brother and sister who’ve both moved out to college (they both live around 25 minutes away though so they come home quite often).  A couple of days ago my sister was visiting home and I was feeling very depressed while we were having dinner. This is very often the case. But then my sister decided to take a photo of me because I ‘looked cute’. I was literally feeling fucking depressed and I ran off to my room and I’m fucking mad at her but she doesn’t know. She can’t read me at all and it’s terrible because whenever I feel depressed and talk to her she thinks I’m mad at her. NO. IM DEPRESSED YOU FUCKING BLIND BITCH. I fucking hate this situation and I don’t know what to do. This evening she’s coming home to make dinner for the two of us since my parents are out, but I don’t want her to come and I don’t want to have dinner with her and especially not be alone with her. Lately she always makes me feel super much worse and she doesn’t know how to read me at all and it’s making me very upset. I don’t know what to do, do you have any advice on how to make this situation better/how to get out of it??  If you want more context, leave a message down below

Have you tried talking to her?  You seem to have a lot of anger and resentment towards your sister, but you admitted that she doesn’t even know you are angry at her.  She’s not a mind reader; you’re going to have to step up and be honest with her.
Thanks for your reply. I know (I also told my therapist but in less detail: she told me the same as what you said). I haven’t talked to my sister yet but I think I will when the time is right.

It's hard for me to see anything positive in my current state. I have nothing to look forward to. My own life is simply empty and meaningless. I don't have a family, friends or a career. I'm about 30. It looks like the good times are far behind already. I remember them with bittersweet feelings. There were times when I felt really lucky and alive. I even had romantic partners. I was really going somewhere. But then it all just ended. Friends moved away, I failed in my relationships and ended up alone. I'm still studying at university but thanks to COVID all the social life has ended. I hate Zoom and social media and I'm uncomfortable at phone.   All I have are some probably delusional beliefs that I suspect might be a sign of a mental illness. I have tried committing a suicide multiple times during last years.   I can't get any help. At the moment getting to therapy is almost impossible. And it would also probably cost so much money that I couldn't afford it. After all, I'm totally broke.   I know how many mistakes I have made. And I guess I have earned this all. I was stupid, I didn't know how to act properly or behave with people. I get easily offended, so many of relationships ended even before they really started. I wasn't smart enough to build myself a career. Things just happened in my life and I didn't know how to control them. And now I'm alone and miserable because of that. It's probably all my fault and I shouldn't even complain.

You say you are attending university.  Surely the school offers some sort of counseling program at no cost to students?  Covid has been brutal not just to you, but many people.  At least there is hope that an end will come and we can resume our normal way of life and not feel so isolated anymore.    I feel for you and totally understand as I live alone and work from home currently.  Have hope that you will finish school, covid will be a distant memory, and you will find a job at a great business and your social life will return.  Until then, hang on and keep your chin up.
This probably isn’t what you want to hear... but you have a great opportunity ahead of you... you can start from scratch... build the life you want... find your passion... if you don’t have one... try new things until you find what you want to do...   Look at your values and find something that aligns with them... if you don’t know what your  values are, discover them...
Your post hit me. I felt something  Maybe because I was in a very similar state  I hit rock bottom  Not once but twice  So I hit rock bottom  Then was back for about 2 yrs  Then hit Rock bottom again falling gradually for 5 years  Then it took me 6 yrs to come back  I kept asking myself how can this be - maybe I did something wrong  And that made me research, read books (some many times), watch youtube videos, buy courses  And everything made sense. It made sense why I fell twice and how the first time I got back up Look! Your post was powerful and I’ve come back twice. You can do this. And I’ll tell you something else - as I was falling so was most other things  And when I was rising everything started to fix itself  So the only journey is the rise Of course it’s not going to be overnight but it’s fun the journey of rising is fun  You can do this but first I think like me I had to stop blaming myself  Ok it happened. Ok I may have had regrets, but the power is now. Where am I now? The power is getting back up  Please make a decision to get back up No action  Just make the decision Decision has power and let things happen I wish you all the best and I know you can be flying high again in happiness as a fortunate person

I don't know how to get over my low self esteem. I don't know if medication is the answer, drugs or what. I'm starting to get to the point where I want to feel numb or apathetic. It's better than feeling shitty all the time.  It's just that I messed up my entire life. I did poorly in college. Made 0 friends. Could only get crappy low paying jobs ever since. I feel like my husband probably secretly thinks I'm a stupid loser and probably wishes he had the courage to find someone better (but he's too nice). I rarely enjoy any hobbies anymore or anything at all. I have 0 talent so what's the point. Nobody respects me at all.

Is just your mind, like mine. I know how to do tons of stuff, but I still feel like the last idiot on earth.  People watch my stuff and like it. Am I satisfied? No. Do I feel good? No.  Because that's just the point if this illness, seeing things differently from how they really are.  Hugs, friend. If you need to talk feel free to contact me.
I think you are taking responsibility by honestly accounting where you are at now.    maybe reread and say to yourself what you would to a loved one you dont want to see suffer anymore.  Hopefully this can start you on a road to compassion. Who are you not good enough for?  good enough for what?  why judge when we are all trying to survive right now? Tread easy, be good to you.  Depression sucks!
I’d highly recommend speaking to a counsellor or therapist. It’s a release to get these problems off your chest and to have professional guidance.   I was feeling fairly similar with self esteem issues which over the years became deeply ingrained into my thought patterns, it’s still difficult but with the right guidance it makes mor  e sense.  Wishing you the best :)
I don't only feel the same, I'm in an exact situation here. Every day I try my best, but it doesn't always help. I hope you, me and everybody in the same position will find the solution that works best for us..
I’m going through the same problems, my self worth just seems to get worse. But I’m really trying to hold on and see the good things in life. 🤗
I know how you feel. Wife says she loves me, but I know she could do better. It’s been difficult finding a job that pays well right now. Especially with everything going on. I haven’t been able to save up enough to attend college. I hated high school. I was really good at only a few specific things. Everything else was just an annoyance to me and I sucked at it. I used to enjoy cooking but countless chef jobs have made me care less.   If anything else, I have empathy for you. Just another day, come and gone by, hopefully the next is a little better for us.
Took me a loooot of CBT (not CBD) to get out of the self worth well I was in.  And I'm not really done, just off the bottom really.  Wouldn't wish those feelings of worthlessness on anyone
I did poor in college too, 0 friends, abused weed, and became lazy. That was 8 years ago.   Today I feel like shit, i am 28, and i slept for 8 hours and sat in bed another 4. It's 12 pm and I haven't been to take at least a pee. Imagine how i feel. My mother told me it's 12pm, she was unpleased to say it.   I don't know what's going to happen with my life, but in my head it doesn't look good at all.  I have no hobbies. I have no girlfriend. I always pray for my parents to be fine and support me, otherwise I'll be finished.   So hold on there, you're probably way better than me. Your life is way easier, you have less things to do.
I felt like this too until I found God.  I know he loves me, and he loves you too.  I know this might sound silly, but he has performed so many miracles in my life that some day I want to write a book about it.   Just like I said that God loves you, and you are fantastic just the way you are.  Abracci anche a te, e Dio Ti Benedica.     Tua Amica, Josette
I do talk to a therapist. I started a few weeks ago. It's not really doing much for me at the moment. I might need a new one.
I'm in my 30s. So all I can tell you is don't wait until then. You're 28. Start now. Whatever it is you want in life, start doing it now. You have no girlfriend or anyone getting in the way of doing whatever you want. That's actually pretty great.  Once you're married or have kids or have a house and responsibilities, everything becomes difficult. You can't just travel or just jump in and go back to school. Everything costs money and you have a mortgage to pay or kids to feed.   I feel like it's too late for me. I'm married and have a house. Our parents live near us and as they get older I feel responsible to be around. I'm also getting to the age I need to have kids or it will be too late. So I just feel stuck.   I'm assuming you don't work. Find a part time job to get started and get yourself some money.
Yeah it’s all about finding the right one! It takes time to work on your self but the best investment to make! Keep at it :)
I live with my parents and I feel that i must be around them too. I lived by myself about 4 months last year, but i spent too much money.   I don't want to travel cause I don't have money and i also don't feel like it nowadays. I dont even have enough clothes.   We have 23 dogs and 15 cats, it's hard to deal with them and i don't do much to help, but i do help when it's needed.   I have a job, Monday to Friday 8-4, which I don't like but i need the money.   I dream about becoming an online marketer or dropshipper, but i need money to advertise, so i need to go to work and save.   I want kids the following years too, i don't necessarily want a house, cause we have a big enough one, but i think that it's a drawback for any girl to accept to live with her parents in law and with that many dogs and cats around.  I want to make money, I really need it, we have lots of expenses but i don't have the energy to work in my free time. I have also recently quit smoking weed and cigarettes, and I'm passing through a tough period. Had some hard times in my life recently too.   Thanks for your comment!
I know what it's like to not have the energy to do anything. I love plants and gardening but rarely have the motivation to take care of them.  Dogs and cats can be really therapeutic. Try it out.
Dang, 38 animals? Why so many?  Are you fostering them or are they all pets?  You are probably right in that a girl is not likely to want to live with your parents and all those animals.  Most want to have a home of their own.  Who know... maybe you'll get lucky and find one that doesn't.  The other commenter is right.  Take advantage of your current situation.  You are young and not tied down with anything.  So many options.  I would have to make a list.  Who knows what I would do.  Get courage and take my chances in another country? Go work on a cruise ship for a year?  I dunno.  My kids are older and I find myself single now, but I still have a mortgage and bills and a job.
Well, i currently have a cat in my bed. He is sleeping.   I am on my desk chair surfing on my phone with the tv on. Didn't leave the house today at all.   I enjoy their presence, but i know it's a pain for my mother to feed all of them and clean after them.
They are all pets now. Not fostering any.  We'll see. I'm old enough for a stable relationship, but I am also a different kind of guy.   I can't take advantage of my current situation just now, because I simply don't feel right.  I never actually wanted to go and work in another country even though I thought about that. I also thought about working on a cruise ship, but I don't think that I will manage to do it. I'm depressed home, I'm gonna be more depressed on a cruise ship for sure.

So...depression, right?   I really really would love some advices to how to deal with it the better way possible.  I been depression for several years, not diagnosed but already did it therapy years ago and have signs of it... and u know...really did get worse because all that's happening rn.   Now I finished school, jobless and dont know really what going to do. I just sit the whole day doing anything. (almost.. not always)   Sometimes i look for jobs, but i just get frustated for have anything for me. Even though i dont really know if i GET a job something really will change, u know? (Deep down i feel that will)  Sometimes i read some self help books, and really does feel good, just reading, even knowing I stopped for awhile. (Probably going to returned to read some)  And i think thats it.   If u want to suggested something, feel free to.  Have a nice day :)

Hi,   Since getting treatment my depression has improved a lot. But some days I still wake up and I struggle to get going and I have little motivation to do the things I want to. This is much less common than it was before but it's still just as debilitating as it was before treatment. Do you have any advice ?

Actual advice I am unfortunately useless because my fiancée has to coax me out with coffee on a good day.  Advice where I'm attempting to be funny in hopes you'll laugh, get a cat! You start giving it wet food in the morning daily and they'll annoy you out of bed! Mine does
I'm glad to hear that you have improvement.  That must be a huge relief on your mind.  Having a routine that commits you to doing something in the morning might be all that you need to kickstart the rest of your day.  Walking a dog, or plan a morning jog, rain or shine.  Something that you stick to doing every morning that you do that you can get a little sense of completion when done.  Maybe even doing a guided meditation program in the morning.  They don't take long.  10 minutes.
Maybe reading a good book or starting up a new hobby would do.

I've just really been struggling lately. I sleep too much or not at all. Cleaning is super super hard. Even simple things like laundry, dishes or even my cats litter boxes are hard. I basically don't eat because cooking is annoying. I am falling behind in basic human hygiene because I'm too tired all the time. I just want to know if anyone has some basic life advice on how to deal with it.  Even if its just something simple and silly. I just really need some help rn.  I just want to do better for my animals and my family. I know they're all disappointed in me and don't really get it.

i’ve been here. while it’s hard to feel like you’re disappointing your loved ones, the fact that you do WANT to do better is something you can lean into and try to draw motivation from. what works for me: setting reasonable, clearly delimited goals for myself — and trying to celebrate / recognize my hard work when they’re completed. honestly, five or fewer things a day is the most you should aim for. even completing one is huge.    sounds like you might live with family, so may help to identify with them what is most useful for you to take care of and be SOLELY accountable for that. set expectations with them, and then try not to take on guilt for anything beyond those.  and for eating... get yourself stocked up on easy meals and snacks. i have survived on peanut butter on toast, apples, and microwaved chicken broth for weeks at a time.  be kind to yourself; even asking for advice is a success. 💚
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kpdx25/solipsism_and_lemonade/
I made lemonade today. 3 fluid ounces of sugar, 3 fluid ounces of water. Juice of two lemons. It tasted divine. At least, I thought it did. My mother didn't like it. She said it was too sour, despite her being the one who wanted me to put less sugar in the first place. But you know what? I didn't care, I drank it anyways, because it was sour and sweet and more importantly, I had felt happier than I had been in ages, making iced lemonade in the freezing Canadian winter on a Saturday afternoon, for no damn reason at all.   And... I wish I could live in that moment forever. Where I'm stabbing lemons with a fork and waiting for the ice to freeze, because if I could frame seconds, images, of my life up on a wall, you would bet I would hang it up.   I've ruined it, though. Just like ice melts, happiness doesn't last forever, and what does it leave behind? Nothing. And I don't know if I've even goddamn got depression, if the sick, empty feeling in my chest every time I think of work, academia, is just a result of burnout gifted kid syndrome, because I've gone one too many days, one too many nights, watching the neighbours out the window instead of doing my homework. And I've got my mother's trust issues and my father's loathing, and 15 emails from my teachers and friends, asking "Hey, hand this in" and "Hey, check this out" and "Hey, answer me" and "Hey, I'm worried for you" but I won't reply because I'm busy eating my own heart out.  (The neighbours are happy. They wash the dishes each night at 7.)  I don't know if I'm even living anymore. My parents cheer me on (they have no other alternative) and failure isn't an option. But putting pen to paper means staining it, and suddenly, I'm no longer perfect, I'm a number, I'm whatever I write, and I've heard people say "Hey, just hand it in! A 70 is better than a 0." But they don't understand, because a 70 means that you've tried and you *failed* and there is nothing worse than failing, because failure is for fools who don't know their limit, for people who can afford to fail... and I can't.   They say everything is riding on my performance, on my numbers, and I don't even know if I'm anything outside of my performance. Life is a play, and I say my lines and I walk off stage, but I no longer have a script. And I'm no good at improv. So I choke out words and run off stage, to where I am no longer anything, and it feels good, because being something means that there is something expected of you, the words "potential" and "talent' and "expectations" that you have to fulfill and I am just so weary.   Pen touches paper, and the ink begins to look like oil, black and staining the page. I don't think anyone has ever found oil spills beautiful.  (I'm pounding on the walls of the tanker again. In the aftermath of Pearl Harbour, workers were trapped under rigs beneath the ocean, slowly running out of oxygen. The workers on land could do nothing to save them, as touching the structures would cause them to fall apart and do more damage.  They had to wait. Days and months, listening to the pounding of the workers, begging for them to save them, watching and listening as the knocks grew weaker and weaker, and eventually disappeared.)  I am on the inside and the outside of the rig. I am inside, and I'm suffocating, and my hands slam across metal and glass, but it remains closed. I am outside, listening to the muffled knocks and screams, but it is as if I'm watching a fish bowl. It is distorted, the sound, the sight, and I see it, but I do nothing. I'm not sure if I could, because if I fail... then it's far worse than what I can deal with right now. I am fragile, fragile as spun sugar and the lamplight I had shattered when I was six, and I am crying, like I've never seen my father do, and I am tired, like I've never seen my mother become and I am so, so sick of this world and everything material.  (Some days, I wonder if I was the only thing that could exist. Some days, I wish I was the only thing that could exist. Some days, I wonder if I don't exist. Some days, I wish I didn't exist.)

**Hello I really enjoyed reading** the text you've written please write more :)
Hi, you seem to be under the assumption that I've seen other people arrive at, and I'm here to give a quick clarification. These are *not stories.* Writing is cathartic for me when I'm in a depressive episode or extremely stressed, and the moments when I post on this Reddit are during some of my most troubled times.  I appreciate the sentiment, honestly, and it does make me slightly less bitter to see that I'm making other people happy, but you have to realize, this writing does not come out of a good place, and hence, though I know you this was not your intention, this reply is a tad disrespectful.  I wish you a good day.

Ok, ummm well I’ve not been genuinely happy in about 4 years and I’ve tried to k-word myself by means of taking 25+ Tylenol (on multiple occasions), cutting, locking myself in a room while cleaning with strong chemicals and by some miracle, I’m alive??? I want nothing more than to be happy but I feel like if I ask for help my family will think I’m just being dramatic, annoying or needy and I only want to be able to help them so I try not to talk much about my feelings... you know? I like to help give advice but I never ask for any because I don’t want to be a nuisance but I have goals that I want to accomplish that I just have lost so much motivation for... I even fell behind in school for two semesters. I started college while I was 15(last year, but I’m still in highschool( duel enrollment). But I had to pause college due to drop in grades and ended up disappointing my parents anyways... I don’t know how to be happy anymore but I really want more for myself. I want to be happy again. I thought anonymously posting could help me somewhat organize my thoughts hehe, sorry if this bothers you but if you can help I’d be grateful.

Another note, if I’m left alone in my head for too long I stare into space and cry even if I’m not thinking of anything and I’ve had multiple panic attacks for the past two years (almost everyday at one point) where I’d lock myself in the bathroom for atleast +30mins
Oh boy you are a hard case but I think I can help
Alright so don’t cut yourself or hurt yourself it will only make you more sad because of the injuries and wtv but if you don’t want to disappoint your parents march right up to them and say “mom, dad I feel like it is time to tell you, I need help and you both are not helping or anything and I request you need to at least recommend me help it is distracting me from my work in college which disappoints you, and I feel if I can get help from your or someone else it may be able to help me with not spacing out or crying or cutting myself or locking myself in the bathroom for at least half an hour” just say that they might not be convinced, if that doesn’t work just don’t pay attention to them if they are a burden on your thoughts and make you not pay attention in school and I know college debt isn’t good overall but you have to eventually get over it, everyone does, anyway I’m probably annoying you if you want help talk to me or any friends on reddit or go to someone professional get a small dog ( dogs cheer me up when I’m sad so It is. 3/4 chance they will make you not sad or other pets like a fish you can talk to it to practice talking to people who can ACTUALLY help I think you should at least get something to help at least that’s what I think Anyway you don’t have to contact me or a therapist or your parents (if your parents really are disappointed in you THAT MUCH I just wouldn’t pay attention to them) anyway I should prolly go I bet I’m annoying you bye bye
No, you’re not annoying haha thank you so much..... I don’t think they’re that disappointed just enough to the point where they’re putting it in my face everytime is mentioned (I.e) “please don’t make me put on my camera, I’d be the only student with a cam on and it’s really embarrassing (social anxiety to some degree)” “It’s embarrassing to know how you’re doing in school, how do you think I feel?” And so now I hide and spend all of class making sure they can’t see me rather than my work which isn’t helping and now I feel like my parents sometimes do care but they also just want to be able to brag and be a token parent :’)
Sooooo did u tell them?
Nope :D
Okay
I’m too scared to
Ohhhhh well that’s okay just as long as ur happy this okay brobro

I don't know how to make it out on your own, but I had years of medication and therapy to no avail, simply because I was in real hard denial about trauma. Once I "woke up", and was able to truly see it how it was, I was able to start healing. The progress is not fast, but it is incredible. I thought I was a lost cause, but I'm not. I'm getting better. I do however use therapy and a low dose of antidepressives.
Is your routine of doing nothing contributing to keeping you down?  I mean, I get it, games are *something*, but not really.  Have you tried shaking things up some?  I know it's hard to explore many options right now with covid, but surely there has to be some things occupy your free time differently than how do spend your time now?  I find constructive things rewarding, and that sense of accomplishment isn't going to change your life, but it's a bright spot.  Personally I like woodworking, but hell.. Lego kits, painting, writing something, getting through a classic novel, master the art of cooking.. whatever your fancy.  And maybe rearrange your furniture some.  New space... new you.
I’m in the exact same situation, if you ever feel like talking about it you can dm me. Maybe we can help each other.
Yeah man for sure

Would appreciate some help to keep going.   Hi, hope everyone reading this is well.  I am currently going through a depressive episode and don’t feel like I’ve got the energy to continue trying to cope with it and since I don’t have a support system; I was wondering if anyone could encourage me to continue my journey. I would love to hear some kind words. If anyone also wanted to share anything nice that happened to them I’d be happy to hear.    I personally don’t know anyone around me who doesn’t have a support system but if someone here is feeling the same way or has advice would love to hear it but please nothing like “try to make new friends etc” since it’s hard for me right now. Maybe if there is a safe, supportive group that I could join I’d like that.

Hi there.  Yeah, I'd recommend finding a peer support group!  You can search the websites of NAMI (national alliance on mental illness) or the DBSA (depression and bipolar support alliance) to find free virtual groups by location.  Groups have done so, so much for me over the years.  Best wishes, -F.
Thank you will definitely look up these websites. Wish you the best as well.

excuse me if I used the wrong flair.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  I don't know what does depression looks like I don't even know if I have it or not all I know is that I feel not doing anything if someone tells me to do something I'd scream and say I'm not gonna do that I don't wanna go to sleep I don't feel like eating food or talking to anyone even my grades I used to be one of the best students in my classes, not I'm fulling half of my classes. I'd say I'll do something that makes my mood change I'd get so excited then in the middle of whatever am I doing I feel so lazy I feel that I don't wanna do it anymore if I were forced to sit with someone I'd launch and act like nothing, but inside me, I'm saying am I really thrilled. when I sit by myself at night I feel that there's someone talking to me and saying everything that could hurt me like ur so useless you haven't done anything good with ur life just go and die go and kill yourself then I feel there's someone else saying to me your just imaging that no doesn't do that you're not gonna kill yourself then I'd start crying. I don't know what's that I don't know anything I'm scared if I tell someone they gonna say I'm crazy or something. What can do someone help me, please.

Hi there.  It sounds like you are dealing with a mental health condition, and that's ok - a lot of us are.  When you say that you feel there's someone talking to you, I'm not sure if you mean conflicting thoughts or if these voices feel like they're not your own.  I would recommend speaking openly with a mental health professional about your symptoms to determine how to best start feeling better.  Suicidal thoughts, even if we don't plan to act on them, are scary and traumatic.  If you do begin to fear that you might hurt yourself, please ask a friend or neighbor to take you to a hospital.  You can also always contact NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) for guidance and advice - either their national helpline number or a number of a local chapter.     Best wishes, -F.

My friendship with a boy I love has seemingly finally come to an end. I lack the strength to get over him and it’s been months. I’m too low and tired. I honestly don’t think I’ll ever see him again and it kills me. I don’t know how my life could ever get better at this point. Alone for 4 years. Too shy to even use social media to make friends. Lost my new job due to another lockdown. I don’t imagine I’ll ever get over him. Every day it seems less likely I’ll live to see 25. I’m 24 now and my birthday is in spring. The only reason I am alive is because I don’t want to upset my mother or brother  Sometimes when I cross the street I don’t look for cars because at least then they’d see it as an accident and not blame themselves  I know that’s wrong, I am just so so low and alone in this life  I just wish he cared again

You aren’t alone. And you will survive this, I promise you.
You aren’t allowing yourself to finish the grieving phase of the loss of your relationship. His part in your life is gone and it stings. We all know that here. The other commenter is right about self love. You don’t need this guy to create your happiness, no more than he needed you for his. Don’t allow his absence to control your attitude. Finish mourning the relationship, and look to the future of what’s to come. 24 is young and there are so many fantastic people out there that you will meet and when it happens, the memory of this guy will fade.
I learnt something actually very recently which was self love. If I appreciate myself then I don’t need love from anyone else. I think need and want is different. Wanting love from others is amazing but needing it can be difficult. Self love fixes that and self love I think changes things. I hope you find ways to appreciate yourself as love and appreciation are very similar feelings. You asked an amazing question. There is something intriguing about you. Maybe the way you write. something I learnt just recently and that self love will give you a great feeling and a new chapter in your life. People may even ask or say you’ve changed in a better way. I think that is what you are missing. There are so many things to appreciate about ourselves  I wish you good luck!
Thank you, I hope you’re right

Struggling in life right now  I’ll start with that I’m 17 years old and I have no idea what my purpose is. I don’t know what I want to do with my life. Recently I’ve been struggling with depersonalization and trying to figure out who I am and where I’m going. I’m from Florida lived there for 16 years. When I was in Florida around the time I started my freshman year I got into drugs. I was smoking weed and dropping acid and at one point my sophomore year I was doing Xanax stealing my moms prescription. When I was in middle school my mom met my now stepdad. He’s a cool guy and all but we didn’t get along that much. At one point in my life I was really lost and in my sophomore year I ended up punching him and my friends saw and called the cops. My stepdad slapped me first so when the cops got there I explained what happened and admitted to punching him. In Florida where I’m from there was a rule where if sheriff’s were called out to a domestic assault case somebody has to get arrested. He slapped me with a open hand so it was considered parental discipline and I got hit with a domestic battery charge at 15. When this unfolded the cops pulled me to the side and asked me if I felt safe and If I wanted to go somewhere else I could only imagine they could’ve put me in JDC at the time I didn’t want to hurt my mom so I said no. I still think about that decision and if I should’ve went maybe it wouldve straightened me out. I started getting caught a lot with weed and everytime this would happen I would get all privileges revoked and everything out of my room. The worst part was disappointing my mom but I still did it because I couldn’t find any other way to be happy. I still kept in contact with my real dad me and my sister would go in the summers and winters to see him. My sister is 4 years older then me so when she was a senior and got older she decided she didn’t want to go anymore so it was just me. I love my real dad and I loved spending time with hit the only problem was he also remarried and I had a stepmom that was worst then my stepdad. She scares me she would hit me never with a fist or anything just regular hitting. It got to the point I would flinch at every move she made near me. She was also so selfish and never liked me to begin with. One day I got bored and looked online at one of those record lookups on people and I looked her up and she had a charge from the past for child neglect. My mom and stepdad moved a lot even though not far from the place before still in Florida but it was always a new school district. So my junior year I moved and started a new school I met people here that changed my life. I met my friend there Connor he was a senior at the time but he took me in. Instead of having to ride the bus he would pick me up in his car and take me to school since we also lived in the same neighborhood. Connor was cool but he was also like me in the aspect he smoked weed. He didn’t do any hard stuff like I was freshman and sophomore year but this sparked me to start smoking again. Half way through my junior year I got caught smoking once again by a random drug test from my parents this time I flipped shit. In a split decision in one night I told my mom I wanted to live with my real dad who lives in North Carolina. That night I packed a bag and was gone the next morning. When I was leaving my stepdad didn’t say a word to me just stared out the back glass door and didn’t move. I also left another friend I made at that school her name was McKenzie. Oh my god McKenzie was the most amazing girl you could’ve met. She had this personality that was unmatched and she loved everyone. She didn’t judge. I talked to her and was busy chasing her my beginning of junior year. I eventually got to date her but she was just starting her bad place going through stuff with her mom and ex boyfriend. She wasn’t allowed to see me and I could only talk to her at school. But we didn’t have classes together so it was based on a 30 minute window for lunch. Towards the point of me getting caught me and her had a falling out. She was still hung over her ex and the funny thing was it was a long distance relationship. The day before I moved I told her I might be leaving and I would like to speak with her one last time I told her to meet me on one of our school buildings stairs at lunch. She never showed up. I left and went home and got into a argument then packed my bags. Now here I am in North Carolina living with my real dad and stepmom. I’m a senior now but when I first got up here it was starting second semester of junior year then covid scare began to happen. Before covid let out the schools I already had trouble meeting new people at once again a new school. My credits were messed up so my classes were all over the place. And of course being the new kid in the middle of year is definitely not a title you want. No one talked to me. I did find shelter in my jrotc class though. I met this kid named Seth we instantly connected Because are so similar background. He came from Florida also dealing with drug addiction and moved to live with his grandparents. The difference between me and him was he went to rehab I didn’t. When I got there he was the only one that would talk to me. At this point covid started to scare the world and school got let out. Little did I know it wasn’t just for 2 weeks. Junior year was basically over and I’m now living in a abusive household with my stepmom. Not much physically anymore but mentally. It also didn’t help that I had no friends either. Seth was a senior that year so when covid hit over the summer he went to basic for the marines which made us loose touch. I’m proud of him and how he had the dedication to stay clean. I on the other hand was struggling. I got a job and started getting some money and then I fell back into smoking again. They didn’t drug test me up here so I was doing it a lot. When the summer ended and my senior year began it was so shit. All online no interaction with anyone no chance to meet new people. This really hit me hard with depression and loneliness. Idk how many of you guys on here have people to turn to but the feeling of having no one to talk to is astonishingly impactful. It hurts. We started a method of going back to school in person 2 days of the week. But this also didn’t do much since there was 4 kids in a class and we had to social distance so still no communication. My closest friend I had last semester was my history teacher. I love history. I pushed through school and miserably pushed through working a shitty job at McDonald’s with co workers that treated me like shit. When I started smoking again I lost all motivation. i started to talk to Kenzie again after awhile over text. Her ex boyfriend the long distance relationship one didn’t work out the guy was a dick in the end she flew to see him and he never showed. Between this time whenever I would check in with her she was dating someone else but never seemed to work in her favor. We started talking again recently and told her what was going on. At this point I was lazy I felt like I couldn’t function without weed. I stopped on my own terms. I couldn’t do it anymore. I’ve been clean for almost 2 months now. Even though I stopped smoking I still had no motivation. I stopped showing up to work without calling out eventually one day I got a call from my manager saying I had to work and I said I didn’t know and was basically told not to come in anymore. Now me 17 now sober lonely with no friends. I got attached to Kenzie again and I didn’t want to hide it so I told her. We have different paths and we are now a few states away so it wouldn’t work. But I still love her. We still talk but I do wish we could be more then friends. I’m now a senior at a school I hate and I don’t know a single person in my graduating class and no that is not a exaggeration. I just got hired at a new supermarket job the other day and had my first day today actually and it wasn’t so bad. I don’t know what I want to do in life other then move back down to Florida when I graduate. What to do after I do that I have no idea. I don’t see a purpose in me and I have pretty much zero interests at this point but I also refuse to live my life working a basic ass job making minimum wage. I want to be someone. I’ve been sober for a little now other then drinking on New Years but I’m not an alcoholic like I am a pot head. Alcohol I can barely stand so I only drink on special occasions. But here I am lost and confused. I dont know why I’m sharing this but I hope someone will read this and think maybe they don’t have it as bad as they think. It could be worst. I’m looking forward to it getting better. Goodnight guys.

Oh wow you took my advice. I didnt expect to see you here to be honest. I try not giving advice about things I'm not sure about but I promised someone would respond and people dont respond often here to long posts like these. First thing I suggest is telling your father. The chances of a father not caring about your abuse is minuscule especially when going off of your description of him as a good guy. Second about being lost in life, everyone is. I remember a long time ago when I was younger my aunt pressured me into picking a uni to go to. This wasn't something like the 11th grade, it was more like the 8th. When my mom noticed I felt pressured she told me that no one has life figured out. Everyone's life is a mess until the last second. Everyone feels lost in life until you're 30 years old with a family, so dont be nervous.
Of course I’d take your advice. It would also be nice to hear what other people have to say
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kp34vq/i_am_not_sure_what_to_do_now_i_feel_out_of_options/
I am sorry about how long this post is. I have left out a lot to attempt to simplify my situation but it ended up being long anyway. Any advice to anyone who can read this would be great.  I am completely sick of my current life. I am 22F and have never felt happy despite reaching out for help and trying ways to change my lifestyle. I feel that my family is so used to violence in the family and not dealing with it that assaults committed against me aren't taken seriously. I don't have the strength nor the love in my life to continue on like this. I want to be happy but I feel like I am exhausting every option available to me and I am afraid I will run out of alternatives.  I have been assaulted by my older sister twice. Both times over an old laptop I needed to run software for my degree that belongs to my dad that she feels she is entitled to keep despite her having two laptops already. One personal one and another given to her by her company.  I am 22 and she is 25 soon. She has always been an achiever. She has worked as a model in the past and is always in a relationship. She is kind when she needs something and has potential for violence when she needs something, depending on if the kindness is working or not. Generally she is seen as charming by many and did well in a good university, and has a great job in tech consultancy.  I am a bit of the odd one out. I have suffered for a long time due to my introverted and insecure nature. I got into an ok university after repeating my secondary school exams and I am trying my best to get through despite my consistent lows. I have two more years to go and feel pretty overwhelmed with the work in general. I have never had a solid friend or boyfriend for that matter. I don't feel feminine or happy so I find it difficult to pursue relationships of any kind since I feel inferior in every way. My autopilot is to be kind since I know I never want to be mean to someone since I know how damaging it can be to someone's life by personal experience. I realise this is an obnoxious pity party but this is the only way I can communicate how I feel since my family is not accepting of mental health or depression being real.  The first assault happened in my aunt's house in January 2020. I use solidworks for my engineering degree and it was running slowly since at that stage the computer is already 7 years old and pretty beat up, in any case I am glad I have it. I left it in the kitchen since I was getting ready for a ball. This is something I would never do normally, since I am extremely introverted with little confidence, but I felt that it was a way I could finally make some firm friends in university so I built up the courage to go. I was preparing for the CSWA exam so I felt the need to work before hopefully enjoying the ball. It took a long time to get the laptop from her, it was stupid for me to have left it in the kitchen but it was 3pm and she didn't usually finish work until 6pm according to my aunt.  I was planning to leave before 6pm with the laptop so to avoid confrontation but she arrived early and tried to change the password of the laptop and uninstall solidworks. I tried to get the laptop from her. I never touched her but she kept screaming and hitting me over and over again, holding the laptop out of my reach since she is taller. I was so terrified since I am completely unable to defend myself due to years of abuse from her since I was small I couldn't find the strength to fight back. I completely froze, I know its pathetic.  She changed the passwords and gave me the laptop with this grin on her face. She continued to insult the laugh at me as I ran from the house with my other things. I ended up not going to the ball since I was distraught from the events that happed and got a bus and train to my grandmother's house. I made the excuse to people that I had an emergency to take care of so couldn't go anymore. I felt so worthless and pathetic. My uncle and grandmother picked me up from the train station. The shame I felt from taking all the abuse and violence was so intense I couldn't speak. I think I was having a panic attack at the time because I couldn't remember getting onto the train but who knows. I told my grandmother what happened and she was sympathetic to a degree but other than that said that my sister is a piece of work and shouldn't have done what she did. I didn't call my parents or aunt because I wasn't able to speak at the time. My sister got to them first. I don't know what she said to them but I got an angry text from my aunt asking why I had left her house in a mess. Despite it being in a mess when I arrived and not having time to clean before leaving (like I was expected to) due to what had happened. I decided to try and cut both my sister and aunt out of my life at that point. She also called my parents apparently but I guess they didn't believe her or half believed her. When I eventually called my mother she gave a similar speech as my grandmother.  I felt like there was no resolution and nothing said in combat to what my sister did. I certainly wasn't able to plead my case to my parents because they weren't prepared to help me. *Side-note: My mother never told my father about what happened as I assumed she did. Months later it came up in conversation, he was angry for a moment but then nothing was said after. They say since we're adults the problem isn't theirs to solve. I never felt more alone after that. Despite being an "adult" I have never felt more helpless and I know its my fault for being as weak as I am.*  When COVID happened the universities closed at the beginning of march so I had to move out of the off campus accommodation and return home. I live far away from the city in the countryside. My sister still lived with my aunt at that point and I begged my parents to not let her stay at home during the quarantine. They said yes since she had always been cruel to them too. In the end my aunt kicked her out of her house because they were at odds and always arguing. My parents had to take her in. I ended up locking myself either in the spare room to study or my bedroom to sleep for weeks after she arrived. I ate early in the morning or late at night. Despite all this she stole many of my expensive art supplies, generally violated my privacy and insulted me when she got a chance. I felt completely trapped in that house and my mental health was decreasing rapidly with that stress paired with the lack of care from my parents and my challenging degree. I will try my best with my studies but I know they are suffering and I hate myself for it.  She organised a party when the quarantine subsided which coincided with my exams. She was loud despite being asked to be considerate to me. She doesn't care about anyone about herself. She proves this time and time again to my parents but they don't do a thing. I think she might be a sociopath but I don't feel good about diagnosing her since I am not a professional.  The last assault happened when I needed to change settings to update the laptop but she blocked them previously as the admin. I brought the computer down to confront her with my family in the room, hoping I could get some support. She pretended to not remember the password, smiling at me creepily so I decided to give up, restore the computer to its factory settings and install every software again. She snapped similarly to before when I picked the laptop up she hit me hard and grabbed my neck in a headlock, strangling me to the floor. My family just watched until a painful and terrifying few seconds into the strangling when my mother yelled to stop. She let go of me and tried to take the laptop but my mother took it and told her to leave the room. I was so distraught that I felt paralysed again and couldn't speak and kept crying. Just like the first time, which happened several months ago at that point. Again nothing happened to address what happened even with my entire family there watching on. I felt the lowest then as I ever had in my life when nothing was said or done to help me. My mother kept saying that my sister is now in trouble since she has shown them who she really is when I knew myself about her a long time ago.  I decided to leave my parent's house a few months ago and live with extended family. It has been hard feeling unsafe in my family home, I do feel better being away now but I don't feel better about my situation mentally. My mother when we do talk asks me if I want to go home, which is an obvious no while my sister is still there. Currently my younger sister is suffering from mental health difficulties which I hear about a lot. I feel a bit resentful that my parents weren't as sympathetic to me but I will never know what they feel. I am told my older sister is not only being nasty to everyone in the house but also breaking quarantine despite my father being high risk. I will never understand why they don't kick her out. They don't charge her rent so she more than likely has enough money. She has bought a car recently so maybe she is trying to stay at the house until further notice.  Other things happen here where I am staying. A family member has Asperger's syndrome and tried to strangle and kill another family member which is horrifying and only increases my anxiety. I tried to call the police but it happened on new year's eve so they were very busy. I don't think I have anything to fear from him but I am just in general not capable of dealing with anything anymore. I have university exams in the following week and I am sick to my stomach just thinking about doing them.  I guess I should preface that I have been going to a several counsellors for a year now, all through my university who are in high demand so I see them once every fortnight. I am only coming to the realisation now that I am the same weak willed and insecure person I have always been even before the assaults. I feel like I am living a life not my own and I am at a point of complete hopelessness considering I will probably feel this way until I start to make enough money and find a place of my own. Currently my degree is too challenging for me to hold down a job as well as study because I know I am not that capable. I sleep so much and never feel rested. I have never felt good about myself and feel totally at loss of what to do. I am afraid of being a weak pushover for the rest of my life.  I haven't tried medication yet but that won't help my circumstances so I don't feel like that's the best option for me at the moment.

I am a teenage boy and for the last 2-3 years I just feel sad. I only realised it can be depression in the last few months because earlier I told myself that it's nothing and it's gonna pass. I don't really  have anyone to confide in and I just rarely go to bed and say " it has been a good day ". I even thought about suicide but I just don't have the power in me. Therapy isn't really an option and I just feel stucked in an unhappy life forever

When you are depressed, it is normal to think this is gonna be forever. The fact is, it is temporary. I keep telling myself that. Chemicals in your brain does play a role in it. It is “lying” to you.
Would you mind saying why therapy isn't really an option?
It's just that I have always thought it's gonna get better, but now it's just too much. Also this covid phase made my social anxiety kinda go away, but now I am terrified of going to school again and I don't know what to do anymore
Do you have school counseling? I think talking to the professionals will help. Sometimes medication makes a huge difference- it turned my life around.  I know close friends who have had sever depression during teenage years and now they are totally fine. They said at that time they didn’t know better, because life before has always been depressed and they did not know what the future holds. But now they are all high paying professionals and have loving families. I would have never known their depression history unless we discussed the topic. Just take it one day at a time, don’t look at years from now.

Clearly he is emotionally unstable. Has some communication problems.  He is probably unhappy because he doesn't have what he wants or because he doesn't achieve what he wants.

How useless can I be ? Already told the school that I was doing 50% and now i can't even do it in a reduced rythme, Studying is exhausting after 10 minutes and I get panic attacks because i can't remember anything. Add to that the fact that i'm behind on half the semester because I would rather skip school and wonder aimlessly around. How much longer am I gonna drown myself in self pity, setting myself up for failure because i'm too weak to face any adversity ? It's frustrating, saddening and tiring to see myself in this way but i can't even see how I could improve my conditions.

I've just lost another relationship. This one really hurts. I've known this person for a long time and I really love them, but they're no longer talking to me. They were my last relationship, and now I'm entirely alone. We got into a disagreement. We have had many good interactions aside from that. I feel blindsided. I feel like I've been thrown away like a piece of trash. I really need a friend. I really need to feel like I'm not an inherently flawed, worthless, unlovable piece of shit. I hurt so much. What is so wrong with me that no one will ever love me? Please tell me what I did to deserve this because I want to fix it. I'm so tired. Oh God, please help me.

Hey, I am not the best with words, so I am not sure I will be able to do much throug this text. There is one thing however: I am going to give you an award, and I want you to know why. I don't do this because this post is funny, or nice, or whatever else you would imagine to be a reason for giving an award, but because you sound like you need support. And since I can't give you a shoulder pat I will give you this award. I know it is a free award and might not seem worth much, but see it atleast as a sign that we care about you. Stay strong, even if you lost all contact to friends and are completely alone. You are not lost yet.   If you need any help we will be there for you.
.
Losing a meaningful relationship can be brutal.  Some people seem to be resilient to it and go about their business like it hardly happened.  Other people fall into a pit of despair after the loss and it can be tough to get out.  Believe me, I hear you, and find myself in a similar position.  There isn't any one thing you can do to feel any better about it.  People will tell you that time heals, which is great, but doesn't ease the pain.  What I can say is that relationships fail for all kinds of reasons.  It doesn't mean that you are worthless or unlovable.  A relationship that starts off strong may be fueled by excitement, physical attraction, etc., eventually levels off.  After that leveling off and time goes on, fronts are dropped and you get a chance to see who that person really is, how they live their life, their values, their faults, their priorities, their needs.  And they learn that about you.  Maybe these things don't align and one of you decides they would rather find someone that aligns better.  That doesn't say anything about who you are. It just means you haven't aligned with the right person yet.  Think of it this way... there are a ton of people in the world right now that are single or divorced.  That means that every single relationship that those people have had in their lives has failed to last.  Are ALL those people unlovable?? Of course not.  They just haven't found someone that meshes well.  Disagreements happen, and in my case, happened a lot and tempers flared and there was a lot of pain.  Relationships shouldn't be painful.  They require work, but it shouldn't be constant repair work.  I'm suffering a huge loss right now, but I think it's for the best.  I'm going to mourn the death of this part of my life for a while.  I'm going to try to eat enough and get some exercise, and spend some reflecting on what I did right, and what I did wrong, and what they did right and wrong, and try to improve myself for the next stage in my life.  I'm going to get some therapy to talk about some things with a professional.  After the dust settles, I am comfortable where I am at in life and I have my affairs in order, then I will get back on the horse and be open to trying a new relationship.  For now, I am going to work on refreshing some relationships with friends that went slack over the years, and try to get involved in doing things that interested me before but didn't do because of my relationship.  It's lonely here, but I know it's not a permanent feeling.  It's in my power to take action and guide my life in the direction that I want it to go.
Me too. I need more people to talk with.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kp85zs/i_had_to_bury_my_covid_positive_grampa_by_myself/
Hello, i'm a first time poster. English isn't my first language. I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub or if i'm following etiquette, it's late at night, i'm distraught and i thought i might find some help here.   My grampa was 77 when he passed away on the 17th of december 2020. He was suffering from depression turned dementia (that is how the medics explained it) and had cerebral atrophy going on on his last MRI test. In his last days he was also found positive with covid, despite not coming in contact with anyone, besides me and my mom, and we both work from home. When he died at home, (because again, no covid symptoms) it was simply because he had deteriorated very fast over the course of just one month. He spoke rarely before and now he'd become nonverbal, actively refused food and water, refused to leave his bed and so on. We're most certain though that he was still lucid, because he recognized and understood my mom, nodding to her questions, holding and kissing her hand, saying her name and so on. So, we basically just theorized that he'd just given up on life and wanted to join my grandma who passed away a year before from cancer.   When he died i was left to take care of the funeral. It was a shitshow and fucking awful. The morning of i called an ambulance to notice the time of death. Because he was theoretically in quarantine and positive, we had the police and investigators at our house, since it was a suspicious death. It took me nearly half of day to find a funeral home who would take him in. Paperwork that was supposed to come out in 6 hours lasted for 12 because people were incompetent and didn't knew the procedure. The police report said some false statements that made the process even more complicated. I had to drive to all the institutions, buy the funeral clothing, pay for all arrangements, covid suits, post mortem 'clean-up' (whatever the fuck that means...), announce relatives, find a priest and all the other details i can't remember right now. I was alone in this because i tested negative and only had my partner to help me. It all stretched over the course of 2 days where i barely slept or ate properly.   Eventually it was all done. The funeral was very small, barely 8 people including the priest, and it was very rushed. i live in a slavic country, the funerals here are 3 days long and full of religious rituals, but this one lasted roughly 15 minutes. It really devastated my mom and, even though i'm not religious, it felt very wrong to have someone die like this.   The thing is... people seem to overall pity my grandpa. He was old, widowed, had mental illnesses and didn't get a proper burial. And while i agree these all are awful things there is some part of me who can't help but feel like he deserved it. He was not a good man. He was proud, stubborn and narcissistic. In his youth he never allowed my grandma to work so she'd depend on him. He'd be unfaithful and abusive towards her. He raised my mom and her brother (my uncle) with an iron first and fear. When my mother married my dad and had me, my grandpa somehow assumed the 'man of the house' role because my father was a sailor and often worked abroad many months at a time. He always had a problem with my father because of his upbringing (dad was from a rural village, granpa was a city man) and he would call me father names. He would often cause problems between my parents to the point they considered divorce 10 years ago.   The biggest thing was probably when we sold our old house. My mom had ownership over 3/4s of the property, while my grandpa had 1/4s, but he demanded that they split the money in half otherwise he's not agreeing to sell. This was about hundreds of thousands of euro, in the time before the 2008 economic crises. The ironic part is that my grandpa melted through the money in a couple of years, buying an excessively big house, going on vacations and spending on his son, mom's brother, whom was the golden child. All this time my parents said nothing, took half of the money, paid off debts and finished the house we are living now in, as the decent human beings they are.  I know all of this because i was old enough to see it and from all the things my parents and other members of the family told me throughout the years.   But since Karma is apparently a thing, mom's brother left a few years back to work in another country after divorcing his wife and leaving behind 2 kids. This majorly threw all of my grandparents plans off because they relied on his to take care of them in their old age (they had some sort of verbal agreeing about this). Now that they were alone, they turned to my mom, dad and myself to help them.   Which brings us to today. I feel... weird. I had spent a good chuck of the last few years trying to help my grandparents. I had scarified the last month of my life trying to help my quarantined mom and grandpa while still maintaining a full time job. As i saw his deteriorate i felt pity, but not a whole lot more. It hurt more to see my mom suffer because of it, since it's her father after all, bad blood and everything. But me? I don't know what to feel. I watched this man slowly die over the course of a month and i barely felt a thing. I went to the morgue to recognize him and was only a bit disgusted by seeing a dead body. I did everything i could to better the burial and i just sat there while people cried around me. The few times i did cry was because i was tired and exhausted. Each time i cried i'd 'talk' to him in my head saying things like 'there, this is what you get for living the life you did, why did you have to be such a shitty person, why do i have to make sure you're being taken care of when you did so much damage in your life?"  I don't know what's happening to me right now, but a few weeks later i'm still losing sleep. I still feel resentment towards a dead man, i am still stressed, i feel guilty about my feelings. I know i did everything right, and i did not let any of my bad feelings show through to anyone besides my partner, whom i trust with my life. So why do i feel so much guilt? I legit feel like this person got the ending they deserve, but someone i'm still not ok with that? I feel like...i don't know, like they had so many chances to make things right and they never did. To my knowledge, my grandpa never apologized, not even once to my parents, not even in a veiled form. When he began to mentally deteriorate, he just adopted this frail man person and everyone had to help him because 'look at him, this poor old, alone man'. Thinking about this hypocrasy makes...makes my blood boil. But it doesn't give me peace.   I want to go into therapy because i am so confused by why i feel so guilty and depressed. It's getting worse because i cannot find real joy in the things i used to love doing and i am dreading going back to work (i am a school teacher). I feel utterly confused and angry with how unstable i'm becoming over something that shouldn't be that important. A not so good man passed away in a not so good way like he deserved so... why can't i accept that?  I don't know what i'm looking for in this sub... maybe just to rant or some advice please? I'm sorry this is so long but i'm not very coherent right now. Therapy isn't really available for me right now so i'm looking for solutions wherever i can because i feel like this is a dangerous thing to spiral into since i have a bit of history with mental health.    So... what do i do? Is it ok to feel like this? Am i a bad person for thinking like this about another human being? Anything, any sort of reply is welcomed...

I'm in the process of figuring out what's causing what in my mental health picture.  I saw a psychiatrist in the summer because I have trouble focusing on anything that doesn't really interest me (namely: work!). He suggested that I try a stimulant med and then an SSRI if that didn't help.  I also have GAD, possible OCD, and almost certainly depression.  The stimulant (Concerta) made me extremely depressed. So the ADHD guy sent me back to the psychiatrist.  Now I've started the SSRI and (although it's very early days) I feel like my focus/concentration is already a little better. Today, I finished an entire book — which I haven't done in a while (I literally have 8 half read books by my bedside).  Has anybody had issues with concentration and focus that looked a lot like ADHD but ultimately turned out to be nothing more than symptoms of depression?

I don't understand how I can come out of my depression, feel like the world is so beautiful and new and that I'll never be the same again, and then exactly one trigger later I am rocking back and forth on the floor trying to convince myself that life is worth it and I won't always feel so alone. I'm just tired, I don't want to feel this weak forever. I don't want to give up over and over again. I don't want every relationship to chip away at me until there is nothing left to give. I can't understand why I feel so fragile.

Me too. I can’t pretend to know exactly how it feels for you because we’re both individuals but I have and am currently experiencing a mental health crisis as well. I feel trapped in my own head. We’ve got to find a way out. Everyone deserves happiness
That how it be innit. I'm sorry you've been having a rough time too.
I am completely down too. I have many problems and everything is a mess inside my head and around me.   I am praying every day for the better...
This is me right now. I was on a high leading into December, and with Christmas and now in a new year, I've suddenly dropped very quickly.   I have awesome things happening yet this sadness... It continues. Crying outburts have happened again and the hurt/headaches in my head are so painful. I just want it to go away.
I’m not sure how to put it this way but the more you endure the more you become stronger,I always give up on certain things because I am fed up on giving up,but then again you still have a fighting chance while you’re here in this subreddit.
Yep. You think you’re doing fine and then the ground drops out from under you.
Yeah I don’t want to be here either majority of the time, the bad outweighs the good
I hope things get better for you...again. I deal with the same thing. Diagnosed with major depression two years ago and have been going through a roller coaster ever since. When I was on medication my lows were short lived, two to three days at most. Now that I’m not on meds the lows last 2-3 weeks at a time and are awful. Hoping I can get back on meds soon. Hoping this low will end soon. I’m just trying to keep busy. Even if it’s something small like wiping surfaces, getting off the couch for a short walk, watching an episode or two of a new show. Baby steps is what everyone keeps telling me. Maybe that can help you.
Lamotrigine
I'm hoping the best for you.
Thank you.
I'll pray for you, too.
I'm sorry for your pain, I hope it passes quickly.
Thank you
I hope things turn around for you soon.
Thank you. I hope things turn around for you, too.
Thank you :( same to you OP
For me these cycles personally last about a few days at a time. It's small stupid triggers too, makes me kind of embarrassed to admit. I hope you get out your current rut and eventually find stability.
Thank you, friend! God bless you and your family!
Thank you. I'm hoping it passes as fast as possible.
Hope things get better for you too

No.  My father is a wonderful human being and I still have to deal with depression.  And forgiving people to find peace is bollocks. I have found much more peace from cutting out people then I ever have by forgiving them and allowing them to return to my space. As harsh as it sounds, some of my best decisions in life has been cutting certain people out.
No it is not. Depression isn’t situational. You can feel depressed without having depression.

It's more than 8 months now sitting in my room, endlessly scrolling on my screen, sometimes trying to be productive and sometimes procrastinating. I used to think I was an Ambivert but all this time maybe changed me to a complete introvert (it isn't bad ik). Earlier, I used to connect my friend circle with ease and kinda was always in limelight because of my humor. Now, I'm missing that connection I'm not able to text my friends idk what to talk about, i have really great friends they care about me but I'm not able to have a convo regularly! I want to talk to them but i don't feel like sending texts! I am not good on video calls and voice calls! All i do is crack one line jokes and share memes on group chats. I want to meet my friends who are just few miles away but i don't feel like going out. I don't feel accomplished. I'm overthinking, constantly reflecting on myself and feeling pathetic for not getting a girlfriend all my life (20 years)! What should i do? I feel sad and lonely a lot of times! I really want to change my lifestyle!   PS: English isn't my first language so pardon me for errors.

Im the same way. Im an extrovert and due to health problems (literally a cold almost sent me to a hospital cuz my lungs werent getting enough air) I have stayed inside for most of 2020. I hate it. I cant get myself to be productive or to do anything of meaning. Ive been asked what my binge shows were and I didnt even have one, i sit in bed staring at the same reddit posts from hours ago waiting for a new one. As an extrovert without many meaningful friendships, Im just constantly disconnected. I found that forcing myself to sit up and watch something helps, just as long as I am not in bed. I found that sitting in common spaces helps (like the kitchen or living room). I found that doing super low effort versions of my hobbies helps (like id doodle on a sticky note, or pick horribly on my guitar). I hope these can help you too. Somehow, these things help me feel more connected. Its hard, but maybe force yourself to message a friend hry every couple or so days, just to check up on them, too. The worst of it is sparking yourself up to do something

"comfort is death and pain is success"
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kolk4a/nothing_holds_my_attention_anymore/
I realized I haven't been doing anything for a long time. I was a full time student and a full time employee since March and I have been living with my boyfriend since July. I decided to take a break from school since I just finished my AA and my mental health has been rocky. My last course ended December 20th and I went straight into holiday prep after that. Now that the holidays are over and my work load at my job has lightened I realize I haven't been doing anything I enjoy and I can't keep entertained by anything. Essentially I am in a pretty bad bout of depression now that all of my stressors have disappeared. I feel like I am only working, spending time with my boyfriend until he goes to work and then sleeping. I don't even know how to pull myself out of this. I try doing something I love and it feels like a huge chore. Even the realization that I haven't been doing anything for myself makes me feel worse about it. I don't know if this is a depression thing or if it just worsened my depression but I feel like a shell.  How can I start taking care of myself and doing what  I enjoy again and enjoying it?

Start by making sure you are drinking plenty of  clean, filtered water every day. Get plenty of  sleep. 85% of all growth hormones, which replenishes the mind and body, occurs during sleep, specifically during REM sleep, ( dream state).  Get some exercise by walking in fresh air and exercise your heart and lungs to oxygenate your blood.  Stop  drinking or smoking  weed if you are doing that.  Eat a nutritious diet, cut back and cut out junk food especially refined sugars and carbs and food loaded with  refined sugar.  There are natural remedies for depression found online and health food stores, however be careful if/ what you select , because if you are taking an   prescribed anti-depressant, the natural plant product might not work or have undesired side affects.  Lastly, if you are not doing it, consider keeping a journal for your thoughts and ideas. This helps open up the creative channels and taps into imagination which opens doors to new ideas.  Good luck!
After a long time stressor is gone it can make you feel quite depressed instead of relieved. You were on edge all this time  and it's what kept you awake and going. Now it feels like there's nothing and you have no goal, no purpose. It's a different train of life, and you're not used to it. There's also the possibility that you're burned out by that stressor.  Try to make little plan lists for the next day, do small things that make you pround and build back up your confidence and life from there. When you go for those plans, try not to force it too much, try to be kind and patient to yourself like you would a child. It takes time to get back. Try to find small things that you enjoy.  Like... just a cup of hot water with milk, almond, honey and vanilla (that's what I'm having right now hehe). Yea I know it won't cure your depression... but mabye a cup here, a cleaned room tomorow, a pizza! A [smile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9jDgPsU_YvmeI_td7LXI1Q) from someone else. Just small things, they won't cure you sure, but maybe it can help, step by step.  It may not only be the stressor affecting you. It may also be physically related. Ask a doctor for a blood test.

We entered 2021. Take a seat, breath in, and read this. It might be a little long, but I hope, worth it.     We entered 2021. Its a new year, new month, new beginning. Which means, its a new chance for all of you. All of us.  Today's January,  1st.  Take a pencil, or a marker,  and make a list of things you hated in 2020. Make a list about people who you want to cross over and kick out in 2021. Toxic ones, if you know what I mean. Go outside, breath in, and burn it.  Make that the last time, you thought about them. People we left, and people who left us in 2020, aren't supposed to be in our lives anymore. I'm saying this, because I had to let go some of them, and it hurts, but you can do it too.  Find a mirror, and look at yourself. Smile, and say good morning, or good night.  Compliment yourself, even if its hard. Even if it feels wrong to you at this moment.  Remember, if thered anything you don't like on yourself, you can always change it, relax.  Listen to good music, and read books. Write about the things you feel, make post it walls in your room. Hug your siblings, mom, or dad. Boyfriend or girlfriend,  best friend. Even, if your pet is the only living  being that you trust.  Hug yourself.  Everything we go through, we go through for a reason,and everything will pass. We all cried ourselves to sleep, and smashed mirrors, glasses with hands. We screamed  from the bottom of our lungs, and cursed everything, thinking we're damned for being like this. But recovery is possible  and we'll be alright.  Its a new year, so give yourself a chance. Get a fish, and try to smile as much as you can. Get tattoos, and dye your hair. Find yourself again, because that person is deep inside of you. Flourish.  On your own. With the support of people in real life, or over Internet. Everyone is fighting a battle, and there has to be someone who will understand us. Family is always deep down scared of it, but we have each other.  Give yourself a chance, because you deserve it. I'll make you private Spotify playlist  and if you ever want to talk, pm me here, and I'll leave you my social media, so you can text me, or call me. I'll even drop you motivational quotes every day you wake up. I'll try to help you, and give you reasons to live, and love this life, if you ever lack reasons.  Stay strong, and happy new year,  Love, random 21 year old girl.

Thanks for this really kind words. sadly I have some big problems with the things you wrote. I can't look at a mirror and smile. I know what I am and I know how much I want it to change. I don't hate me, but I also cant accept what I am at the moment.  &#x200B;  How can I find myself? I feel like nothing more like an empty Vessel only capable of doing things everyone around me wants me to do. There are no instructions or something comparable on how to find my "true self". I only want some basic things. Why can't I have more friends? I don't the sort of friends you can tell everything and trust blindly. I mean this sort of friends wich wants to go to the next party with you. Friends wich rip you out of your own little miserable life and make a better life even possible.  I want a girlfriend which understands me and helps me with my life. Someone who loves me for who I am with all my flaws and everything I would be capable to give her... But who am I to demand something like this...  &#x200B;  But still, thanks.  love, also random 21 year old boy
Thank you! :(

My birthday is in four days. My mom has been especially nasty on my birthday every year and I've hated it since my grandpa died two days before. You can not convince me this time of year if nothing but garbage no matter how hard you try.

So as long as I can remember my life has been pretty much shit. This has led to depression. But now I feel like I just don't feel anymore. I'm not sad, happy, excited, or anything. I'm just here. When I was 12 I tried to end it for the first time, and it was a failed attempt. Well 10 years later and I know that I am going to end it successfully one day. I'm not sad about it. I'm not worried or anything. At this point I've wanted to die for the past 10 to 15 years and it's normal to me now and it's just something I know is going to happen. I know I won't do it right now or soon but I will when I'm older. Maybe in my 30's. Am I the only one out there like this? Am I the only one that could hang myself right now without a second thought or a tear to shed?

I'm sorry to read that this has affected you for so long.  I don't have long term depression but have experienced situational depression and I know it can feel like there is nothing in life worth engaging.  The weight of the depression is just too heavy.  Do you currently have support for this?  Do you have family and friends that know about this?
Know. I'm from the deep south so anything mentally wrong with men makes you a pussy or causes you to be bullied.
Understood.  The rest of the country says differently and having depression doesn't make you a pussy any more than having the flu does.  It happens, and it happens to a lot of people.  The up side is, there is plenty of support out there, I wager even in the deep south, and you don't have to live your life this way, thinking about how or when to end it.  Reach out to someone.  Google therapists in your area and make a couple phone calls.  It's the least you can do for yourself and a phone call will start a process that may change your life.

Okay so ima use this post to call myself out, I’ve not properly washed in 3 weeks, I normally love to exfoliate and tan and shave but I’ve done none of it in forever I’ve eaten nothing but quesadillas and noodles in the same amount of time, my room is a total mess although I’ve managed to keep on top of my house overall, I’ve not text a single friend back in two weeks and I’ve let my teeth go to absolute shit.. I feel totally overwhelmed with how much I have to do to even get myself clean and not gross anymore.. I can’t sleep at night so I’m going to sleep at 7am and wakening up super late, by then I don’t even feel like getting myself clean or dressed because it’s pretty much already night time. I need a more adulty adult to help me put down a routine and stick to it please❤️

Start with one thing at a time... I’ll call it a snowball method. It’s hard to stick to a routine if you do it all at once.  I know how debilitating it can all be. I’ve dealt with depression for all of my adult life and a bit before, and I know even the smallest thing can seem like a monumental task. I still struggle.  But the little things help me feel a bit better about myself, so I try to make it a point to get those smaller victories.  Let’s start today with brushing your teeth. Floss if you have it, but even just brushing once in the morning and once at night is all you need to do.  For me, I try to make showering therapeutic. It sounds pretty silly, but I like to think of my crappy feelings sitting at the surface of my skin, and taking a shower washes it away for a bit. I find it oddly does help, and I end up taking longer showers because I do feel better for it.  I try to keep my beard short because it grows really quickly, but a similar thing—I think of it as getting rid of some of the negative feelings. And it works because I do think i look a bit better and feel more comfortable.  As for diet, what I eat can really affect my overall feeling. I try to mix in some fruits or veggies—and if I’m in a rut, I try to take a multivitamin now and again because i know I’m missing out on some stuff.  Sleep is my biggest problem and has been a lifelong struggle. I feel good when I wake up early, but I’m not a morning person and take forever to get to sleep with the obsessive thoughts. Reading helps—I get a bit meditative and pass out.   But we’ll start with one thing. Brush your teeth at least once today. Two minutes. That’s all you need.
Make short to do lists! I like to make mine just for 1 day at a time when I wake up. Put like 2 things to start. Maybe shower & brush your teeth. Those are the only 2 things you HAVE to do for that day. Get them done & check them off when you do. It will make you feel accomplished! You can have the same list for  a few days to help you get in the routine, then slowly add more things when you feel you can handle it. I make sure to give myself 1 day a week without a to do list though so I don't start feeling too overwhelmed.
Having somone sleep with you is best... but it's not always possible.  Else, a plushie can really helps with the sleeping. Consider leaving lights on for very diffult nights or perhaps breathing some outside fresh cold air.  I suggest to keep a routine and always wake up at the same hour to get your circadian rythm used to it.
I am literally in the exact same situation. I'm sorry I can't offer any advice, but just know that you are not alone.
The other commenters have good suggestions.  The sleeping problem is something you can address, but it may not be very fun for a week.  You need to reset your internal clock.  That means getting up a little earlier each day, even if its in the afternoon, so you can fall asleep a little earlier each night.  It might take a week or two to shift your sleep time a reasonable amount, but it works.  While you are doing this, add somethings to help you get into sleepy mode at a reasonable time.  Sleep aiding hot tea, melatonin, lose the phone a couple hours before bed, soft sleeping sounds in the background... lots of youtube videos of rain and thunder or waves on a beach or whatever.  They work great.  I agree 100% with the shower.  It's not just to rid your body of dirt and oil.  It's relaxing and warm.  Put some music on and let enjoy the steam like a soul cleansing.
The overall vibe of your message was just complete understanding, thank you so so much. I really needed somebody who just gets it and you totally do, thank you for not judging me. You’re right, all I need is two minutes, I spend so much time overthinking it all that I’ve failed to notice the simplicity and you’ve really helped with that. Could honestly cry at the kindness you’ve shown a total stranger online, thanks again✌️
Thank you, as well. It’s been a tough few days, so your thanks means a lot to me and has honestly made my week.   Please feel free to message if I can help in any way, even if it’s just lending an ear. I know how isolating it can feel.

I've always felt alone and had friends/ppl to go to most of the time but recently I was betrayed by the person who i thought I could trust the most my "girl"friend of 6 months and we were friends for 2 months prior, starting in may I talked to 2 people on a pixelmon server a few weeks later one of them stops playing so I try to talk to the other person more(the betrayer) because I feel bad for their friend kinda just leaving them and we completely hit it off we had the same interests outside of just pokemon and minecraft, in early July I make a move and we get together we get really attached and talk to each other alot I always have a feeling something's up like life's going too smooth I'm feeling happy and like I have a purpose then my depression gets worse and we start drifting apart by December we're no longer together but still friends, on December 27th late at night they message me saying they're actually a guy and have been lying to me and friends this whole time so I naturally flip out and tell him to leave my life, the next day I message him saying I'm sorry and that I wanna help him(he's told me alot of things that made me feel bad for him and I don't like abandoning damaged people) so we try to be friends we check up on each other a couple times a day and stuff, today I cut him off because it didn't feel like he was putting much effort in and it never really felt like he did whenever, most of his responses were just idk or sorry my final words were "maybe you are just a disappointment" cus I wanted to leave a final sting but I feel like a complete piece of shit and have been told it's reasonable but still feel bad about it, sorry if this doesn't make much sense I'm incredibly flustered and don't know what to do/who I can trust anymore

It seems like you have been through many challenges. I am sorry this has been happening in your life. I understand the betrayal was a significant blow, I have been through a similar situation where I felt it was my duty to keep in contact with someone who wasn't good for me for fear of them hurting themselves. Just remember that sometimes you have to prioritise your own mental health. It is kind that you tried and don't feel bad how things ended since every event of our lives is a learning experience. You are not a piece of shit. Take some time to yourself to watch a movie/listen to music/speak to a trusted family member or counsellor to ease your mind a little.

You're a young teen which means you still have a chance to take care of your teeth. Start brushing, flossing and using listerine daily. I have bad gums from eating poorly and not taking care of my teeth that good as a teen.
Your depression about your teeth is understandable, as our appearance is important to us and no one wants trouble in our mouths (we use them so much!).  The bright side to this is that this is entirely within your control to fix.  Brushing and flossing isn't fun.  But it only take a minute of your time and your future self will thank you.  Some people luck out and don't go to the dentist for 20 years and are fine.  Most people have to work at it and get regular cleanings and take care of their teeth at home.  This is something you are just going to have to do.  Make it a routine.  Do not skip a single day of oral hygiene.  Ever.

Man, that sucks. I had a birthday party about 10 years ago, and no one showed up. It hurt like hell.  I'm sorry.
It's not such a big deal, I felt ok sitting home and doing nothing. Don't take it too personal. Everyone was tired probably.  It was a night like any other nights.   Happy new year!
I hope the new year gets better for you and I am sorry that happened. I know I am just a random person online but I am glad you had the will to post this here. I send you good wishes of better days ahead and if you want to talk I am willing to listen. Happy new years.
Please don't mind my bad English...  People just don't understand how much some company could mean to someone. Especially after us taking in some efforts to organise and yet they ditch us in the last minute....   My advice: in my life I have had people ditch me for everything they forget to call me or forgot I've invited them... So after a point, I lost hope and so I stopped caring. I only wished someone would respect me for who I am... I lost hopes in people. I stopped putting in efforts to talk to people, even though I'm extroverted... And one person was be there for company. He was the one true friend who actually cares and understood that I need to talk to people... Also, After I discovered Reddit. I find some comfort in talking about loneliness...   If you still do feel lonely... Distraction works as temporary fix to prevent your mind from spiralling out of control and falling into anxiety or depression... Distraction like Tv series, movies, coding, art work, poetry, learning languages (like I am learning English) etc etc.  Hope this helps you brother/sister, we are all there for you!!! Be brave and wait till you find the right person who deserves you!!!
Dont take it too personally (even though easier said than done). I just sat alone watching tv all night in my thoughts and and random moments of anxiety from those thoughts if that makes you feel any better.
sending endless love to you
That must have felt awful!   I tried to make some plans with a few friends and they were responsive, but I was feeling exhausted and didn't really end up planning something. I feel terrible that I didn't, but I just simply couldn't, didn't have the energy.  This year was awful to many. I am sure people have their own set of problems. If it really bothers you, use cognitive therapy on yourself, brainstorm why they may not have joined your party other than they didn't want to. For example: they didn't want to dress up, they needed to attend family parties etc.  It is a new year. Make a new year's resolution to be kind to yourself.
i'm sorry you were alone. you have some digital company here.
Don’t worry I sometimes feel left out too,Although they either are just busy and may mean well,The thing about it is that if you feel lonely remember that there are people around you around this subreddit,And I know parties do suck alone but everybody’s trying hard this quarantine! Take care! :).
Happy.new year brother. God bless.  That said, dump that whore.
I feel like i am supposed to show you this https://youtu.be/dfGgUww6uFU i think it can help a lot of others on here suffering with depression and other crappy stuff going on in their life. Im really sorry your party didn’t turn out ❤️
When I was on first or second grade only one of my classmates showed up to my party.  My sister and I had all our parties together because we have a 1year and 2 days difference between us.   She got so many gifts and I didn't.    Ouch
Same bro. That was the last party I ever willingly hosted. (Me and my mom share a bday, so there were other “bday” parties, but I don’t really count them since I never wanted them nor invited anyone)
My friends forgot my birthday last year, and I don't have a lot of friends to begin with

I feel like I’m doing everything in my power to fight my depression but I don’t see results. I go to the gym everyday. I do chores, mostly working on my moms yard because were clearing a forest in her yard. I try to take care of myself by grooming myself well. I recently left the military and started a job part time while I go to school so I have goals and plans. Whenever I get the chance I go do new things and try to get out as much as possible. My best friend and his girlfriend are always there for me to hang out with and I take full advantage of having some support other than family. I talked to a psychiatrist and got prescribed antidepressants which I’ve been on for 3 months now. I don’t think I’m unattractive but I was recently told I might move too fast and have sex as soon as I start talking to someone. Maybe possibly the reason I’ve never been in a serious relationship? I do feel like I want to be with someone romantically but usually anyone I start to talk to i end up just hooking up with and It dying off or just dying off before we get anywhere. But I’m mainly just trying to get my mind right and be happy on my own. I feel like im doing everything in my power to feel good and fight depression but anytime im not constantly occupying myself I keep thinking about how easy it would be to just kill myself and I’m starting to physically hurt when I get these emotions. I don’t think I ever would but the thought is always there. I’m constantly feeling alone like I cant truly connect with people other than my best friend but there’s only so much that he can do. I try to socialize with people but half the time I don’t know what to say but I just try to be nice and compliment people when I can. I really have no idea why I feel so alone and miserable and I don’t want this to be the way I start the new year.

hey r/depression_help.   i'm 21 years old and i am struggling with depression.   i have difficulty with reaching out to my friends because my depression thoughts always tell me that they secretly think i'm a burden. i often try to push my friends away by insisting that they are better off without me.   one of my friends is so tired of this that after an incident in which i tried pushing them away in September we agreed to take a break until i have addressed this in therapy (i have, but so far i feel like my therapist hasn't been able to help me out in any concrete ways).    i am very depressed but i really want to get better for my friend's sake, or at least learn how to cope with these thoughts so they don't ruin my friendship.   so, what are some no-nonsense ways i can cope with the idea that everyone would be better off without me?

I would think it would be better not to cope with that thought that isn't even true.  Depression happens to a lot of people, and your friends are your friends for a reason.  They like you and want to spend their precious time on this earth in your company.  They aren't better off without you, but some people do not know how to be supporting to someone with depression.  That is why there are therapists, and a lot of them at that!  You should reach out to a professional so you can sit down and talk about what's going on.  In the meantime, keep in touch with your friends.  Friends don't grow on trees and you should keep the ones you have close to you.
I don’t know about no one missing me, but, I do know what “I didn’t choose to be here” feels like. Maybe it can translate to what you’re experiencing.   Maybe they won’t miss you, but they will know you are gone forever. Your absence will be more keenly felt than your distance.
thank you, friend.   i think that's the thing that i have to remember beneath everything else; i have to remember that there is a reason why my friends choose to spend time with me; they truly want to spend their time with me.

No matter how much I read about how to change my life, how i should make the first step, all the inspirational bullshit, everything just leads to me sitting there, at home, realizing that the real reason I'm not getting anywhere is my lack of motivation. And there isn't a single fucking thing to get time motivated. I hate it so much. I feel like I have some ludacris combination of complexes and mental illnesses that i can't make anything out of myself. I always try to be better than everyone, have an inferiority complex, suffer from some stupid depression and am too stubborn or have "too much pride" to even think about the normal ways to cope with it. I don't want to go a therapist and even if, I'd only want the medication. I don't want to do anything, or rather I CANT DO ANYTHING.   I'm so pissed, everything i read about relationships, jobs, goals, achievements in life, everything reminds me of how I won't reach anything because I just can't. I won't write a book, i won't be an actor, I won't become some MMA-fighter, i won't get anywhere and i can't do anything about it. I hate it so fucking much.  My family pisses me off, school pisses me off, that I'm bad a video games, literally the ONLY THING I DO,  pisses me off. I just hate that I am how i am but I can't change it. Everything takes conscious effort but I can't even THINK about making a "first step". I hate that life or genes or whatever fucked me over like that.

Ayo I know how you feel, am riddled with ADHD and I can’t concentrate on anything. I try and try, only way I can is if I’m drugged up, but I hate the fact that I have to take meds in order to be deemed as “normal”. Just wanted to let you know that you ain’t the only one mate and that they’re others that you can talk to
Honestly, i never really understood why people think it helps knowing that "you're not the only one", great, other people feel horrible too, cool. No offense btw
Nah I get it is cool

Everyone's just scrolled past 8 memes about depression and wanting to die in the last 10 minutes, why should my story capture them?

I (28 M) went through depression in 2020. English is not my first language, sentences might be constructed differently. I took therapy sessions and was able to recover a bit. I told what had happend to my close college friends. These are the people with whom i have celebrated everything since 2011. When i went through therapy, i saw how they were involved in breaking my self confidence, things like, i had a hairline fracture on my left ankle and complete bedrest for 2 weeks, these people went for a road/ bike trip without telling me, i got to know from facebook. Other thing i can remember is them never priorotizing what i wanted to do. I kind of agreed to what they always wanted.  During therapy i reflected and realized all this.  When i told them that i got diagnosed with depression, two of them basically told me that i have everyrhing and have no right or reason to be depressed. When i discussed this with another friend from that group, he proceeded to tell others what i had said, thus breaking trust even more. It got made fun of. I got to know when one of them was talking to another and his phone was on loudspeaker and this topic came up, i understood right away that what it was about and what might have happend in the background.  I have had some really good moments with them during the years, now, i don't want to even see them. I had not spoken to them since october 2020, on 31 st decemeber evening, my phone rang, and they invited me to a house party at night. I refused then and did not go. In the morning of 1st Jan, yesterday, i decided to visit them as we all had been together for all new years since 2011.  I had taken a solo trip recently to calm my mind a bit, it got made fun of when i met them and some mean stuff was said, all disguised as humour. I has a anxiety attack later yesterday. Its my birthday tomorrow and they want to meet me, whereas i really don't. I don't want to lie to them about this, but i am not sure how to tell them that - while they are good for each other, they are not good for my mental health.  How to convey this, please help.

I see a therapist who treats suicidal people. He always says that when people say “I want to die” it’s a metaphor for “I want to live.” It’s a case of mistaken identity and you can’t logic your way out of it because logic didn’t get you INTO it. He recommends watching movies like the Truman show, making a list of the clues Truman had, and then writing a list for yourself in your own life that your life might not be YOUR life, much the same way as in the movie. Differentiating between your true self and your false self. Not sure if this makes any sense whatsoever but you need to contextualize and conceptualize what you’re in right now in order to get out of it and metaphorically kill yourself without LITERALLY killing yourself.
I know this is going to sound terribly cliche, but you have so much life ahead of you. I’m in my 40s and I’ve made some poor decisions and now I’m stuck. But not you. You can still build the life you want.
Do you like sunsets or sunrises? They help me when I'm at my lowest. Just watching them and the colors changing.
I think this could be very helpful imo. I'll do it and maybe OP will give it a try too. Thank you
Nah. I don’t want to make it to my 40’s or see what “life is ahead of me”
They don’t really help tbh. Thank you though.

It seems like every person I know, whenever I wanna share my interests, or just share something funny, they don't care, like outright tell me they don't care, but someone else will talk about the same thing or show them the same thing, and they're invested. But then they get mad when I stop caring about what they have to talk about. I just don't know what to do anymore

I suggest that you stop caring about their opinion of you, block and ignore them and look for other friends who are aware of your value!
Yep I completely agree... I too went through this... And did as suggested... At first it seemed lonely... Then when I got used to it, it didn't matter to me anymore...  And remember: Those who mind don't matter and those who Matter don't mind

Im a very outgoing guy. People know me as the funny guy, the leader, outspoken, charming and all of that. What is bothering me to insanity is that i know for a fact im not happy.  I am good at making others smile, laugh, be loved, be taken care of. But I am the last person kn the planet to have it reciprocated. And for that it burns me to the ground and makes me feel really down.  Starting with my wife. On our 13th year together  now and she is everything I ever wanted as a wife before. But for the past few years she is slowly becoming everything i hate. And its not because i changed standards, i still love her but the way she treats me now is shit. Its too long to discuss but long story short i dont get the happiness from her in every aspect for the most recent times.  My family and friends holds me in a very high pedestal. Im tje most successful, most financially stable and all that jazz so going to anyone regarding my depression will really just destroy anyone. Imagine the one you are looking up to suddenly appears weak and depressed, i cant bear the consequences to any of my family or friend if they end up worse than me.  My career, im at a point in my career where i am really good at what i do and i find no challenge anymore, and if i do i get all the anxiety attack in the world that leaves me wayyyy down than how i started. I eventually accomplish any challenge but then i still have a very low esteem that i cna do the next thing that will be challenging to me, then it trickles down to me losing my job, turning out a failure, disappointment to poeple etc.  But then the silver lining among all these. My lovely innocent daughter. Who shows nothing but pure love and happiness with for me. Everytime i see her all my problems seem to go. Im happy, then i go to work, see my family, friends, wife. Then im mad again at myself why can't i be happy. Why am i always fearing that one day ill snap and be the next person with a smiling halpy picture captioned "this is how depression looks like". I dont have the strength to take my life nor harm myself but im fearing that one day ill snap and just might. I fear that something happens to my daughter, our relationship or anything that would take her away from me and then suddenly im just a broken man.  I wrote this just after fighting with my wife and juat after putting my baby to sleep happy. Theres something wrong i just want to talk to someone.

I've been chronically depressed for 6 years now. There are ups and downs, the winter keeps me down pretty consistently. My new partner makes me really happy, but when he leaves I get depressed and uninterested again.  I've had therapists who think it's circumstantial depression and others who never gave me a verbal diagnosis, though it's likely in my paperwork. My new medication from my doc got rejected by insurance.  I'm feeling down and getting into a new relationship always makes me see the parts of me that are unusual to neurotypical people. It makes me feel broken. Advice/support is appreciated.

Hey
hi
I’m on here to make friends. I’m Julian. I have been diagnosed with depression for 3years and it’s been a rough road. It helps to talk it out I figured.

I always feared that I'm nothing fun or interesting, that's why I don't have friends or do good in relationships. And I'm a sad and depressed soul, that's why you don't talk that much or play that much with me.  And all of this that I feared was proven true today, that I actually wasn't good enough. :)

I’m just anxious and I just want to word vomit a little.  Tomorrow I’m traveling to japan with my mom because my grandma was tested positive for covid the week of Christmas and it seems to just be getting worse. She went in for a broken bone and caught covid in the hospital. The hospital she was originally at didn’t let us know that she was positive until she was on a ventilator and basically unconscious. We called days before and they just kept telling us there were no changes and she’s doing fine even though our relatives said she hasn’t been doing well.   We had her moved to another hospital that’s more transparent with us but the anxiety in my house is insane right now. I haven’t slept well at all because I keep having anxiety attacks.   Even once we land we have to quarentine for 2 weeks and we don’t know if she’ll last till then.  And because of the new Strand of the virus the travel requirements are changing every day.  The last few days we spent scrambling to try to get tested and getting a doctors note.  I’m thankful I can still work from home and I can afford to go back but I’ve just spent a majority of the time lying down. I’m too exausted to do anything and I just feel hopeless. Everything has gone wrong so far and I keep thinking that the doctors are lying to us or the planes gonna crash or she’s going to pass while we’re on the plane. I’m just nervous and I need to be strong for my mom but I feel myself shutting down   If anyone has any advice about coping with potential grief or just taking control of yourself in moments of panic and spiraling please let me know.  This morning my mom told me to pack black clothing just in case and I just couldn’t function for a few hours.  I’m feeling ashamed that I can’t handle this situation better. I feel like a failure because I couldn’t be there for my grandma earlier. And I feel like an asshole just over all. I wish I wasn’t so weak. I’m trying my best but my best isn’t enough right now...  Thanks for reading my rant if you made it all the way through. Sorry for being a bummer on newyears

I can't tell from what you wrote if you have a diagnosis or not, but what you are feeling is due to a very real situation. It's normal to want to deny the gravity of the situation. In time you will get to acceptance and this will be behind you. Be there not just for your grandmother, but for your mother as well. The irony of death is that it's the living who suffer. Hope that your grandmother can pass in comfort. You and your mother will have to move through this till acceptance. Don't be surprised if your family members are angry or believe there is still a way to save her. It's a normal part of the grieving process. Now that you know this you are actually in a better position to help.  There's nothing wrong with how you feel. Just don't let it overwhelm you.

I’m a germaphobe so there’s that. I wash my hands for 2-3 minutes and it’s exhausting I hate doing it. And I get so scared of the germs. Then there’s the depression side to it like ugh I don’t have energy to do this, I can’t be fucked, this sucks I hate life.   I hate that going to the toilet is such a big deal for me. Honestly been holding off going to the toilet for hours now I just really don’t want to !

Hey guys. 22F here. Last night began with a lot of fun. I've been having issues with drinking too much and being high too often for a long time, but over the Christmas time at my parents place I gave my best to stay sober as much as possible. So when I drank with my friends, it started out being fun, I didn't drink alone and we had fun convos. At some point we started talking about goals. I think that's where I started drinking mindlessly. I couldn't keep up with the topic anymore. I was trying to express my fear of inability to have actual goals. My fear of not ever being able to feel happy about myself and my life. At midnight we were outside, I was just doing my best to have a good time, tried to stick to silly, non-serious topics. I felt like playing fire-poi, even though I knew playing drunk doesn't work well. That's when things really broke down. I got so mad at myself that I wasn't able to provide a nice show for my friends. I kept burning myself, but I didn't care and continued trying. My arms are full of burns now, but they're not going to leave scars, luckily.  I turned inward and wasn't able to hold any conversation anymore. When we went back home, I just laid on the couch. I was wide awake. I can't recall what I was thinking about, only that I bet myself up badly. I felt the burns on my arms and wished they would hurt more. I have a tendency to self-punishment, but it rarely comes out. At around 3am everyone decided to leave (no worries, we were the allowed amount of people), so I got up. I was on the brink of tears, but held back until I was outside. Then I just broke down crying. Two friends were with me and stayed with me. I'm so thankful for them, but fuck, I feel so insanely ashamed and awkward. I have no access to the reason of why exactly I started sobbing. I tried to explain, but my inability only caused me to cry more.  As sweet as my friends are, they put me to bed. I slept for about 14 hours, after taking a higher dose of my antidepressants (they help me sleep through). Now I'm awake, didn't get out of bed for hours. My flatmate brought me some coffee. My friends are painting a toy for a friend who recently became a dad. I want to be part of this but I feel so unstable, so ashamed. I feel like such a burden. I have great friends, I don't understand how I would deserve them.  It helps writing this down. I don't want to ask for anything. I guess if there are people out there, who experience similar breakdowns and intense feelings of shame afterwards, I would like to talk about it. You are not alone, and I know I'm not alone either. I've been struggling with this for nearly half my life. I just want to get better...

Hi sister,  I can't give advice but this is what my Friend did once.. I feel, talking about it to a friend can help. Like not just once. Like keep on talking... If you feel like you're burdening your friend. Then go ahead and write... Or type for that matter. It is a bit hard at first but then slowly it will get better :) Hope this helps... We are here for you
2020 was a strange, hard year. I had a breakdown recently too. My dad passed in 2019 and then 2020 was a shitstorm. I just want everything to get better too. I'm not one for resolutions but I am going to try to be kinder to myself this year. One thing I've noticed with depression is that we are so mean to ourselves. I would never say things to other people like I say to myself. Be kind to yourself. Thanks for sharing.
Thank you❤️ I will try.
Thank you for your kind words ❤️ how do you handle those moments, when you don't feel worthy of self-care, let alone help from others?
I'm not good at taking care of myself and I rarely ask for help. Not wanting to be a burden must be a symptom of depression. It's the little things that have helped me crawl out of the pit before. Things like talking nicer to myself, drinking less, getting out of my head more.

This is a request for advice but also a rant- its a bit long so there's a tldr at the bottom.  I feel like my life is incomplete, like im not home. I find myself saying that i want to go home even when I am home. I have always had a deep hatred for my home, I've never moved or anything, I just hate it more then anything. I feel like an alien- like I don't belong here. I don't necessarily feel like a human (ik, its weird)  This world is so predictable, so boring, and so depressing. I wish I lived in a fantasy world with monsters and magic. I get super depressed after playing fantasy games, watching fantasy movies, reading fantasy books, or having a magical dream. For Christmas I got the game The Witcher and playing it has made me super depressed. I wish I could have magic powers, to fight monsters and stuff. I wish I could travel and trade goods, to not know where ill go tomorrow. Honestly I wish I could just dream forever.   I'm so bored with my life. Nothing ever happens to me, I go about my day the same as the one before and the one before that, thinking the same thoughts, talking to the same people. How can I fix this deep sadness and longing? I hate this feeling and don't want to feel it anymore.   I told my therapist about this and I'm not sure she understands. She said that its just because my self esteem is off and its my defense mechanism. Even when I was at my happiest time (I had decent self esteem) I still felt this longing and sadness towards something that I can never have/experience. I don't really know how to explain it to her without sounding as insane as I do here.  I feel insane because It feels so familiar, like I've lived in a world like that and was cursed or something to live here. When I go on vacation I feel a bit of a relief, like im ment to be traveling. Idk. Im not religious but I do believe in reincarnation and it kinda feels like that. Yall don't have to call me crazy because ik I am. This has been on my mind alot lately and I just wanted to put it out there- maybe others feel the same way and have found a way to live with it.   I haven't told my therapist about the reincarnation bit. I feel like she may think I'm crazy so I've only told her that I feel like an alien (I think she just thinks because I'm being hard on myself and disliking myself) and that I get sad about the world being boring and not magical. I know for a fact that its not related to self esteem, its more of an identity crisis of sorts.   TLDR: I feel like I belong in a different world and I was cursed(?) to live in this one. How can I stop feeling miserable?

Have you ever looked into astral travel?? Some people are naturally good at it and others have to practice a lot. There’s a good astral projection/out of body experience Reddit thread you could check out. You’re not crazy and there are a lot of people who don’t feel like they fit in, even if they call it something different than alien. Sorry your therapist doesn’t understand you. That must make you feel even more alone in this. I’m sure you can find your people even if you are in the same geographical location as you’ve always been.
Do you have a link to that thread?

I didn't get you said absorb so I was reading it as "let the light's abs orb your depression" and I was like WHY DO THE LIGHTS HAVE ABS AND HOW IS ORBS A VERB but yeah have a good day
As of late, like everyone else, my friend MPQ-S has been having depression. It could be covid related, the holidays or just for no identifiable reason.  She purchased a disco ball for her covid lounge in her garage but first tried it out inside.  After watching the light show that it put on, her depression subsided. There is no scientific information to back up her theory that dancing "orbs" put her mind into a better place.  But hey, you never know until you try it!
i dont know what any of this is, or what it means, but i like it.
My sweet friend who doesnt know about social media asked me to help her post this to try to help someone. She puts on the light show and watches it and it seems to help her so she wanted to pass the info along. We tried to set up her own reddit. She couldn't post it so we used mine. I assume it's because shes a brand new user. We have more of these projects in the works!
You wouldn't believe how excited she was about this. We hope it might help at least 1 person.

I (26f) have had depression for most if not all of my life. My physiatrist called it persistent depressive disorder. I’ve accepted that it’s just a part of my life and that there are just some things that I have a harder time doing. One of these things involves working and going to college. I have gone through every option I can think of to be able to support myself as an independent adult.   Last month my last resort blew up in my face and I had to quit due to a hostile work environment. It’s not the first time I’ve had to quit and it’s not the first time that I’ve been without work, but this is the first time that I don’t know how to pick myself back up.   The issue isn’t my support network. I have my GP, my psychiatrist, and my therapist. I also have a great family support. While I don’t have a ton of friends, I do have one who is worth her weight in gold and then some.   The issue also isn’t medication. I’m on medication and have been so for years. Until recently, I was doing great.   Honestly, I just don’t know what else to do. I’m a planner. I always have a backup plan, or always know what I should do to keep moving toward the future. To pull myself up and try to be a productive member of society. I have ways to cope with my depression, but this is the first time that my plan has failed and I don’t even care that I don’t have a backup. Every job I’ve tried to succeed in has failed and I don’t know if I have the energy to pull myself up again. Any advice is appreciated.

Hi, Please know that no effort is futile. Try setting small goals doesn't have to be much. Say study 1 page properly for the day. Or do 10 second planks. Try increasing by a manageable amount. You can curl up beneath the sheets all you want. But ensure to finish the simplest of tasks. And improve the next day. Slowly energy will improve and you'll get the boost you need :) all the best sis!
Here is the results from the long term research on what serotonin drugs do for depression: increase it by 80%, increase it by 50% double it, increase it by 80%, and double it.  These drugs also more than double the chance the person taking them becomes disabled.  The reason people assume these drugs are helpful is because of an active placebo effect, natural recovery (without drugs 80% have a full recovery within a year), and withdrawal.  There isn’t a single long term study finding these drugs have any long term benefit.   Even the short term studies don’t find any benefit when you use high quality methods that remove the active placebo, cherry picking and/or withdrawal that occurs in the corporate run trials.  https://www.madinamerica.com/2018/03/do-antidepressants-work-a-peoples-review-of-the-evidence/  https://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3697/rr-4  https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/479162  https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/488802

I am 23yo and I am staying with my parents. Although I can afford my own place and own car I still am staying with them to take care of them and because it would mean a lot to them too having me living with them. But they are too suffocating. They are not comfortable in letting me go to my friend's place. They keep track of almost everything I do, including my text messages. I don't say anything as I feel like I owe them my life... They have sacrificed a lot for making a better life for me. So I don't say anything against what they say. But my mother just messes my plans of going out with friends. She on purpose asks me to shorten my plans at the very last minute for no reason. If she atleast tells me before hand I can tell my friends to plan accordingly. But no, initially she raises my hopes and then at the last minute she shatters them by denying me. I just want a week off. I know I will be safe, and no matter what, they just cannot stop hovering. I am looking for a ways and methods to be stern and firm and tell them that I will go to my friend's house no matter what, even if it is for a few hours and I will come back home ensuring my safety and that they need not track my every move.  Thanks in advance Sorry for the rant. Just needed to let it out to someone. Please forgive me for sounding so depressing :)

sorry, misclicked incomplete.  Hey. I had the same situation not long ago. My mother, as much as I love her and know that she only means well, is very manipulative and without her even knowing cultivated sense of false guilt in me. It required a psychologist and friends to make me see that. I cannot give you any advice but I can tell you my experience. I came to realise that everything our parents do for us must be appreciated and given great gratitude but it must not let us be manipulated or make us feel guilty because everything they did and do is their choice. My situation was different from yours, but the principles are the same. I suggest talking openly about how their actions make you feel. You must sooner or later set boundaries between your life and theirs, no matter how bad or guilty it can make you feel, because if you don't, you risk your own happiness and they must understand that, with your help.
Hey, thank you very much for this. Will learn from your experience and try talking to them. Although I may not be able to see them hurt because of my response atleast I'll take the first step.   Thank you very much!! Means a lot to me and I don't feel so lonely in this aspect any more! :)
You don't need to hurt them, just be honest but tactful. I hope you and your parents will find the silver lining. Happy new year :)
Thank you for your advice, happy new year!! Quick update: I did talk to my mom and she reluctantly did give me permission to go over to my friend's place!! Thank you for your support!! I'm finally getting the break that I do desparately needed!!!  Best regards.
I'm happy to hear it! You're very welcome. :)

I ran out of Effexor about a day after Christmas, and despite my efforts to get my psych's office to send some refills to my pharmacy, it didn't happen. I'd only recently switched to it from Prozac, and there had been a couple of times I'd had to wait for refills of that, but I didn't feel nearly this bad during that time. (Hell, 4 days ago I wouldn't have had any idea what "brain zaps" were, and now I'm very aware.)  So now I'm looking at either tomorrow or 3 days from now before I can get a refill, plus however long it takes to normalize after getting back on it. Does anyone here have experience with Effexor withdrawal, and did you have any ways of dealing with it?

I haven't tried that one myself, but in situations like your a trip to the emergency room could have gotten you enough meds to hold you over. Now that would not be a good option. If your doctor is connected to a hospital try getting in touch with whatever nurse practitioner that is avail. This needs to get back to your doctor to keep it from happening again.

Worst new year ever  My ex fiancé decided to added me on snap and make me relive everything until 3 am when I literally just got over a few days ago? It’s been 6 months of radio silence, an email from me, calls with no answer. We were raising my son together his he was 5 months old and we heard nothing from him. His excuse was the same one that he used all throughout our relationship to not be there for us- work is killing him. He owns a pizza restaurant.. and he’s a control freak so he basically does everything himself even though he pays employees then stressed himself out because he’s doing everything and working 16 hours a day. It ended with me asking for 1 hour a week of couple counselling because I know I have issues but he does too and needs to be able to make at least one hour a time a week for his family if it was ever going to work. His message was “ I miss you. happy New Years” and then from there it turned into him going on about his how shitty his life is without me.. even though apparently I was the reason he had no money ever and now it’s the same. I live off of less than half of his income, supporting my son in a two bedroom as opposed to his one bed- and somehow I have savings, even though I do have some bad spending habits ( fast food delivery 😬, and grocery delivery because sometimes I’m too anxious to leave the house and I need to cook for my son). Anyway so that was a mess. And then my friend with benefit that I was falling for.. that I thought maybe felt the same because he was driving an hour to see me, bringing me starbucks, offering to teach me how to drive and cook better, talking about maybe meeting my kid in the future, talking about taking me out clubbing after covid cause I’ve missed out being a young mom with no help; had a New Years party.. didn’t even think to invite me and posted on his snap grinding with some girl 10x hotter than me.. so I hate myself so much for thinking maybe I was special, maybe I meant something to someone in 2020 nope..

People are shitty. That's just we are. Even when we think we're being kind we can be hurtful. I myself have a history of deluding myself into thinking people actually like me when they're just being nice or whatever. Who even knows what they want. Most people barely understand their own minds.
Might as well just kill myself I’m so worthless I don’t even deserve support
>	My ex fiancé decided to added me on snap and make me relive everything  So why would you do that? Block them? The rest of your nonsense is just bitching.   *You allowed this to happen.*
As much as I'd like to agree, not all of people are as bad as we think of them. Yeah most of them are shitty, but if you live one day in their skin you'd see the reason why most of them are this way. We create our own monsters. Most people became shitty because life has treated them this way. Very rarely you can come upon crazies who can still be kind without any expectations.
What is wrong with you?
Oh yeah there's no blame to assign and plenty of grace and understanding go a long way. But we're mostly pretty bad. I was just feeling bitter and wanted to encourage OP to temper their expectations.
I was telling you this not to make you feel bad but on the contrary, to ignite the embers of hope. If you only seek the worst of people that is all you'll ever see. Nobody is good and nobody is bad, we're people.
It doesn't matter how good people are if they hurt me all the time. On the contrary, I'm tired of making excuses for other people. I'll accept them as they are, but I reserve the right to feel that they're kind of crummy.
You misunderstood me. If people hurt you then fuck them. I'm just saying that people deserve a chance to prove themselves good for you. I learned that by experience. I had a friend who kept using and manipulating me because I always came up with an excuse until I said no more and cut all connections. Now I always give people a chance but only one, then I either don't get close or wave goodbye. I hope you'll find more people who won't hurt you and are good because they can't be all bad. You wouldn't say they are bad if you didn't know what is good. Good night :)

I will leave her and be a shadow or a distant memory being dragged by 2020, the person I love is on the internet on the other side of the US I just did the hardest decision of my life which was to leave her forever... I really went head over heels for this person and just don't know what to do with my life anymore, she brought me hope, she brought me happiness, she made me feel like a was enough to even give a damn..... I'm lost without them...I hope i made the right call and need help trying to feel like I did the right thing?

Without more context it’s difficult to say whether your call was the right one or not, friend. Though honestly, I prefer not to think in terms of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, but rather that everything is a mixed bag with far too many variables to keep track of. Which means that we’re off the hook! We don’t have to decide what’s right, because in whatever we choose there will be both good and bad. All that’s left to us is to make the best of what comes up ❤️
This. Most decisions are trade-offs, only we can decide what to value and prioritize.

I can’t tell if I’m being dramatic or not. I genuinely think it would just be more pain if I kept living. I’m 17 male? and mostly everything in life just kind of sucks right now. I don’t have any friends or a social life I haven’t had one for a lot of years. No job no drivers license and I’m landlocked in a condo association next to a fast road so it’s hard to walk anywhere so I’m stuck to wherever my mom could drive me or my alcoholic grandpa drives me which probably isn’t the best idea because well....  cuz he’s a alcoholic which makes me sad remembering what he used to be. And while I’m out public I have very bad social anxiety I get freaked out when I don’t know what I’m doing or when someone talks to me it’s even worse if it’s a crowded store which is really all that’s open right now. Most of my days consist of waking up at 3pm-7pm then staying up all night just staring at my iPad and listening to the same “dead Kennedys” albums over and over again. As for my academic life I really don’t have one I do online school and cheating in every subject cause of lack of motivation laziness depression and I would fail any other way because I have the spelling abilities sixth grader I had to write this whole thing was speech to text. Depression has gotten so bad lately that I went on antidepressants in October and they haven’t done much but turned me into a zombie mindlessly zoning off along with a terrible side effect that I don’t want to mention but I’m sure you can imagine it’s bad for a teenage boy. And I’m top of all that I think I have some kind of gender dysphoria? All I know is I hate Everly masculine part of me including facial hair. also my grandma and dog died this year and we had to walk away from her house which had so many memories attached it and it being the house I decorated every year for Halloween so I had a sell all my Halloween stuff because I have nowhere else to decorate. I have no future plans and I’m not going to college either No job and I don’t think I can survive on minimum wage $9.56. I don’t even have a dad I can hang out with just one I see an hour a month when he accuses my mom of telling me not to talk to him. Fuck this year and Fuck my life I’m looking forward to death. It’s really the only way out at this point.

It sounds like one thing you could use is a community of support who “see you”. Maybe consider joining [Gender Dysphoria](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderDysphoria/) if you’re not already a member. You can ask for support in your local area or ask what others did in similar situations. Finding people who are going through similar stuff is going to go a long way and help you see what pieces you need to fit together to feel better overall.
A really motivating post! Although my issue is unrelated, motivated me to look forward at life knowing that I'm not alone

You were smart and creative enough to post here for help. Sounds like you’re being a little hard on yourself.
Lol same. At least you aren’t alone on that one!
I feel the same way lol, I used to think I was really smart and talented because I did really well in high school, and I thought I would go on to do big things in the future and have a great job and family and everything, but now I’m in college where I’m below average and struggling to even find the motivation to do things. Meanwhile, everyone I know seems to be better than me, they’re getting better grades, better internships, better social lives. I’m just not that good at anything lol. I’m okay at a lot of things but I don’t have anything I’m actually good at.  So you’re not alone!
You gotta live with it then. I mean, if you have time to post of how stupid, talentless, and uncreative you are, then you have time to do more productive stuff to keep your mind off those thoughts. Its a new year. Face it with a new and better attitude. Just saying.

I have so many thoughts and things flying round in my mind, it's making it hard to collectively try and understand and focus on exactly how or what I'm feeling so this may be all over the place   Ah so I guess I should start with the fact I suffer from severe depression and anxiety due to the fact my home life and environment was not very nurturing, instead was very physically mentally and emotionally abusive, controlling and demeaning. In the last few weeks I made the choice and finally moved out of home for good and have moved in to my girlfriends place. And for the last few weeks I have of course been feeling stressed and worried about what I'm gonna do but better than I felt at home now that I was in a loving and caring environment. But things have taken a wrong turn and in the last few days I have felt worse than I have in a while and everything is just getting so hard to handle and all these feelings keep stacking and making me feel like I just want to stop and do nothing.  First off I guess something thats got me feeling like this is the fact that I'm very worrisome and stress about everything and since moving in to my gfs place I have been worried that 1. I would be interrupting their routine, 2. Invading their spaces and making my problems theirs 3. Taking up more space than I need or want to 4. Worried I'm gonna in some way cause problems between me and my girlfriend because now we are constantly togther and I'm just scared.  Second, because of I'm now away from home j have been dealing with my abusive family and threats, I have gotten police involved so I was able to get my clothing so my gfs family didn't have to pay and buy things for me because that makes me feel worse. I'm too scared to officially get police involved and am now struggling to deal with and organise things for myself so I can start living on my own, tgere is so much I need to do and I feel like my future is now fucked and uncertain and being it's my last year of school now I'm now stressing about how I'm going to deal with it being I can't even deal with what I'm going through and feeling now.  Next of course is school, I thankfully have been able to organise things for school so I'm not going into my last year empty handed without any of the expensive text books or new uniform I needed. And luckily the school knows what is going on but I'm still worried no one is going to care or worry about my situation and understand what is going on and in a way make it harder for me to get through the year and graduate like I want as really that's the only real goal I have and that is forcing me to not give up but just barely.  Now is how I have been feeling in relation to my relationship, this has been the biggest thing weighting on me. We have been dating for a few months but taking it slow and now I'm basicly living with her and that's a big step I hadn't even thought about and I'm fucking terrified that with me always arpund is going to cause tension or stress on her which I don't want to cause, I absolutely hate when I worry her or cause her to be concerned about me. Lately she has brought up the fact that she's worried about my weight and it turns out I'm anorexic so has been asking me to try and eat more. I have been trying and it's hard, I have been actively forcing myself to eat what I'm given and have spent the last of my money of sustagen to have with my meals to hopefully help with that progress. I hate worrying her, I should be worrying about her, she shouldn't have to when she has so much to worry and stress over so much already and I hate being another problem for her.  Now my biggest flaw, I just absolutely hate myself and everything abput me, I don't get why people like me or how people think my advise of just "trying" is helpful, I am a nice guy and actively look after other people and be the "therapist friend" and I just always try but I can't help but still hate myself and everything I am or everything I do, I question myself over why my gf likes me and so why she is even with me, I question why people out up with m or why her family are treating me this way and worrying about me and letting me stay in their home. I'm always comparing myself to other people, especially because my girlfriend is obviously a catch and I don't deserve her but she could have any one she wanted, and I know their are people out their waiting for me to be dumped so they can jump on the opitunitys and that hprrifys me, I ESSPECIALLY compare myself to this one guy who is more good looking, more knowledgeable, more interesting than me and he has been getting awfully close to her asking her out to hang out for lunch or dinner and I'm scared, he is better and what if she realises? Wjat if he does succeed and win her over, he's tried asking her out numerous times whole we had been togther previously and she has shown interest in him a while back (me and my gf have been togther collectively a year, but had split half way through the year due to covid, and it's the first few months we started dating at the start of 2020 that he tried asking her out while with me and that she showed interest in him because he caught her on the bus one time because she nearly fell) I don't feel comforble and in stressed because I want to talk to her but she's very head strong and confident and I don't want her to feel I'm controlling her and trying to tell her who she can't and can talk or hang with and cause any confrontation between us, I am not even sure if she has made it clear and told her we are dating again I just mean a bit of reasurance wpuld be nice but yeah. They are hanging out tomorrow for lunch and a walk and I'm fine with them going and I'm just scared and stressed because I'm anxious. Idk you guys tell me if I'm being unreasonable or stupid or controlling thinking about that in particular.   Tgere are just all these things that keep tearing me down, I'm sitting in my room away from everyone because I'm just not happy, and don't want to inconviance my girlfriend or her mum, and I can hear them laughing and have fun and tgey seem better off without me around, maybe I should give in to my thoughts and just pack my stuff and leave, tgere is so much on my mind ruining me and it's hurting and I'm struggling to deal with it or do anything because it just feeds into a loop that's keeping me from doing anything, I thought maybe writhing it or some of it down on this sub would help but idk if it really has. I know other people have more severe problems and I know my problems are nothing or small compared to what other people are dealing with or experiencing so don't worry about me too much because I honestly don't feel like I deserve any ones help because of just how bad I'm feeling

Man I just feel you, I am 15 and that makes some of your points pretty far, but I just don’t feel good at the place I live as well, parents have been promising to move to a new flat where I’d finally have my own room for far too long and I’m losing hope I’ll ever live there before I maybe find somewhere else to live. My parents are probably not abusive but certainly not very supportive either.  I hate myself for doing all sorts of stupid, ankward stuff but am not sure if it really is a big deal and im just overthinking myself.   Anyways, as young and stupid I am, reaching out is the least you can do, not gonna lie I also hate doing it because I like others over myself, but finding people who value you is hard when you don’t know the value of yourself. I hope you feel better soon :)

She's on her way to Minnesota with her dad and my children, after they plotted this behind my back.  She just disappeared and I didn't even get to tell them I love them. I'm afraid to acknowledge the darkness I have in me right now because idk if I have what it takes to do this anymore.   I'm not a danger to myself tonight, please don't report this to Reddit. But they are my everything, and I'm all alone in Colorado with no friends or family and I've never spent a night away from my kids.   I need someone to fix this for me and the person who I count on just took away the essence of my life.   The fucked up part is that she hasn't seen her first son in three years because her ex did exactly this.

First thing in the morning go to the courthouse and see about filing for emergency custody.
Contact a lawyer.
hey that’s illegal call the police
It may not be written specifically that it's illegal but grab an attorney and when you get a judges ruling they're not going to rule in the mothers favor that's for sure.
i am so sorry. stay safe, your kids know you love them.
call the police and report a kidnapping.
I don’t know what to say other than I feel sad you’re going through this, and that I hope you’re soon in a good place with your children on good terms with her loving a happy life looking back on this hard times feeling blessed.
Take a few deep breaths when you're feeling overwhelmed. Focus in your good intentions and desire to care for your children.  Take things 1 step at a time and 1 day at a time.  I'm not one to give advice about this exact situation but I'm sure as hell used to feeling hopeless or lost and overwhelmed. If there are no friends or family near you, allow this Reddit community to rally around you and offer our support.  Hang in there. This won't last forever.
I hope things get better for you as this is completely messed up! You are not alone and there is support, including myself. If you need to talk or just have that support, feel free to message me! you will get through this!
Why did they take your kids away from you? Why did your wife and her father assume they needed to run from you under the radar?
So, thats not alright at all. Get a lawyer. Thats the most advice reddit SHOULD give rn tbh.
Call the police. What she's done could be construed as kidnapping. You still have parental rights.
Moral here is: Don't go near wahmen.     Now for the post itself pretty sure you have to go to the police about this? Not like it would matter i think cause in America assuming Minnesota/Colorado are the American based ones they will always find a way to victimise the woman even tho you could borderline call this a kidnapping if she doesnt have full custody of the kids.
And delete this post
It's not, because we're married. Her dad made sure it wasn't illegal
Yeah I think you're right on the money with that one. I just hate how ugly this is. I'm going to have to use the fact that she already lost one child against her in court, and I just feel ugly about it. All she had to do was tell me, I would have happily given her the space to heal.  But now I can never again trust her to go out with both kids, or drop me off at work... Thank you for listening to my rant. I have nobody here, and last night was the single hardest night of my life.
Her dad already consulted an attorney, and because WE'RE MARRIED, it's not kidnapping. Her fuckin ex did this same shit to her and she'll have to live with the fact that she's doing this, but there's literally nothing I can do about it.
I've been asking myself that all night and day; the answer is that as much as I would love to blame myself, she is demonstrating the same manipulative behaviors as I've seen her display to others such as her parents. Seems as if her mom is more in my corner with this, having expressed her horror at how this was executed.  We're cooped up, impoverished, and she has chosen to sink so deep into her addiction to screens that I'm met with rage every time I bring something up.  Neither of us handled this year well, and she says she just needs some time, but I don't believe her.
That's all the advice I'm seeking, to also be honest. It's just a fine line between being responsible and taking extraordinary measures which will likely end our marriage while we're a thousand miles apart. FML, for real. I love her so much, and I would gladly lay down my life for my kids, but the situation is simply being perverted faster than I can handle. Luckily, her mother is aware of her manipulative behaviors.
Bro I literally have no recourse. Because we're married, she somehow has legal right to do this.
She can't just take your kids away. I don't know the legality for sure, but please don't take her dad's word for it.
Call a lawyer immediately. Today! Don’t take legal advice from people who aren’t attorneys.
It's still considered kidnapping
Just remember you didn't make it ugly, she did. Also just remember you have the whole internet full of people who are here to help! (Minus a few trolls here and there)
The other thing to consider, OP, is that you must protect your children. If she's already lost one, it does not bode well for the wellbeing of her current children - it is a simple fact that the court should know to make an informed decision, not an attack.
You have recourse. https://www.freeadvice.com/legal/my-spouse-has-left-with-the-children-now-what-do-i-do/  Don't do nothing. That will be used against you in court later when deciding custody. You can't just go and take the kids back, but you can go to court and fight for them.
Addiction? If your wife is using illegal substances around children that’s something to actually bring up.
I can NOT tell you what to do with your marriage. That advice is so dangerous and touchy to someone's life.   What I can say is, feeling hurt by this is okay, and if you know the right answer to yourself already, and you know whats important to you, you'll make the right decision.
Contact an attorney asap.
Thank you. I just told my parents what you said. I had the same gut feeling.
The legality is that since they are still legally married they are both legal guardians of the children with no restrictions imposed by a formal custody order and what she did is NOT kidnapping and is NOT a crime she can be arrested for.    However, it can be considered parental alienation, which would not go well for her if OP petitioned the court for emergency custody. Also, since she has already lost custody of a previous child due to her behavior, has neglected and verbally abused these children, and made a unilateral choice to rip the kids from their home without a second thought, OP has solid grounds to petition for full custody being in the best interests of the children.    If OP is granted the petition and is awarded custody and THEN she refuses to return the children, it may be considered anything from criminal custodial interference to kidnapping depending on the circumstances and how aggressive the DA is.   /u/jizzbasket, I hope you can get a good attorney ASAP and try to make this happen.
The fact that you're so right about that breaks my heart. I love her so much. Thank you for helping me see the reality behind the bias.
No, addiction to social media and phones and computers. Unfortunately, that kind of addiction is almost promoted in society, but when one spends 18+ hours a day staring at a screen, it tends to put a strain on not only eyeballs, but also relationships.
Thank you a lot. That really does help.
Good luck, jizzbasket.
Of course. My deepest condolences for what you're going through - you seem like a caring and loving father, and I wish you all the best in this court battle.
That is probably unrelated to this issue. Being indoors staring at screens wouldn’t encourage a wife to kidnap her children from a husband. At some point, you must’ve disagreed with her about something or shown something she would attempt to spin out of proportion like yelling at her or the children or breaking something. If there is nothing you can remember, either you aren’t being honest with yourself, or she has some undiagnosed mental illness that could be prevalent in her family. You need to call for a well check on her, or a private detective to prove she’s not in her right mind.
She has diagnosed borderline personality disorder.  While my fuse has admittedly been short lately, the source of the disagreements has largely been her inattentiveness to our children, her need to coddle her computer more than our kids, and her penchant for screaming and swearing at our one year old daughter for wanting to breastfeed.  Unfortunately, as is the case with sociopathy and borderline, she's excellent at appearing as if she has her shit together.
Should’ve recorded it for proof, or hire a private investigator to catch the behavior at her current hideout. If the problems were always this prevalent, there’s no way it would go away immediately after moving away from her husband.

I’m a dude. Long story short, I reached out to the suicide hotline for help, and was referred to speak to some therapists in my area. So, I did my due diligence and spent the last week looking through all of my therapist options. Found one that fit my needs and seemed like a great fit, and our first session was today.   Well..I have a lot of things to start working on, but being diagnosed with lost child syndrome really surprised me. Had no idea this was a thing, and so many of my issues make sense now. I just hope I can cope with this and the recovery of understanding what this all means, and how to help myself.

I'm having the worst day I've had in a while, feeling really helpless in a job I don't hate (but drains me emotionally until I burn out)  Anyway you guys probably don't want my whole life story, but I'm feeling super rough. It's a bit of an odd request, but could someone just send me a little fact or even a little something good?  I'm not a danger to myself so no worries there, I just really need something to hold onto for a bit?

You aren’t alone. There are people at your job that appreciate all your hard work and emotional energy. You are doing exactly what you are supposed to be and I believe in you.
Did you know the main difference in the way dogs and cats see humans is this:   Dogs see humans as different animals, but equals. They learned millions of years ago that when they are good to us, we are REALLY good to them. So, dogs see us as best friends.  Cats, on the other hand, see us as giant hairless cats. When they bring you half dead presents they are actually trying to teach you to hunt and feed yourself. It’s the equator your gramma saying “you’re looking too thin! Eat something for Christ’s sake”. How sweet is that?
Thank you, I really needed that :)
That's really awesome, thanks for letting me know why my cat brings me live birds haha
It’s because your cat genuinely loves you and is trying to help you take care of yourself :)
Haha my little emotional support kitty, I'm actually going to look more into animal's perceptions of us - I love animals and your comment has my curiosity going
The nature of our relationship to our furever friends has saved me many, many times over. Wishing you all the best in the New Year. Hang in there, sugar foot.
Wishing you a good new year too! Thank you for making my day a little brighter :)

Nature. I try to spend time outside noticing the temp/trees/air... just get away from electronics.
Sure, tell more more about the kind of rut / what you struggle with, and I'll hook you up with a corresponding discord support group, ok?
It all depends on what kind of rut you’re in and what you like to do. Me? I make music. I go to therapy twice a week. I take meds as prescribed. It’s all about figuring out how to ground yourself, and that’s a very personal process.

First encourage them to seek professional help. Therapy or medication might work. For spending time with them, Show them your favourite happy vibes or silly movie or YouTube video. Go out with him to places if they can. Talk to them your silly memories or any memory, tell them the story of plants or trees in your backyard.  Distraction is very helpful for me personally. I was suicidal then my dad took me to my friend. And we had a good time. And didn't became suicidal for a week. Personally i feel motivated to live by seeing my idols(Jacksepticeye, Jaiden Animations, Corpse, boyinaband, lilypichu, tomska,etc. ) going through depression and now enjoying their life and have better coping mechanisms. It says to me if they can do it, so why can't i?
I really respect you for your concern on your friend.
So, pretty much am that person on your end.  Some sort of break from the cycle.  A video, a image anything to stop the song on repeat
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ko0rej/serious_depression_anxiety_obsessive_thought/
I've had this obsessive thought and feeling that I have nothing to look forward to (this was after we built our dream house last year)  I've had this thought / feeling since this November and I know that THIS IS NOT TRU because I still have a lot of dreams, aspirations (I still want to build a business, study Nihongo, go back to Japan, etc)  I know that it is a lie, but why can't I wrap my head around it and accept it??  Is this due to depression and or anxiety??     Moreover, I am a fairly easy to please person.  Just going out with my family, drinking good coffee, some online shopping, being able to take care of my family and living with them for the rest of my life is enough for me.  So why am I obsessing about this? This has made me spiral down to depression and anxiety and I now have insomnia to boot.  I go on life now, not fully engaged. You are physically present, but your mind is not.  I've had an existential thought when I was a kid and I also felt intense sadness back then because I can't figure it out.. however, what I did when I was a kid was to just accept the existential thought and told it, "Yeah, sure, whatever. Ok, whatever you say.." and I was able to accept and ignore the thought and I was able to get out of the rut and had a great life.  Now 30 plus years later, I am plagued with the above obsessive thought.  Can I do the same thing again, to get out of this rut?  Sorry for the long post.  Just very desperate. Thank you.

Things got really bad two years ago and I got help. Then covid happened so there was a lot more time to work on myself so I did so. Got into stoicism, working out more, music and cooking.   But a few weeks ago I moved 200km (about 120 miles) from home to study (3.5 years). I haven't had a single conversation face to face with anyone during that time. I don't know anyone around here and because of covid, I can't just go and meet new people by starting a new hobby or something. The loneliness is just tearing me apart.   Also, school starts in five days and I'm freaking out about it big time. Especially since it's done virtually and I've never done it before and you don't really get to know people via Zoom lol Also, I'm quickly running out of money and it creates even more stress.   I can function, I cook, I shower, I work out a little, I clean my apartment etc., but it all feels so hard all of a sudden. I just want to cry all the time and do nothing but sleep and watch Netflix while eating ice cream.   And it looks like it's gonna get worse before it gets better so, any advice?

I'm sorry I don't have any words of encouragement nor can I give you an advice. But maybe knowing that you're not alone being in such situation will help you a little. I've been depressed for such a long time I start to forget what it's like not to be depressed.. Long story short - I met a man who pulled me out of darkness with continuous support and distraction and after years of paperwork and literal suffering we're finally together, but I was the one who moved to his country. I'm 2000 miles away from home, my family, friends. I thought I got rid of my depression but I didn't.. I am happy we're finally together, but I can feel it's coming back. I'm alone here in a way too. I don't have work yet, because well Corona, I have no friends, because Corona, and I feel like a burden. The worst thing is that I chose all of this, I knew it wouldn't be easy, but it's getting harder and harder to go on, but I do my best. I do hope you will also find your strength and meaning to all this. If you would like to talk more you can send me a message if not I wish you best.

I am new to Reddit and have been looking at depression support posts as I also deal with my depression but not on your level.  I am not qualified to give advice but your post spoke to me. What I have started to do is write down things that happened to me that day when the depression is over the top.  Especially work related. I look back and at my notes a week later.  Sometimes the things that depressed me have gotten better.  Sometimes they are continual.  But for me, putting it to paper has helped.  I also go and take a walk even for 20 minutes to clear my depression.  I saw a previous post and video about the lights of a disco ball absorbing depression and that brought a smile to my face. I cant promise you things will get better but hopefully 2021 will bring renewed hope.

Hi everyone.  Exactly 26 days ago, I posted a goodbye letter here.  In those 26 days, people checked up on me, messaged me, added me on discord, played games with me. In those 26 days, I left the toxic relationship I had, that everyone told me to do but I couldn't. In those 26 days, I read a book, and made a huge post it wall in my room  with all the reasons  to live and to love this life. In those 26 days I changed my appearance, that reminded me of who I am.  So thank you. I'm still trying to figure out a right road on how to love myself, but its possible if you really want it.  If anything helped me, its this subreddit  and everyone commenting . Some negative situations came back and are still going on, but i guess  I can go thru that as well.  I love you all  💙  Edit: thanks for all the cute awards 😭 If you ever wish to talk, or open up about anything  you can always pop in my pms  and ill leave you  my social media thingys  <3 I actually want to be there for anyone who has troubles with anything.  Edit 2: oh my god.  I definitely didn't expect this to blow up a little and like  we have such a beautiful comment section. And that makes me so damn happy! Thank you, and I love you all 🥺🥺🥺

For starters, 2020 has probably been the worst year of my life, not even because of COVID. To start with, the very first week of 2020, my parents get a divorce ( a very toxic one, at that). After that all happened, I stopped talking to most of my friends, I only talk to about 4(ish) people now, yet I refuse to talk to any of them about my issues. Continuing on from that, I got diagnosed with multiple medical conditions (non- life threatening).  (A bit of a trigger warning, next part talks about suicidal ideations/ self harm, stop reading if it bothers you).   Around mid 2020 I started developing this overwhelming sensation of just sadness. I couldn’t stop it, so I picked up a blade, and started to self mutilate. Coming into the end of 2020, my life seems to have gotten worse, the one person I told about my self harm, called me “attention seeking”, and that’s kinds stopped my from talking to anyone, that’s why this is on a throwaway account. Then, come to find out my grandmother has cancer, which she is successfully fighting, but still, she doesn’t have much time to live yet. If she dies, I will at the age of 16 be forced to take care of my family.      Continuing onwards to the last couple of months, I’ve just gotten worse. I’ve started thinking about suicide everyday , or just thinking “pick up that knife”. Now, as well, I barley get out of bed. I’ve lost all motivation to do anything, whenever I think, I always think negative, like I always insult myself, no matter what. It’s to the point now where I barley eat anything, barley get out of bed, and I’m mostly physically oppressed to doing anything besides laying, alone. I just feel, lost, alone, and I doubt I’m ever going to make it out of this spiral, yet I tell everyone I’ll be fine, but I know I won’t be. I honestly don’t really know what to do anymore. I also know that my problems are probably way less worse then others people, and I’m sorry, I just don’t know what else to do.

I’m sorry for all you had to go through, for everything that’s going on. I wish your grandmother well, with a speedy recovery. Just wanted to tell you that you are not alone. I know that this may be little consolation but I’m here with you. I understand the feeling of hopelessness, and how hard it is to keep it from dominating your life. But, you can do it. Please, don’t give up. Everything will work out. If you need anyone to talk to i’m here.
Hey. You're not alone in this. No matter how hard and shitty life gets, trust me a lot of people went through the same if not worse. I'm not gonna say keep it together and start picturing life in bright colours. But know that it's up to you to find a way out of it. I strongly recommend to try to seek out professional help if possible because if you don't do it, nobody will because you don't let anyone know about it. People can be very stupid when it comes to this. me myself was depressed for 7 years only because my family "didn't believe in depression" and just thought I'm ill tempered. mostly because they don't want to believe it's this serious. so after much thinking and searching and trying I came to realise that if I don't help myself then nobody will, so I did. but honestly sometimes you just need to reach the emotional bottom, let it all out, then the only way will be up. first thing you need to do is stop insulting yourself or think there's something wrong with you or blaming yourself for whatever. Go take a warm bath or shower, clean your room, cook something and trust me you'll feel better and that will be a start. Know that what you're going through.. there's nothing more human than feeling lost and alone. I wish there was a universal recipe for all the sorrows, but there isn't. You have to find your meaning for yourself but I think you're on the right way because you're reaching out for help. Please don't give up. Yes you can kill yourself but the harsh truth is that nothing will change, except there will never be a person like you ever again. I wish you all the best and if you want to talk to me you can send me a pm.

Hey, so this is my first time posting on reddit! And it's simply because I want to get my life together, and everyone always seems super nice on here! I am almost 24f, and I will be moving out within the next 12 months, I say will, because I am very determined to do this. I'm just having a hard time reaching my goals, because of my anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I have a lot of things that I wanna do, and I have reached a lot of my goals in the past. I am just having a hard time staying motivated and focusing, and often just getting out of bed.  I'm taking lexapro for everything, and I really want to smoke less weed, bc if f\*cks with my sleep, and makes me have even less energy, but it's kinda sadly, the only thing I have to look forward to most days. Because of the lexapro, this is a less emotional, I guess, kinda depression. I don't feel sad, like I use to at least, I just feel very disconnected. But I am trying hard to get better, eating right, exercising, speaking to my family, this is just kinda tough. I need to get a job soon, because I'm moving out, but the thought of having a job makes me so anxious, that I'll end up f\*cking sobbing in the bathroom! I remind myself that I'm allowed to fail, and I think I am doing better, but I'm just afraid that I'll get a job and it'll be too much for me.  Sorry if this has been a lot, I just want advice from people who have been able to make that next step in life. Having their own lease/mortgage and taking care of themselves, with ADHD and Depression specifically. Just to, I'm not sure, be reminded that it's possible.

Yo moonbeam boy do I hear ya! But yeah I swear we can beat this, I mean cmon this world hasn't taken us down yet right? If you want to pm or discord, I'm down. HNY and let's kick next year's ass this time eh?
You may want to also lurk and ask r/ADHD for a little bit as well, if you haven't already. I've been able to glean a lot of helpful information from the good noodles there as well as here and you may be able to get the Lexapro Squad to give you some specific advice for organization with your medication in mind.

> Got rejected 5 times, one of them taken INCREDIBLY painful.   I read that as "took a chance and wasn't successful 5 times". Because you deserve kudos for even asking -- success or failure. So few people ask, so go you for even asking and taking that risk!

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/knn6zc/i_hate_who_i_am/
i hate who i am  It never used to be this way. im 17. some of you have probably seen my posts before and i'm sorry because i'm probably wasting your time. I hate basically everything about myself. And I don't know how to stop.  I hate the way I look. I'm called skinny, lanky, ugly etc, but then sometimes people call me cute and my parents and their friends seem to think im handsome. So for years i probably went around with an overinflated ego thinking girls would just drop to their knees in front of me. I started to question this when no girls ever expressed any attraction in me. To date, I've only had one girlfriend and it didn't last more than maybe 6 weeks. Another girl asked mt out; i had admitted to her i liked hern me, but she was like 12, a couple  months off 13, and I got the impression she was only interested in me doing sexual things to her which I said no to (this was before i had a gf). This makes me feel terrible for admitting I foudn her attractive. I had to think about it when she asked me, because im so fucking lonely!  I look at other guys and they have great bodies, they have girls and sex and sh\*t. i'm nearly 18 and i've got nothing. i've got a loving family, which is great, but then my parents treat me like a child and have constant control over the things i buy, what i post online, when i go out where etc.   I hate the way I act. I'm socially awkward. I used to act "myself", but I didn't like that so I tried to act more like others my age, but not cloning them etc. then i got called out for being someone fake or whatever. Either way, no one seemed to like me. I have ASD and I sometimes struggle to get stuff, I can varely make conversations, im usually hte last one ot understand a joke or i'm the butt of it.  I hate the way I feel. I feel pathetic. I am. Everytime I try and change who I am, I fail. I hate the person I was before, and i don't know what i think of this new person. I'm a joke.

Man that can be a tough age.  When I was 17, my driver's license said I was 6'0 and 123 lbs.  Of course I was the skinny kid, my moms neighbor called me lanky.  First time I had ever heard that one.  My brother's gf asked me once if I had to poop a lot implying I wasn't getting proper nutrition.  Kids blossom at all different ages.  Seems I never really did.  It really hit me hard with my self confidence.  I wasn't really socially awkward, but certainly lacked confidence.  There was a pretty waitress that worked at the Denny's restaurant where I hung out at in the evening to kill some time.  I anguished at the thought of talking to her, but I really wanted to.  I finally went up to her one night and made some stupid joke about the menu.  I don't remember what it was.  Here was this skinny kid talking to a gorgeous girl who really didn't need me bugging her.  Fast forward 3 years and we were married.  Amazing things can happen if you put yourself out there.  Don't worry about feeling awkward socially.  We aren't all masters of chit chat.  Just be pleasant.  Don't stop trying.  Things will work out for you.  If your skinniness weighs heavily on you as it did me, take action and do something about it.  I waited until I was 31 to start.  I wished I had done it sooner.  I joined a gym, bought some protein shake powder, and started going 5 days a week.  Progress was a little slow, but then one day I realized I wasn't scrawny any more.  Still lean, skinny wrists and ankles, but I was starting to get definition.  It was SO worth the hard work.  Amazing what a confidence booster it was.  People made comments about it.  It literally changed my life.  It was like getting cured of a disease.  It's the perfect time to do it too.  New Year tomorrow.  Get started improving yourself.  Chat some people up at the gym.  I made several friends over the years.  You see these people there everyday, and they have something in common with you.  It was like a social club, and I was bettering myself. WIN WIN.
Would be the perfect time and I did go already BUT covid happened and gyms are closed. I’ve got some weights at home but not much apart from that. Anything else you can comment or relate to other than this like the other stuff I said? And I think I’m probably about 160lbs. I’ve got definition on my arms but not much elsewhere.
Well, I wouldn't lose one second of sleep about some 12 year old girl.  That was an odd occurrence. Focus on the now.  Yea, it sucks that a lot of things closed from covid.  Use your weights at home until your gym opens back up.  Keep the routine going.  Kids blossom at all different ages. 17 is young. Your adult life hasn't even begun.  Your parents may over-parent you, but how much longer is that going to last?  Do you plan to move away for school?
I don’t know, I do kind of want to go to university but not sure if I’ll get the grade as as I have missed a lot of schoolwork and my depression is really stopping me from concentrating etc. It’s also making me have a lack of motivation and energy to work out. If I did go to university I’d want to move away but even then my parents seem to want me to choose one close to home and potentially one where I could stay at home
Oh also here’s my full story if you want to read https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/k7ckvz/depression_and_me_the_story_of_the_last_six_or_so/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Living away from home when going to a university is part of the experience.  It teaches you how to start living like an adult and tending to your own needs.  I strongly urge you to consider this when making a choice.  Living in university housing will also expose you to many new people, and girls, that you wouldn't get if you stayed at home.  Have you spoken to your parents about how you feel?  Not just about uni, but life in general?  Do they still see you as their "little boy"?
I read your full story.  You put a lot of time into that, and frankly, it was very well written.  I also read the comments from the 17F who you went back and forth with.  She made some excellent points.  She is right in saying that high school is nothing.  It sucks for some, and others I know look back and see it as the best days of their lives.  It's different for everyone.  For me, I didn't enjoy it much.  It taught me the school subjects, and I learned some people are assholes.  I have 100% confidence that your life is going to change when you leave for university.  It's going to change like you can't understand right now.  It will be a chance for you to redefine who you are.  You do not need to take your troubles with you there.  Leave them at home and become the person you want to be.     You will find outlets for things that interest you.  Everyone will be a new face.  So much potential.  No more bullying. You will meet people with likeminded interests.  Seek out activities and clubs there.  Go to study groups.  You have so much to look forward to.
They know about my depression and stuff I’m getting help for it but they’ve always sheltered me too much I feel , because I think they’re overcompensating for the fact they chose the first school I went to (equivalent of middle school in the US) where I was horrendously bullied. The rest of it’s mainly because they’re worried about me being suicidal which I do feel a lot but still

Idk anymore.  Title explains it all. I’m a teenager with no stable parent. They both do drugs, lie, and I just want so much more with my life than what they are. I smoke weed everyday. I’ve got to the point where I don’t come out of my room much. I rely on weed to be happy and to be honest I just don’t wanna be here. I want so much for myself I want to be something but I just feel like I can’t.

I just went through a break up a month ago, and I went on a date a few days ago, and he ghosted me, but that lead me to the realization that it’s not just pain and sadness that eliminate my will to live, it’s everything. It feels like it’s just a constant now. I feel like even if everything was great, I wouldn’t want to be here. It’s not that I wanna kill myself because I’m hurt, it’s that I don’t want to wake up tomorrow because there is no point. My dreams have no point, my life has absolutely no point. My friends and family are just people, and they have other people, and life goes on for them, because they have a point. I don’t have a point. I wanted to be a doctor, but what is that gonna do? I’m gonna spend several years in a tough school and eventually, if I’m lucky, find a constant. Every day go to work and do the same damn thing, live the same life. Even if I was a gypsy, moving around, going exciting places, what is the point?? They’re just places. The only place I want to be is nowhere... y’know? I just do not want to be here. I didn’t think I’d make it past the breakup and I’m probably right. The months not over yet, ey. I just wanna know... what’s the fucking point? Say that people give me joy- well nobody likes me and I’m unlovable apparently, so what is the point, I ask again? If I find join in a single thing, it’s relationships, and I’m clearly not enough for anyone. I’m not going to “wait” and I don’t give a damn if it “gets better with time”. What do I do now???

this aches to read because i have felt exactly the same way, gone through the same thought processes. all i can tell you is that 1) you’ve had a motivation and been happy before, even if that’s hard to remember now, so you know that it’s possible — even it feels unlikely. you’re only able to recognize how empty you feel now because you’ve been full before. 2) depression is a liar. it feeds us messages exactly like the ones you’re sharing here, funnels our thoughts in that one direction, and only lets us holds on to the thoughts and feelings that support its message. we think it’s the only truth out there, but it’s not.   i’m truly sorry you’re feeling this way — i know it is hard, and so painful. what do you do now? you look for help (a therapist, friends, family); you take care of yourself (sleep, hydrate, eat); and you just... work on remembering that this voice in your head is not the only reality. i know this doesn’t mean much, but every day you’re able to remember that is a step towards the other side of this feeling.
Thank you for this.

Hey everyone. Just want to share my horror experience with **iron and vitamin d deficiency**. It all started out of nowhere. I was in uni, high stress, long days, eating loads of sugar, but nothing traumatic and all of a sudden I cannot concentrate anymore. Everything turns joyless. My body is full of anxiety of anything. My thoughts go like crazy.  Within a four weeks my brain convinced me that everything was hopeless and that I have tuned from a happy, thriving student into a complete loser for no reason - other that I have turned mental. I had meltdowns, I ruined a great relationship, almost failed exams and had a **concrete suicide plan**.  Two doctors and a psychiatrist suggested to take SSRIs, getting an appointment for psychotherapy would take months. Not a single person recommended to take a **blood test**! When I decided to get one after reading online, it turned out I was strongly deficient on iron and vitamin d (formerly vegan, didn't supplement properly + only ate junk food at uni for 2 weeks straight). I'm now on iron infusions and supplements and start to feel better. But this was **hell on earth**.  Anyone suffering from depressions and anxiety, get your blood checked and eat healthy! Had anyone had similar experiences? I'm shocked it all happened so fast!

Thank you! Im currently a very depressed veggo. Im taking supplements but have a very bad relationship w food. Im going to get this done asap!
I’m vegan and I believe this had something to do with my recent bout of depression. I got a new Vitamin D supplement with Iron and B12 to hopefully remedy this moving forward.
I’m currently depressed and very low on iron. My dr put me on oral supplements for now. I suspect he wanted to order a couple of other tests, but tried supplements first bc Covid is delaying optional stuff. I’ve seen some improvement. I am glad he runs blood tests all the time!
It's surprising to me. Blood tests were the first thing my doctor recommanded. I'm glad you found that imbalance and was able to correct it thought. Depression and anxiety sucks.
Yeah, well in my case it wasn't that simple but checking my blood, correcting diet and sleep regime as well as physical activity certainly helped. There are 2 major types of depression. one is caused by actual medical condition from vitamin insufficiency to hormonal imbalance and cancer, other caused by traumatic mental experience or certain circumstances. I mean those are basics, I might not be fully correct but this is what I remember. So in my case it's both, one making the other worse.. so fixing one problem lessened the other, but it's still there.  But yeah, sometimes it actually is this simple. I'm happy you feel better.

Looking for insight on this topic. I've been  on the same SSRI (sertraline) for 3 years. One of the biggest side effects has been something called Angedonia, or emotional blunting. Towards the end of this year its become so bad; I'm feeling a numbness to anything that brings me warmth and pleasure. (Libido is completely shot. I dont get any joy from human contact, even as simple as a hug)  So at the start of December I decided to taper off of the medication completely. Now I understand that going off medications without any backup plans or support is probably not a good idea. Please, hear me out. My emotional state is so numb that tapering off has left me feeling the same as the last few months on the medications. I (personally) strongly believe I may need an alternative medication or support, because I dont want to continue taking this medication. I am now completely off the medication.  I've been doing really well, mentally, off of the meds. Until after christmas, I am starting to feel a lot of negative emotions. Loneliness, worthlessness, failure, lost. Loneliness being the biggest one, and me and the SO had broken up 2 months prior, and I feel like it was partially because of my blanked emotional state.  Am I wrong to have stopped taking my medication? I dont know what I could have done differently. Is it natural to feel these emotions, even if they are bringing me down? I want change. I want to continue working on my mental health, but since the breakup I feel alone with no supports.   I have been writing a lot, about my feelings, why I feel the way I do, about my past, and I think I want to get into therapy with a professional. I have no idea what that can do for me; have never been to mental health therapy, just general therapy. I tried going to a place in town a few days ago, to reach out, and I was met with the saltiest grinch and just left. Theres another place in town that I'll try that specializes in mental health. They're closed until further notice.  I've also got a doctors appointment on Saturday to talk about my medications. But this is where I am unsure of. I had a poor experience with my doctor, who switched me from sertraline cold turkey to Wellbutrin, and I suffered for a month until I switched back. So theres a level of mistrust of their knowledge in this topic. May ask them for a referral as well for a mental health therapist.  Theres a lot, and I am overwhelmed, on top of these negative emotions. I'm not looking for a cure, but I'm hoping for a bit of guidance or insight. What step can I take forward, to avoid slipping and falling backward.  Thank you for reading.   Edit 3 hours later: I've been experiencing Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction. Here's a good article on the subject https://rxisk.org/post-ssri-sexual-dysfunction-pssd/  It's a dysfunction I've experienced while on my medications, starting a few months after being put on them, but it was never this bad.  As time goes on, and the more that I read, I'm understanding that, I was probably wrong to want to taper off and cut out my antidepressants, just because I didn't like the emotional numbness that came with it. I am unwell. Probably the most unwell I've been for a while. Maybe I am just managing this better because over the last few years in my recovery I have developed stronger resilience to my negative emotions. I've learned and put into practice ways to combat depression spells. I feel like I am being selfish to myself and not allowing myself to get the proper help that I **could** be getting.

Even if no one reads any of this, I feel like this is good journaling for myself. :3
I take breaks off my medication sometimes because when im on my meds for more than a few months I get so numb, I can't do anything creative and I barely feel any emotion. It makes me crave my emotions, crave crying, crave raging. I know going off your medication isn't the best resolution but sometimes it helps me get clarity. My therapist referred me to get TMS treatment since I don't like meds/having a hard time finding one that fits me.

None of this makes sense to me. I don’t understand why bad things keep happening to me. My feelings just don’t seem to matter. Do I deserve this? Am I not the good person I perceive myself to be? Am I deluded? I can’t talk about it because I’ll just be seen as a nuisance. I don’t know what to think anymore, I really don’t. I’m just in pain and I’m sick of being in pain but I can never seem to escape it. It’s becoming too much and honestly, I wish that I never existed. But I know that it is all my fault. I let it happen. I let it get to me. It’s on me that I don’t see these things coming. I’m stupid for thinking that I have some kind of worth and thinking that I can be good enough for anything. I’m nothing but a waste of space and resources yet I always seem to forget this even when I’m surrounded by reminders. I’m such an idiot.

Yes, because part of the coming new year is reflecting on the past year. Kind of taking a personal inventory and coming to some sobering realizations about where I am at and where I will be if things don’t improve. While I am grateful for some of the good things, I am painfully aware that I missed several opportunities and am essentially starting over in many areas of my life. The new year is daunting bc I know what’s coming, a lot of work to try and rebuild a life for myself. It is overwhelming and a lot of pressure.   I think it is ok to be a little depressed around the new year. Shows that something in your life needs to change. The new year is a fresh start though, so try to focus on the possibility that things will improve/depression will pass.
I do
Yep. Tried to kms around this time last year. I think it's fueled by the fear of another unknown year. But I gotta remind myself to accept the unknown and accept is as a new start.
Yes. I always feel sad during Christmas and new year’s  but this year is especially hard. I try to remind myself that it’s just an ordinary day, nothing special about it and it wouldn’t matter if my circumstances were different I would still feel depressed. I just have to wait it out.

This is a rant/ story, but it more fits the rant so, that’s why that’s there   Anyway, a few days ago I think it was (maybe a week?) My father disowned me, and honestly, I was so very very happy about it.   He’s not a good person, I realized that a few years back, and I’m happy that I never have to see him again.  And y’know he took my phone, and I don’t care too much, the only important stuff I had on there was the pictures of my SO, and my contacts. Or so I thought.  Feels really kinda selfish of me to be attached to a game, but I know I’ve gotten more attached to physical objects than people because a constant threat was to have my things taken, and the thing I’m most attached to is Minecraft.  It’s been my lifeblood for basically my entire life, and even going a week without playing made me fall into a sort of depression, not as bad as my usuals, but bad enough.  It’s a fun game, and it’s always been there, either waiting in the background for me, or there so I can play. So it’s not that much of a surprise to me that I’m feeling like this without it.  Thanks for listening, just needed somewhere to put this.

Normally I have people whom I can turn to, but I've temporarily lost my support network and now I'm just feeling all alone. It's now almost 9:30 pm here and ever since 8am it's been nothing but breakdowns and panic attacks.

I am a fucking loser. I have no social life, no close friends, no hobbies or interests, no talents, no motivation, nothing. The only thing that makes me happy anymore is weed and right next to it I'm addicted to nicotine. I am a lazy ass peice of shit who rarely works and as a result despite being considered the "gifted kid" and school being really easy for me, my grades are failing. I have to hide my beliefs from my family because they're all extremely religious and I'm scared as to what would happen if they found out I don't believe in god. Every day is no different than the last. And nothing good ever happens. I always told myself it was because of quarantine and when school reopens I'll get things back on track but now I think it's just some excuse.  My cousin was shot and killed recently and being at her funeral brought back memories that I had of my dad's funeral (he died a little over 10 years ago when I was three). I realized that if he was alive how much of a disappointment I would've been to him. A pathetic lazy drug addicted piece of shit excuse of a son disappointment.  I tried to kill myself back in October. Was standing on the tip of my toes on a stepladder with a belt wrapped around my neck and I couldn't go through with it. I think I'm probably going to try again sometime soon. I'm tired of lying to myself and saying it will get better because it fucking won't. I remember having seasonal depression since forever. I've always had a shitty relationship with my mom, always had trouble making friends and talking to people, always spent most of my time indoors playing games, watching stuff, etc, and Ive never been happy for very long. I remember having suicidal thoughts as early as 10 years old, and I just want them to stop.

I've been really down ,alone, and depressed lately. Thanks to my dog Orion not bad enough to harm or anything.  But I don't know what to do. I'm planning to try to work out with my family more, planning self care methods, and even planning easy cheap excursions for  my husband, Orion, and me. But lately, any plans I make, fall to dust. And I feel as if I have no control in my life. Need help.

Hi there.  I'd like to suggest finding a peer support group.  Hearing from and sharing with other people who at least kind of get it can be a really powerful experience, especially if you stick with one for a while.  To find free virtual peer groups, you can search the websites of NAMI (national alliance on mental illness) or the DBSA (depression and bipolar support alliance) by location.  Groups have done so, so much for me over the years; they help us feel less alone, and connecting with peers gives us a different perspective on ourselves and our mental health conditions.  Best wishes, -F.
Thank you for the advice, I will look into these.

I'm just so sick of everything. People see you sad and depressed and they say you're weak, that you have to be grateful that you have a roof over your head and a meal at the end of the day. That you r "sad" and "being dramatic" because some people had it worst.  No matter how much you try to explain it they just heard you, say some shitty comment and move on, if you try to talk about it again they feel annoyed.  All of this things were said to me by the only person in my life who might care.  So, fuck everything, clearly I have no one if I'm not happy.

I feel really bad about my life because its bad but I feel like even if I made the massive effort to make my life good I would still feel bad and the only difference is I would no longer have the pie in the sky to console me. I want to change but how can I find the motivation when I feel like happiness is impossible?  I made a vlog where I ramble about this as I walk around the street at night in if anyone is interested...

The problem seems to be that you have no reason to find motivation as you believe that happiness is impossible for you. What makes you think this? If you could change this belief then may be you would have a reason to make life good for yourself.
Getting to happiness from depression (if it is depression) is tough  It took me 6 years to get from depression to joy through self help books and courses  There are stages  So I went through stages  Depression  Then other emotions that felt better than depression but no where absolutely near happiness  There is a spectrum of emotions  It’s a journey  I’d focus on getting to relief rather than happiness as it’s much easier to get to from depression and feels so much better than depression  I hope this helps When I tried to force my happiness the depression would grind me back down
Thanks for the reply! The thing that makes me believe this is that whenever something goes well it never makes me feel good.
Good to hear your doing better. What books helped you and what kind of courses did you do?
Happiness might be overrated honestly. How do you define happiness? Modern western cultures tend to associate it with positive feelings, stuff that makes you laugh and is fun. That's all well and good but it's unsustainable. It definitely contrasts to other ideals such as equanimity.
Are there any beliefs that may cause this, such as 'it will all go wrong anyway' that stop you feeling happy? Or is it more of an inability to feel happy? Or maybe pleasure at all?
Thanks! Everybody is different  I looked at a lot of people  Some I got a lot from - they resonated with me. I bought books by them and watched their YouTube videos. I also followed their blog, Facebook group and did self help courses on removing negative emotion. One course was great at building businesses and increasing money through mindset power. Others I benefited from some of the things they offered. Some I didn’t really benefit from it or resonate with  So what worked for me may not work for you  My advice - google a question you have or watch a youtube video related to it. Then watch different people and 1 or 2 will really click and resonate for you. They are for you. So follow them and you will gain a lot. Then you may buy their books or courses later. Another idea is get loads of sample books on Amazon relating to the topic. Any that grips you when reading it is for you so then buy the book. What I went through maybe the same emotion - depression anxiety etc but what caused it may be different to others. Hope this helps  It’s a journey  You can do this  There is something about your messages - it has power  Once you find authors, bloggers, or speakers you resonate with it the journey is gaining speed.
equanimity would be just as good.
I dont think its any beliefs. I dont know if I can feel happiness or plessuare but I never do even when things or better so I suspect that I can't.
Maybe you can work for that instead then.
Hi again! Have you heard of something called anhedonia? Look it up and see if you can relate to it. I just wonder if this might be relevant to you?
any advice on that? Is that something you've tried?
Ive heard of it. Do you know how I can know for sure if I have it? Thanks for the help.
Not with any success unfortunately. Just thought it could be an alternate approach.
I guess I just need to do my best and if I never feel any better I suppose i've got my answer.
Firstly read up on anhedonia and see if it this describes what you are experiencing. If it is then go and see you GP or psychiatrist (if you have one). Describe your symptoms to them and ask if they think you have it. Obviously I can't diagnose you and self diagnosis isn't useful. If this is the symptom that is causing you the most distress (because there doesn't seem much point in life in you can't feel any pleasure from it does there?) then may be you can look at some form of treatment. From what I have read, anhedonia may or may not respond to treatment.   Mine did but mine was drug withdrawal induced so the cause was easy to see.  And of course, it may be that this isn't what you are suffering from. I am just surmising in the hope of giving you some direction.
Your right maybe a different philosophy would help. Il look in to it, thanks!

I feel like being depressed makes me feel ungrateful of the life that I have

Yup. Especially once you get told its all just an act and you're just being ungrateful.
I do bc I feel like it’s in my head and rude to people who have it worse than me and for that I feel like I’m not worth shit
Yes! Often! Having had a career in nursing, I would see people struggling to live while my thoughts were often about wanting mine to end.
Oh definitely. I am a parasite who cant give anything back to the people who care about me or do they?
Yeah, however it's normal to feel that. Instead focus on pirortizing processing those feeling however you do it through hobbies, fitness etc I use the rule of 5 to ground myself  (list 5 things you see, 4 things you feel, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, 1 thing you taste)  Don't feel guilty theres nothing guilty about depression
omg all the time. right now even. take care of yourself. depression is insidious and a legit illness, and there's nothing to feel guilty about (as if that solves anything). [https://www.thelatestkate.art/](https://www.thelatestkate.art/) The Latest Kate makes some great art that I find reassuring sometimes. The Rule of Five is a good Cognitive Behavioral Tool that can help get you out of your head when you feel like you're spiraling.
I feel guilty because it feels like I'm inconveniencing my hubby more than anything else. He's done a lot for me emotionally during this pandemic and he's made it a lot easier to just barely function sometimes.
Yeah I do. Not retrospectively,sometimes for the present and far more often for the Future if this  makes sense.
I do feel guilty all the time for a multitude of reasons. That is normal with depression it dregs up all your insecurities and self doubts and runs them on loop in your head.    Dwelling on the what ifs won't help you feel any better try to focus on things you can do that can help out no matter what size your able. Some can do far more others less but try to not spend too much time in your head listening to all the lies.
Big time
Yeah, I have a damn amazing boyfriend, great friends, I'm in a good school and all that. I feel bad for feeling bad which makes me feel even worse. Sucks but hey, not much you can do, just try to stay positive and don't be too hard on yourself.
Literally how I feel right now, I feel bad for not being a good partner that is pulling their own weight in the relationship. My partner is not making me feel bad, I am making myself feel worse. When I consider how I have been pretty useless lately and sad.
Sort of yeah. Especially when it makes me neglect social and family "duties". People might think I'm being disinterested, distant or lazy, but really I find it hard to manage all those things sometimes. Ends up making me feel guilty because I have friends/family with awful backstories who still manage to charge through life "crushing it" so to speak
I think its a really common feeling, i feel it a lot but never voice it cause everytime i do i get told its on me, im doing this to myself, and all that jazz.
Yeah I do too. I feel like I don't deserve to call myself depressed because I tell myself I had everthing in life to be happy and not a burden to society.But I fucked it up by being stupid, irresponsible and lazy. My life compared to others is on easy mode(stable family, loving parents, first world) and I feel guilty for that. There are people who deserve this life more than I do.
I often feel like my depression is my fault and that   I should manage it alone. I feel guilty when I talk about it to my friends or my girlfriend because I feel like I'm selfish. Talking about my issues and seeing them try to help me feels weird.
Sometimes
I always feel bad. I feel like a burden because my depression can really affect my life at my low points which inevitably affects other people and my relationships and such. I feel like i’m just an issue for them.
Yup. People are just like "You need to exercise more, get out more, try supplements, go make friends, stop being sad, think positive, try yoga! Blah blah blah blah blah you're just lazy! You don't want to get better! You just want to be sad!" Which isn't true at all! But I still feel like I'm lazy and useless.
Most every day, I would not wish this misery on anyone not even my worst enemy. I find it hard to take care of myself to the fullest extent a lot of the time. I just don’t have the energy. It gets really bad in the winter where if I don’t feel up to participating in life, I don’t want my eyes to be open. I made a career of being a CNA for 30 years, had back surgery in 2013 and couldn’t handle working w/o pain meds. Now I cannot deal with life without them because I feel awful. I can’t believe how my life mentally and physically has dissipated. Feels like I am barely hanging on.
All the time.
all the time. ive always been told im selfish for feeling that way
yes I do
DEFINITELY! I hate seeing how it affects the people around me and feeling like it’s all my fault  and having no control over it at the same time.
Don’t feel guilty. It happens to us. It doesnt help how society has been developed by neuro patterns
I only feel guilty because I know I will kill myself and cause my family unnecessary pain
Yup. Constantly. But I don't feel guilty for being ungrateful -- I just feel like I'm making problems for other people. And failing to contribute. And being a burden. And failing to accomplish anything (even when I do accomplish things).
Thats a pretty vicious cycle.
This!! This is exactly how I feel. I know other people have it way worse than I do. I generally have a good life I have no reason to feel this way. So I get upset about that too. But depression doesn’t care how good we have it, how much money we have, how little we have, it can affect anyone.
Yea
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/knbo32/has_anyone_here_been_helped_by_dbt/
Has anyone here with treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder been helped by Dialectical Behavior Therapy?  I’m particularly interested in hearing from those who do not have BPD, Bipolar Disorder, or other diagnoses that involve the powerful, changeable emotions DBT was originally designed to treat.  I have a near-lifelong low mood, which sometimes inches up toward neutral, and sometimes inches down toward severe depression.    I have been told that DBT is used to treat MDD now, although this is my second try at this therapy, and I still see nothing I can relate to.  Having me drop out would be a blow to my family, however, because they’re quite concerned about me, and the belief that there’s a “next, new thing” out there that might turn everything around is helping sustain them at a difficult time.  Also, since this is not my first time in the mental health rodeo, I’m aware that getting quality mental health care (or any care at all), is frequently contingent on professionals’ perception that you are “treatment compliant” or “working,” which generally means that you are doing what your doctors tell you to do, whether or not there is much evidence that their recommendations will help.    For multiple reasons, I really want DBT to be a thing that helps me, for all that every time I participate, I wonder, “What am I DOING here?”   Unfortunately, this isn’t a “nothing to lose by try trying” situation.  The DBT sessions cost me $90 a week, which I can Ill-afford on my SSDI income.  Participating in DBT also prevents me from seeking out other therapies, because Medicare will not pay for both.     I would feel less discouraged if someone out there with similar symptoms to mine had benefitted from this therapy.

Exatly one and a half hour from when I started to write this, I asked my almost girlfriend (It's a long story) "Do you love me?" And she answered: "I like you/ But I don't know if I love you anymore"  As soon as I saw this, I felt like I've been shoot in the chest at least 3 times. We proceeded to discuss it a little bit, but yeah... I think it is over  She helped me through one of the darkest times in my life, when depression really started killing me, and I also helped her, because she has a troubled family like myself. We fell in love, she always kept me more... Alive than I could ever imagine.  This was my first real relationship, and she was the one that followed in lots of "first times" (Not sex, but other things, some naughty). I just can't live alone anymore, I'll end up taking pills like cereal or cut myself until I die...  Can someone, please help? I don't know how to live anymore  (Obs: Sorry if it's a bad post. It's my first here, and I'm not a native english speaker)

Heartbreak is hard.  You aren't alone.  Browse the divorced community to see what I mean.  The first whiff of it can knock you down.  You'll be in shock.  There are so many emotions connected with it that it can feel like too much to handle.  If you are 1-1/2 hours into this as of your post, this is so fresh in your mind that you haven't had a chance to let things sink in. I don't know anything about your situation, but maybe she's just having a bad day.  Maybe she is troubled by something else entirely.  Maybe she wants a little break.  Maybe she needs one.  Whatever the reason, slow your mind down a little about it.  Step away from the situation and let the dust settle and see where things stand.    And if things don't turn out in the best way for you, don't forget what you said in your post.  "First real relationship".  This means the one before the others.  Dude, like almost every man alive that engages women has been through this.  First heartbreaks are brutal.  I remember mine when I was 16.  I look back and it's a distant memory.  I know that doesn't solve your problem, but I assure you, you will get through it no matter how it turns out.  You aren't going to cut yourself or take pills.  You are going to be cool about this.  For now, I would give her some time.  See how it goes.
This book helped me a lot. It was the first time I thought to myself love myself? And when I was in rock bottom it came at the right time. Hope it helps for you. It helped me and I bought the whole book  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15704926-love-yourself-like-your-life-depends-on-it I realised that working on this will help me and save me  I hope it helps you if you are interested  And once we have love for ourselves we no longer are fully reliant on the love from others  Actually this post you wrote has just helped me with something big like a resolution  Thanks!

I can feel my footing erode a bit more every day. I’m on cracked ground and will fall if I don’t get help. I’m calling psychiatrists tomorrow because my regular doctor has no idea what to do with me anymore.   I’ve tried Abilify, Lexapro, Seroquil, Zoloft, Effexor, two doses of Pristiq, 2 doses of Wellbutrin, CBT, EMDR, and group therapy. I’m tired. And I’m very sad. And I’m very tired of being very sad.   I feel like my skin is waterlogged with sadness, so saturated I could split open at any moment and drown everything around me. There is pain in simply being awake and conscious.   The idea of starting over with a new psychiatrist to pour out my life story and all the meds/techniques I’ve failed on is overwhelming to the point where I burst into tears thinking about it. I don’t want to do it but I know I’m a ticking time bomb if I don’t.

Straight up yes dude.

That bad huh? Well then maybe you should seek help.
What help the person whom I helped i her most difficult  time left me saying I have changed. Someone not appreciating is the worst feeling  I get. She was suicidal  and stuff I was with her. And now I am changed. So what someone should do. I feel like peeling her skin off for the tings she has said to me.
Sounds like a downright cunt. And who's to stop you, just make sure you don't get caught. Morality is overrated when it comes to vengeance!

I've known for about a month that I need to finish my IT class project. I haven't done a thing until now and I can't finish it properly since I only have office online and I am missing many functions that are needed. That being said, I also don't know how to do some things there. I am running short on time because I am lazy pos that deserves nothing but to die.  Last few weeks I was free of my depression, but I still didn't do anything with my life. Just lazing around, playing games, watching anime and sleeping. My therapist recommended me to doctor, but I can see them only in February. I was hoping that meds will help with my symptoms and I would become somehow productive. But not being depressed and still just being lazy doing nothing proved me wrong.  If I don't score at least 75% with the project I will just yeet myself under the train or Idk. I guess I need to find some painless and quick ways too die :d. At least I will do something useful when I kill myself.

I might have been in a slump these past 4 months. I rarely take a shower, I stopped cooking and I only order food from grubhub. My room is a mess. Trash everywhere. Everyday is the same to me, wake up online class eat assignments sleep (well it’s winter break now but i still don’t do much). I moved out couple months back and am living alone right now. I don’t even leave my room nowadays except to get some stuff at the store. Although I don’t really feel stressed or suicidal. I have never been like this before. I don’t even know what I’m doing at this point.( Also I don’t know if I’ll have enough money to last until the end of January. )Should I get help...

It sounds like you are definitely in a slump, but maybe it's just the isolation blues?  I think you might be letting this get away from you though.  It may get worse if you don't take action now.  Self-care is very important.  Disorder in your home is going to make you feel disorderly in your mind.  Grab a trash bag, pick up the trash.  Enjoy your showers.  They are warm and relaxing.  Even if you don't have anywhere to go right now.  Wash your sheets and go to bed clean.  Its one of life's simple pleasures.  Move your furniture around.  Change things up a little bit to reflect your new change in attitude.  The isolation isn't forever.  And grubhub is expensive. If money is tight, buy some groceries.  Make ordering out a special treat on weekends or something.  Make sandwiches at home.  Don't go broke because of delivery food.

I have this paranoid feeling that im being recorded in my own house by my boyfriend. I know its not true (he has NEVER done anything like that)  I know where it comes from. My abusive mother got this small video recorder when i was 12 and set it up in our house without me and my brothers knowing. It was absolute hell. She took away my last sense of privacy. Ive been paranoid ever since that when i live with someone they are secretly recording me.  How do i stop this?? Its driving me insane because i know logically its ridiculous but i cant convince my emotions of that. Any help would be appreciated.  Edit: im 29 now so this has been persistent for 17 years. Idk if that info helps.

You are very clever  You know your exact issue  And you know the exact root cause  And also that you want to overcome it  My advice: journal it  Write and write about it up to a point where it starts to feel a bit better I journaled a lot and I would feel it weaken I wouldn’t read what I wrote. I’d just bin it  I found that unaddressed emotions take over and is triggered because we didn’t really address that emotion at that time so it triggers and takes over  Journaling it weakens it  I hope this helps  And if you keep journaling there will be a point where it will all go  And you will think cool it don’t trigger anymore  If we journal it fully then that is still good because instead of being 10/10 takeover no control it could become 5/10 or 3/10 so more manageable  Wish you all the best  You got this!
That's an understandable worry if it's happened to you before, and especially with cameras everywhere now.  But if you KNOW it's not true, then why are you paranoid about it?  It sounds more like you THINK it's highly unlikely, but there's always a chance.  Regardless, if it were me, I would try to rationalize it.  First, it takes a special kind of crazy to do something like that.  You would recognize this by now if he was that kind of person.  Second, like, what's to gain if he did?  Videos of you watching TV?  Doesn't make sense. Don't let this steal your sense of security in your own home.  You are safe there, and your boyfriend is a safe person.
Thank you. I will try definitely but thats a little triggering as well. She used to go through all my journals and abuse me for what was in it so it ties into the paranoia.
He really is and he would never invade my privacy. He never has the whole time we have been together. Ive been having therapy sessions over the phone due to the quarantine and if he is home he will leave because he believes that is private and if i want to tell i can afterwards. And ive been rationalizing for 2 years. It hasnt worked. Ive just now let my therapist know about it because i know its stupid. But its just gotten so bad here recently.
I wonder if being isolated from covid is feeding this paranoia a bit?
Its not isolation my life didnt change at all when quarantine hit. I was already staying home because of my anxiety and my boyfriend still worked like normal because he is an essential worker. But we have had a lot of stress(not in our relationship)the last couple of months. So maybe that has triggered it?
Well, if it's flared up, and there haven't been any actual new instances of secret recording, then something must have triggered it, right?
The stress we have been going through has been triggering in other ways so maybe it brought that up too since its related to the timeframe of what triggered from my past?
I wish I could give you a clear answer.  Likely something more deeply rooted.  The mind is a powerful thing, yes?  If stress can cause physical ailments like rashes, aches, indigestion.. surely it can also trigger other things that trouble you to surface again.
Very true thank you for talking to me. Its really helped.

Honestly been feeling shunned even more than ever nearing the end of the semester.  As much as I want to work together it just seems near impossible to be friends when almost always never being invited to join discussions regarding class related things. is it wrong to desire some kind of connection? I've tried making connections before but it will always end in an awkward state.   Is it anxiety that's telling me to not try to impose as it will make it awkward? Self hatred becomes overbearing when i think about it.  Growing up sucks man.  Oddly enough I only have this problem while studying. while working i dont.

And you feel emotionally suffocated. You want to cry but there are no tears and you want to vanish in the darkness leaving no spot of your existence. When there is no escape why are we not allowed to just end the suffering. I wonder what it would be like to just never exist and never matter. Sorry my rant won’t make sense to you.

Your rant makes perfect sense.  You are struggling with where you are at, everything seems pointless, and you see no possibility of recovery.  You already exist so it's a moot question to even hypothesize about having never existed.    Have you reached out for help?  If your mind is in darkness right now, you aren't alone.  Many suffer from this.  There is hope though.  It doesn't have to be this way.  Please talk to someone.  In person if possible.  Whatever is available to you.  Parents, family members, friends, counselors.  There are many options.  Take the first step and the steps after that will fall into place.  You are in control.

My recent bout of depression has me wondering if I feel genuine empathy for friends and loved ones and I hate it. I know deep down I love my family, friends and my sweet little rescue dog but this bout of depression has me questioning all of that. I think I’m on the tail end of it but this nagging feeling is lingering. It’s dulling my interactions with these people I care about and I just want it to stop. My emotions have come back and I’m getting my appetite back but this feeling of guilt about whether I feel true love for others is infuriating. It’s making me imagine extreme scenarios where I would have to feel deep emotions for them and it’s awful. If I can just shake this last part of it off then I’ll be back to the regular happy person that I was. Any help or kind gentle words are appreciated 😢❤️

Love takes energy, and sometimes we just don't have enough. Nothing wrong with that. Is just how people are.
You’re right. I need to remind myself of that more often. And I think being an empath it makes me feel things much more strongly sometimes and it can overwhelm me. Like I have feelings overload and I don’t know how to process it all so I just shut down.

I don't know what to do and how to deal with. I feel numb all the time, observe everything but don't have any type of feeling. Cannot sleep at night. I always try to control my anger in situations most of the time. I never had the guts to talk about this to anyone, not even my parents because they believe I'm doing drama and all that so I just keep everything to my self. I don't friends. I'm antisocial and introvert also.

The insomnia is the worst, it makes everything else so much harder. I can only tell you what helped for me; I got a low dose of medication and I take a little bit of cannabis before bed. I can fall asleep and stay asleep now. I also recommend talking to someone qualified whether it’s a doctor or counselor, even a school counselor to help. Breaking the ice on the conversation is the hardest part but it’s all easier after. Good luck!
Please don't smoke cannabis as mentioned in the previous comment. Whilst I am not anti drugs, cannabis can totally mess with your mental health.  You need to speak to a mental health professional. You can get referred through your GP or sometimes self refer to local services depending on where you live.   This might be a boring answer to you and I apologise. Since I don't know your location or age etc then I can't recommend any particular services. However, a google search should help you find out whats available locally.

It started in 8th grade. Back then, it was clear that I needed help, but I didn't get any. I decided to try and beat it on my own. Because it made me feel strong. And, I mean, it kinda worked, I actually got a lot better, but it only lasted for so long. After my "recovery", I spent the next two years relapsing again and again and again. I never told anyone. It would go away eventually, I always told myself, and I believed it. A few months ago, I actually managed to get clean from self-harm and I was doing so amazingly, I was convinced that it was over.  Well... turns out it wasn't. Depression has many symptoms, but for me, the biggest one has always been self-hatred. And that self-hatred is seeping into my mind again, making me feel worse and worse every day. I'm relapsing again, and I'm scared of it. I don't wanna go back to that dark place. I don't wanna start self-harming again, but the urge is getting unbearable.  It could have been over long time ago, but I recovered so poorly. I never got help because I didn't want to lose the image of the brave, resilient fighter girl which is, and has always been, my main source of confidence. It's kinda stupid, really. I mean, there are so many things I could be proud of, so much success. But all of those rely on talent, innate or learned during early childhood, I never had to put significant effort into anything - except for my resilience. It makes me feel strong because it's the fruit of my very own willpower. I can't talk. What should i do? Why can't I just be strong enough to get out of here once and for all?

So many people think that strength is in fighting all by yourself, but that’s wrong.  Strength is allowing people to help you.  You need to see a therapist and get help and there is no shame in that.  Be strong enough to accept help.  You don’t have to do this alone.

I don't need anyone to tell me what to do I just feel like talking into the reddit void.  I went through a seriously rough few years, I took a shit ton of weed to cope. And I mean A LOT of weed. And I'd smoke ciggerets. And I would hang out with people who didn't really care about me. Then I met someone very very special. A light and bubbly girl named Brittany. She had everything she could possibly want,  her family and extended family are quite wealthy, not that I care or even knew at the time. I was on an online dating app for sex which helped with the pain at the time. It was all i did, just screw for hours, smoke a ton if drugs, move onto the next girl (mainly because they wernt intrested in anything more) anyway back into the story. So this girl Brittany, I met her on the dating app and we talked about a bunch of stuff, she had just gotten out of an unloving relasionship, fuck yeah i thought, now I get to be her rebound. We made plans and she came to stay for a month, she had been living with her family for a short period before she came to stay with me. So she gets to my place and get this, the first thing she does is make me carry her shit inside, and I thought to myself "this bitch is going to get a really rough fucking for her rudness" I took her stuff inside and we hung out for a bit did a bit of screwing and the next day I woke up and cooked her breakfast. Then she apologised for being rude and making me bring all her stuff inside. She saw how I lived. (That being a VERY small studio where the bedroom and living room were shared and the kitchen and toilet were just over shoulder length) and she said she didn't realise how good she had it. I told her I lived like that because I was depressed and having cheaper rent meant more weed. She and I often smoked pot during her month stay. During that time I told her about all the horrible shit I went through as a kid, the forster homes, the violence, the bullying, the isoloation, the rape. She said she was sorry. I told her she had nothing to be sorry about and that bad things happen to good people. And then she just hugged me, like my first guineine loving hug. And I cried softly, without a sound. This was the first time i felt a pang of love. At the end of the arranged month she asked me what my plans were. I asked her to stay and that we'd take it on a day to day basis. Which we did. We went through so much shit togeather, like some serious deep shit. And through the whole thing she stuck by me and comforted me. For 2 and a half years. We'd lived in several different homes togeather I met her family who didn't like me at first but grew to care about me and I them. And through it all she kept me going through my depression. Until one day I figured out how to buy drugs online. I did some research on lsd, and I bought it and holy shit can I tell you what it changed my life. I didn't feel depressed at all I stopped smoking ciggies and pot, and I didn't need to take lsd after the first trip. But my partner also took a tab because we did everything togeather. And it fucking destroyed her. She felt horrible. She had a really bad trip and her underlying depression surfaced. A year forward she is getting worse. I've had to call the ambulance for her more then once. Even untie a rope off her neck she strangled herself with after she locked herself in the toilet. I support her every day the way she supported me. Because that's what love is, not just loving someone when things are good, but loving them when things are really rough. She doesn't feel like she will ever feel good again, but her depression let's up sometimes and she has a good day. I feel tremendous guilt, shame , and dishonour, and at the same time i don't feel depressed. Its a little confusing. But so far this boat is still floating, and whoever reads this I hope you keep your boat floating too.  *disclaimer i don't think anyone should take drugs

My aunt died on Christmas and the people I've told have all given me a generic sorry for your loss. Thats it. No one even cares to ask how im doing. Work not giving me paid leave so I just took one week off.  Im beginning to think that most of my friends are just robots who really don't give a shit about me.  With my mental health too, no one cares that I have crippling depression and can barely make it through a work day. The day before Christmas I got bossed around at work cos I didn't put something in its proper place. Im just tired of dealing with people's bullshit. Everyone knows I have mental health issues but treat me like im high functioning even though im not. Like yeah I drag myself to work but I wanna die every day and some days I just think its pointless to even live cos we're gonna die anyway.  One of these days I'll probably just explode from all this pain.

Hey friend, how are you doing? losing a loved one is one of the most challenging things a person can go through, especially when you're already suffering from depression. I lost my dad a long long time ago, and some days I still ball my eyes out thinking about him, and I barley even knew him. It's ok to be sad. This is a very difficult time for you, and you're allowed to cry.  If I could offer one piece of advice it would be to try to go to therapy. I dont know if you're already in therapy, but it really helps me, personally. As for work, try not to stress it to much, ok? It's just a job. Unless you really really really fuck up, they're not going to fire you. Just take it day by day, and maybe express to an HR rep or a manager you're close with that you're really struggling and need some help. I know it's hard to ask for help, but I promise you people are more inclined to lend a hand than you think. Maybe they dont actucally know how much you're struggling, and you'll never know unless you tell them.  You're life is not pointless. Many people care about you, and even if you dont think your IRL friends do, well we do. And I do. Otherwise I wouldn't spend my time writing this comment. It is hard right now, but I promise you it gets better, little by little. You just have to realize that it is going to take time, and you cannot give up.  You can get through this, and one day you'll look back and be so proud of how you overcame all these struggles. Work will get better, life will get better. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other and it will slowly happen.  Once again, I am so sorry for your loss. It's ok to be sad. I can already tell you're such a strong person, and if anything, know that I, and this whole community, has your back. You can do it friend, I believe in you : )
Thanks for this. Yeah it's just super complicated and I honestly just don't know if it's gonna get better. Thanks for your long comment, I can sense that you care from it.

I feel utterly broken and devoid of purpose. All I want is my sweet Eyore back and I won’t ever see him again. Every time I think about it I’m crushed all over again.

I’m so sorry to hear that SuccMyHorseCock :( losing a pet under any circumstances isn’t easy, let alone like that.
I know it's really hard to get through, but I know your dog would want you to keep battling and to be happy. I bet he loved his time with you, and he loved seeing you happy. It's ok to be sad, just try to keep battling through it. I'm sorry you lost such a great friend : ( it just better my friend, and I know he's looking down on you in doggy heaven and is happy for what you have and will continue to accomplish.
I fell for you. My best furry friend died in these circumstances too. Please grieve it go through the process and try to accept. Maybe down the line get another furry friend. This won’t replace but having another bit of furry companion my help. My heart goes out to you.
I'm so sorry for your loss
Yeah it hurts real bad. I didn’t know I loved anyone that much.
I wish I believed in an afterlife at times like these. It’s the fact I’ll never see pr touch him again that hurts.
Yeah I’ve had pets die in the past and it hurt. But this is on another level then previous ones. He was turning 3 in two months. I relied on him to get through the past years and now he’s gone.

I’m trying to start writing this in story form like “so I was yadda yadda” but the only way my brain is forming sentences is through the first few sentences of Eminem’s verse in “My Band”  Anyways. I was sitting in the McDonald’s parking lot with my boyfriend and we were having some pretty heavy conversation (in my eyes). And then I realize as I’m eating my ice cream cone, staring ahead and listening to him, “oh, I’m in a film scene again.”   And I turn to him and I say “do you ever see life as a movie?”  He furrows his brow and says “what do you mean?”  “Like life is just one scene after another playing out, like in a movie.”  His brow is still furrowed, and he looks confused. “No? But I’m pretty sure that’s a symptom of ptsd.”   In the moment I smile and laugh and say “you got me there.”  But fuck. Is that what dissociation is?? My best friend - my BEST FRIEND - talks about her struggles with it all the time. I always thought, “no, I don’t experience that, so I never dissociate. I know when I have in the past, but I haven’t in a long time.”  When probably two or three nights ago I was in a very life-compromising situation, full on arguing and debating with myself OUT LOUD, all while not seeing my life as a tangible thing, and not really accepting that the situation I was in was an actually serious situation, and not just a film to be played in front of my own eyes.  When people said “watching your life through a movie screen” I never realized that they meant that you were in the movie. I never realized they meant it’s like you were taken and placed onto a room with invisible cameras filming you, and you’re acting out a scene.   I didn’t realize that it meant conversations were seen more as dialogue.  Or that background noise was just sound design.  I always thought my seeing-my-life-as-a-movie was just me being dramatic and self centered. I didn’t realize it was dissociation.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kme180/student_nurse_with_severe_depression_bout_how_can/
My fiancee is a student nurse after a career change and is currently in her second year. She had setbacks due to COVID and a broken wrist (which still requires a re-set operation that she is putting off because of training). Her last placement was absolute hell and she had deliberately obstructive staff rather than anyone who would sign off her competencies. She has a history of severe depression and is taking medication, but has really gone downhill for the last month or longer. On the worst days she is barely able to take care of herself and of course it puts our relationship under terrible strain, but I try to help and support where ever I can.  She feels trapped in this career path, and has admitted that she is continuing because she feels she has no other options, but I am genuinely afraid that it is killing her. She really wanted to be a community nurse and the ward shifts are taking a serious toll on her mental and physical health. I've tried to talk about finding other options or just ways to cope with the stress, but she's not really interested at this point. I'm terrified for her and the shifts start again in a couple of weeks.  I know lots of us have depression (me included) at times and have just about any career, but I am out of ideas and looking for any advice from healthcare professionals. Is this the wrong path for her?

I can only speak on my own experience, but I was in a similar situation as a student (also healthcare) and I really can't recommend continuing. I did - I felt I was too deep into school not to, and I have now been in and out of therapy trying to cope with my work related anxiety for almost my entire healthcare career. I'm now out on mental health leave and have never been more miserable. The good news is I'm back in school changing degrees like I should have in the first place, but it was kind of an unnecessary lesson to learn for something that was always kinda obvious to begin with. That isn't to say your girlfriend won't just get used to it, but if her gut tells her that this isn't the right path for her, it really might pay off to listen.
I should have quit nursing school when I was feeling like she is feeling.  I wish I would have listened.  Nursing is a really hard profession, especially for someone with depression issues.
are you in america? why doesn’t she switch to a job not on the floor like research, sales, working for an insurance company, case manager?
hey, sorry that you are going through this...
Hi there - not a nurse or in medical school, but I was stuck in a top tier university doing a course I hated because I thought I should continue. People would tell me you're wasting the time you've already spent there if you quit, what about the money, what about the reputation etc etc. Then I went to therapy and also met my fiance, and those two people said to me: what do you want to do? Ignoring everyone else's opinions and what has happened before, what would be best for you right now in this moment? And I said I needed out. The moment I dropped out was the best moment of last year without a doubt. I literally felt like I could breathe again and I wish I had done it sooner. I struggled with depression, I barely ate, I hurt myself and felt like nothing was worth it because of the situation I was in.   There is nothing more important than your mental health - NOTHING. And if that means a few setbacks and some life adjustments, then so be it. I would not be in the positive place I am now if I hadn't left. The fact she hasn't had the wrist surgery because of her training is really worrying - her priorities are wrong. She needs to put herself first. I would recommend some therapy and some time out at the very least. Distance gives perspective.   Good luck to both of you and big high five for being a great boyfriend. 😊
I'm glad you're doing well now. I really think you're right in this case.
This is exactly what I'm afraid of. I didn't know her when she started on this path. She is a very caring person but it takes so much from her. I don't want to kill her dreams but it doesn't seem like a dream for her. In fact it's becoming a nightmare and I'm really struggling to see her getting through this.
Not in the US. She's done sales/marketing work before. Maybe it's time for a serious talk about careers.
Thanks!
It is hard to change directions when you are so far into it time and money wise.  Nursing as a whole tends to prey on people who have caring hearts.  You give and you give until there is nothing left to give anymore.  To me it seemed like those who had a touch less empathy or those who could turn it off did the best in health care.    She may need to see it for herself.  Sometimes we need to support our partners going through what they need to go through while they figure it out on their own.  Who knows, maybe she will find a calm enough nursing gig that she will love it?    She should try to avoid hospital nursing if she is already feeling this way though.  It chewed me up and spit me out fast.   I’d be happy to chat with her about it if you think that might help.  I’d also be happy to chat with you about it anytime.  Feel free to send me a DM or keep asking questions here.    You are a kind partner and she is very lucky to have someone like you in her corner. ❤️
Thank you for your reply! I think she would like to contact you sometime soon (through me - she's not on Reddit).

I wrote this in my diary a little while ago and, although I've never been depressed before, I hope it might help someone who is. Now I don't know if this is as uplifting to you as it was to me but I'm only posting to try and help.   If you're currently experiencing the bad part of life, the dark and lonely part, I beg of you to remember that the bad in life only helps you to find the beauty where you would never look for it. These parts are like an overworked mom whose child just asked her to find them their lost schoolbook. The mom walks into the room, looks around and points the book out in a place you SWEAR you looked already. In a few months, years, weeks or even days you'll find yourself sorrounded by the smell of your favourite cookies, under your feet there will be the softest carpet in the world, over your head will be a beautiful starry night and in your hands you'll hold the part of your heart that's currently missing. Remember that you can only recognize you're happy if you've been down and sad before. It's not hopeless for you or anyone.   I actually wrote that for my future self, but I think it could work. If it means anything at all to you, this moody, most of the time annoyed girl who hates almost everyone she comes across cares for you and your recovery wholeheartedly. I hope and wish the best for you and this hopefully helped, even a little bit.

It's been a while since the last time I got swallowed into that dark hole of emptiness and depression naps that lasts 18hrs a day.. M spending the holidays alone and after a few months of lockdown (I live alone so the lockdown is harder than when u live with others) things has been taking a wrong turn for a while.. And I finally reached that moment where I cant get myself to get outta my bed.. To shower.. To eat.. Nothing!  I have exams next week and I literally did nothing during my holidays but what's scary to me is not being able to pull my self out of it.. I go to therapy sessions every two weeks and honnestly nothing much is changing not like I'm depressed 24/7 but when it gets dark there's no way OUT and it FREAKS ME OUT to think about being stuck with MYSELF AND MY THOUGHTS.. I know it's so selfish of me to say that but I feel so disappointed in my "friends" I feel left out and I feel like m not important.. In such moments.. All I hope for is to get my phone n find that somebody is trying to reach me.. It somehow makes me feel like they will pull me out of it. I know I shouldn't be expecting that from anybody and I also know everybody has their own struggles they are having on their own THEIR OWN BATTLES I MIGHT NOT KNOW OF.. But Iam also hoping that somebody would care enough to notice me when I'm just a moving body with a dead soul.. When I'm drowning and afraid.. I have no will to live.. I don't even bother to self harm or anything anymore.. It's like I gave up on myself and I'm so tired of fighting.  My struggles are beyond my efforts of getting out and as much as I know that it's irrational and selfish to want someone to get me out I can't shut the emotion down. I'm so sad for having nobody in such times.. NOT EVEN MYSELF.

I'm not sure really where I should even begin to reach out about this but hopefully I'm in the right place.  Over the last half year, I've been struggling to consistently see a doctor in order to get my anxiety meds filled. Part of this is because of my anxiety in and of itself. I have social anxiety which makes it hard for me to call over phones or send messages through portals, much less have the courage to get into my car and make the drive to the office to talk with my doctor. Even with the meds, I'm always finding some excuse to avoid the struggle of dealing with any sense of anxiety. This means that I go weeks at a time without my meds. If it weren't for the fact that I had a mom who at least acknowledged how scary it is for me to make appointments, I wouldnt see a doctor at all and get meds for the next month.   The issue is that without the medicine, I feel like I have absolutely no control over my emotions. I end up getting hit incredibly hard by feelings of self loathing and then will spend a whole day in my room crying and wanting to stop existing because being like this is just a waste of air and space. I become overwhelmed with thoughts about how much of a nuisance I surely am to people, how my family deserves so much better that me, and that my boyfriend is probably fed up with me trying to garner some validation from him just so I'm reminded he doesnt absolutely loathe me. I become convinced that the world is better off without me and I just start to spiral out of control. I also become incredibly angry at the stupidest things, wanting nothing more than to act out on my rage(I never do bc the cycle moves back to me not wanting to somehow burden everyone) so I sit and fester and became mean to anyone that tries to talk with me. I assume the worst out of every interaction and basically just get trapped in a dark hole with the thought that I'm not worth a damn and that it'll be easier for everyone to realize if I just off myself. Idk how to process these emotions bc when I'm on the meds, they never get this intense and I'm able to overcome my anxiety and depression enough to shut this shit down.  My big thing is that, even as I sit here post breakdown after having been off my meds /again/ for the last week, I know these thoughts arent correct. I know that people love me, that my boyfriend doesnt hate me, and that my parents would be devastated if they lost me. I sit here and am certain that I am overthinking everything. Yet, that doesn't help?? The prevailing thoughts are still, "you're a burden, a waste of air, do everyone a favor and off yourself." I just. Dont understand how I can be so aware that it's just my anxiety and depression and emotions getting the better of me but still somehow loathe every ounce of my existence. I just want to know if there is any way I can actually stop my thoughts, using my self awareness.  I want to start improving myself, especially for this next year and I dont want to have to always rely on medications. I want to seek out a therapist but my social anxiety stops me from doing that and it's hard. However, I can't keep dragging people down with my anxiety attacks and panic attacks anytime I fall into this shitty hole of uncontrolled emotions and intense self hatred. I'm scared I'll one day hurt myself and I dont want to do that. Basically, what I'm asking is, is there anyway I can learn to control my emotions and anxiety long enough for me to get the help I really need? Simple self help tricks or something, anything. I just cant seem to get over the hurdle that follows acknowledging the problem. I'm desperate at this point because I'm growing more and more afraid that I'm going to hurt myself.  If this isnt the right place or something, I'm really really sorry. I'm just scared. Thank you so much for anyone that reads this and I will truly appreciate any words you can offer.

My name is David and I'm 15, but that ultimately doesn't matter. I have been dealing with the feelings of hopelessness and emptiness for the last couple months.  I have never been diagnosed with depression (don't know if that's how it works, I'm sorry), I'm sorry if the things I have been feeling don't have anything to do with this topic. I don't think I feel this way because of the quarantine, because I don't really talk to people all that much anyways, plus all of the feelings enabling these new feelings have appeared even before the quarantine.  I have been dealing with anxiety, especially the social kind. All kinds of social situations stress me out. I have been recently thinking about these feelings of emptiness and how some people never felt them, which is super interesting for me. I have been thinking about the concept of death lately. By this I mean the fact that I have to embrace death to live my life fully, and not the suicide aspect of death. I don't plan on taking my own life, and I don't think I ever will, but I can't see the future, so I wouldn't be able to answer the question of "Will you ever take your life" I guess I am looking for help, but venting and writing my emotions down like this helps. (I'm sorry if I put the wrong flair on this post, I'm quite confused)

Everyone always leaves me, and one of the reasons why that hurts most is because I say “I love you” too much, it’s because whenever I feel loved for the first time in a while, I feel special and happy and I want them to know that and feel loved in return and give my all to them because they made me feel a way I haven’t felt in a while, and then it all either hurts me in return because either they don’t give near as much back or leave me Bc I’m too clingy and then I feel like a failure and like why love when it’ll just end up hurting me 😔

Lol same. I just no longer delude myself into thinking romantic love is a thing for me.
Thanks..
Also FYI, You can’t say “I love you” too much.
Apparently I could :/

I don’t know if you spoken to a therapist before, I have.  It can change your life.  They also have medicines that don’t completely zomby you out nowadays, it can really help.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/km0vip/i_cant_talk_to_anyone_about_my_feelings/
I just hate it when I'm the one needing help. I'm always the one trying to help others but if I tell people about my problems I feel really really uncomfortable and I feel like I don't have the right to feel sad. I hate it when I know people worry about me cause I know how it feels to constantly have to worry about someone and I don't wanna do this to anyone. On the one hand I want to tell people I'm not feeling well but on the other hand... my brain is always like:" how can you do this to person a? Now they are worried about you. Well done". I'm just so used talking about whatever bothers other people. I can't remember the last time I actually told someone I am not okay. I once tried telling it to my boyfriend but I felt sooo uncomfortable so I quickly changed the topic to his topics again. Also I feel like my brain is like: no talking about problems=no problems. Like...if you nobody else can see it, it's not real. Idk what to do anymore. I just feel so trapped in my mind. Sorry btw, I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit because I don't really have depression but I didn't kniw where else to post this.

I can so relate. When you find yourself needing to say "I'm not okay" please message me. I will listen to anything you have to say - No judgment
I feel you. I came here to write the exact same thing. I feel like im losing the battle. So if u need to talk to someone who will understand u, im here
I feel you, but you should try talking to someone about it like a therapist if u don’t already? And I’m always here for you:)
We are truly alone in this
Do you want someone to talk to?
Some things feel okay to share and some don't. I share the fact you regret talking bc now they are worried or bothered. Also putting others before yourself and masking and pretending the problems are not here is very toxic but it works on the moment. But you know like I do, the problems are still very here and they are not pretending to leave bc you told them to. My comment was kinda pointless, but I felt like reacting to your experience because I can see myself in it. I tend to express myself to a very limited amount of people, one ore two, because I found these persons who can relate to what I'm saying and who always give good advices. But the guilt of worrying them or even bothering them is still here each times and I always end up regretting talking and thinking I should've shut up. I kinda also feel like I'm not worth listening to, and that the others should go before me. It's unpleasant finding yourself being in the place of the one needing help, and I'd rather help all my loved ones but not them helping me. I guess
I’m literally the exact same boat!! But that does mean I’m great at listening to people if you ever want someone to talk to :)
I can truly relate. Never thought it’d turn out like this.
i feel similar. i have the issue where i hurt and have problems but my outside life seems ok. its really not. i have another friend who has outside problems and so when i talk to our mutual friends they dont believe me when i try to talk to them. it is just very annoying so in trying to get therapy at least. if you are able to you should look into it because just talkinng helps. im also always open. also some problems are hard to talk about and you dont have to talk about them if you dont want to. set your boundaries with yourself and just try to talk about what you can.
You’re stronger than I am omg. I wish I could do what you do. I let my stuff too much out. It’s not particularly good at all. but one thing is I’ve just learned to let the walls down and show my true colors of how I feel. I can’t put the walls back up and I don’t really want too either. Not really, anyways. It feels better to get it out. It’s supposed to help you process it better. One thing I’d say to you is that I had a different experience and reasons why I hid my stuff from others and I felt alone a lot more. Now I allow myself to be more open about what’s going on, and yes I tend to say sorry and stuff a lot but in the end it makes me feel much better. The feeling bad from putting problems of mine on others especially family is there but don’t for long because fact is everyone needs a release somewhere. Maybe it’s your boyfriend, maybe it’s reddit or maybe is in a different friend etc, etc I don’t know if this helps or not. But the ability you have to do that you do should not go unnoticed me.
Yup Exactly. And it gets even worse when you finally open up to someone and they respond with that you should be grateful for everything and to just drop the act.  Btw this is my first time commenting on reddit. Sorry if any thing seems out of place in the text. Would be really helpful if someone corrected if I got anything wrong from it.
I try so hard to suppress my depression. I’ve stopped going to therapy and it’s kind of like working out. Now that I haven’t done it for a while I’m dreading to start over and look for a new therapist and tell them all this trauma and angsts. I woke up today trying to feel positive and then it all went downhill when I started scrolling through socials and wasting time. I started feeling anxious how I woke up late and spent so much time scrolling and then spiraled down. I’m now crying and back in bed. I can’t stop giving myself this pity party... I get embarrassed having to tell my boyfriend I’m having another meltdown. It’s not his responsibility to always lift me up but then when I try to hide it he gets upset and wants me to lean on him. Ugh idk I’m just rambling here and sorry not even offering good advice or anything but just know you’re not alone. I’m waiting for this crying phase to stop so I can get up finally. I hope you feel better and have someone to talk to. I know a therapist would make me feel better... I just have to summon some self will to do it. From a human being to another wishing you the best. 💞
thank you for the offer! That's really nice of you. I gotta go sleep now but if I'm feeling bad tomorrow I'll talk to you. If you are feeling not okay, you can message me too and I'll listen because you really deserve it because you are a great human. Have a nice day/night! c:
Thanks i might message you tommorow. Goodnight from australia.
Hey don't give up please. Do you wanna talk about your problems? Maybe I can help you. I really gotta go sleep though, but we could talk tomorrow if you wanna.
thanks that's very nice of you! Sadly I can't talk to a therapist.
It would ve really nice to talk about that stuff with someone but I gotta sleep because it's 1am where I live. I really appreciate your offer tho. Can I maybe talk to you tomorrow?
thanks that's very nice of you! If you want someone to talk to, I'm here too :)
thank you for your comment :). I wish I could open up about my problems like you. If you ever need anyone to talk to, I'm here
I’m sorry that happened to you.  If you get up the courage to talk about your problems with someone and trust them that much, you would think they would respect your decision and at a minimum listen to you even if they don’t feel like they could offer help.  Sometimes, just a I understand your upset and I’m here for you to talk to is all we need..
Thank you! I hope to hear from you even if you are not feeling bad too 🙂
Oh.. well I’m here for u if u need it :)
I was really in your boat until maybe a few months ago. Couldn’t talk about stuff truthfully or openly to people. It required a change in perception of others. Like allowing yourself be a little vulnerable. I used to cry and whenever anyone tried to ask me what was wrong I just couldn’t speak. Nothing would come out. Even as hard as I tried and it irritated everyone, including me. It’s not always a pleasant experience but it is cathartic to let things out. Though with that said sometimes opening up can feel like a setback and make you feel worse because you confronted things and talked about them out loud. Maybe even try 7cups website? Or even looking at yourself in the mirror and talking out loud to yourself about things that are weighing you down.   Thank you for that 😊 I just might at some time.
Yes exactly. Thank you so much.

Be truthful with your loved ones about it.  It will work out for you, I know it.
Thank you. I have gotten a lot of warnings from people on here about it but personally I have only had good experiences after telling someone close to me. Maybe it's because I do a good job managing it.
I think that’s part of it too.  You’re not telling them to warn them about you, you’re telling them so they know and can be supportive and understanding.  They will help you get through it too.  You’re not alone.

I just watched the most horrific sub Reddit iv ever seen. Grusomme historical pictures. And I don't feel anything but a overwhelming nothingness. I don't really know what to say.   I guess I'm just so offset that I wanted confirmation on what I should feel. Currently taken way to many sleep aids mixed with anti anxiety meds to dull everything. But forreal do other people like believe in the future? I'm working towards a history PhD. And at this point I feel like if I do my job il just be murdered by one of the 15 country's trying to bury their historys fucked up shit. Like if I don't do my job il be depressed if o do it. Il just be murdered and someone else will do it.

I know that if I exercise, I feel a sense of achievement, I get endorphins from exercising and generally feel a lot more positive about things.  I have got a training plan arranged with either running or exercises to do six days a week (I thought the accountability would help) and I haven't done anything for over a week.   I feel very little motivation to do anything which isn't helped by the fact it's so cold and miserable outside and gets dark quickly.  I know if I did get out there and go for a run or, if it's an alternate day, do my body weight exercises, then I'd feel a lot better about things, but I just can't seem to make myself do anything. In a normal holiday season we'd be visiting family and friends and going on days out, but that's not allowed due to my country's Coronavirus restrictions. Part of this issue is having absolutely no structure to my day.  I'm off work for the holidays so I stay in bed until midday feeling shitty, get up for lunch, drag my family to the park so the kids can get some fresh air, then come home and slouch until dinner, then go to bed when they do and spend the evening on my phone.  Anyone heaved themselves out of this hole?

I definitely felt something similar when we first went into lockdown. my friend suggested an app that had simple bodyweight exercises that I could do. They were short and quick sets (10-15 Min) and it was part of a 28 day challenge. The daily reminders from the app definitely helped keep me going too. And all it needed was a yoga mat.   Since it's cold and dark outside where you are, perhaps indoor exercises are the answer. Another possibility is to schedule daily zoom calls with a friend and do your workouts together. That way you keep each other motivated to keep exercising according to the schedule. Plus it makes working out more social.  I'm really glad that you're looking for ways to get moving. It's definitely a good first step in the right direction.
Sounds like me.  I run to help my depression it really makes me happy afterwards and I can think during the run.  Life changing.  Other people interested in doing the same will help, I use the Nike run app and have some friends on there and we do plans per month usually a mileage total or something as a goal and push each other.  We also do a google doc to share with each other and do push-ups, burpees, plank and a few other body weight excersises on days in between run days..
Thank you, your response means a lot.  Just writing this post was enough to re-shift my thinking and I did the body weight exercises that my trainer set (I thought having a trainer to report back to would keep me motivated, and it did at first, but I seem to have slipped back into inaction).  Doing the exercises made me realise that they're actually only 20 minutes and that last time I'd probably been interrupted by my children which is why it took me 45 minutes. 20 minutes + recovery is infinitely more manageable than 45 minutes + recovery, so that's reassured me in terms of fitting in the next set in 2 days time.  Agree inside workouts would be better, but part of my training is to get me back into running, which I really need to do outside (gyms closed here). We do have a relatively short and mild winter so I'm wondering if it's a case of sucking it up and then reaping the benefits as the days get longer and we head into spring?   I kind of need someone to come and live with me and just tell me what I need to do and when. A proper adult!
I love running too! I used to run outdoors until I got mugged while running two months back. it is definitely a great form of exercise and it is super freeing when you're in the zone.  Building your conditioning and stamina by working out in doors can be a decent first step. I used an app called Home Workout (it has a fair amount of cardio stuff too) and most of the routines are free, including the 28 day challenges. It might be a good one for you too :)

Long long story I think, typing this on my phone and really need to vent out because I'm fed up.  Currently 25 and suffer from PTSD, Depression and have been looking after my parents since 13 with their mental problems then resumed at 23 after finishing university.   Suffer from PTSD upon seeing a murder in Abu Dhabi Airport in the Men's bathroom. Was instructed by my parents to just walk around the pool of blood to urinate or urinate in the water fountain. Did neither of them.   In 2008 I suffered from verbal abuse from my parents and was not properly treated on a medical operation and has taken to 2019 (11 years to get treated for it). Attempted suicide by strangling myself and kept holding a knife towards my chest wanting to stab myself.   After failing to strangle myself I kept cutting myself on purpose (due to eczema) as it felt good to actually divert my mental pain to physical pain.  During college I had no friends to talk to and had no support from anyone in my family, the sixth form removed me from a level maths and my economics teacher was always making me the joke of the class by the clothes I wear.  My health issue continued to get worse during this stage  and I couldn't seek help for my health issue till 2014 as I was not allowed to see the doctors for my health issue as my parents kept insisting that it can go away naturally.  Evidently for each year going untreated my condition kept getting worse which impacted my studies and focus .  Time skip to university period;  I made friends for the first time since high school, people who I can rely on and be somewhat myself, I managed to get medication for my health issue which temporarily fixed a different health issue I wasn't aware of and bad extra circumstances for my coursework and exam.    Regarding 'somewhat myself' I was mostly doing what other people where doing so I felt like I fit in, there's still more I need to discover about myself but I don't know where to start.  In 2015  my dad attempted suicide due to my mum kept putting down my dad to the point he got fed up My mum shown no remorse when he nearly passed out and continued to put down my dad even more.  I somehow did a degree in computer science and got a job but I dislike what I do and want to pursue geology which is what I want to do but I don't have the qualifications for it.  To this day I'm still in touch with them but I had to move back in with my parents as I can't afford to buy a property yet In the UK. Both if my parents have diabetes and display symptoms of dementia but with my mum also displaying mental signs.  I try to do my best to keep sane from all this but it's gotten to the point where I just want to escape all this, find out what sort of person I want to be and become that person..but there's so many limitations because I can't escape from this unless I rent out (don't want to as then I will mostly have to stay in the rental market and save up more to buy a house)  Currently which may sound pathetic, my escape haven is to watch the magicians (as it's about people with depression finding their own haven in fantasy magic), collect crystals. Thats it..other than that I feel like an empty shell just there to be used or make people feel welcomed or happy by using me as a tool..  Apologies if I posted in the wrong subreddit wasn't sure to post it in this or as a personal rant.

I’m (presumably) experiencing some physical symptoms of my depression/anxiety, namely slight nausea and the overwhelming sensation of being weak/no energy. It’s almost like I can feel that I’m deprived of nutrients or something. It might be that I’m deficient in some nutrient, which I plan on asking my doctor about. I’m eating and drinking enough water, and I’ve tried to limit my coffee intake to 1-2 cups a day. Any advice for dealing with symptoms like this?

It's definitely worth speaking to your doctor. It may well be that you're not getting enough nutrition. Personally I had similar symptoms but it was because of my depression and the chemical imbalance. So, it's definitely a good idea to get a professional to give you a diagnosis.

So I have a friend who’s depression has been strongly hitting them nowadays. It’s always been bad but recently it’s just taking up her energy and I don’t know what to do. I’m visiting her soon because I have a present to give her, but our only way of communication right now is texting because of COVID. If you have depression, what’s the best way of comforting you? Not just hugs and words. I’ll go out of my way so please share what would comfort you when you’re in need.

You being present definitely makes a huge difference. Sometimes all someone needs is to know that there is a kind friend looking out for them. And you keeping in touch and texting and letting her know she's not alone is definitely a really good thing.  I know it's a regularly repeated line but does she see a professional for her depression. They have the training to help people through behavioural techniques or just offering a safe space to unpack the challenges we face. They would also be better equipped to see if your friend needs to see a psychiatrist for medication.
She does have a therapist. From what I know, her therapist calls in once a week (usually on weekends) for about 10 minutes but she said once a week isn’t enough and feels selfish for thinking so. She didn’t mention medication and I don’t think she takes any because I never saw her at school with medication. But what I do know is she doesn’t really tell much to her therapist when she does call her because her mom tells her to stay in the room as her and doesn’t get privacy. So I’m guessing she’s holding everything in because she can’t talk to her therapist...
I glad to hear she's talking to a therapist, but you're right, 10 minutes seems far too short. It sucks that many places don't have free/affordable healthcare. If her parents have medical insurance it might be worth asking her to ask them if they can help with it.  Holding in all the feelings and challenges is definitely not the answer. It can make everything so much harder and it's like a dam wall stopping all the feelings. It can be quite a lot harder if that wall starts to crack.  I don't want to put any pressure on you but if you can, it might help to let her know she can talk to you.
Thanks for the advice. Her parents know but they don’t believe depression is real even though she has a diagnosis so they don’t plan on getting her the professional help she needs which is why I’m even more concerned for her holding it in. I reassure her when she messages me that I’m there for her but she says she doesn’t want to let me in because she’s scared of getting disappointed if I leave. I told her I’d wait till she’s ready so I just wanna know how to comfort her till that day comes.
If you're going to get to see her, perhaps plan something fun that you both enjoy? as a way to keep your spirits up during these times? Sometimes the actions speak louder than the words and you going to the extra effort may resonate.   If she (or you) are dealing with social anxiety too, perhaps something lowkey like watching your favourite series or just jamming out to some music might be good too.   Definitely keep the conversation going and when she's ready and comfortable, she will probably start to open up and share her struggles with you.   &#x200B;  During all of this, make sure to take care of your own mental health too. See a professional if you need to and use other techniques that might work for you like journalling or mindfulness practices to help manage your own anxiety and energy levels. Remember, you're also a person with their own needs and you need to make sure to take care of yourself too.

Hello there. I have a serious problem right now and I don’t know how to deal with it... I’m very frustrated and I don’t know what to do.  So, I have been in a relationship with someone. They already suffered from different mental illnesses (depression, bpd, ptsd, etc.) and tried their best to handle it. They started therapy, changed their living situation which was very unstable, found friends... And it seemed to go well. I knew they were struggling, still, but it seemed like they were on a good way. Recently, we broke up because that person felt like they have to work on themselves and also experience life a bit. It was hard for me, but I only want the best for them. I have tried my very best for them for a long time and I thought “If that helps, so be it”.  Recently, they have been drinking pretty often though and said things from “I want to try all drugs” to “I don’t care if this kills me” and even “I have lost all hope”. It hurts. I love them. I know that they’re just really really frustrated about life, about trying to change and feeling like it doesn’t work... About everything. I know they don’t want to do it because it’s good for them, but because they don’t know what to do else.  I have talked to them a lot, told them about my worries, that I still have hope and that I’ll never leave them. Today, they tried to cut contact to “Not hurt me when they slowly kill themselves”. I told them that no matter if I am around them or not, it will still hurt me a ton... We had a long conversation, I tried to visit them to talk to them in person, got send away, and I then finally got to write with them again. We had a long long talk and now... We have agreed on staying in contact but they will not try to change and they won’t tell me about their self-destructive behavior.  I am scared about them. I don’t know what to do anymore. They have mentioned a lot of times that they have given up hope... I know it’s not my task to change them or convince them, especially not alone. I have tried involving people close to them so they can also try to help.. But those conversations have been going on for long now and I’m scared I’ll loose them to drugs or death...  Is there anyone who has experience with this? Or just some kind motivating words? I feel like I’m slowly starting to doubt everything I’ve done for them and us in the last years and everything that I value... I have a big problem with self-blame, so yeah, naturally I’m scared that my “supporting” actions weren’t helping at all, eventhough they told me that they have been...

I don’t know how much longer I can do this for.   I’ve tried medication, and I’ve taken four different ones and all of them keep me from sleeping to the point where I can’t go to work.  I can’t take off from work, because I won’t be able to feed myself. I took a new job in April in a field that I was genuinely interested in and actually enjoyed, and now that I do it for a living it’s just boring and I dread getting up and going to work every day.   Exercise helps, but it’s so hard to bring myself to go work out on top of going to work that I can’t reliably do it.   I’ve gone on a diet, and I’ve already lost 40 pounds but I still feel the same mentally.   I have a fiancée who is very supportive and a cat who barely leaves my side when I’m home, but that only does so much on my bad days.   I’m just so tired. Somebody please help me, I can’t deal with this anymore.

I tried to vent to my online best friend 2 days ago but she got annoyed at me towards the end because I wouldn't stop talking and then she ignored me. Today she said I should talk to people irl about these things cause she's just a random person online. I feel pathetic. I really thought she cared about me. Who am I kidding, why would anyone care about me? I've felt really depressed recently and I told her that, and when I needed to rant, she got annoyed and left. I've always been labelled as annoying. I literally got the award for 'most annoying' in my class one year. Why am I so annoying? Why can't I just be likeable? Why am I such an idiot? I made her sit through all that exhausting stuff and yet I expected her to listen, I'm so selfish. Maybe I really should just leave everything and run away, I'm sure people would be happier if I wasn't around. I'm such an idiot. Why do I always fuck things up?! As soon as I have a good relationship with someone, I just fuck it up! I'M SO FUCKING STUPID. I'm too much of a coward to end it all so I don't know what to do. My chest feels heavy and I'm filled with anger, I want to cut myself because I'm so mad, I want to break something, I want to pull out my hair. Why am I such a fuck up. I should just die

I wouldn't say its your fault so much as someone who was not the best person to rely on. I mean it was a shit thing to do to just ignore you and not just explain. I would have to say that the other person has some pretty messed up social issues themselves. The world is not a caring place right now. People thrive and get off on hurting other people or at the very least watching them suffer. Sadly most do not have the practical capacity to higher thinking because they do not trust other people. This is mainly because they themselves cannot be trusted and project.
Oh, i'm so sorry you feel that way. Nothing of that it's your fault, really. And you're not and idiot or annoying. It's just sometimes hard for some people to be there when someone need them. You are definitely worthy of attention and your friendship should be appreciated. Breath, and keep going. Again, I'm so sorry for how you feel. I really hope it gets better for you.

I give zero fucks about this world and its people from now on. Neither about myself. I am becoming the toxic and the bad person that people always imagined when they look at me to my face and my skin color. I have believed the world could become a place where everyone is threatened equal for a fucking 28 years but it's not. It wont be ever healed and those who thinks within themselves are healed are not.   I have been threatening people bad, be jerk and ghost everyone without exception even those who look on the surface tries to help but in reality everyone has hidden agendas behind their intentions. Everyone wants to use you either for their inner psyche or for some real physical benefit. They themselves want to feel better not you. That's why there's this toxic positivity exists online across all the forums and boards. Maybe I should join some terrorists that people want me to be when they look at me so then I can kill your sons and daughters in the future. Is that what you really want from people like me? To bring destruction to this world? I have passed the point already. The 2021 will not be better year and it will be even worse than 2020. The collective has serious problems unraveling and it will take many lives within you pitiful lives. And I wont be ever easy on anybody anymore. Fuck you all.

Kind of a rant too: Sometimes it really feels like there's some outside force conspiring against me and trying to make me as miserable as possible. I spent so much of my life trying to actually HAVE a life and to be happy. I finally got that when I moved to NYC. I was finally happy. I found a perfect balance of introvert and social activities. I went places. My diet and sleep were great.  And then what happens? A global pandemic tears apart life as we know it, right as I'm starting to enjoy myself. Of course something big like a pandemic turns the world upside down, making activities I've wanted to do for a long time and have finally summoned up the courage to do impossible.  I’ve been burning out at work, at a job I love and always wanted, and I know it’s because of the pandemic. I’m calling out more bc I don’t have the mental or physical strength to get out of bed. I feel like such a failure, I’m letting my clients down and putting more work on my coworkers. I’ve always been the one to help out when the situation’s reversed, I feel so guilty to be in this position.  The 3rd anniversary of my mother’s suicide is in less than a month. I was able to plan for it the last 2 years by going outside and being with people, but that’s not gonna be able to happen with the pandemic. I’m alone.  And I hate the people who are still traveling while I’m making sacrifices. One of my coworkers traveled 3 hours across the country for Christmas and I’m so pissed at her. I don’t even think she’s gonna follow the quarantine guidelines. I feel like I’m being gaslighted when I see shit like this, I feel like I’m going crazy.  Thanks for reading and for any support, life just really sucks for me right now.

Sorry to hear you are struggling.  It sounds as if it primarily caused by the current covid situation and not ongoing depression.  At least there is an end in sight!  Everyone has their own maximum patience for this pandemic, and while it's frustrating that some ignore the guidelines completely from something as simple as wearing a mask, to those that operate cautiously but still choose to do things like travel and socialize, to those that have holed up completely and won't show their faces till it's over... you can't be surprised by this and it shouldn't make you angry.  We should appreciate that the vast majority of people operate prudently and in turn has helped keep the case numbers lower than they could be.

You’re you. No matter what, that person will still be you. Don’t think about being “lacking” or “missing” something, because depression is not what defines you - we all are the sums of our experiences, so no matter how interlocked you are with those feelings, they can’t be absolute.  In the end, in my very personal but honest opinion, we are what we are. As a matter of fact, physically, you aren’t 100% the same person as yesterday anyway. In another couple of years most of you should be new - don’t be afraid of change! humans are made to grow, adapt and thrive. Instead of fearing who you will become, look forward to that person.  Its a new version of you after all, mind and body, and they’re going to be wonderful.
I have had occasional depression throughout my life, but not nearly as long as you have. But I can say that I sort of understand how you feel. It becomes something that almost defines you, a part of you that even though you don't like, has always been there. There are times after I get over it that I would feel so anxious because it felt like something was missing, but I'm going to tell you that over time you will feel so much better. It's like any change, it feels strange at first and you kind of want to go back, but then you accept the change and realize that this isn't bad at all. It's unfortunate how people need to get over such a big mental hurdle just to feel "normal" but when that time comes I hope you grab on to it and live life to the fullest as was intended. It's great to see things with new eyes and without the dark cloud dampening all the happy moments, so all in all imma say don't be afraid because i'm sure the person you will become will be a good one.

I could probably consider this a rant so I will mark it under that flair.  Life just seems to be getting worse and worse for me. So many negative things happened to me this year and there are no changes. All of the emotional trauma is not healed and my mind feels so crowded. I am struggling extremely hard and it seems no matter what I do, I am stuck in this painful state of mind. I have tried to make changes in my life, pray for things to be different, but nothing really comes out of it. Each time I put myself out there, I am met with things spiraling downwards. I don't know where to go from here, or what I am supposed to do. Everything just hurts emotionally.   &#x200B;  I can't vent to family and friends. I know it drains them. I know they cannot keep dealing with it and they don't understand. I cannot afford therapy and I don't know but my mind reaches deeper and deeper into this dark place. I am so tired and I just want to give up so badly. I don't know how much fight I have left in me to keep going up this hill that never seems to end.

There has just been so much shit going on in my life I can barely function. Ive hidden literally all my emotion from my close friends so they don't get concerned and I just break down randomly now. I have enough control over that, at least. I just hate the holidays now because they are a constant reminder of the people ive lost. The people I almost lost. I can't eat. I sleep less and less every night. Ive lost all interest in what I used to look forward to not even 2 weeks ago. I honestly considered ending it all, but that would juat leave my family worse off than it already is. I won't do that to them. Not intentionally, anyway. Reddit is one of the few places I actually bring this up, because I dont trust anyone. There is nobody I can confide in, or rely on. He'll, my parents just yell at me when I have a breakdown so I cant even show that to them. Maybe I should end it. Do them a fucking favor. Do myself a favor. I cant though, im too much of a fucking bitch to do it. I cant go down the road to recovery because I get slapped in the face and told im fine by everyone i know. Metaphorically, that is. I just... I can't anymore, guys. Someone please tell me what im supposed to do.   Edit: I told my friends about it and they up and ditched me... Jesus Christ maybe I should. If nobody who I thought would care actually does, why stick around?

I absolutely understand. I feel the same way. But just remember you are not the only one. I m no good with words but I would suggest you to seek some help . I really think talking to a therapist might help. Just don't loose hopes. Be strong . And if you want to share anything don't hesitate. You can tell me if you want to.

So today sucked. On the positives, I managed not to burst into tears during my meeting. The conns, I’ve felt completely defeated all of today. It felt like nothing was right all day. I spent most of the day tense, just waiting for the worst to happen. I really need to get out of my head. Got some new meds today for the depression. Old ones didn’t really help and just made me dizzy for a while when I took them. They say they’ll make you drowsy so I’m going to take them tonight and see how it goes.

Music. Not sure if it actually makes me feel better or merely serves as a distraction that allows peace but whatever works I guess 🤷‍♂️
This is probably going to sound stupid ... but the thing that always makes me smile no matter how bad I feel is ERMAGERD memes.  Just seeing that word and thinking in my head about how it sounds makes me giggle.
Animal/children antics.. those viral cat videos too~ there is something so innocent and at the same time domineering lol.
My piggies are helping me rn. I’m manic and going through a spot.
I think maybe the reason I'm still here is because of how excited my dogs get when they see me. I don't know what they see in me, but I'm not complaining. I love them so much, especially when they come running at me when they first see me for the day, almost knocking themselves over because they're wagging their tails so hard that it flings their entire bodies from side to side ❤
My girlfriend's smile. I mean her photo.  PS: She passed away in May 2020. Or I lost my everything in May 2020
Might be silly but, when I´m feeling low, I google "fat cats" and look at the images. Something about the roundness of cats makes me happy.
Bunnies. I could be at rock bottom, but seeing a picture of a bunny is the ONLY thing that will always be able to bring back some amount of joy. And if it's just 0.0001%, it's something. I really love bunnies.
When my dog cuddles me in the morning. Every day she waits for me to move in bed, so she knows I'm awake enough to pet her... then  she snuggles and sleeps next to me. It's precious and makes me feel so great... my mornings have improved a lot since adopting her.
Dogs
Not seeing wild animals run from you causes you joy? Well it strikes me great fear when a bear is running at me.   For me running konusuba.
Hey thats great!
HAHAHA LOVE IT
I'm also very entertained by babies laughing. But these answers are all awesome!
Good piggies
I’m so happy you’re still here ❤️ keep fighting
Oh shit i was gonna say necrophiliac alert jk tho I’m sorry she’s passed
Lmaooo that’s such a good idea
That’s so cute
Aww
🐕
LMAO that’s funny
Baby giggles make me giggle too.. compulsively, like witchcraft. A chubby baby smile is also pretty efficient, indeed.
I have no words! Thank you btw for the description.
Well that's true. Even goose. Have you seen a goose charging at you. Like fuck that big ass angry fried chicken honking at me
Sorry if it offended you tho
I charge back at them (usually works)
No problem. It was kind of funny tho. Put a smile on my face for once, rarely happens since she passed. I should have worded it right. Her smile also keeps me away from killing myself.
USUALLY. ....
Yeah.. 💀

Just when I thought life couldn’t get any worse it did. And it keeps happening over and over again. I’m done with it. I just need to drop dead.

Sorry to hear about what you are going through. It is tough to be hopeful in such dark times.
I do sometimes feel the same thing. I hope it gets better. Don't loose hope.keep going.
I know how you feel. Just remember that feelings are an ebb and flow and maybe try to find someone to talk to.
Thank you :/

I am so lost and confused. My boyfriend never showed any signs of depression. He owns a successful business, owns a nice house and does well for himself. He's smart, attractive, fit, kindhearted and loved by everyone.  I don't understand why or how he could do this. I am in disbelief.  He said he was going to be out of town for work on his birthday and would be back and we can celebrate his 40th birthday and Christmas this past weekend. He had given everyone Christmas presents before he left and seemed fine and happy.  How could I not have known. I feel guilt, maybe if I given him more attention. More intimacy. He tried to have sex with me the night before he left and I denied that from him. I knew I should've called him on his birthday but settled with a text message.  I didn't even know until 2 days after when his sister posted his passing online. I just assumed he was busy and didn't want to bother him.

Don't feel guilty. There's a lot of internal conversation that happens that the people outside his head space will never know. The worst part is dealing with a society that says men should keep feelings bottled up because exposing emotions is considered a "weakness".  You are not the cause of this. You are not responsible for what happened.  Take it from a 40 year old man struggling with an existential crisis, and low self esteem, it's a struggle that's often hidden and often never shared because of the stigma and fear of judgment /rejection.
Honestly as a suicidally depressed person myself, I highly doubt he was thinking about anything you've done/not done. And it sounds like he tried to do everything in his power to make it as painless as possible for his family (that includes you too)   It's a fucking awful thing and he was a victim just as much as you, so you shouldn't blame him or yourself. (Not saying you would've blamed him obviously but I'm just pointing it out that you need to cut yourself some slack here) You're both equally blameless, it's a disease, but it's one that some people can effectively hide until one day it gets too much.  Wishing you all the best.
I’m so sorry this happened. I wish I knew what to say to lift this burden from you. I know this is the unimaginable, but it is not your fault. And I know a stranger on the internet saying that might feel like a load of Bull, but I promise you that these decisions are made in a dark place where people can hardly be reached, and you not noticing or intervening is not your fault and you are not guilty. I hope that you are able to find peace soon.
First, I am dearly sorry for your loss, and please try not to blame yourself for his passing. A lot of times, people choose to hide their depression because they are afraid of what might happen in the event they reveal it to others. Speaking from myself (I was diagnosed with mild depression) I was always afraid to tell my parents about how I felt because I was afraid they wouldn't understand, or that I would burden them with the news. I was also scared of how others would perceive me, as there's a lot of stigma attached to mental illness/health. I've heard this is common amongst people with depression. Please, don't be afraid to reach out to others if you start feeling similar.
You don't know about this stuff like ever. Most of us ESPECIALLY MEN have learned to hide our depression or any negative mood for the sake of not getting judged by both men and women and this is why men suicide rates are so abysmally high.      In the end of the day it's not your fault neither his it's the shitty society's. I'm personally glad i snapped out of my own depression and have disregarded people as a whole and finally i am leading a happy life with extremenly rare relapses that dont last more than a day or two.     As for the sex part, sex does not cure depression if all it makes it worse after you release your hormones cause you become more moody afterwards at least thats what it was for me so it might even be worse for a male with lower T levels due to age.
I am so sorry for your loss.  You need to let yourself grieve but you can't blame yourself for this. He likely had decided on this for a bit and many times there aren't outward signs people can pick up on right before it happens.   He clearly had his own issues despite how well balanced and we'll established he was.   Depression. Doesn't care about all that and it can strike thoes who have nothing all the way to thoes who have everything.    I'm sorry he lost his battle and you lost someone dear to you my prayers and thoughts go out to you .  It might help to speak with a counselor or therapist if you need some help theu might be able to give you added support through this.  Please be safe.
I am really sorry for you and for family. You have to remember that you are not guilty at all. This feeling is only created by your sadness.. but it is not real. Depression is unpredictible disease our soul. Dont think that you should know, see something because very often it is just impossible. Maybe something happen this day. Maybe everything before was fine. Even if not, that is not your fault honey. That is a life. Very brutal truth. When people say that men cant cry, when people say that men have to carry about their family, when people say that men have to be strong and so independent.. they ruins someone life. Because those men feel that they cant be sad and cant talk about this. That's rly sad... but these are stereotypes. I know that if you know about his sadness you will do everything to help him. Take care about yourself. I am with you. I am rly sorry as I said..
Hi OP.  First, I am so sorry for your loss. Losing someone is never easy, but losing them to suicide can be even harder. Right now your mind is looking for a way to rationalize what happened. It's working overtime trying to create a scenario in which this makes sense, especially because your boyfriend was quiet about his feelings.   &#x200B;  The way you're feeling right now is completely valid. You have experienced a trauma. I highly recommend that you talk to a counselor to help you work through this grief. In the meantime, be kind to yourself. You loved him and brought joy to his life. You are and were enough and his loss isn't something that you caused by not having sex with him or giving him enough intimacy.   &#x200B;  Take care of yourself <3
I’m here if you wanna talk...
If you read the work of Dr. Joe Dispenza in his latest book "Becoming Supernatural," you will find a woman who went through the same situation that you do. Please don't blame yourself for what happened to your boyfriend. It is exactly because he had everything in the external world that he could ask for and still he is not fulfilled that led to his suicide.
I am so sorry, that is so sad and devastating.   I just want to say: you will feel guilty. But you couldn't have known. I felt guilty about a friend I wasn't even friends with anymore. I felt if ever he really needed something, of course I'd have been there.   I'm sure he knew you were there for him, I think people are just lost in a spiral where they think it's only their problem, there is no solution, they don't want to burden anyone... And it's a horrible mystery you will never solve.   I hope you can be kind to yourself.
My condolences. TBH you could have given him a call. I think two days without contact is enough for me to get concerned but I don't know how your relationship worked before. But a lot of things can be triggering and Christmas is especially difficult for people with depression. May you find peace.
I hope you find peace with your crisis and get help to overcome your problems. You say you are struggling but what you typed to the op takes strength and kindness, remember to show yourself that kindness as you deserve it too.
Bet thing to do is vent, don't be of your emotions. Embrace what makes you human. You are meant to feel, being emotionless is the trait of a robot or psychopath. Embrace your feelings, they mean that you're alive. Never give up. If you're depressed, let people know, find out the root cause and work to correct what ever is making you depressed, burying will always end badly.
I agree with this comment , and add that I feel like he made sure that you couldn't tell any of the signs. I had a serious attempt a few months ago, and my family felt blindsided. They wished they knew before, but obviously my plan was to make sure nobody knew because I didn't want to be stopped. I love my family so much and they do so much for me, but it was still something I felt like I have to do. I assume this was true for your boyfriend as well. Suicide has everything to do with the person themselves, not about the ones who love them/the ones they love..   I'm so sorry OP for your loss. I know you won't feel ok for a while. If you're not currently seeing a therapist, I think it would be a great idea to start so you can process this in the healthiest and the more supported way you can
Yes definitely the added issues with men. Plus men tend to be more violent in their attempts, which equals to more success in carrying it out. A lot of times it will be an impulsive decision. That's why if someone had concerns it's a good idea to remove any weapons from them.
What you said is not necessary, don’t be a condescending asshole.
I don't really see that as strength. It's more trying to break that barrier that society has placed and trying to let people know they're not alone. Especially during the pandemic.  Besides. This is more about OP than me. I just... Wanted to tell them that it's not their fault, and guilt is normal in terms of grieving the loss of someone. Survivor's guilt, I think it's called?
:p What you said is not necessary, don’t be an asshole.
I’m just trying to complement you because you said you were struggling. I feel It takes strength to even attempt to break the barrier you describe. You’re not alone either.  The post is about the OP but I have nothing of value to help the OP after reading their post...yet I saw your comment and something called out to me so I wanted to be nice to the person attempting to comfort another. I hope you have a good day and I hope the OP finds the closure she needs and heals.
Sorry. I'm.. Not very good with compliments, heck. I have a hard time with mirrors.  Thank you for the compliment.
It’s all good, I can’t relate to mirrors but I struggle with complements myself. Sometimes I get so defensive when I’m complemented I want to argue with them about their complement until they take it back. It gets better overtime with more exposure to complements so I try to give them out first. Idk if it really helps but at least I’m trying being genuinely nice to others that I feel deserve it so if it doesn’t help me at least I might perk someone else up.

Why am I so self conscious? I take so many pics of myself and only post 2 out of the several I have taken. After I post the pics I start second guessing my decision to post in the first place. I find myself constantly paranoid of being insulted for my appearance. I've been insulted several times in the past by strangers online.... but when friends and acquaintances say nice things about my appearance, I completely disregard it. Why? Why am I so focused on the negative? I hate it.

I keep replying the thoughts, scenarios, images of her with me or with anyone else. I really need to get over it. The more I think about it, the more I crave it. The more I miss her. I know none of those things could or couldnt be real. I know nothing about her we have been in NC. I just hate those toxic ideas. Those irritating images and scanerios that dont even bring any pleasure anymore. Yes I miss her. How do people even say that we can control our thoughts? I am so lonely that I have spent the day alone. Literally. I know that I need to go out and meet other people and just move on with someone better but easier said than done. My ex have done alot of painful things that I dont want to go back but i miss her. I have lots of stories to tell her. I want share things with her. Talk to her. I know none of this would work. We have reached a point of no going back. I am firm that I deserve better and I hate myself for clinging sexually on her. Even if I want her back, I need to at least be with some other people first. Its pathetic, toxic, and miserable that I am still thinking of her sexually.

honestly, for me (AND I AM NOT A THERAPIST), I had to just let the thoughts happen. acknowledge them, accept that things are different, maybe fantasize a bit about memories and what might have been, and then keep going about your day.  I tried a LOT of stuff. new relationship! booze! pills! porn! none of that was obvi a good or healthy response. all of my fantasies and crying about it were made worse by the fact that I was the toxic one - they left ME, and for very good reason (I was absolutely batshit mentally ill and was not getting better or getting help).  but at the end of the day, we're becoming something else (if you're doing things right) and we're someone else. that person is not part of you anymore and it hurts more than anything, but there is something else and by the sound of it something better out there for you. you'll be better some time soon, maybe only a bit at a time, but better.  I'm sorry this is happening. good luck.

I hate myself so much , I’m always stressed I feel not good enough like I’ll never be okay, but I feel like a piece of shit and like I’m invalidating other peoples problems when I talk about because “how dare I be sad when they have a lot worse” and I failed my crush, I don’t even think she wants me anymore like she said she did.. I’m never good enough for anybody that’s why my bestfriends killed themselves bc when they needed help I was too focused on myself having a panic attack to know what to say.. and everything feels like a waste that’s why I’m cutting myself and can’t stop.. I feel so depressed and useless bc honestly I’m not worth anything to anybody that’s why I always give in sooo much but never get enough in return and it leaves me broken but I can’t leave or stop helping the ones I love most bc then idk what I would do if they committed, I feel like such a useless failure and I just wish I was happy and the thoughts would go away, I’m always overthinking about the smallest things I hate it I wish I would fit in with everyone else but I don’t bc I’m just a weirdo mistake who can barely function mentally and I wish I could just restart or die..

I always feel like I can't talk to anyone because I am just being another problem for them that they just don't need.  recently my SO has also had a few issues mentally and I've been trying to help as much as I can but just tonight they said that they don't want to talk about what's on their mind.  I now feel even more like that I can't explain how I feel, as if I try and bring it up I feel as if I come across as selfish as they shouldn't have to deal with me at the same time.  Honestly feel so exhausted and at a dead-end and genuinely quite scared

It’s definitely getting bad again.  This week— no, this month has been one of the worst in a long time. My therapist has been offering very kind, but not very profound advice: Enjoy the Christmas season, enjoy your family, banish the bad thoughts away.   I spent the day working, ignoring everything else, until this evening when I went to shower. I’ve never self-harmed in my life, I’ll swear that up and down... But this feeling is unlike anything I’ve ever felt. It’s more than despair. It’s a well, a sinkhole in the pit of my stomach that won’t go away.  I stood in the shower, sobbing as I turned up the heat as high as it could go. As my body started to get used to the hot water, I looked to the razor on the shelf. But I just couldn’t do it. I was revolted with myself. I immediately turned the temperature ice cold, and shocked myself out of it.  All this to say, I didn’t harm tonight. But I’m clutching at a very threadbare foundation right now. Any alternatives I could do to release this feeling would be wonderful.

Hey there, a lot of research has demonstrated the strong benefits that exercise has on depression, so if you aren’t already maybe starting a routine could provide some help. It’s suggested that when first starting exercising the priority should be frequency of exercise rather than duration or intensity until the behavior has been well established, but to be more specific Mayo Clinic says, “Doing 30 minutes or more of exercise a day for a few days a week may significantly improve depression or anxiety symptoms. But smaller amounts of physical activity — as little as 10 to 15 minutes at a time — may make a difference, and that It may take even less time exercising to improve your mood when you do more-vigorous activities.” Vigorous meaning exercise that is sufficiently intense that you can’t talk during it.  And here are some quotes & articles if you’re interested ~   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC474733/  “the efficacy of exercise in decreasing symptoms of depression has been well established.”  :https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495   “Working out and other forms of physical activity can definitely ease symptoms of depression or anxiety and make you feel better. Exercise may also help keep depression and anxiety from coming back once you're feeling better.”
Thank you so much ❤️

About an hour ago I got up to go shower, I didn’t realize how bad it was until I feel on the floor crying and sobbing. Everyone is so busy or having a good time without me. I feel like someone I choking me and pushing me into the floor and I can’t get up. When I feel like I might be able to do something basic like eating or going to the bathroom I just break down again.  This week I went through a breakup. Even writing that word it doesn’t feel right. It was the only person keeping me alive these past two years and now without him I’m alone again, what’s worse is my family and friends had no clue how bad I’ve been these months so they’re unprepared when I come to them and ignore me or give me crap advice like “exercise or take a break and relax”. No one picks up their phone or texts back, if they do they sigh in annoyance and give an excuse to hang up quickly.  Today is maybe the last day for me. I don’t see myself past this week and every time I get to this point it feels less and less like I’ll come out alive. Part of me wanted to try getting help but it looks so difficult I might just give up if this pain doesn’t stop. I’m gonna do it.

I wanna preface this by saying that I have no idea what the external implications of this type of displacement are but this has ensured me with my life in the darkest of my times. I understand what it’s like to be time and time again at ends wit and with diminishing hope and crushed with feelings of despair. Something that has gotten me through is forcefully pledging my undying allegiance (no matter how insincere it feels in the moment) to the concept of extreme survival and metaphorically placing myself in extreme survival situations. You’re the sole survivor of a helicopter crash - your lines of communication are down. The entirety of your will is channelled into keeping your vessel alive. You know it won’t be peaceful but you will not allow yourself to freeze, starve or be taken by other elements. You have one objective and you need to try. You need to realize you are in the nighttime of ground zero, but morning is coming. String yourself along until the proverbial morning, the actual morning, the next step. You will have the chance to seek help despite it being difficult you are capable of doing difficult things if only you give yourself the opportunity to do them. And you already have - you posted here, a lifeline. It is not over for you.
I’ve put appointments and stuff for the doctor but when it comes it just gets difficult to even try, A mental hospital sounds like a bad idea if they keep me in a room or if I end up more restricted than at home

The title sums it up.  Since an event that took place more than a week ago, on Sunday, I've realized how messed up I was and how unable I was to socialize and be with people. I've stopped talking about it to my family, because my father would shout at me again, my mother would joke about it and the others would judge me. They've badly educated me and gave me an unhealthy mindset. I hate my education and my family's lifestyle and morals. I despise what how they made me, and they can't listen when I ask for change.  I'm done being a weight. No matter what my friends say, I cannot see how I'm not a burden. I'm always bringing down the mood (some have stopped talking to me about that) and I don't bring anything. I'm clingy and pathetic. If you look at my post history, you'll see how even school tried to get rid of me because I depressed others. It's the physical manifestation of "they would be better without me".  Now, I've stopped talking to people and I'm about to end it. I see no other way, no one knows what to do with me. I have the means and I'm ready to stop it. I'm sorry to everyone who cared about me.

Don't fuckin do it man, I'm going through alot too and while it seems the best option it isn't, I know it seems like there's no reasons left to stay, I feel like that too but try to reach out to someone, and tell them everything, even just sit with them, your not alone man, stay strong
holy crap that sucks :( you wanna talk about it?
Hey, I just wanted to message you after your latest post on r/feemagers.  I just want to let you know that despite what you may think, this isn’t a good idea, and it won’t solve anything for yourself or others, even if it seems like it.  The world is never “better off without you”. I know it may feel that way, but I guarantee that no one in your life actually would feel better because of what you’re doing. It may feel like you’re a burden (I’ve felt that way sometimes), but it’s not true. You say “No matter what my friends say, I cannot see how I’m not a burden”, so I’m assuming they are supporting you and telling you that you aren’t a burden to them, and they are absolutely right. Trust me, there has never been a suicide where the friends and family of the suicidal person were happy, or relieved, or felt better. Think about it. If your Mom is hiding knives, why would you she want you killing yourself? I know you say that your school tried to get rid of you because you depressed others, but not only do I guarantee that no one at the school, classmates or otherwise, would be happy about your death, you should not let the actions of some asshole school trying to get rid of you validate your suicidal thoughts. Fuck the school if they’re not supportive, but that’s them, not you.  Also, since you’re 17, you still have the majority of your life ahead of you to experience great things that you will love. It may feel like this feeling is constant or won’t ever change, but I guarantee you that it will. It can’t change if you end your life early. Your life will not permanently feel this way. Im sure current circumstances (school, family, pandemic, etc) are making this situation worse, and I totally understand. But these things aren’t permanent. You could leave your asshole school and your family behind, if you want. Fuck them. Death is the end of everything, all thought, and it means you won’t get to experience anything pleasant ever again. If you have any passions or interests, focus on those. You won’t be able to experience them ever again if you take your life. Why take a measure like death when there are ways to help yourself that allow you to continue living and experiencing? People who were in your situation have been able to find things that give them joy, things they would not have been able to do had they committed suicide.  Please try and find someone to talk to, either your friends, or a hotline, or someone on Reddit (I mean, if you want to talk, feel free to DM me, I don’t mind.) It may be hard, but please realize absolutely no one who you should care about will be happy about your death.  Hotline number: 18002738255
Please don‘t do it. You are valuable and deserve love. I know you probably don‘t believe me, but I‘m serious. Sending a big fat virtual hug, cause I don‘t know what else I could do.
Man,  I know that I may never get to know you, and that you may think that it won´t get any better, but I can assure you that it will, I care about you and nothing would make me happier than to know that you decided to not do it and that you are staying alive, I love you and I care about you and I hope that it means something to you
I tried to reach out to people and it only got worse, way way worse. Now some have stopped talking to me, I can't go to school because I make everyone anxious and my friends are afraid of me. So talking about it to them only made me feel like a burden even more
Thank you very much for your words. As of now, I haven't done it but I sadly still think about it most of the time. I just want to be able to relax and be with friends, but I can't

I have been dealing with depression for almost my whole life, but it has definitely gotten worse over the past two years or so. I have been dating my boyfriend for 4 years now, and he is extremely supportive and kind. However, any time he tries to tell me to think more positively or gives me advice on how I can make better choices to relieve my depression, I immediately get really defensive and angry. I know that he is just trying to help, and a lot of what he says sounds like something a therapist might say. I am currently not seeing a therapist, even though I really should be (it has been really hard to find one taking new patients during the pandemic.) Any advice on how to calm down and listen to him instead of immediately getting angry?

Hi there.  Talking about depression in a personal relationship is complicated, because well-meaning advice can actually feel invalidating, i.e. make it feel like the other person is insinuating that the problem is easily solvable if only we would follow their advice.  But as people living with depression, we've probably already thought about those solutions and dismissed them...due to our depression.  Which for me, at least, gets me thinking about the whole loop I feel stuck in, which makes me more frustrated with myself as well as angry with the person giving advice.  This is why professional relationships like therapist-client are good, but I actually think that talking to peers can be even better - and by peers I mean, for you, other people dealing with depression and, for your partner (if he's up for it), other people in close relationships with people dealing with mental health conditions.  And there are actually support groups for both of you: peer support groups, as well as support groups for family/friends.  Both NAMI (national alliance on mental illness) and the DBSA (depression and bipolar support alliance) offer both types of groups, and you can search their websites by location to find free virtual groups near you - or not near you!  I know it's not exactly the same situation, but it was really healthy for my relationship with my family when I started going to peer groups and they attended a few family groups, so that the pressure of 'talking about the thing' was removed a little bit, by giving us separate spaces in which to come to our own realizations and understanding.  All the best, -F.
I'm also defensive. I feel like those who haven't lived with depression for as long as I have or don't have a clue about my perceptions aren't really qualified to tell me how to get better. That's mostly what my anger stems from. But to curve my anger, I just say thank you and give them a compliment on their advice or how they've handled my sadness. Makes me feel a little better just to be nice when I feel like crap and it probably makes them feel better, too.
Thank you so much for the advice! I will definitely look into NAMI and DBSA. I do think that I would benefit from talking to anyone else about this because right now it's like beating a dead horse.

I recently have come to a point where I can't stand the way I've been living and I feel as though my apartment being a mess is one of the main reasons for that. I've been working 50-60 hour work weeks for the past two months because it keeps me busy and keep my mind off things. However, I feel from this schedule of working and sleeping, working and sleeping I've gotten so far behind on taking care of myself and my apartment that just the thought of all the stuff I need to do is overwhelming. Leading me to barely want to get out of bed on my day off because I know how much I need to work on because nothing got done during the week. So I've decided to cut my hours down to 45 a week, although I'll have less money I feel like it will allow me more time to take care of my outside of work stuff so that I won't be so exhausted all the time.  I was wondering what tricks/system you all use to keep up with cleaning and household stuff. Does a daily chore chart work for you? Or writing a list for the week and completing so many tasks each day?

Take 15 minute cleaning breaks. Set a timer. Focus on one small item at a time.
I am in the same boat as you right now- my aunt gave me the great idea of building a chore into my routine which is simple and tacked right on the end of my day. For example, when I get home from work, I feed the cat, clean the litter box, then do chore X (like clean the dishes, wipe down the counter, sweep, etc). This has helped so much because it just falls right into place! I’ve also started adding a 10 minute yoga or workout in so that it feels more routine-like and less chore-like. Hope this helps!
I just commit to doing one small thing a day. If I promise myself to scrub the toilet, it's not a big ask. Once I'm done with that, I'll usually have some momentum after seeing one thing in my house look nice and clean. If I don't have the momentum, at least one thing is nice and clean.
My depression comes in waves... and I will allow my house to become embarrassingly disarrayed and that makes my depression worse.  I also have that sense of being overwhelmed by it and feelings like it reflects on me and who I am, "a messy dysfunctional person."  But you're not, you're depressed.    I find it is more manageable if I think of tasks in the smallest increments possible.  Make a list if you like lists and do the easy stuff first.  Or possibly the most urgent thing.  Or whatever is stressing you out.  If you can do two or three things, do them.  If you don't feel that you can, chill out and affirm that you did the one thing and it was good.  If I start this process, I might do another thing in a hour or so, maybe two...  I find it builds up momentum to chip away at what you have to do to be happy.  Before you know it, you will do five or ten things in a day.  The lists are good because you can check them off and again affirm that you are making progress.  The way you think about yourself in relation to the things that need to be done is important.  Switch the narrative to one with a more positive tone.
it is easy to have the house chores and self-care slip when trying to just work and sleep to get thru these hard times.  how about trying to do one self-care thing and one chore.  this way you will recharge you and still get a little bit done everyday or every other day.  even try to split up the self care day and do the chore the next.
Amp up the Disney Tunes. Wiggle that butt. Start vacuuming. That’s what I do 😆🌈
I feel you, a lot. From my experience - My flat is a hot mess all the time, and I always think "I have to take time to clean all of it at once". I've made a week plan for my chores, and saturday would be a general cleaning day. Sometimes I manage to do it then, but thats maybe once a month and I never have energy for doing everything. I thought I MUST to do it ALL once a week, and that I have to finish it all in one or two days.  Except, no one says I have to do that. I have the problem that I constantly set my own expectations of me way too high. The only one who says "the apartment looks like shit and you need to have a cleaning day once a week" is me.   I realized that I'm just not capable of doing a lot of cleaning, so I actively worked against the thought of "I have to do everything or nothing". One day, I just loaded the dishwasher. The other, I just made the bed. Another day, I only vacuumed the kitchen floor, which was absolutely in need of it. And at one, I even cleaned the entire bathroom!   The thing is, I try to not FORCE me to clean EVERYTHING. I just don't have the energy for it all, and although i really dont like that, I try to show compassion and make it easier for myself.  So, I'd advise you to start slow. Try cleaning just one thing at a time - something where you'll notice a difference. You feel every crumb while walking on the carpet? Vacuum JUST that. The sink is filled to the brink? Load JUST the dishwasher. If you find energy for doing more, thats great! But you do not have to do everything at once. Something small will make a difference, maybe just a small one, but you'll feel just a little bit lighter afterwards.
I've found it helps to identify certain chores that really can't be "put off" like dirty dishes, cat box, laundry, garbage out, etc. Then apply some of the techniques suggested here to ensure those basics are covered. If you can stay ahead of the basics, you'll eventually be able to add other tasks to your list, like dusting, vacuuming, etc...  For context: I need to shovel the walk of snow, but instead have been simply using an alternate entrance.... My goal is to clear the walk today after daybreak.
hire someone to do the cleaning for you on your days off, preferably someone you know wont steal.  A younger unemployed cousin or something, keeps the money in the family and makes it easier to work out a deal.  Let them know you're way too exhausted to do it yourself. Frees up your time for work or other things.  edit: hope this helps
I have tried different things which work for a short while but it never lasts. I've decided to hire a cleaner regularly next year. It's the one thing I can outsource to buy myself time. Of course I realise not everyone can afford this option.
I tried to make cleaning and taking care of my own things more rewarding than my actual work. In a way, just re-wording what I thought about cleaning. Instead of thinking I didn't like to clean or didn't have time, I just started saying I liked cleaning and this is more important than what I did for 8+ hours and if it's more important, then I should do it. Now it's habit.
Nice. I think I'll have to try this.
Good Idea! Alternativ Suggestionen: Put on your headphones and listen to audio books or podcasts. Total game changer for me.

I'm 45, been depressed on and off on an almost yearly cycle since I was around 13.  My first "attempt" at suicide was 14 when I tried to drown myself (I can't swim anyway).  I've been on numerous medications, had a fair few rounds of talking therapy, CBT, person-centred therapy all with no success.  I don't have any friends, most have since moved on, stopped contact (either by me not answering their calls or them dropping me too).  I've been through a few nervous breakdowns - the most recent one was end of November when I just wanted to ride my motorbike off somewhere and end it all again.  I was trying to also punch myself unconscious, considering getting a rock and smashing my own stupid head in.  My GP has been trying to get me the support I need - he's got a list as long as your arm with incidents of near suicide, of having to change meds, or going back because whatever was happening was making things worse.  At the moment he's trying to get me back to see a psychologist or psychiatrist, along with trying to get an autism diagnosis, as we strongly suspect I also have that as well.  But here's the kicker - I've already been turned down by them as I didn't score highly enough.  Let me elaborate.  A year ago I tried to get a referral to see the mental health team and a psychiatrist because I was going through a super tough patch.  I met with the team leader, went through my life in detail in regards to depression, the failed treatments, medications, near-suicide attempts, breakdowns, the lot.  I had to fill in a form.  I met them again and they said I had not scored highly enough to be considered for more in-depth treatment.  And, this is the ludicrous part, my score was dropped merely because I said I wanted to live, despite the numerous near-suicide attempts.  My GP was livid at this.  His recent letter to them detailed that I was still going through numerous times of feeling like this, and it would only take one of these to push me over the edge and actually complete the act.  I live in fear of my own mind.  Counselling hasn't helped.  Medication is doing nothing.  It's only sheer good fortune that I've managed to not kill myself as yet, but I really feel I'm running out of time.  There's no motivation to do anything - I'll load up a game and quit minutes later, start a movie and stop it minutes later, or open up a book and put it down - nothing seems to 'click' and distract me enough.  None of it feels like it's got any point anyway.  Even writing this seems useless and futile.  I'm tired of living like this - no joy in anything.  I eat well enough, sleep plenty, my job (I barely hold on to) is quite physical and I get plenty of exercise from it as well as being outdoors.  By rights I should be a much better balanced person - but I'm a wreck, a shell of a man who's lived with depression for decades stuck with a system that seems to only be interested in those with extreme problems.  Maybe I'm just not worth bothering with.  The waiting lists are ridiculous - 3-6 months for basic counselling, 2 years for autism diagnosis, and I really have no clue how long for any other mental health services.  My GP wrote two months ago and still hasn't had confirmation of his request.

Hi there.  I'm sorry you've been dealing with this level of depression for so long.  My first thought would be to suggest finding a peer support group.  I'm in the states, and we have NAMI and the DBSA, national organizations that have smaller chapters that offer free virtual groups.  If you could make the times work, I wonder if that's a route you could take - just find a big city with lots of groups and try a few out.  Or maybe there are organizations in the UK that offer similar support, or perhaps you yourself could find some people online in your area dealing with similar things who would like to get together on zoom once a week to chat (If you go that route, there are guides online about how to conduct a peer support group, principles of supportive peer group facilitation, etc.).  Mental health conditions are isolating, and then waiting for treatment - and even much treatment itself - is additionally isolating.  After multiple hospitalizations and years of trying to do this on my own, I've come to believe that we start to really get better when we connect with other people who at least kind of get it.  I still need my one-on-one care, and I hope that yours begins/gets better soon, but groups are a great way to begin working toward mental wellness.  All the best, -F.
Public Mental Health coverage seems to suck everywhere, Canada is horrible too.   I have found though a lot of therapists acre actually willing to help out with reduced rates and even free service.   I would email any therapist you feel that would help, explain your situation as you have here, ask them if they offer any pro bono or reduced fees, if not ask them if they could recommend anyone who dose. There's some pretty amazing people out there, it just takes some networking to find them.
Sorry to read about this anguish you deal with.  So many of these posts are heart breaking reading about what some people struggle with.  Here I am with my own minor blues, and others have dealt with it so much worse for so long.  It makes me wish I had professional therapy skills to offer help.  I do wonder how I would cope if I struggled with it for so long.  Maybe I would just pack up some shit and move to a tropical country and get myself completely removed from everything I know.  Maybe I would find someone that really needed help that I was capable of helping.  A total stranger.  A small gift to humanity as a completely selfless act.

I’m in my apartment alone but I can’t stop crying, I’ve had a few traumatic things happen to me in the past 5 years and recently had some people in my career field (I was trying to befriend) discourage me, shame me, verbally and mentally abuse me and I feel broken. On top of that I was told by a manager at my day job that they didn’t like my demeanor.  Bad memories and bad things people have said to me are playing in a loop in my head all day every day. Sometimes I have nightmares related to the memories. I feel really alone and like I don’t have it in me to try again, feel heartbroken and like I won’t find someone for me. Don’t know if I can do this anymore.  I’m supposed to make a doctors appointment and maybe try prozac but I am scared. Can someone please talk me off the ledge.

For the past 3 years I've felt like a constant loser.

Thanks for sharing. You are not I this journey alone. Constantly I have this feeling of inadequate to wrestle with for the past two years. What really help me doing something that I enjoy it was reading books.
I feel like that's my problem. I used to enjoy a multitude of things from playing guitar, watching sports, playing video games, reading books based on my favorite video games but now I either get super bored, have no interest in it, or I feel like I'm just going through the motions just to keep myself busy. It doesn't help when I feel like I don't belong at my current job. I have this constant feeling/fear that I'm not good at my job and that I'll be ousted for being inadequate, even though my job is one of the more convoluted and intricate jobs out there and takes years to understand.

I have major deep depression, anxiety disorder, panic attacks, ptsd. I am always crying, I never feel like doing nothing. I pretend I am alright in front of my 16yo twins.  I have a 18yo son i haven't heard from since May. We stay in a homeless shelter. I cannot go to work cause I need to get 6 rods, and 12 screws in my spine. I don't have income to get them out the shelter. My psy doctor gave me a letter to get a support animal (that I can't afford). I signed up for secret santa so my daughters could receive something for Christmas. I posted on r/assistance for help to get a support animal. A reddit user commented that I am lieing bout being in a homeless shelter, I am using people to get a free dog. I been asking agencies for help to get out the shelter, and since I don't have enough income. I don't have enough to get the support animal and all I did was ask for help. I feel so terrible that my children hurting, and suffering and I can't do nothing to ease their mind and heart. Me as a mother, is responsible to protect, provide, support, give them guidance. I feel like the worst mother already, but to have someone come and say I am lieing, is like a knife through my soul. I am doing my best I am tired I am worthless I can't stop all these thoughts going on at the same time I am trying my best is not working no one understands I have crazy thoughts like do drugs im against drugs I need my mind to stop shut up I can't focus someone please give me hug my children suffering its not their fault I cause them suffer

Oh honey, your son left the nest. Soon Marshay and Maiya will fly away too. This is a good thing. They need their space , they're teenagers! In two years they will have jobs, they need to work, and they can't stick around. It's just what time does.
I must excite you cause your following me all over reddit. My pain and suffering must sexually arouse you. >f you don't have nothing uplifting to say, keep your negativity to yourself
Honey, I'm not sure what you mean. Kids grow up and they leave. My children left ages ago. it's heartbreaking but it's part of motherhood.

Hello, I'm 21, boy, and I'm currently at my fourth (hopefully last) year of an engineering degree and I think I'm just starting to dive into an existential crisis.  Let me describe my reasons:  - Since last year I have noticed I am not retaining any useful information from my classes as I'm not capable of doing anything related to the career by myself. Even after I try several times, stop, then try again and so on until I abandon all hope in the project I'm involved into. This year, though, I tried joining a university student association where we develop an autonomous racing car (not gonna lie, very exciting), as well as having to course 7 (one of which is re-taken) subjects for the first half of the scholar year, which is obviously very time and morale consuming when coming close to exams and deadlines. I have already exceeded a couple of those deadlines having to deal with a penalisation on my marks.  - Since, again, last year, I have started losing weigh by eating better and attending to volleyball matches and trainings. This is of course NOT a bad thing and I'm really proud of my achievements in that field. The counterpart that's making me feel bad or at least not as good is that I've noticed I've lost a lot of social abilities especially with girls (I'm mostly heterosexual). From what my friends have told me and what I can see, this is no problem when I'm just being friendly or funny or whatever. The problem comes when I am into someone and can't manage it. I start acting weird and start having extremely toxic thoughts about myself, but also experience jealously and high levels of insecurity.  - Additionally, today I have tried to help my mother with reinstalling Windows 7 on an old computer her friend let her and I did it, but the OS had no network adapters and I spent 5 hours trying to find a solution, for which every try was unsuccessful, so I surrendered.  The whole combination of my studies status plus my relationships and self-esteem problems has led to a combination of these:  - Me not recognising myself in the mirror sometimes - Considering myself an incompetent professional and not being self-sufficient - Surrendering easily when a problem outstands me - Feeling immature and "not enough"  This last one has also been a cause for failing at building and maintaining a relationship with someone (what I told you before). Therefore, I'm experiencing lack of affection and am running low on pride.  My question is, what can I do to get over this? Is there any psychological procedure for someone to just start setting his life up for once?  I'm sorry if this was too long and tedious to read but I needed to let it out. Thank you for your help, I will appreciate any of it!

Stuck in analysis paralysis and don’t know which path to take in life. With social pressure around me, I don’t know how to forge my own path and I feel left behind in life. My self esteem is so low and I don’t know how to move forward.

I need to talk to someone. I'm having difficult things going on in my life for over 2 years. I don't want to talk someone who's going to give me life advices. I just need to talk. If you are going to be sad for me please do not text me. I don't want anyone else to feel bad because of me. I don't want to burden you with my problems because I know I'm not the only one who has problems in their life.  I just want to be heard, I didn't talk to anyone about these things, so this is the reason I want this conversation to be anonymous.  I'm sorry for asking people to pm me but all of the subreddits I've looked says that I'm not allowed to do it but I will not feel as if I'm talking to 1 person.  If you are going to pity me-I don't want you to feel sorry for me-please do not text me but other than that if you have time to chat with me, can you please send me a pm? Or can you redirect me to someone who can help?

I'm happy to hear what you have to say, and can engage you in any way that you prefer.  We can chat about whatever you want, and I guarantee no pity party.  I'll leave it up to you to make contact if you wish.  I'm on all the time.  If you're curious, I'm a 43M and it makes me feel a little better having some conversations with people I don't know.

First thing first, i want to thank everyone who reads this text, thank you.  I've always been a cheerful person, even though i've been throught some horrible things. When i finally recovered from depression in may 2019, i started seeing the good in everything: life seemed a beautiful thing and in september i got with my girlfriend. From that moment, from the moment i saw her, i thought to myself "life couldn't be better". And i was right: my marks were really high, i was the best in the class, i was happy, only that. When that coronavirus thing came, my life started getting worse and worse. I couldn't see my girlfriend, i broke up with my friends, i got very nervous and hateful, and i think that almost everyone can relate. I was and still am frustrated because the best years of my life are just going to waste. My dog (11 years together) and 2 other animals died, and i haven't been the same since that (in october), my birthday was the worst i've ever had, even though my girlfriend was there. Later on, i started noticing some drastic changes in my character: i wasn't happy, not even a single second. It got even worse because i started arguing more often with my girl (even now we are still arguing), and all of my family members seem not to see my problems. I have a lot of problems in telling other people my problems, and i didn't tell anyone anything i've said in this text, and i feel like until a vaccine will be available for me and my family i won't smile again. Staying 24/7 in this house, with people shouting and not caring about me is really stressfull.  I know that there are so many people that have more important problems, and it might be a waste of time for you too, but thanks. I needed to get this thing out of my chest. Remember: always love yourself and don't change, you are beautiful as you are now. Someday we'll see the light again and depression will just be an old dream.  I love you all.

Hey. Go easy on yourself. You’re doing great!!
You're not a failure. You have an illness and that has no reflection on who you are as a person. No one calls a person with diabetes a failure. The same applies to you. I have both diabetes and Depression and I'm quite happy with my life because I've helped many just by being myself.

It seems like everything I do in life I hate. I have a job that I hate and makes me extremely suicidal day in and day out. I have had other jobs that seem like things that I can do, and I end up hating them.  Feel like it is all my fault since I could be happy if I put the negativity out of my head, but I can’t. I am addicted to feeling like shit constantly. Whatever happiness I have, is very much temporary.   My very soul seems cold. The old me that used to be happy has long been dead, modern me doesn’t feel like I should be here anymore.  I’m going to school in June, but that means staying at my shitty job until then. Even if I do go back to school, I have a suspicion I will hate that as well and I’ll just land up in the hospital (prison for the mentally troubled) again.   I just want something to look forward to, that isn’t me dying so I don’t have to deal with my excuse of a life.  I can’t control my emotions, I feel like I’m going crazy and there’s nothing I can do but stand by and watch.

I know how you feel, I’d be interested in seeing if anyone has some advice too ahha.
I feel very much like this, all the time. I wish I had some useful tips for both of us, but I really don’t. I’m commenting and upvoting in the hope that more will see it.   OP, I truly wish you well.
What do you like to do for fun? If you feel like you haven’t had fun in awhile, what’s something that used to make you happy? Sometimes it’s enough to just look forward to the little things, even if that’s just a sequel to a movie or a walk to the park
Have you thought about finding a hobby?
I like to play video games and play bass guitar. Used to like just walking around.
I have some hobbies, it’s just my work takes up most of my time.
Try giving yourself allotted time to do those things. Focus on how they make you feel. Finding joy in the small things makes it easier to deal with the big things

Okay, so I know a decent amount of people get depression bc u feel like you’ve lost the happiness or happy place you had when u were a kid, but trust me, it’ll come, maybe it’s just taking a while, but we all go through shit to make us better and stronger and to prepare us for the happiness or happy place, oh and, you need to try to find it, it doesn’t always just come, but it takes time, it may be a while, but if it takes so long, it’s gonna all be worth it, life can fucking suck, but there’s always light at the end of the tunnel, but sometimes you need to like, break out of the tunnel of darkness and try to find the light if that makes sense, and really finding that happy place is the beauty of it, and maybe this shit you’re going through will give you wisdom and help you to help more people, remember you’re loved and you’ll make it out of this hell someday and I’m always here even if idk who you are<3

Hi, I'm a girl in my 20s and have suffered with General Anxiety Disorder and Severe Depression since I was 17. I have an amazing boyfriend since a year ago who recently due to the pandemic and a failed job interview has become more and more depressed. We're in a long distance relationship and apart from each other. Seeing him sad is making me extremely sad as well, and I don't know how to help him feel better. His meals and sleep times are really bad and erratic and he always lacks energy now. I feel like a big weight is put on our relationship and our wellbeing.      Any advice on how I can help him?

Hi everyone! I was diagnosed with depression when I was around 16/17. For years now, Ive struggled to maintain any of my old hobbies (drawing and reading mostly) and I feel like ive lost a part of myself.  My question is, how did you guys manage to motivate yourself to pick up a hobby or resume a previous one?

This is me right now as well. I've been dealing with this for years and if I knew the trick I would be screaming it from the rooftops. A lot of people I see suggest supplements like B12, Omega, Vitamin D but I take all of those without any improvement.

I am 31, I barely finished my associates degree last year. I am a preschool director and I can barely do my job because I am terrible at math but really great at talking and faking my ability to function well. I have no passions, no sparks or skills and I feel like a waste of space.  I’m going through a divorce, I have one daughter, I try my best to be a good mom But I feel like I suck at that too.  I feel really useless, I have no real friends. No education. No interests.   Most days I wish I was never born, my daughter struggles with depression already too and I feel like i brought her down this path and have tremendous guilt. She’s beautiful and smart and caring, I try to be supportive and there but she gets upset I don’t understand and has a better time with her dad (or so it feels) I know she loves me and she’s the only thing that keeps me wanting to stay trying.  I feel like a useless unlovable person.  There is nothing interesting about me, I have no support systems, I feel like I’m drowning in my life.

So I wish I had a more helpful comment but I litteraly feel almost identical to you and feel really Shitty right now too. It’s hard to come up with encouraging words when I feel the same way but I thought I’d comment to let ur not a lone. I’m 26 with an almost 2 year old moved bk with my parents who I’m not even speaking with cause we got i a huge fight and trying to find a place to move tonwith my son. His dad and I broke up. I’m too depressed and stressed figuring out life to be fully present with him when that’s all he deserves. I’ve just been praying (even if ur not religious..just praying to the universe) to be a better mom and get my life together. Anyway you are intersting! Even if I don’t no you, I know you are because we are all special, it’s just hard to recognize that when your depressed. Your obviously going through a lot of sense emotions..guilt being one and going through a divorce! That’s a lot of emotions to process on top of working and being a parent! Just because your not good at math doesn’t make you a bad worker, the fact that you are struggling so deeply but still manage to be there for people is amazing! Depression is so real but it isn’t you! It’s just something your going through, it will pass but it sucks gojg through it! I know this is cliche to say but if you can afford it finding a good therapist, talking and getting it out is half the battle!
From what you said Ma’am,The definition of useless seems far away in your situation,your daughter needs you as you need her,As a mom you have to be their for your kids no matter what,You do not only get to teach them from what’s right and wrong,either way your daughter and you are born with extraordinary talents,Either way give your daughter some time,And no matter what You are their for people who care about you in this subreddit,Also when I said you are born with extraordinary talents I meant that to be true,I am also not good in math because I am a student,But the thing about it is that you can find your hobbies by the people you meet,it’s the things that interest us to make us compassionate for the one’s we truly like,but it maybe a journey of hardship but you have to get comfortable feeling the uncomfortable,just for success and there is no other way,Most importantly compassion also takes sacrifice,Your love for your daughter is not about the absence of usefulness,but it’s the meaning of feeling and compassion what drives you and everybody else into out of the ordinary,Wheter this subreddit or other people we believe in you! Take care! :).
Love you have got to stop putting yourself down ❤️ practice positive affirmations and start rewiring your brain to think more positively, our words and thoughts literally create our reality. You are perfect just the way you are, learn to accept yourself and love yourself and tell yourself that its okay to not be “perfect”, because  you already are. there is no such thing as good, bad, right, wrong, or mistakes. There are only lessons, learn from them and move on to the next one show that little girl of yours how to be confident and love herself no matter what choices she makes, i used to feel the same way you do now until i learned that our words we choose are everything. If you tell yourself you will amount to nothing then that will become your reality if you tell yourself that you are successful and happy then that is what you will get out of life. https://youtu.be/GnWlERK0UJc here is a video of affirmations https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18XvWPlOL4rMKSuu0aUGtGOqbi8Ozkyp- and here is a link to my google drive with a bunch of material in it. There is meditations, yoga, a folder of books for healing/happiness all kinds of stuff. Just know that you don’t have to feel the way you are feeling. Consider a subscription to Gaia as well, there is so much good stuff on there one of my faves is the series Rewired truly helped me to overcome my lifelong depression❤️❤️ much love friend i hope you can find peace within yourself
Sending as much love as I can to you!!! I feel like this allLLLLL the time, literally 24 hours a day and you’re not alone. I promise it’ll be worth it for you to keep trudging on.
I'm sorry to read of your challenge right now.  As a divorcee myself (10 years recovered with a fresh romantic loss that lays heavy on me right now), I can recognize the grief that I have dominates everything I do.  It sucks you in.  Maybe you don't mourn the loss of the marriage, but I can see how it would make you second guess who you are and what you are capable of.  It's poison for the soul.  I saw my divorce as a personal failure.  I was rejected.  It stung bad.  My life was turned upside down.  I struggled dealing with my children on my weekend visits.  I had to opt out for the first couple months because I couldn't deal with it.  With the loss of my partner... my sidekick in life... I determined I wasn't fit to navigate the world alone.  Shit... I hardly have any friends.  I lost interest in my hobbies from the depression.  I had to fake it for my young kids.  It was a disaster.  I was sleeping on the floor of a coworkers floor for a month.  Then I moved back into my marital house against her wishes and lived in the basement for another month.  Something happened after that.  Nothing I did, I think.  It just happened. I woke up one day feeling a little better.  I was 31 years old at the time (43 now). I struggled with my appetite ever since that miserable day she said she was leaving.  But that day I felt the need to go to the store and buy the ingredients for a big meal and I forced the food down.  With that one step, I started taking all the other self-care steps I needed to dig myself out of the deep pit I was in.  I realized all the things I felt that stacked on top of the grief of loss weren't things that I couldn't change about myself.  I began to cherish the time with my kids rather than let them me a reminder of what I lost.  I stopped leaning so much on my folks for mental support and began to enjoy what was growing into a new direction for me.    So what happened?  Time I guess.  The wound and self-doubt needed to fester a bit.  I met some new people.  Made new friends.  Found new relationships.  Made the best of who I was.  It will happen to you too.  I have been listening to some interesting podcasts lately (Mark Groves.  Check him out.  If you do, listen to #1, then pick and choose your interest from the other 150).  One thing I heard him talk about was to embrace the negative emotions rather than try to turn them off.  I haven't figured out how to do that yet, but it's on my mind.  Oh, and there's nothing wrong with using a calculator.  Even mathematicians use them.
Your daughter most likely loves you and wishes you were doing better and happier.  If something isn't working with her, perhaps think about what you can do to be more useful and make her life better
I know how it feels. I have maintained a facade just like yours where I suck at stuff but i have to keep doing things anyhow. It's stressful, it's tiring and i really respect you for pulling through it everyday. You are a pre school director! You are smart. Have faith in your abilities. :)
I don't know what else to say except that I love you as a person. I suggest you look into resources to find affordable therapy or maybe talk to, I think, a psychiatrist to see if it's clinical or not.   &#x200B;  Try meditating. Yoga. Congratulate yourself every day for waking up and getting out of bed when you do. Congratulate yourself for even caring about your mothering skills even at your worst.   &#x200B;  I hope this helps in some way. :)
Thank you, I wish you and your son the best too, being a single mom is hard especially when you already have a mess in your head. You’re 26 though, you still have a lot of time to figure things out. Not that 31 is old (in my case) but I feel like all my dreams from when I was young died already. I guess all we can do is be strong for our children.
Thank you so much for taking the time to write something. All these comments are helping me a bit.
Thank you so much, I will be looking into these things. I get so lost in my own thoughts I can’t even ground myself with what’s real
Thank you for taking time out of your day to respond.
Thank you very much, divorce is really devastating on every level, I was depressed before this happened but I got much worse, it really made me feel like a failure also, to my child and family and self. I just feel devastated all around, it really hurts deeply. I even miss my ex and can’t stop crying about it even though I am the one who initiated it. I just forgot how to love myself.
It’s very tiring, I come home from work and just feel terribly exhausted from the sheer amount of effort I have to give to a career I don’t even enjoy.
I needed this and thank you, my life fell out of my control and I can’t remember the last time I felt good about myself
Aww ! Thanks honey! Please know your not too old for dreams! you know I look at single mothers who are 21 and feel so old now at 26, as if it’s to late! The truth is we can always be older or younger , age is all perspective! Obviously we have to sacrifice parts of our selves and certain dreams but there are always dreams that can be revived with a bit of nurturing, just the tiniest bit! I’m not sure what your dreams were from when you were younger but if you can at least find one even the tinest simple one that you can make happen, it will help you feel a little bit better! For example say you wanted to learn piano (I have no idea just throwing something out there), buy a cheap kid keyboard and practice learning an easy song when you have a moment. I just wanted to throw something out there that it’s never to late to chase your dreams even with kids, it just takes some adjustments! I hope you know your worth it and your depression won’t last forever, you’ll get your spark back. In the meantime, don’t be too hard on yourself while dealing with it. It’s hard...trust me I understand. I feel depressed everyday but the tinest little jolt of inspiration can really create a domino effect. Much love to you honey, I’ll be thinking of you! I know you got this!
I used to do the same so i totally understand. It takes some self discipline of rewording our thoughts and words and catching ourselves when we say negative things and choosing better words instead. The rest will all come with it, happiness, self love, comfort, confidence, just gotta start with being understanding and loving to yourself. The positive affirmations help tremendously! And the gaia videos too we are sooo much more than these physical bodies and we have so much power over our reality we can literally create any kind if life we want to with thought and belief alone. Stay strong and take baby steps and you will get where you want to be. Feel free to message me if you need help ❤️

This has worked for me. Keep in mind that the sadness and negative thoughts are just symptoms of Depression. What you are feeling, and how you are feeling are two different sensations. Learn to differentiate the two and you will find this more bearable.  It won't come easy, but it can be done. Good luck.

Alright your answer  The reason why suicide isn't the answer is because you should not just kill yourself because you hurt or cause someone hurt you, I've been hurt,bullied,sucidal,depressed, feeling empty and I can tell u now I am none of those now because I didn't want suicide and yes I recommend u talk to someone I did sure I did it mostly through sleeping and writing my dreams convos down but I still did. And the thing is u may say no one loves u but I bet someone loves u enough to mourn u and killing ourselves is a waste we showed everyone we are weak some people are but we shouldn't need to kill ourselves to prove we are we should take a stand and say fuck u asshole I don't give a shit what u think I'm going to do what I want and if it gets physical make sure u hit him hard. But seriously life is like a roller coaster there are ups and downs we may not like where we are but we are there so might as  well get ready to deal with it. Life isn't easy and it shouldn't be it challenges us to become better. If u can beat suicidal thought then u can beat anything thsts why I think u shouldn't do it because life is a challenge and we sometimes have to overcome things.

Everyone has the right to dictate what they wanna do with their lives. Thinking any pep talk can allow you or anyone to force your opinnion or ideals on someone is laughable. I would advise people to avoid suicide but if they simply cannot take the torment for various reasons it's their choice to end it. Some people reach such extreme levels where the only solution to their issue boils down to becoming borderline junkies which is no way to live your life.     The thing with depression is tracking and tackling it as early as possible to develop habbits to counter it before you develop the habbits that promote it.     Speaking to people does NOT help everyone it took the exact opposite for me to snap out of my long lasting depression which got reignited after my break up earlier this year isolating myself completely from absolutely everyone for months was what helped me snap out of it and now i finally live a rather fulfiling life following my hobbies collecting any money i can and trying to get a stable job to start up my own life.     The generalisation of \*If you are depressed talk to people\* has become such a bad piece of advice considering how utterly uneducated people are on the matter which leads to further damage to the people with the condition ESPECIALLY for males for simply do not get the treatment women do due to the bs standards our society has.     The same thing i've been told by various friends and aquintances who happen to catch me alone in the park and come open up about their depression or their thought of having it because i have openly talked about mine in recent times and the same thing is uttered by all of them.  'People don't understand me when i tell em i feel X or Y and they only make me feel worse'.     And as a final note: If you care about what others say about you in a negative way depression is on of the lesser issues you will experience. Both women and men suck relationships suck friendships are mostly fake and are an excuse for people to take advantage of eachother,learn to enjoy your company and learn to live alone without superficial needs and instictive needs such as sex and you will never deal with depression the same again in your life.
Just because it isn’t the answer *for you* that it isn’t for someone else. It’s my life I get to do what I want with it. What you’re suggesting is because you’ve eaten hungry people don’t exist anymore.
I personally feel if you think you can help someone you should try.

Yes.  Depression makes it difficult to focus & concentrate.  If you have anxiety, a drug like ritalin will make it worse.  Regarding the motivation issue, that might take some time but will get better as your depression is relieved!

Hi there.  I'm sorry you've been so depressed, and have these complicating factors in your life.  I'd recommend finding a free peer support group, which you can do by searching the websites of NAMI (national alliance on mental illness) or the DBSA (depression and bipolar support alliance) by location - really any location, as they're all virtual now.  Hearing from and sharing with people who at least kind of get it can be a really powerful experience.  Best, -F.
Thank you F, you reaching out meant alot. I don't think there are such things in my country but I'll definitely try to find them. 💙

Hi there.  I'd recommend finding a peer support group.  To have another time every week (or a few times) to connect with people who at least kind of get it.  Groups have helped me so, so much over the years.  To find free virtual peer support groups by location, you can search the websites of NAMI (national alliance on mental illness) and the DBSA (depression and bipolar support alliance).  There are also less-than-inpatient options like partial hospitalization programs (PHPs) and intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) that are very group-heavy.  Best, -F.
If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out. You can find help at a National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  USA: 18002738255 US Crisis textline: 741741 text HOME  United Kingdom: 116 123  Trans Lifeline (877-565-8860)  Others: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines  https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org
I’ve felt the same, maybe try thinking about why and then try to find a way you can resolve it

I've never posted here before but I was officially diagnosed with depression last year but have been struggling with it off and on since 2012. Obviously, this year has been really hard on my mental health and I feel like I've only gotten worse and not better.  People keep telling me that things are temporary and that I'll start feeling better, but I feel like despite my trying, I've been stuck in the same phase of my life for years with no change or worse change and it's really getting me down. I just feel like a loser with no prospects and no future. Every time I try to change things for myself, I'm met with closed doors or things just stay the same.  I am in therapy and I was on an antidepressant, but since my insurance runs out at the end of this year, I don't have any refills. I just don't know what to do anymore. A lot of days, I just don't feel like trying because I have been trying and fighting but it doesn't feel like it amounts to anything. I feel like sleeping all the time because being awake sucks so much. At the start of this year, I at least had a job and decent physical health, but now I don't even have either. I just feel like life keeps getting worse and I don't know what to do to cope anymore.

I would imagine your post reflects the feelings of many. I myself was diagnosed with major depressive disorder theee year ago. Three suicide attempts, three hospitalizations, ECT....its a difficult road, to say the least. Am I better? I guess people would say that. Me? I'm numb. Lonely. Lost. Tried all kinds of medicine. Kind of feel like this is what life looks like now. Not happy about it but....? Stayed home from work today. Not a good idea. My only advice is to put together a solid support system. AND use it. Here if you need anything

I have been dealing with depression for years now and my #1 supported just told me he no longer can take it yesterday. My mom had past away about 7 years ago and the holidays have been really hard ever since. I just don’t know what to do because everyone has turn their back on me and left. I don’t know if I should check into a clinic to seek help or try to tough it out on my own.

Hi there.  I'm very sorry about your losses.  We don't need to tough these things out on our own, though - and the solo route really doesn't work when it comes to mental health.  Finding support in our communities, in people we haven't met yet, is the way back to mental health.  If you feel like you should check in with a doctor, I'd encourage you to check in with a doctor.   I'd also recommend finding a peer support group (in the states I'd suggest finding groups through NAMI or the DBSA; if you're abroad, I'm sure there are similar organizations); hearing from and sharing with people who at least kind of get it can be a really powerful experience.  If you are looking for some solo work to supplement community care, here is a free pdf of a DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) workbook [https://adoeci.com/sites/default/files/grupos/dbt-skills-workbook.pdf](https://adoeci.com/sites/default/files/grupos/dbt-skills-workbook.pdf)  Best, -F.
Thank you for the help. I’ll be looking into things. I just work a full time overnight job so it’s hard for me to keep in touch with the community. But I’ll be trying harder now knowing I can talk to others whether it’s online or face to face with a counselor or doctor. I’m still debating on whether or not I want to check myself into a psychiatrist hospital because I’ve struggled with self harm and suicidal thoughts lately. After graduating high school a little over a year ago my life just seems to be going in a downward slope. Not having any close friends who understand the struggle of battling mental illness is a hard for me. I’m so happy none of them have had to deal with it but it’s hard to relate to someone if they’ve never had that experience. The only one that had known the struggles was my best friend before everything that had happened and it just feels like I’m alone and I’m unsure on how to turn my life around at this point. But thank you for the tips. I’ll be looking more into the different communities.
Yeah, for sure.  Also, regarding hospitalization, something else that lots of folks don't know is that there are other options offered at some hospitals aside from inpatient (although if you feel that inpatient is the right move for you, then it's probably the right move for you, and that's totally fine!): some hospitals offer intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) and partial hospitalization programs (PHPs), which are also very group-heavy.  These kinds of programs can also be done after inpatient hospitalizations (something I've done), to help transition/keep an eye on progress.  All the best, -F.

Hi. I'm not expecting much but I'm posting because I really feel like I'm about to give up. I'm at an all time low and really just need some sort of distraction or kindness to help release all my worries and anxieties. My negative thoughts and overthinking are reaching the point where I just want to put a bullet to my head to silence it. I feel very alone and like there is no hope, like I'm just in constant limbo. I'm a really good listener, but right now I think im most in need of someone willing to listen to me. I'm willing to do the same, so just dm me.  Thanks

i feel the same way and am willing to listen to u.
Hi i am 21M diagnosed with major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. I lost my brother to suicide when he was 14 in 2016 and my gf to Cancer in may 2020. My discord is Sisyphus 2218 and my Instagram is paramaniacal and my Twitter is ishanthecunt. I am always there to talk if you wish.
I already DM you ♥️⛄
Sure! Just sent you a PM. :) Would love to have a friend.
I suggest using discord if you want to talk to people, just a suggestion I dont know...

I don't know when, but I noticed I've started avoiding people in general. I'm hanging out with the few friends I have less often, and I'm almost terrified of meeting new people. I think it could be because too many people have disappointed/betrayed me in the past, so I'm afraid of being close to anyone now.  Not having many friends has made me really lonely though, and I've heard that being alone during depressive episodes could actually lead to me being more depressed. How do I stop this cycle of self-sabotaging and start meeting more people? Covid certainly hasn't helped anything because I'm now using that as an excuse not to go out. I'm afraid that once the world goes back to normal again, everyone would be excited to move on with their lives except me, because I've forgotten how to make friends with others..

Find a hobby, find a craft, something that can pay the bills. Think about how you can serve others, especially close family members.   As far as meeting new people, think about how you can serve them too. Maybe sell them food or something. Check out these two "foodpreneurs?" idk what to call it but they run their shit solo.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lpIxfS\_JKU&ab\_channel=FoodInsider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lpIxfS_JKU&ab_channel=FoodInsider)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bewbPnI-kbc&ab\_channel=FoodInsider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bewbPnI-kbc&ab_channel=FoodInsider)  Or you can also be like fk that im not meeting anyone and see if what u heard about being lonely actually makes you more depressed  And about the going back to normal thing. It might not ever go back to normal, but if it does its gonna be a very slow gradual process i thinkg. Also, a lot of people lost family members and are probably not gonna be very excited to move on with their lives, so yea rip to them.  hope this helps

Hello, I'm 18 years old and basically spiraling down an awful path. I'm 6'0 feet or maybe an inch taller or so and weigh probably close to 350lbs at this point, it's probably closer to 330 or something, but I haven't checked on a scale in a while. I don't really know what I'm hoping to get out of making this post, maybe just to be able to see someone can relate. I had a pretty normal childhood but was always one of the fattest kids and my parents just let me eat whatever, mainly my mom, because she just wanted to do what made me and my brother happy, so she also let us play video games way too much, which of course didn't help with the weight, and also when my brother was in 9th grade and I was in 5th he was not fitting in and whatnot and wanted to be homeschooled, so naturally I wanted to follow in his footsteps and my mom let us both start being homeschooled. For the first couple years or so we did an actual curriculum and everything was fine, but because of the beliefs she held at that time she ended up letting us both basically just stop doing school work of any sort and I just played video games alot, so did my brother. At around 12-13 I started becoming interested in "truther" type videos on YouTube, which led me to the Christian side of that subject... eventually it led me to a point where I got my own Bible and started reading 60 chapters of it a day and it all felt so real and I became under "true Christian conviction," that I'm honestly not still sure whether it was all real or not... long story short I became saves according to the Bible and it totally changed my life in an unreal way, I got out of video games and started studying the Bible in ways that most theologians and scholars probably don't, it was very very real and personal to me, it didn't have anything to do with my parents forcing it upon me or anything like that, I actually pushed them away in many ways because I wanted to be closer to God and a life of holiness and righteousness and not a part of "the world of sin." My brother got into quite different things like veganism (I actually became vegan with him for a while and it changed both of our health for the better) and permaculture etc... my life was so clear, I lived such a crazy life looking back on it. I didn't watch movies, I didn't listen to most music, I didn't make friends with the wrong people... I wasn't in school, but I did talk alot to people online and also had two different literal full time jobs (under the table of course) at the time, so I was meeting and interacting with people on a daily basis, yet I was trying to live a different life according to the Bible. It all felt so amazing and great because I had purpose, meaning, joy, peace, and hope after death. I'm leaving alot out but basically at around 16-17 I started struggling again with my weight because food was always an escape of sorts for me, so when I started doubting and having question I went back to it... The main questions I had were about how other Christians were, why so many were in these false religions institutions full of man-made traditions etc... not really doubts so much about God or the Bible.... I didn't go to any sort of church until later when I found one that I thought lined up as close as I would find with the Bible, plus, I was just so lonely and needed like-minded people in my life. But I ended up not attending that church anymore and quitting my job and my life just started spiraling out of control, doubt after doubt started to arise, I wasn't doing anything and lost the few like-minded internet and church friends I had or either pushed them away. Now here I am, about a year or so of basically just trying to accept on some way that I will never get back what I had, I will never feel the same way anymore, I will never be apart of those things anymore because my whole mindset has just changed and I can't help it. I hate it. I miss that life so badly. I don't have any friends besides a few online friends on Xbox, who really don't know me like I feel friends should. I literally never leave the house at this point and am sitting on my bed almost all day, unless I'm laying on it. I've gotten so insecure, so much worse than I've ever been, literally the only person who I see and sees me is my mom (I live with her and her bf), I stopped seeing my dad because my parents divorced and I'm too afraid to drive and stuff, but honestly I just don't want him to see what I've become. It hurts so much, I love him. I love so many people that have tried to help me and I've pushed away. I feel paralyzed and wanna die, yet at the same time I wanna live, I want to try something else and even when I take a step outside and feel the fresh air and see the beauty of nature it makes me wanna live and I love people and wanna do things, but I also have trust issues and am too scared. The reason why I don't do anything is 100% my weight... I know people will only ever see me as a fat and ugly loser who lives with his mom. And that's really all I am at this point, I have no skills, no talents, no drives, no passions, hobbies, friends, and really would bring nothing but baggage and sob stories to anyone who REALLY wanted to try to know me and stuff, so I do understand why people wouldn't wanna take the time, especially considering that I'm becoming an age where it's already hard to make friends and stuff if you don't have any connections at all. I've talked to my mom in depth about how I feel like I have a food addiction and we have tried doing things to help me eat better but I have failed sooooooo many times that I have basically given up. I say I'm okay, but I am so far from okay, I don't even feel suicidal, I don't wanna die, I just wanna live and it feeling and seeming so far out of reach hurts me so bad. It's just an endless cycle. I'm at a point where it hurts me, makes me lose my breath, ache, etc.. to do basic things like use the toilet, take a shower, walk to the kitchen, let the dog out, etc... I know that is not 100% because I'm fat, but a big part of it is just because I don't hardly move at all so my muscles and stuff are so weak. I've screwed myself over so bad and am just screwing myself more and more. I guess that's about it, I've left so much out, but I'm at a point where the tears are gone and I'm not really so torn up about this whole writing it. I don't think I'm really looking for advice because I've heard it all and it just seems to go through my head... advice from "you just need to take medicine and get therapy" to "you fat loser you need to get off your fat ass and change." I guess if I'm 100% honest, I just want someone who doesn't just wanna tolerate listening to me or being nice to me because they pity me or think they have all the answers. I just want someone who can relate in a deeper way I guess. I know there are so many people in somewhat similar or much worse situations, but at the end of the day my situation is a little strange I feel. Maybe someone can relate to me on the being fat part and stuff, but maybe not the faith part. I don't know, I know I'm not not special or anything, just another person struggling with life like most, all in our own ways. First time posting to Reddit, so no idea if I will just get loads of hate, the post will get deleted, or if anyone will even read it through or even care. If you have read it all, thanks, means something. Sorry if this is not the right place to post this.

As far as losing weight goes (not a doctor so this isnt medical advice), go vegan like your brother and make sure to get all your essential nutrients and whatnot. Do some intermitent fasting where you dont eat for like a day or two. Drink lots of water. Get some cardio, watch out for jogging tho cuz that could fk up your knees. Go for like medium intensity. Keep it gradual, you dont wanna lose too much weight too quickly cuz thats not healthy. Be consistent cuz its gonna take AT LEAST several months to lose a significant amount of weight.   Whatever you do, stay away from surgery unless its ABSOLUTELY necessary.   A few words about weight tho, its nothing wrong with being on the larger side(unless it causes health problems of course). I know some women prefer that cuz it makes them feel safer or they want like a giant teddy bear or something instead of a body builder or a scronny type. Also, if youre as large as you say you are and you also have no hobbies or talents(which your only 18 so you most likely just havent found them yet) have you thought about learning about sumo? Just an idea, a really cool one if u ask me. You dont really have to like do the whole wrestling thing(especially cuz of covid), you could just learn about it. Or maybe you can wrestle with your brother. uLearn about the culture, its history, the rules of the game, etc. But def get some excercise tho. If people are gonna insult you by calling you "fat" or "ugly" just remember, you're much bigger than they are (lol actually).  For food addiction... my guy, if you have access to so much food that its causing you problems, dude SHARE THAT SHT, especially with people that dont have enough to eat.   Check out these, idk, "foodpreneurs?"  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bewbPnI-kbc&ab\_channel=FoodInsider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bewbPnI-kbc&ab_channel=FoodInsider)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lpIxfS\_JKU&ab\_channel=FoodInsider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lpIxfS_JKU&ab_channel=FoodInsider)  I know the bible talks about servitude and humility. These videos are two great examples of that, and it aint no such thing as an ugly loser thats humble and serves his community. So yea maybe you can replace your addiction with a hobby or craft and find fulfilment in serving others. But then again staring at food all day long as a cook might not be the best option for you if it triggers your appetite. So maybe find another avenue if thats the case.   And also i hope watching these videos didnt trigger your apetite, cuz that would be a fail, lol, on my part.    But yea the whole point of that is to, in service to others, give what you have to those that dont have it. So metaphorically you're giving your excess pounds to the scronny people that need it? Its a wierd example but hopefully u get it.   As far as what other people think, or what you think other people think, im just gonna say this: ***"assumptions."*** We all know the how the old saying goes; so is further explanation on that word necessary? I think not.  &#x200B;  Hope this helps.   &#x200B;  Also, if you're gonna post such a long thread, consider splitting it up into sections next time, that would make it much easier to read.   &#x200B;  Anyway, keep reading the bible and putting God first my friend.
Come on man, telling a fat person who said that being fat is basically the number one thing preventing them from doing things in life and is so fat they struggle to do basic tasks to look into being a sumo or learning about it, literally thought you were trolling me because of that part... And I don't have "excess food laying around" like I'm some wealthy ass person from a cartoon with wheels of cheese and whole hams in my pantry.... it's just that all I eat is shit, literally said I've tried changing things... when you have a food addiction you can't just change like magic, bro... I wrote the long ass post because I was hoping someone would relate, not fucking tell me shit like become a fucking sumo? I don't know you or your situation, but Jesus man that shit came off douchey as hell. Don't know why I expected anything from Reddit. Thanks still for trying I guess, bro.

Hate to sound like such an awful person, but I have nothing better to do than respond, the advice doesn't help at all, kinda missing my points I feel, but you taking the time to write it all does mean alot, so thank you. Maybe I'm just not in a good mindset to receive it, but either way. Thanks.

Also, i read my post again, and might have come off as insensitive, which if i did pardon me for that. Just recognize that all i'm trying to do is help, not be a douche or anything like that. No one is perfect except God.
All good, man, sorry if I came across rude, just lack of sleep probably talking.

I've been depressed for 7 years. I'm 19 now. Every day is mostly the same, I wake up, head to my computer, browse youtube and tumbler or play a single player game, eat supper, go to bed. Sometimes when I'm lucky, my parents will take me out shopping for groceries.  I've asked my parents to do things with me, but whenever I ask they say they're tired. They're 50 years old now so I don't blame them but, I was hoping for a board game even. I know I ask for bike rides or to go to classes together, but it's the time spend with them that I want. I want to do so much but I just can't bring myself to do anything. I want friends who would want to talk about things I like and can do activities with.  I'm so unmotivated to do anything anymore, I can't even start an animation or drawing for posting as I want. When I start something, after 2 mins I have to put it away cause I can't get into it. I keep trying to pick up hobbies to try and feel something but I just can't keep at it. I'm just so tired all the time.. I wish I could be like how I was in elementary where things were easy and you could make friends just by asking.    I don't want to talk to anyone about what's going on, because I see how they complain about how depressing it is to hear when everyone else is trying to have fun, meanwhile whenever someone talks about how depressed they are people avoid them because of it for complaining so much. I don't want to have it where I vent so often, they'll get annoyed by it and not want to hear it, so I try not to say anything at all.    I started thinking recently, I'm almost 20, I wasted my teenage years and have no good memories from it, so roughhousing with friends, no late-night sneak outs, nothing.. I feel lower than anything.. I started avoiding going on my computer as often as I did, though now it's just sitting in the living room. I want to make memories, to have skills to show off, to feel something aside from nothing but numb or regret. I hate going out by myself because of social anxiety, and I want to do so much but I just can't, I know that I'm able to, but that's not what I mean.   One day I'm going to die. Maybe old and alone, maybe from cancer or something but I know that when it happens, I won't have anything to be happy about, because I couldn't do what I wanted to do. I'm just so tired of every day being the same. I know it won't ever change because it's been like this for years and if it was supposed to change it would have. I may have a little hope but it's fading..

Sounds like my depression, which was depression by way of ADD; I couldn’t be motivated or keep interest in anything, so I slowly “faded into myself” which was mondo depressing. What’s worse, the ADD brain “retreats” even further in absence of stimulating activities/surroundings, which adds even more depression.  Keep in mind, ADD doesn’t always include hyperactive behavior - some people just get lost in the “television constantly changing stations” that is their own mind.
If it was supposed to change it would have?   99% of the time if you wanna change something you gotta put in the effort. Things don't typically change on their own, they tend to continue as they have.  Gotta ask yourself how bad you want it and how far are you willing to go for it.   Think about how your parents want to see you doing better and maybe they will get excited and have a little more energy if they did see you doing better.

I laugh and smile every fucking day almost and yet there's this constant void/empty feeling i feel so alone and that's my fault I push people away because I hate people I hate life,   I lost my job then lost my girlfriend I feel like I lost everything during that time, I miss her so much she wants to stay friends I can't even bring myself to message her I honestly don't think she ever really cared I hope she's happy with life and I wish her well but it hurts to know she dropped me like I was nothing I can't even blame her for her choice all I can do is blame myself for being a failure yet again I can't hold a job down for more then a month, most days I think about suicide or even cry for no reason and I hate it I don't feel like I'm a person at all this emptiness leaves me with no remorse for my actions or situation which have happened.  I don't know if anyone will see this post don't let go of what you love once its gone you might never get it back

Hey man, I went through years of breaking up and getting back together with my ex. Sometimes it really is just as simple as two people who don't vibe as well as they thought they did. It's not some failure on your part and she's definitely not your last girlfriend, or your best. I know what that mindset is like and I know you question yourself a lot when you're in it, really try not to do that, it does you no good I promise. Just let her go. You don't have to be friends with her, that just messes with the healing process.

So this is a post I didn’t want to make but fucc it I’m here lol  About a few months ago I reconnected with someone who I haven’t spoken to in about 5 years after he reached out to me through Facebook. We were talking and we hung out a few times (I’m from Australia so covid restrictions are eased here in case you were wondering) and I came to discover that not only is he extremely depressed (bitch me too gang gang) but he is also quite attracted to me. I don’t feel the same way about him for a myriad of reasons but his depressive episodes have had  him spiralling into a self loathing rut not helped by him feeling guilty because he knows I don’t return his affections but he still can’t stop himself for being attracted to me.   It got to the point where he was saying some very concerning things that resulted in me racing to his house in the middle of the night and narrowly getting to him before he could kill himself. This cycle of vicious self pity and then apologising to me for it has become very common place and I while I care for him very much I’m feel like there’s only so much empathy I can provide for him. I’ve got a bunch of mental bullshit I’m dealing with too and I can’t be his anchor and his absolute refusal to help himself is so frustrating to me.  He says that it’s unfair to assume the worst in others because of what one person did to him, but he constantly assumes I’m going to abandon him and that I should walk away because he’s a terrible person and he’s just dragging me down to his level and that he’s not deserving of love. I don’t want to abandon him and I promised him I never would but I can’t keep doing this, I’ve pushed myself to uncomfortable limits trying to comfort him and I need to take care of myself too.  What should I do?

Is he followed by a therapist? Does he have a family to rely on? He needs external support. Else, like you said, you're gonna break, you and him both.  He seems quite obscessed by you. Relying on someone else more than on yourself is never a good thing. It seems like that's something he's doing. Friends should not think and or worry about one another 24/24 for weeks and months on end.  I think that you both need more external support. To worry less about each others and try to reconnect with your own lives (hobbies, work, friends, family, interests etc). Stop living in each other's dimension, it's not sustainable....  But he needs to understand that else if you take your distance sudently without discussing it, then it will feel like abandonement/betrayal to him.
He does have a therapist but he feels that it’s not working for him and he’s quite disconnected from his family. I myself have quite good external support, my mum has been brilliant with me and I’ve gotten myself a new job that I’ve been studying for the better part of the year.  I know that it isn’t healthy for him for me to come running to him at the first sign of something amiss, but I fear that I’ll be a bad friend if I don’t because he has nobody else.
You're a good friend to have. But it's also good to have some boundaries.   You can help from time to time, but you can't always be there. Not at 4am, not every day of the week, not when you're trying to work. It's ok for you to rest without having to worry about someone else constantly.  That fear, if always present will make you anxious, panic, maybe burn out. I hope things will get better for you two.

It's trying times for everyone right now.  You aren't alone there.  Is there something missing from your life or are you going through some grief right now, or is this ongoing depression?  The community here is eager to be helpful.  Maybe share a little more and you will get some solid advice or reassurance that what you are dealing with is typical and will pass with time.
Honestly I'd probably say its ongoing depression and honestly any advice would be a great help and if therea anything more I'd need to add I'll make an edit to the post
If it's ongoing, then you should definitely reach out to someone.  This doesn't need to be something that you cope with alone.  I think be selective on who you choose.  I leaned heavily on my brother who is a very understanding and supporting person.  Finding a counselor to speak with would be ideal but understandably not as convenient.

Sorry if this is kinda long but I was dating this girl for 3 years and she helped me get back to playing competitive hockey after I broke my neck playing a few years ago. At the start of the year I received a contract to play hockey in Canada and she encouraged me to go and take the opportunity I was given and I did fast forward a few months later I left to move to Canada to play and things were pretty good for a month or two then she broke up with me and since then I have lost the passion to play the sport I love and have been in a depressive state of mind but I continued to play and when the winter break hit I was told I wasn’t allowed to go home and I felt like I sunk deeper and on Christmas I decided it was time to go home and just quit playing. Over this time me and her still talked and said she misses me and just wants me to be home but earlier this month she started seeing someone but has still told me she wants me and this and that and I don’t know what todo I feel like I’m losing myself and in a few days I make the 26 hour drive home and I can only feel anxious sad and a little happy. I just feel like I lost myself.

Dude, what your describing sounds like clinical depression.  It sounds like you're too healthy to commit *physical* self-harm, but maybe you're still ill enough to substitute social/relationship self-destruction instead?  I'd recommend telling your ex that you didn't cheat, it's just that your head is all effed up right now.  And then go see a mental health specialist for help.

I struggle with this too. Don’t have the full solution, but I have found if you prepare the thing you enjoy ahead of time as much as possible then you have a better chance of finding motivation to follow through.   For example, I enjoy reading and have a bunch of books that I’ve been neglecting in favor of being phone addicted. To get myself to read I do some prep, make some hot tea, grab a cozy throw blanket and get in a good quiet spot. Ahead of time I put a bottle of water/headphones and a charger in my reading spot so I don’t get distracted and wander off.   It is a nice feeling when the space is already set up for you and you can just start. It is more enjoyable this way.  You can do this prep for almost anything, if you enjoy walking/hiking then the day before you want to go, get all your gear ready and add a really good snack.  Really just try to make it as easy as possible. With depression everything feels like a chore, even things we enjoy. So whatever you can do to make it more inviting/comfortable and easy the better chance you’ll actually push yourself to do it.
You won't like the answer. Those with Major Depression can have a symptom called Anhedonia. It's exactly what you described. A loss of enjoyment of the things you once did enjoy. Like Depression, there's no cure for it yet.  It does ebb and flow, so on occasion you will find you can function as you did once.  I first experienced this when I was eight. I'm 54 now.  You don't deserve to be miserable. All these negative feelings are symptoms of Depression.  Once you are able distinguish these feelings from your own things can improve.
I understand. Remember that feelings are weather and they do pass, I promise. Creating ritual out of it feels good to me. Similar to a user below, I'll find comfort in preparing things (if I'm making a smoothie, which I love to do, I find comfort in the ritual of pouring the liquid,  grabbing the fruits and vegetables, adding supplements, pouring the plant-based protein powder, things like that) or playing piano- heating up fresh tea leaves and taking it along with a coaster to my piano, grabbing my favorite pen and one of my music journals, silencing my phone and making a whole thing of it. It really does work.
Whatever you did to make you feel like you deserve to be miserable, think about a way to right your wrong?

I am a depressed girl in a relationship of almost a year with a guy with anxiety disorder. It's not always easy but I could never find anyone more conforting, supporting and understanding than him. I suggest trying, you can always decide it's not the right thing later
If you like them, go for it, after seeing what your therapist and possibly his says, because they're trained to help people.
Maybe it would be okay because you could both understand the trappings of having mental health disorders. As long as you're both receptive to each other's needs and want to be a couple, it should be okay. You're not your issues just because you have them, there's plenty more about you to love, and plenty more about him to live, too.  Good luck!
I've recently started seeing someone and both of us also have mental health issues, plus I have abandonment issues and major trust issues... Anyway since we've been talking and seeing one another I feel like some of my issues have calmed down. Not sure about his but I think maybe his has too. So, like the other person suggested, talk to your therapist and see what they say. I honestly feel like it's better with someone who has issues like mine.
I have depression and anxiety and I’ve been with my partner who has bipolar disorder for over four years now. We’re actually getting married in the spring. There’ve been some hurdles to overcome, but no more than any other relationship. Since we both have mental health issues we better understand each other and can be more supportive and empathetic

I feel you. I'm going through something extremely hard right now and suffering the worse emotional and mental pain I've ever experienced in my 25 years on this earth. My depression is also worse than it's ever been. But hey, I'm here for you still if you, seriously, want to vent and just have someone listen to you, be a friend, give advice if you're open for it, etc. No matter the day or time.
Yeah, I can relate. I say I'm okay, but I'm not. Hopefully we can find something one day that does make us feel okay.

I thought I was getting better until I had the urge the other night to hurt myself. I haven't had this urge in over 5 years and it terrifies me that its creeping back. I feel like everyone I love is going to leave me. I feel like I'm going to lose everything and everyone close to me. I'm sleeping way too much, my room is the messiest its been in years, and my anxiety feels like its constantly switched on. Im overthinking things like crazy but I just cant stop.

Seasonal depression might not be helping it.  I'm really surprised it doesn't affect as many people is it appears.  Maybe it does.  I know I certainly feel it when it's dark when I get up and dark when I get home.  The days are slowly getting longer now and before you know it we will be through it.  In the meantime, have you reached out to anyone about this?  Simply having someone listen to you has always helped me.  Just vocalizing how I feel to someone feels like some of the weight is lifted.  The right confidant will reassure you that you are loved and you will not be left alone.  Have you attempted to do anything that has previously given you pleasure?

I'm not really sure what to do anymore. My life feels like it's just spiralling out of control lately, and I know everyone is going through hard times right now with the pandemic. I just feel like I'm finally broken, I've been sleeping most of the day lately and only being awake during the early hours of the morning for a couple hours. I can't find the motivation to do anything I love, and honestly lately I've been feeling so numb and empty lately like I can't love anything anymore. I have no income now due to the fact that I was having panic attacks whenever I was at work, and now I feel like a failure. I've just been thinking maybe I'd be better off gone. It just hurts to exist right now, and I don't want to feel like this anymore. Sleep is the only time I get any relief from this crushing disappointment of a life.

I've been experiencing panic attacks and persistent anxiety for a year now.  The first one happened while I was at work, first thing monday morning.  I ended up in the ER.  Didn't know what was happening.  I thought I was dying.  Since then I have continued to have them here and there.  One caught me bad on my first night during a vacation a month later.  Almost went to the ER again.  It took a few hours in the middle of the night to get talked down through a phone call, my brother who was there, and sitting on the shower floor until the hot water tank was empty.  Over the last year I have gotten better at controlling them.  My doctor prescribed me some medicine that I keep with me at all times, to be used in case of an attack.  I try not to use them.  I don't have that many.  I feel like they are more of a security blanket.  Just having them in my car makes me feel a little safer.  They work.  Don't lose yourself to this.  There is help available.  You can be happy again and you do not need to live with the panic.  Please reach out at least to someone close, or contact your doctor if you haven't already.  You are not alone feeling this way, and it isn't permanent.

Life *is* temporary, yeah.
I'd like to believe that, but depression doesn't seem to just randomly disappear and I don't think I have the will to live with that
Yes, but so are periods in your life. If you're going through a rough patch, things will enviably change. If you work towards the change being better. It will. If you do nothing at all, then it might not. Things don't resolve on their own though. So, you have to find the motivation to keep going so you can have those good experiences.
Depression doesn't go away, but it can get better. Sometimes to the point you rarely feel it anymore. If you work towards getting help, and realizing and resolving the things in your life that are the source of it. You'll feel better. I normally tell people to write down the things that make you depressed, decide which ones you can fix and which ones are out of your hands. For the ones that are fixable, set goals to  resolve them. For the ones that are inevitable you just have to come to terms with them.   Tl:dr You can feel better if you work towards it. It may take alot of time, and you will have hard moments but it's possible.
As soon as I notice that something takes a while, instantly lose motivation, unfortunately. I wish I had enough willpower to do something
Sometimes you have to make yourself even when you don't feel like doing it. Ive been there. I still get into that mindset alot. But it just comes down to pushing through it anyways. It's all about your mindset. If you constantly put yourself down and tell yourself you won't get better, then you won't. If you tell yourself that it WILL get better then eventually things might start changing. Of course it might not work for everyone. But ik it does for me
I'm sorry, I don't think I'm able to "push through" honestly
Well I hope things get better for you. It really all comes down to your mindset, you won't get better till you are ready to.

You need to report it to the authorities and get help.  Don’t try to handle it on your own.
wait fr???
[deleted]
Yes, you should contact the proper authorities in your local area!
Is there a victims' advocate organization near you, such as a domestic violence shelter? You can also call a domestic violence hotline for assistance.
No. I called police once for theft. The officer said he had a huge stack of police reports for similar incidences and the likelihood anything would ever come of it was low.
talk to the police
Totally agree. Get help immediately
I'm being serious.  For real.
No. You don't understand.  I am being harassed because I get disability money and people are jealous.
They won't do anything.  They're too busy dealing with shootings and robberies.
I know that it is something that is going to be difficult to do, but you should physically go to the police station and ask to speak with a detective or other officer, when you're at the front desk.  I would have a notebook, or paper to help keep you calm and be able to answer questions they might have, because it sounds like (from the very limited information you've given, and this isn't a "tell us more!" Situation btw) you *might* be getting cased for another robbery or marked as am easy target.   I would make sure you take extra care to lock your doors and windows, and be extra careful about keeping your head on a swivel.  When you talk to the police, if they take you seriously, they will want to know the conditions in which you felt you were followed.  What does the person look like?  Were they in a vehicle?  How often have they followed you?  When did you first begin to notice you were being followed? Do you have any enemies, or people that might want to hurt you?  Do you have anywhere that you can be safe, maybe at a friend's house for a few days?  Police are very often there only to protect "important" things, or people, and will often make excuses about not being able to be everywhere, or being underfunded. The truth of the matter is that it is difficult for any individual organization to really prevent crime and usually operates on a "the criminal will keep doing crimes until eventually they mess up and we get lucky." Type situation.  I agree with everyone else here, you should not try to handle this on your own.  I would not try to handle this situation on your own, amd would absolutely speak with the police. (And I say, in person / physically at the department, because it gives your claim an air of seriousness. "I'm afraid enough to overcome social anxiety and come and actually talk to you people!")  I would say, that if you have the financial means, that you try and locate a reputable private investigator and explain your situation. If you're being followed, having another person following you that you know, and is looking out for people also following you, could let them gather definite proof of it. You would be able to go to the police after and go "here is the address of the person following me, here is all the times they did it, here's a good picture of what they look like, please go tell them to stop."  Something like that, having a couple of cops show up at your door and tell you to knock it off, would stop all but the most hardcore people.  If you don't have the financial ability to, or there are no good, or reliable P.I.s, just make sure you lock your doors at night and always have your cell phone with you. Lock your bedroom door as well if you feel you're in danger. If you're worried about being robbed, invest in a safe to store your most valuable positions, and bolt it to the floor, in your bedroom closet, or somewhere it would be too difficult to remove.  If you're worried about being physically assaulted, try to involve any family of friends you can, if you have any you trust / are on good terms with.  Again, you might feel silly for this, but see if you'll be able to visit any for lunch (since places are restricted on covid), and have a note, or your phone to have the same details you'd give the police, and after some light conversation explain your worries.  If you're like me, you might not have a lot of real life friends.  Depending on how afraid you are, you might want to talk to the neighbors, across the street, and either side of you.  Asking them to keep an eye out, that you're afraid of being a victim of a crime, I think you would be surprised how (some) neighbors might really take it to heart for at least a few weeks to look for anyone stopping that isn't normally in the area.    I know that was a big wall of text and a lot to read. Good luck, try to stay safe and keep us updated please.
They sneak into my apartment and tear up my stuff.  One lady broke my umbrella then later said, "You're not retarded!"
They can! Especially if you have had property destroyed, or people trespassing on your property. They are obligated to help you!
That‘s destruction of property, which is a crime. Have you talked to the police about that?

I've always been on the heavier side and I've always had problems with self confidence and hating how I look. I'm in college so I rarely have a lot of free time, but during the last year I've really tried to improve myself. Part of this was starting to go to therapy. Recently the suggestion of medication for my depression has been brought up. At first I thought that'd be a good thing, but the more I think about it the more I hate the idea because I know there's a possibility it makes me fatter. I already hate how I look and I know I'll feel even worse if I put on more weight. Alternatively I know getting on medication could be a step in a good direction for my mental wellbeing, which I know is important. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has had similar thoughts or experiences, and how you handled being afraid of medication.

Hi, I'm 60 and have had several bouts of depression.  I have taken many different meds over the years.  Yes, some of them make you gain weight.  Tell the doctor your concerns and ask for something that doesn't.  For example wellbutrin makes you lose weight.  Some of the ssri's don't make you gain.  I understand being afraid of them, but if you feel horrible, they may be worth a try.  Ask for one that doesn't make you gain weight and ask for a tiny dose and see how it makes you feel. Remember you don't have to take medicine if you don't want to!    good luck.
What is the cliche answer, make a pro and con list? Let’s do that  Pro: 1- According to the short term corporate studies 1 in 7 people taking any current antidepressant will receive a 2 point benefit on a 54 point scale. This is equivalent to saying you are ill, or gaining weight (yes weight gain is counted as “improved depression”), or playing less with your hair.   2- Some of the drugs are sedating, while some have stimulant like effects.  Con:   1- All long term research that factors out withdrawal effects finds these drugs worsen depression by 50%-200%.  2- Drugs given for depression increase all cause mortality by 25%-75%. Welbutrin which is also used as a weight loss drug increases all cause mortality by 75%. SSRI’s increase it by 49%  3- The FDA has black box warning that these drugs can cause suicide. Research finds the drugs increase suicide by 250%  4- The drugs cause cognitive impairment, dementia and more than double the chance of becoming disabled.  5- The drugs cause dependence and withdrawal effects that can prevent people from quiting. We see this in the relapse data where the entire drug benefit occurs during acute withdrawal and fades to nothing after time has passed.    https://www.madinamerica.com/2018/03/do-antidepressants-work-a-peoples-review-of-the-evidence/  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28903117/  https://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3697/rr-4

"In a small study of adults with major depression, Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers report that two doses of the psychedelic substance psilocybin, given with supportive psychotherapy, produced rapid and large reductions in depressive symptoms, with most participants showing improvement and half of study participants achieving remission through the four-week follow-up."   "The magnitude of the effect we saw was about four times larger than what clinical trials have shown for traditional antidepressants on the market,” says Alan Davis, Ph.D., adjunct assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “Because most other depression treatments take weeks or months to work and may have undesirable effects, this could be a game changer if these findings hold up in future ‘gold-standard’ placebo-controlled clinical trials.”  "For the entire group of 24 participants, 67% showed a more than 50% reduction in depression symptoms at the one-week follow-up and 71% at the four-week follow-up. Overall, four weeks post-treatment, 54% of participants were considered in remission – meaning they no longer qualified as being depressed"  We aren't just talking improvements, we're talking REMISSION!

Timothy Leary rolling in his grave yelling that we could have figured this out much sooner.
I was so mad after I did shrooms for the first time earlier this year and had incredible improvement in my depression, only to discover in subsequent internet digging that psychological experiments were done back in like the 50s or 60s that had already concluded that shrooms were demonstrably beneficial in treating a slew of mental illnesses. Yet we're made to believe that those 50 years of stigmatization and virtually no scientific research was all done in simple ignorance.
This would change my life - so many lives by alleviating so much suffering. I really hope psilocybin treatments are developed.
I couldn't find out how much but they were given two doses two weeks apart. how much were the doses I wonder
It's really simple large pharmaceutical companies can't patent these and make billions off people's sufferings.
I can tell you that personally, no other anti-depressant/SSRI or remedy has worked even half as effectively has mushrooms have for me. I used microdoses also which is a sub-perceptual dose(.3g) taken 2-4x weekly. The days i dosed, I felt amazing, like I could literally just shut off my depression. The off days, I would meditate for a short while and would try to bring myself back to that peaceful state of mind. To my surprise, I actually could! This medicine is amazing and I understand why they are called "Magic Mushrooms"
Judging by the impact of the sessions, my guess is somewhere between 2-4g. I could be wrong tho
They are sure as hell trying to patent it tho. It's just the business model thats not appealing to them. You really only need a couple doses as opposed to infinite perscriptions or a pill every day.
You're right. I think it's also threatening because shrooms can be effective with a single dose, but anti-depressants are literally addictive and ensure that users will continue to to be dependent on the product for years to come.

I (25m) have basically been somewhat depressed and unemployed since I finished grad school in September 2019. Since then and even before that (I was probably depressed in grad school and most if not all of undergrad) I’ve found that while I like working out and exercising it doesn’t make me feel that much better mentally.   I was briefly seeing a therapist who suggested I make sure to exercise more often and more regularly.   The thing is that I used to work out a lot and while it helps me feel better physically it doesn’t do that much for me mentally.   Are there any alternatives/things I can do that might help me more? I’ve found reading helps somewhat but other than that idk.  Edit: I’ve found that ref league team sports helped a bit but tbh I still struggle to focus on important things and they’re shut down in my area rn. For me, structure and consistent, good human interaction seem to help me the most.

Hi, I've had struggles with depression off and on. I'm 60.  Exercise works for me.  But here's some other things that also help me. Getting up in the morning and getting light, either lightbox or outside running.  Definitely structure and human interaction.  You need a purpose in life.  This could be a job you enjoy online now or after the pandemic.  It could be volunteer work, or answering reddit calls for help :)  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy CBT worked for me. If you feel horrible, meds for a short time only can get you out of dark spots.  Meditation (there's apps like headspace or insight timer) teach you how to let go of negative thoughts.   Reading books about depression can help..  I like "Upward Spiral" Good luck and let me know if any of this helped!

Hello, I do not have depression but my girlfriend does. She is a great person and a better person than I am. Her psychiatrist recently gave her a yearly update and she is still severely depressed but her outlook on life has improved. What are some small everyday things I can do that can help her or improve her quality of life?  I am getting better at just listening and not interrupting her when I think of a solution. We also have a way to express our frustrations or problems we have that day.

Hi. Good job. I'm not have experience in relationship because I'm depressed and I choose to not dating someone as long as I don't get out of that state of mind. But I'm know that if you keep listening when she's talk, you are kind, patient and comprehensive to her, you doing very well. Just keep going. Send you good vibe
Not to be harsh, but if you both have an expectation that this will just go away one day, don't expect it. I've had Depression for forty years. You can have a regular life with it, but it requires you manage your symptoms. Medication is definitely a way to do this.  It's an adjustment on both your parts, but it can happen.  I've had to give up on some goals, like getting a higher education, but I still have managed to be employed and productive. Your support and knowledge of her situation is admirable as many are in situations where family and loved ones have no frame of reference to mental illness.
You’re right. I know that depression is life long. She is taking medication and talks to a psychiatrist so that is really good.  I was wondering what small things I can do to help her. Like you said her family isn’t the most supportive when it comes to depression. I have learned from others with depression that it is a very heavy weight that hangs over someone and I just want to help lessen it for my girlfriend since she has a lot of work related stress as of late. Thank you for being truthful to me.
You are both on top of this. With some families there is a reluctance to accept because it could be something that runs in the family. Just putting that out there. I know you want to help, but remember this. She may do something that is outside of her control from Depression. It's not your fault. Depression has a subconscious aspect that can make you want to sabotage yourself. It can make you go into debt, miss deadlines, or worse. Keep an eye on her behavior. It can be subtle, but she has you to point this out. Take care...

have you talked to the police?
Please someone help me.  I beg of you!
The police won't do anything about it because it's cyberstalking and hard to prove without an investigation.
I've filed police reports in my city before.  They just ignore it.
are you okay? i literally just saw your other post
holy shit... is there anyway you could drastically change your appearance, change your name delete all media?
No. I'm not okay.
Idk. I doubt it.
how does he stalk you online?
Whoever it is, is stalking me online.
I got a private message from a redditor with the name 'Load' or they had load in their name.  Then I saw a post in this sub from earlier that contains the words ' unload groceries '.   I just bought groceries this morning and I think the person who made that post is the same guy as the one with 'load'  in his name.  I am being harassed.
but how like what examples idk how ppl stalk online
could you delete reddit and make a new account?
No because they will still see me buying groceries and still stalk me in person.  Deleting my account won't affect that.
im sorry sis all i can think of is getting protection to keep on you, and never be alone out
I don't have anyone.  I'm all alone.
or find an AA group to talk to people and they’ll have your back, find someone. or get a dog

I am very anxious and worried and hope it will not escalate.  Over the summer came out of a serious depression. Now I am on Lithium and Mirtazipine having previously been on everything, benzos and sleepers at night.  I suppose I should be glad I am better.  But my main anxiety is my meds. Lithium makes me flat, emotionless. Mirtazipine makes me groggy and hungover.   I want to get off them, but I basically worried that I am addicted, even though these drugs aren't strictly speaking, addictive.  Being on these drugs fills me with dread.  But I know, if I don't take them, I won't sleep. And I am scared, as over time,  the sedative effects of Lithium will fade and I will be in trouble and won't be able to sleep.  This is my main worry, my main anxiety and it's beginning to consume me.

The emotionlessness can be a symptom of your depression. When it comes to medication you are within your rights to tell your doctor that you don't like how they make you feel and request to try something else. Your doctor will respect that.  Lithium has a lot of side effects, do i would ask to try something else.  Getting a good night's sleep is beneficial to you. Definitely ask to change that medication as well. I had to take Ativan to sleep, but at a very small dose since it's a narcotic. The last one I took was Remeron which worked great and I could eventually sleep without it.  You have to be an active participant in your treatment.
Thanks for your excellent advice. I will have to take to my psych.  I have asked to have Li reduced. Problem is I'm only entitled to a psych visit every three months. It seems to me an eternity until the middle of March, until then I feel I will be more addicted and my body will be used to the meds.
Drink lots of water while on Lithium.  One side effect is dry mouth, but it can hurt your teeth in the process.  Most meds don't have a physical addiction as a result. You still need to take them on schedule for the best result. Take care...

Hey! Here for you if you want to chat! I would ask what do you do for yourself every day?
thank you so much.. usually i work two jobs but i’ve been sick for a week just dreading going back to work. i live w my boyfriend but im still so sad all the time.
Even with two jobs need to find 5 min to yourself to read, meditate, work on hobbies, something for yourself and your mind
I want to meditate, but i’m not sure how, is it just like praying? and thank you so much for being so nice
Glad to help! Russel Brand on YouTube had some good meditation videos . One question that really helped me is “are you aware you have feeling / touch in your hand without actually touching anything “   The thought can we then moved to each part of your body , let any thought come and go in your mind, eventually for me it was almost like an out of body experience after  and that continued for awhile. Find the method that works for you!
i’m gonna try that you’re amazing thank you
Glad to help and here if you ever need to help. Let me know how your first session goes !

Let's  suppose a college decides to get someone framed for criminal harassment. Don't question the truth of it, just pretend for a moment that it's true : they framed you.   What are some of the reasons a college would cherry pick a particular student and choose to do that to them?  This question pertains to my depression so that's why I'm asking.   So what do you think? Why would a college do that to just one student in particular?

.
Could be a money issue. They only have so many slots and they want to muscle out the lesser paying students for someone more affluent. Or, it could be a boxes thing; they want to look diverse, so they muscle out some of the students that don't have the right look in order to make room for students with the aesthetic they want. Could be a lack of support. Like, say, they need to trim the scholastic budget without causing too much of an issue. Who's least likely to kick up a major fuss?  This is all speculation, mind. It could have nothing to do with what's happening.
Unless the prestige part was meant as a joke. ;)
I find it suspicious that they aren't even willing to talk to me about it. Perhaps because they know they are in the wrong and don't care.  Their police chief said the following in regards to the professors at that college: "They're lost in their own worlds. They just want to push the students through the classes and get their money."
I hate to be that person, but of course they don't want to talk to you about it. If they talk to you about it, admit it in any way shape or form, you have a solid case against them. By *not* talking to you about it, all your evidence is circumstantial and they can play it off as you being paranoid.   My advice: start taking notes. Document everything (incidents that occur, time incidents occur, witnesses if you can find them), make copies if you can. And see if you can get a consultation with a lawyer: DO NOT try to use campus legal. Their first loyalty won't be to you. (A lot of lawyers offer free consultation.) And if the police officer you spoke to is connected with the college, find one that isn't. Again, their first loyalty is to the college, not you. (Sorry about that, but it is true. Trust me, I live in a college town.)  I'm sorry this is happening to you. Good luck.
Thanks for your advice. From my perspective, the situation is an absurd "battle " if you will, that no student should ever have to fight and of course the question goes back to, "Why me of all people ?" I was a quiet,  shy, well behaved 4.0 GPA student at this college and they want to paint me as some kind of criminal.   I just can't believe that it happened to me because I'm an unlikely person for this to happen to. I'm the type that runs away from trouble,  not towards it.  Thanks anyway. I'll keep your advice in mind.
Good luck.

So. I'm 17 getting ready to move out but I have...issues. I planned to talk to a friend but I already know (or think I do cause im Sooo smart. "Sarcasm") how it's going to go.   I'm into minecraft and other games as well as writing books with myself as the lead character.   In all the books (more like books in my head."day dreams?")i'm always a king. Or always someone with alot of power. In these I do what I can to help people. So I never thought much of it.  But after today, after I made an entire server (maybe 15-20 players) fear me as I constantly killed and grieved them and they're homes, the joy I felt as I was doing this was the same as what I got from my day dreams.   It scares me because in my house I have no power. Anything I say that my folk might not like could result in extreme punishment so I don't say anything.   What really terrifies me is the fact that when I get confirmable with someone or a group I tend to show my angry side a bit more. And I'm afraid I might hurt my wife and kids (if I ever manage that).  I know it's kinda a stretch, in game abuse and irl, but idk.  I've recently tried noticing when I'm acting depressing or am trying to seek attention via sympathy and so I'll stop mid convo, apologize and change the subject cause I'm trying to better myself.  It should be said that I find extreme joy from helping people both irl and in game and it is part of me to want to help people but. Idk.  Im afraid that I might turn. Or something. Like. If I get to conferrable or something I'll let my emotions take over and do something Ill regret.   If anyone can tell me either what I need to do or look out for to prevent me from abusing my family I would be very grateful.   (TL;DR) Love killing and hurting people in game and afraid I'll hurt future family cause I got to conferrable.

Hi,  I'm a mom who has two children in their early 20s.  One of whom has anxiety and depression.  My first thought is that you have a lot of anger towards your parents that you can't express except through the game.  The fact that you are concerned about not hurting anyone, tells me you are a good person.  I suggest you find a good therapist, trusted friend, or religious leader and talk this stuff through.  It's OK that you're angry at your parents.  It's ok to talk about feeling depressed to a trusted friend.  If you like you can just talk out these feelings here on reddit.  Please let us know how it's going.  You matter, you are not alone.

im sorry sis, if it helps at all i’m so fucking depressed. i hope things get better for you. you’re wanted in this world.
I feel you brother. I lost my brother 5 yrs ago when he was 16, then my grandpa in 2019 and now my girlfriend died in May 2020. Maybe my time has come too.
Hey man, listen, to feel better about yourself you need to treat yourself as if it was a girl who you have a crush on. No way around it. Start by giving yourself very little objectives through out the day such as making your bed, doing 10 push ups or going on a brief walk and stuff like that. Then slowly raise the bar. In the meantime, i would suggest writing what you feel, why you feel that way and what's the real cause of it. Be extremely sincere with yourself. No lies. It's you and you only and don't show it to anybody but someone who is reeeally trust worthy. Writing helps you analize what's going on inside your head. You give it a clear picture as it forces you to think properly about your true emotions. Then, my man, when you're done writing, think deeply about what you want to do about it, think about wheter it's worth worrying and need action or you can just let it pass. Your life, your choice.
Bro, not sis lol but thank you🥺
I know I don’t know you dude, but you’re loved. Some people get life’s low blows thrown at them sooner than others. It’s unfortunate but we gotta let it build who you are and become the person you’re meant to be. Don’t give up. Keep fighting bro may not seem like it but things will get better, just gotta keep fighting homie.

It's okay to feel sad and lonely sometimes. Has something happened recently to make you feel like this? Sometimes this time of year can be difficult for lots of other people, too. You aren't alone in this community ;-) <3
Same, but in the future I hope to find people that have similar personalities as of mine, It will be hard but as a last resort I may come back here to try and find someone that is similar to me. although I can't be too picky...
Not particularly helpful but okay.

Please don't disappear. The world only has 1 you. Are you up to calling a hotline? Those are created for anyone in crisis, they want you to call. There are literally people waiting on the other end of the phone to talk to you and hear your story and help you figure out a way to a better life. Please please call the hotline (or a local crisis center)
Yes, please call someone to help, there s a light for everybody. You re not alone in this.
Keep fighting. Know that this may only be temporary. You have everything within you to overcome these obstacles.  Try calling a hotline or even a family Member
Just ride it out. You know it will pass bc you have felt this way before. I’ve been here so many times too. It’s the WORST feeling in the world. You don’t want to die but you’re tired of going thru this shit! You just want the pain to go away. I’ve given up trying to talk to someone who doesn’t understand depression or what it is (it’s not about being sad!) bc they give you really frustrating advice that just makes you feel more hopeless (you didn’t even know it could feel worse!). Get a hobby; get a job, exercise, think happy thoughts 😃 (I never thought of that! 🙄)...calling a hotline is the best way to go. They KNOW the feeling of despair and how to talk you thru it. They’ve done it for many and they aren’t condescending or cold hearted. These are ppl who REALLY WANT to help others. They are a God send. Use them! Please!!  Edit: I woke up this morning and realized I needed to go to Target to get bday cards for my 2 grandnieces. Both of their bdays are tmrw, they’re 2 yrs apart. I had the biggest anxiety attack. I didn’t bother to dress Christmas day and faced with having to get up, take a shower and get presentable just totally overwhelmed me. I was almost in tears. But I pushed on thru and got it done. YOU can too. You know you can. 💕💕💕💕💕
Yes, please do that if you can. I totally relate to the wish to dissappear. But this wish never lasted forever. Although in that particular moment it seems like it will never ends. But it won't. Try to make that call and maybe read a little in this subreddit. You are not alone with those feelings.

OK, so I guess this is an expansion on the classic panic attack "focus on a few sounds, smells, visuals etc." (which I've also personally found useful in various situations).  Setting: car passenger so there was plenty of stimulus; I needed to clear my head and focus on the now as I was kinda stuck in the usual thought whirlpool. Basically I tried concentrating on individual objects around me e.g. 'apartments', and then label as many synonyms or associated words before it passed by (Tower block, high rise, concrete...). By repeating this over and over, with objects varying from grassland to the dashboard in front of me I somehow managed to return to the present, and actually ended up feeling a lot more 'present' than I have been for a few weeks.  Not sure if this helps anyone else, but hoping it might. Planning to try it out next time I take the train as my headphones world is comforting but can occasionally stray into melancholic territory   Does anyone else have any similar techniques or experiences btw? Putting this under inspiration as I'm kinda interested to see if there's any verifiable cognitive processes behind it.   Hope this is useful to someone anyway : )

This is definitley a great technique for staying grounded. Are you into meditation at all?
Great idea!  I’ve been up since 3am, right on schedule for my normal negative thought rumination period. It normally runs from 2-3 hours 😫 so I’m gonna try this now.  It’s like being mindful but also labeling things as well, which helps you refocus and be even more present 👍  Awesome idea and thanks again! ☺️
Really great post. This is similar and have been very helpful if you get in the habit. https://www.laughteronlineuniversity.com/hooponopono-4-simple-steps/
This almost exact technique is something that my therapist suggested I use. It’s part of the “thinking” skill from the “ACCEPTS” DBT skill. Basically, you mindfully think about something repetitively, and in a specific manner, in order to refocus your thoughts and gain control over them. It helps with rumination and distress tolerance. It’s a good distraction when you’re feeling overwhelmed by your thoughts or other things. So yeah, it’s a thing and you did awesome using it. I still haven’t really used that one tbh. I stick mostly to Activities, Contributions, and Sensations.   https://www.therapistaid.com/worksheets/dbt-distress-tolerance-skills.pdf
Damn you brought the heat with this folder. Tons of good stuff in there. Gonna bookmark this for sure, thanks
Not particularly; I like taking a few minutes' peace by myself but it's not a routine - always found 'mindfulness' to be too much of a fad for me. It's interesting there are techniques that help, but it's always seemed like an approach that doesn't really address the chemical imbalance side of things - might do a bit of research into grounding techniques though : )
No worries! Really hope it helps, and wishing that the negative thoughts pass without too much pain : )
Thank you for the information, I had no idea! Will make sure to dig a little deeper. Hope your activities, contributions and sensations are also effective for you
😘
Yeah I felt the same way too initially. This technique you described in your post is pretty much the jist of mindfulness. By focusing on the present, here and now, you have already begun the mindfulness process. The trick is to always have that sense of awareness even when you are not struggling, as sort of a proactive solution to preventing getting stuck in our heads and spiraling into panic attacks or manic episodes.  As far as the chemical balance of things, microdosing psilocybin mushrooms has helped me "re-wire" my brain to have a whole new perspective on things. There are studies on how psilocybin promotes nuerogenesis and nueroplasticity to help us find new avenues of coping and dealing with problems. Have you read anything or have any experience with mushrooms or psychedelics? I really recommend giving them a chance despite the stigma
I love this about micodosing! I used to hang without a lot people who just tripped their asses off, and after I got out of that fad, it kinda put a bad taste in my mouth of psychedelics. I stopped doing them but I did tap into microdosing mushrooms a couple years ago and it did help me so much feel normal and focused, like I could hear my thoughts so clearing when I was reading a book and was able to label them as anxiety and just got a taste of how my mind works and return back to the present. It’s crazy how much our mind controls our reality, it really can trap our. A prison of our own making, though I try not to blame ourselves to hard that only makes it worse. The mind is like a being of it’s own and it’s tricky to control but not impossible. Anyway my point was I did try microdosing, I recommend. I just haven’t been around people and don’t know where to get my hands on some. I wish they were legal and more studies were invested into them.
The future for psychedelic medicine is bright! Johns Hopkins University is doing studies on mushrooms effect on terminally ill cancer patients and has given 80% of participants relief from existential dread they had from knowing they would die. Personally, microdosi ng did for me what literally dozens of anti-depressants and SSRI's couldnt do for me. The crazy part is, you dont even need to take them for that long for them to have long term effects. I only microdosed for 2-3x a week for 2 months before I felt like I had conquered my depression and had gained the mental tools I needed to keep it at bay. I was a heroin/opiate addict for 8 years and the primary reason I am clean is because of psychedelic medicine. PM me and we can chat if you'd like. I would love to help you out
Wow that is beautiful!!! I’m so happy to hear you conquered addiction and depression! I would love to chat, I’m always open and extremely curious to learning about the power of mushrooms! I’ll pm you here!

I went to the emergency room Saturday night for SI. I was in denial. I went to the emergency room my husband worked at and he made me promise I'd be honest. So I was. I told them about my accidental overdose on my medication (10/10 don't recommend), and how it was office gossip the next day. How my manager accused me of making myself sick on purpose and said I can't be breaking down at work, that patient's can't he seeing that. (I was in my car, on my lunch break.) How my manager said they were trying to accommodate my illnesses but I was making it too hard. (Sorry wall of text.)  I ended up in a psych hospital because I was "gravely disabled." The hospital didn't even keep me 72 hours because they said "this is a place to get psychiatric help, not run away from work and life.)  As soon as I got discharged I called my therapist office on Tuesday and they got me in a house called Respit. It's run by people who work for my therapist/psychiatrist office. They don't care what you do, it literally let's your brain rest. They have an app through the office called My Strengths. One of the questions was about writing your story, were you writing it or were you allowing others to write it. On my blog I wrote part of my story, but I blanked stuff out so I wouldn't hurt people's feelings. Stop caring! Those people did stuff to you to make you depressed/gave you PTSD! When I get discharged, hopefully tomorrow, I'm rewriting my story. The good, the bad, the ugly. I'm not blanking out names this time.  Draw, write in a journal, blog. Get these horribly, depressing feelings out of you. It's a start in the healing process. You may lose family and friends, but if they were really family and friends wouldn't they care about hearing your story, about why you were depressed?  So who's writing your story. You? Or people around you.

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kkxzj1/partner_is_tone_deaf_to_my_experience_with/
TLDR: Partner tries to support me but is completely tone deaf to my depression despite being with me for 3+ years. Today I had no energy and felt empty and he just comes home complaining about the outcome of a football game despite me not even having the energy to greet him or help him unload the groceries when he got home. And he knew I was depressed today because I told him. Feeling unseen. Needing support.    Today I had depression symptoms and I felt weak, tired, and a great sense of emptiness. My partner knows I suffer from depression and has been with me over 3 years now. He kind of tries to be supportive but he comes off super tone deaf.   I live with my partner and he was gone for the majority of the day to help his dad do some repairs so I was home alone.   Even though I felt these symptoms I managed to still run the dishwasher and washing machine to at least be a little productive. But I was just going through the motions just finishing my housewife duties before I plopped myself down and attempted to numb or distract myself via YouTube.   I still feel empty and lack motivation to do anything. The feeling was getting heavier through the evening.   Fast forward to when my partner comes home. He asks “how are you?” And I’m too exhausted to reply and shake my head. He goes on to take a shower since he’s dirty from repair work and proceeds to make himself dinner.   I don’t mind these things but when he checks in on me again he’s rambling about the outcome of a football game. He’s so disappointed since his team loses all the time and even though I don’t get sports, I know it’s important to him... but he is so tone deaf because he goes:  Him: how are you?  Me: *shakes head* Him: I’m not doing good either.  I don’t have the effort to respond but in that moment I felt so unseen. I spent the entire day alone and suffering from my symptoms and this guy comes in rambling about a football game. It’s just so... tone deaf and above all, I feel like he doesn’t get it.  He goes on to say: “I know you’re going to mention this to our therapist about how I’m reacting to this game but she’ll ask ‘did you even see the game?’l  At this point my disappointment and frustration is at a high. I don’t have the energy to respond and at this point my hair is a mess from laying on the floor all day and tears are streaming down my eyes.  I feel so unsupported by my partner right now. I’ve tried to explain to him in the past why his response to a football game is inappropriate when I’m going through a depressive episode but he keeps being tone deaf. He claims he tries and gives me words of affirmation but they lose meaning when he says the same things over and over again:  “I appreciate you cooking... cleaning... I’m here.”  But they feel so empty if he really isn’t there for me the way I need him to be and if he’ll say “me too” about his mood when my mood is based on my illness.  I’m so infuriated and I just want to feel seen.  Thank you for reading. ;(

I get it. Believe me, I do. I've got a partner who does the same. The idea here is to understand that your depression has nothing to do with your so. It's not his fault. He doesn't live vicariously through you. He has his own emotions. Expecting him to constantly try to help your mental state isn't what your lover is supposed to do. Your happiness and mental state are dependant on you. Not him. I know this may come across as insensitive, but it's true. We have to depend on ourselves to fix ourselves. He wanted to talk about his issues and you brushed him off. You may have done the same to him, that you accuse him of doing.

Quarantine has been rough, and I've been treated like shit by my family, last year, I had my cousin living with us, then in December, my other cousin and her husband came here, so we put them in a room which had a bunch of my toys in it (Legos and other things) and they have a lot of pets. A few weeks from Christmas, my brother and mom  went shopping, and they found a milky way calendar, and mom said to get it for me, my brother told me that they got it, and that he wanted it, then on Christmas morning, I open it, and he calls out, "That's the one I wanted asshole!" he spoiled my present, then called me an asshole, so I ended up giving him the calendar, I regret that, when I handed it to him, he seemed upset at me. The mess of 2020 started, so in January, my cousins let the animals out of their room, some of them decided to pee and crap in places where they're not supposed to. So it's Martin King day, off from school, and one of the animals peed on the floor, so I told my cousin, mom decided to work that day from home, she was very stressed, and took her anger out on me, so I just went into my room, and didn't come out, after I had calmed down, I went to go see our birds which are in my brother's room, and he scolded me for "making mom upset" he always criticizes me when someone gets upset, he always does this, other people do something to clear their heads, and he leaves them alone, but when I clear my head, he just scolds me, so I just left his room and went back to my room, after a while, I come back up and saw the birds, he wasn't there, after I saw the birds, I came back downstairs, and he's in the cousins' room, and they're talking shit about me, they said that it was "violent" of me to tell them that their animal peed on the floor. After that I started to ignore them and not say hi or anything to them, a few days later, it was ones birthday, so I just pretended to care that it was her birthday. March comes around and there's a worldwide pandemic, so now I'm doing school from home, I set up my laptop in the front room, which is right by their room, every few days or so, I'd do a mental health boys group on Microsoft Teams with a counselor, and she wanted me to show everyone my electric guitar, and whenever I'd play it, my cousin would come out to complain. One day, I had baked a frozen pizza for myself, and my other cousin and brother came home with a giant pizza from Joey's, and the first thing they said to me was "NO, you can't have any!"  Hi how was your day Mine was good, thanks for asking. Then Spring starts, and I broke my foot one day, so I had carefully crawled downstairs and my dad gave me a boot, so I saw my cousin, and she didn't seem to care, I went to go see the birds, and my brother didn't seem to care either, he actually got upset at me when I had a bird on my shoulder. After a few weeks, I took the boot off, and my foot didn't hurt anymore, about another week later, I asked mom if she could take me to the skatepark, she said yes, but my brother criticized me and said that my foot may be at risk, so now he cares, and he only cared about my broken foot just to criticize me. I go "back" to school after break, I was at the desk, and one of their cats was out, and was trying to eat something off the floor that it could choke on, so I pick up what it was trying to eat, and I tell my brother, he got upset at me, then he went into the cousins' room, and they talk shit about me, and they don't want me to be around the cat or any of the other animals, because I prevented it from choking to death, WTF. On the first day of summer, my skateboard truck broke, so I started riding my bike more, and I took the bike to the skatepark, and one day, I took a sharp turn, and fell over, my phone was in my pocket, and my phone bent, it still worked, but I couldn't call/text, so my dad went and bought a new one, at Wal-Mart, and it sucks, but it can call/text so I guess that's good, one point in the summer, their dog was out, and it went up to my other brother's room, shat on his floor, covered it with a piece of his clothing, then pissed on his bed, and for some reason, whenever their animals piss/shit on the floor, they always make the husband clean it up, it's their animals, and they can't even clean up after them, so they wanted the husband to go up to my brother's room, and he took the dog out on a walk, so my brother had to pick up after THEIR animal. The husband has also had a lot of strokes, so he is not that bright. After that, we made a rule that ALL the animals should stay IN the room, they completely said fuck you to that and ignored it, so about a week later, the dog was out, so I put a baby gate up by the stairs, and she shat on the floor next to the gate, again, the husband cleans it up. Now it's September, ever heard the Green Day song "Wake Me Up When September Ends?" So now I'm a sophomore, and going to school in the building, being in high school is so fucking hard, some point in September, it's the weekend, and the cats were out, one of them also pees and shits in places that are not a litter box, I go to the upstairs bathroom, and the cat shat on a towel, I notify my cousin, and she yelled at me, she YELLED at me when I told HER that HER ANIMAL shat, and I've told her a million goddamn times that  her animals aren't supposed to be out, she just ignores that, in October, it's my birth month, about a week after my birthday, my cousin is staying out in the living room with her cats, and, guess what, one cat, once again, peed on a towel, this time, I didn't tell her, because I figured she'd just yell at me again. One night, I come upstairs, and there's a tray of brownies, so my cousin, said that my brother made them, and that they're for everybody, so I cut off a tiny piece, then she said that he made them for himself, and they're not for everybody, so then my brother comes down, and starts scolding at me, I explain to him that I thought that they were for everybody, he gets mad and starts yelling at me, dad tells my to go downstairs to go get mom's dish, I open the basement door and go down a few steps, then they start talking shit about me, this time I confront them, and I bring up the other time they talked shit about me, apparently it was wrong of me to stand up for myself, I put the brownie back, and apologized, but, he was still angry, and still yelling at me, and my dad is talking to me, and I mention that I got yelled at when I told my cousin that her animal shat, and then she screams "Well maybe I don't want to be told that first thing in the morning"  well maybe I wouldn't have told you that if you kept your animals in the room, not like I've said anything about that or anything, and I said the she should be more responsible for her animals, she yelled at me and stormed out. Now it's November, one day I was out skateboarding, and I go back into my room, after a while, my mom comes into my room, and she was crying, she told me that cousin and brother were talking shit about me skateboarding, and that she confronted them, and cousin said that I haven't apologized yet. So mom came into my room, without knocking, and wanted me to apologize for what I said, what did I say that was so hurtful, saying that she should be more responsible, confronting them when they were talking shit, or mentioning that she yelled at me for her animal shitting, how is any of that hurtful? I tried to apologize, but my brother said in an angry tone, "Do you mean it, or are you just saying that because we're upset" I said that I actually mean it, then he said that I should apologize to cousin, I ask where she is and he tells me that she is out in the car, I start walking towards the car, and he says not right now, why would you tell me where she is if now is not the right time? Now it's December, on Christmas morning, my brother got another milky way calendar, he called me an asshole last year when I had gotten something that he wanted, I am so fucking tired of all this bullshit they put me through, and they talk shit about other people, one time, they had made dinner, they just put a bunch of random things together and called it food, they didn't have a recipe or anything, and my older brother asked them what it was, so a different night, they are making dinner again, and they bring that up and start talking shit about him, and mom confronts them, and they insult her and hurt her feelings. My cousins don't wash their hands when they go to the bathroom, and the husband picks up the dog shit with his hands, doesn't use plastic gloves or a grocery bag, just his hands. On their anniversary, she is talking shit about him, and says "he's so fucking stupid" he's stupid because of all those strokes he's had. One day, she came home from work, and he asked her how her day was, and she yelled at him, and she tells the other cousin, and she said that he probably deserved it, he just asked you how your day was, because he cares about you, and you yell at him and think he deserved it, be he's done nothing wrong. They also think that the whole wetspot thing was "violent" but here's some things they do, they yell at their animals, they yell at people, we had the front door open, and when she opened the bedroom door, one cat walked out, and she spanked the cat, how is the cat supposed to know if the door is open, one of the cats sits at the bedroom door meowing for attention, and she throws something at the door, they are always watching a R rated movie which had violence in it, the do all this, and me telling them that an animal peed is "violent" this is bullshit. Whenever I am talking to someone, I am constantly interrupted, multiple times, whenever I get interrupted, I let out a big sigh, or frustrated groan, and people walk away from me when I am talking, it fells that nobody cares about what I have to say, and I've tried to explain my depression to my mom, she doesn't really care, she gets angry and wants to start drinking. During quarantine, my cousin is scolding me because I'm not wearing a mask or staying 6ft apart, and that she is  more likely to get it because of her weak immune system, she says that while smoking a cigarette, when we went out together, we were all wearing masks, and she was wearing hers below the nose, yelling at me for not wearing a mask, meanwhile she's wearing hers incorrectly.

OK, so I want to know what happens in your everyday life. Please comment if you can. I wanna hear it.   For me, it’s waking up late at 12PM. Sometimes not eating on time. Use my phone for 9+ hours, if not, play a video game, or video games for 9+ hours for the day. Eat food, maybe shower. Poop and piss. Sleep late. Procrastinate homework. This is for the holiday break or if there is no school.   If there is school, it’s just the same except I wake up at 7AM and go to online class and do the same things after school. There’s no fun and mental stimulation. Are your days just like mine? It’s super sad.  Do I have to live like this until the end of 2021? It’s sad to see so many people in my country are fine with this. Like I don’t see any sad people or any rants with living like this.  Plus life is dog-shit in my country. My main goal in life is to leave this country and settle in a first world country so I can be happy, no joke. You can’t do anything here, they say it’s more fun here but it’s not. My future doesn’t look bleak or bright. Just normal, my grades are awful. There has been some tiny progress on bettering it though.  Also, time is sooo fast. It’s been so faster since the start of quarantine. It’s crazy. Time flies so fast because of the monotonous activities I do. This contributes to my sadness. 1 second kinda translates to 3 seconds. Some months feel faster than others. :(  I think quarantine has taken a toll on my mental health, maybe physical health too.   I watched a movie again for the first time since April 2020 in December, I actually watched 3 movies so far in December 2020. I kinda just spontaneously watched a movie with my family which is pretty cool.   Last thing I’ll say, Christmas was kinda depressing. It ended so quickly. I wish it snowed here. How was your Christmas?  Please comment on what you guys do in your lives in these times. I’m curious.    Thanks for reading. It means a lot. :(

My Christmas was shit too. I feel you, my dude. I feel like we live in world where we are being manipulated and being hardwired into our phones so much to the point where they’re only using their phones to make a career out of it. It’s sad, real sad for the majority out there breaking their backs and sacrificing their health, just to make the public give less of a fuck of their surroundings and trash everywhere they go. Sometimes I wish that you, me, and the people who feel that life sucks should cuddle up together and jump off a high elevated mountain or something and just leave this planet.

Tw climate change etc (sorry). okay I consider myself extremely privileged that the thought plaguing nearly moment of my life is about climate change rather than something personal. My life is pretty good, considering. I love my family, I have good friends. I live in a house with a dog. A part time job at a library. I am crippled with terror over the future and it’s destroying me to the point where sometimes I have to force myself to move. I feel like I don’t have a future at all. Climate change I feel like has given me (everyone..) a death sentence in ten years. Probably sooner. I... I’m so tired. I’m tired of reading the news of things getting worse and worse, of governments not doing anything. What’s the use of doing anything in my own life if everything I do will be destroyed by a handful of people who don’t care about the world? Why try to have a career for myself if I’m going to die at thirty something? What’s the point of being happy if I’m aware it’s going to be cut short? I’m sorry if there’s anyone terminally ill out there and I’m making you feel worse, I’m venting. I feel no hope. I feel so beaten down by the people who are trying to kill us all. And I feel like I can’t talk to this about anyone. It’s a privileged problem. It’s a problem so huge it’s technically not “mine,” it’s ours. No one else seems as constantly terrified about it. I need help. Please. Reddit always makes my moods worse when it comes to this, everyone is always saying “we’re fucked”. I feel awful that this is the thing bothering me the most while people are actually suffering. Please, someone help me.

Context: I (20M) have had depression symptoms since 14, but began medications at 18. Family doesn't know. A select few friends know, but none are really my source of support and comfort.   The holiday season always gets me in a more depressive mood, but with covid im able to slip further into it. I live 45 min from my fam in an apartmemt by my school's campus. I rarely go home; before Christmas i hadnt been back since July. But I'm sleeping excessively (around 12 hrs), I spend my day watching tv. im not good with group chats and my friends arent good at convos with just me. i just don't want to get stuck. how can i stay motivated on a daily?  i may go to the gym, but that's all i got at the moment   any tips would be helpful

Do you have a reason for the minimal contact with your family? Do you have a supportive, functional family or sibling?
ive been snorting kratom extract mixed with pure caffeine on a daily since full lockdown started in my country 2 months ago. I am royally fucked over by these policies I am not even gonna go into it but basically 3 and a half years of every day tunnel vision level work is getting lost so needless to say I want to kill myself every day but this combo certainly helps me forget that by now I would be making 10k-20k a month if this didn’t happen lost 10 kilos of weight though so careful there is a Ketamine like substance in Kratom that heals depression dramatically also some stimulant opioids imo not that hard to stop using but I am someone who kicked meth addiction with meth and cocaine within arms reach so I can get away with anything at this point
Nah my parents divorced like 10 years ago now and since then there's be increasing disconnect. I'm closest with my mother but I have the whole "I don't want to burdern her" mentality. I'm spending a few more days with her before I leave but idk im going downhill not up

Hi there! I’m glad that you’re reaching out. I’m sorry to hear about your depression and that your parents may not be very open minded in regards to these things. Ok so back to your question, I’m just wondering, may your parents be any more open to helping you get started in therapy? Therapy is often the first step anyways (before anti depressants), and many people suffering from depression even gets better from therapy without anti depressants. And actually, doctors are even more cautious prescribing anti depressants to youths under the age of 18. Depends on the country, but in my country most doctors would advise therapy before anti depressants, even for people over the age of 18. So, I’d say that therapy would be a good starting point. I’m not sure if therapy is any easier bringing up than anti depressants though?

I use to be very active in middle school (sports, hanging with friends,  ect...). High School came along and I lost touch with pretty much  everyone and never said a word in classes for all 4 years. Once I got my  first job I felt much better and felt I was living a normal life. Then  gradually 6 years later I noticed little things changing like being more  anxious and panicky, especially driving. I use to drive everywhere and  had no issues. Every year has been gradually worse since than and the  best way to describe my symptoms is that my mind feels like it has  receded, like its exposed or something. I also am beginning to question  reality and if I moving parts of my body. I have had MRI'S and CAT scans  and everything turns back normal.  On top of this, the worsening of  symptoms has restricted me to staying home because of the now fear of  driving and panic attacks and being afraid of night. ANY HELP or  GUIDANCE as to what this could be??? greatly appreciated!

Honestly I think it would be best to get in touch with a counselor or some form of mental health expert to get their informed option on your situation. But it sounds to me like anxiety is probably a factor in your experience, which can often be deeply connected with depression. Best wishes, I hope you find the answers you need
Thank you. I am seeing someone but I just started.

I’m tired of living with my family. I always knew they’re toxic to me. But since Depression, I’ve come to realize just how toxic they really are. I don’t have a job, I’m not in college, I don’t know how to drive, n I have no friends. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my family, but I need to move out. I need something of my own. That isn’t connected to my family.   Now, I’m gonna get to the point of this post... I know the answer might be no, but I’ll ask anyway. Is there any type of place that offers u a place to stay? I know there’ll have to be some type of catch in turn. But I can’t stand living with my mom who keeps saying, “I wanna see about putting u in some home, where they make u take care of urself.” Or “I wanna put u in some program where they make u make friends.” Or even saying something about trying to find something about finding another home my hamster, that I bought with my own money. N I take care of my pet as good as any other good pet owner. I’m 19, I know I’m not the most high maintenance, self care caring person. But she can’t force me into anything like that. I’m so tired of living with someone who talks about me everyday, along with my siblings- who don’t do it as much, but still.   I think if I can just get a job, I can save up for my own place, n move away. From there learn to drive, n hopefully be in college by then. N maybe try n move out of state someday.   Even if there is no place like this, can u please give me some advice on what I can do? I feel like I wanted to ask another question but I forgot...

When I say all I want is what I’ve **WORKED** for, how does that mean come up with an excuse?  When I say I’ve worked 20 years in order to achieve a career as a professional opera singer, how does that mean “you need mental health resources”?    When I ask what would be so terrible about giving me what I’ve worked for, why does that mean avoid the question?    When I say I have suicidal tendencies because of **SOMEONE ELSE PROVOKING THEM**, how does that mean send the mobile crisis unit to come after ME, instead of send the police to come after THEM?  Obviously we seem to be having some problems with our fucking ENGLISH LANGUAGE motherfuckers!!  Either everyone speaks a completely different language from English, or something about the things coming out of my mouth translate into something ELSE!  So what’s the problem?  Obviously something IS WRONG, because if there wasn’t, I’d have received what I worked for, instead of gotten depressed and suicidal earning it without receiving it.  So let’s have it?  What’s wrong with my communication?

Hi everyone, I came across an amazing app called [Argo](https://web.watchargo.com/auth/registration?referral_id=P08MISS2). The creators curated a playlist of short films on mental health. These videos depict the physical manifestations of mental illnesses and the wide variety of struggles that people face on a daily basis. This is a great resource for friends and family who don’t understand what you’re going through, and it is a helpful reminder that you are not alone.

I went off LIHTIUM and had a relapse now I'm back on lithium 1200 and latuda raised to 60 mg I found out u have to take latuda with food to help u but if I never took it with food and I was on a low dosage and I was stable what's now ?? I'm also on birth control and before my period and feeling depressed I was thinking maybe its that and has nothing to do with the medication.Im getting off birth control to see how I feel then.

Is there any way you could get a new psychologist or therapist? :)
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kkreqs/how_to_plan_for_the_future/
For context, I'm a recovering drug addict (303 days sober as of today), I have had chronic depression for 13 years. I've been on and off medication and I'm currently on 100mg sertraline. I've been having non-contact CBT due to COVID-19 (all online) for around 6 weeks and I'm planning to go private with therapy in January when I'll have a little more disposable income.   One thing that I just can't seem to get back into my life is being able to see past today. I'm trying to think about what I want for myself in 2021, I've been sat here with a document open titled "Goals" trying to imagine what I want to achieve in my life and it feels like a physical barrier in my mind when I try to think, I just can't imagine what I want for myself. I wasn't always this way, until I was about 22 I used to plan out all these things I wanted to do and all these things I wanted to achieve, but I guess now I haven't wanted anything for myself because.. Well, I just wanted to not be alive and all I've done is survive the day for years. I sometimes wonder how much damage my chronic drug use has done to my brain and if my inability to think complexly about the future is related to this.   How, if you have experienced this, have you gotten past this? How have you gotten excited for your life again post-depression? Is this a sign that maybe my CBT and medication isn't helping as much as I thought?   Any opinions or advice would be much appreciated, thank you.

I do not think it’s the medication that’s making it worse or help . Medications tend to just keep u stable without the psychotic mind . What type of environment are you in and are you currently working ?
My home life in particular has been stressful recently just with having an elderly/sick parent, but I'd felt like I was coping with that better with the CBT. I do work, but I've been on holiday with almost zero responsibilities for a few weeks over Christmas and still found myself unable to concentrate. Maybe setting goals and thinking about my own future is something I'll just have to keep practicing until it gets easier?

I haven't been able to see a doctor, or a professional who can diagnose and help me, I haven't been able to get up the courage to talk about this with anyone.  I remember there were nights when I would stay up crying until dawn, where I just wanted to die, where I just wanted to end this pain that I didn't understand where it was coming from.  This year there were people who helped me, I was in a very bad situation and they literally saved my life. And thanks to them I was able to help many people in need, especially many children, to see the smiles on the faces of people who have been having a hard time, to see the hope coming back in their eyes has been the best thing that has happened to me this year, I honestly did not think I would make it to the end of the year.  My parents don't know, I have to be strong because we have been in a very bad economic situation and I have had to be the man of the house. My younger brother tries very hard, he is working very hard on a sports project, where he has to be concentrated and training seven days a week, and he has me as his anchor, so I always have to be strong for him.  I've been holding on, looking for ways to escape from this, there were moments where I was able to escape although I really don't know how long I managed to avoid it, there are songs that calm me down and make me stop thinking for a while, they make me feel like I'm getting out of my head and going to other places, The song "Don't you worry child" has been one of those, the chorus that says "Don't you worry, don't you worry child see heavens got a plan for you" has been like a kind of anchor, but every day I feel it working less, the unexplainable pain is coming back out of nowhere.  I don't know what to do, I'd like to have someone to go to, I'm alone and I have no one to seek refuge in. I had been able to keep it away, but it has caught up with me again, this feeling of   I'm afraid of falling back into the hole and spending every night crying and with that feeling that's like being stabbed in the chest or could get worse, I'm lost.  I just want to have a normal life, I don't want this feeling, I don't want this pain, I don't want to be lost anymore, I need to scape from this.

Hey, i get it. It's really hard to feel depressed, but when you don't have someone to go to when you feel down, it's worst. I'm in that place too and I try to handle it the very best i can, so i don't really have an advice for you, and i know it's against the rules, but if want to talk, im here.
You have taken the first step to talk to someone by putting your thoughts out there for strangers to see.  This sounds like you are ready for help, and can take the next step by reaching out directly for some professional support.  Please find the courage contact help, or at least talk to your parents or a friend who will assist you in finding some help.  There is no reason for you to live like this every day.  They can help you.  Let them help you.
You sound like a wonderful soul who keeps others in mind even when he himself is hurting. This is a vulnerable time for you. You need to be careful about who you let into your life and, at the same time, you probably could benefit from a wise and supportive support group or person. Do you have an extended family member who is well-balanced, trustworthy, and caring? Do you take time to do things you enjoy, maybe bicycling?
Thanks for support, I just don't feel like I have the strength to go out and get a haircut or take a shower, I don't get it, because in my mind it's like there's no reason to be down, but in my emotions is like I just don't have the strength, I just don't understand why I'm crying and start to feeling this kind of pain that I don't get to understand, and this makes me feel angry, so I just try to hide I don't want my parents and my brother to see me crying, I try to hide from my friends because I don't feel strength enough to don't start as soon as start to talk of something.
Maybe you should get a doctor’s visit and ask about anti-depressant medication from which your doctor could have you gradually taper off after you get past this time in your life.

Help, I'm at my boyfriend's place and I can't stop crying, I misinterpreted a situation and it set me off, I don't know how to go back in and get into the conversation since I've been upstairs for so long and I pissed him off too by being so mopey. I don't know what to do. What do I do?

Just go and play it off. Being positive and present. People will think its weird but appreciate that you're trying.
Try to think about something else. Positive things. I’ve been so emotional recently too. When you think you’re ready to get out of the room, just go downstairs and try to blend in whatever they’re doing.

I’ve recently been pushed very hard by my therapist to persue medication, and I was wondering what options you guys used and what worked best.  I am concerned about the side effects and also general impact it has on your wellbeing. I’m mostly scared of having a negative reaction which can be quite devastating emotionally apparently.   Also if it matters I live in Australia

My only experiences with them were positives that turned to negatives. They did help me, but the last one I was taking sent me into a dissociative state that lasted for over a year. And I have long term mental issues from that, on top of my major depression, ADHD, Anxiety, and severe suicidal ideations. I've been like this since I was nine (21 now.) But, medication effects each person differently. You may not experience any side effects and recover somewhat. Anyways, I hope everything works out for you lad.
I’m on cymbalta now but I tried celexa and Wellbutrin before.  The Wellbutrin didn’t work for me and while the celexa worked, I gained a lot of weight.  60 pounds, from an overactive appetite.  Just make sure to stay active if you get put on something that increases appetite.
thanks, it’s interesting u went from positives to negatives, usually I hear it’s the other way round
To be fair, I'm on the extreme side of suicidal ideations, depression and anxiety and always have been. So medicines never really work for me, but talk therapy usually does.

Congratulations! That's amazing! The first days are the hardest and you're doing great!  I'm at year 11 now and I promise you it gets a bit easier every day. Just always remember how long it would take you to break your record if you gave in. Do you want some skills to help you in times where staying clean is hard?
Heck yeah! I'm proud of you!!
You don't know me, and I don't know you, but the amount of proud I possess for you is immense. Congratulations, the journey will be hard but very worth it. Happy holidays 😁
Congratulations, I'm rooting for you!
That's huge and it'll keep getting better!!
I try and write music or listen to music when I’m feeling shitty
That's amazing. It helped me too! Do you write lyrics or the music notes?  I'm in skillstraining now for my mental health and they gave me some skills that I found reqlly helpful when the urge came back. I can share them if you want. Maybe they help you to build your own set of helpful skills.
So yeah a few more skills would help
Lyrics I’m trying to finish a few more lines before I start a beat
I hope you share them one day
Thanks I don’t really get support for music often it means a lot
I love music and I love lyrics. I find both very helpful. I would love to know more about yours
Here’s my favourite so far   I don’t talk about death because I’ll end up  another statistic of the mentally ill and sadistic
That's sad and beautiful

We had our family here and he just stayed in his room and ignored anything. He is 26 and since graduating high school just sits in his room playing videogames. Sleeps all day up all night. He only comes out when no one is around. Leaves the house at best 1-2 times a year. Mostly to buy weed im sure as he is always high. My mom will leave him leftovers in the fridge he eats at 3am.   Fine as long as he is happy but I peeked in his room when he was on the toilet and there was a pile of trash 3-4 feet high. Paper plates all with rotting food, tissues, garbage. All over his soiled sheets, rotting peas and crust spilling off of plates onto his bed. Window open in the winter with a fan blowing the putrid stench outwards. The pile of trash he sits next to gaming literally he same height as him, thats how bad it is.   What can I do? Im gonna try to tell him to clean it but its clearly a symptom of deep issues.

It hard to look someone live like this, I think the best thing you can do, is to make some small activity with him, like restroom or hiking. I don't thing that will be good to tell him to clean his mess, but you can help him to do it, your brother is in a bad mood,  he need help.
Yes, encourage seeking help but don't force it. He may be doing the best he can and you might not ever be able to understand. You could always offer to help him with small things or just invite him out of the bedroom to join you in a movie marathon. Or try playing the same games. At least in my experience telling someone who is struggling to do something can make them more resistant. Sometimes just offering options or asking if there are options can be helpful but professional help should be the end goal. Good luck.
Your brother sounds pretty much like me, aside from the drugs. Be very careful about invading his space in the future, if he finds out he will likely not be pleased. Speaking for both him and I...we don't enjoy living like this at all, but we barely have any energy or enthusiasm to function in day to day life, so we neglect ourselves and our living space. We know we're fucking disgusting and we're not proud of it, in fact it's extremely shameful for us and he likely doesn't want you or your family to know or comment on it tbh. So it's a difficult situation for sure. I'd first suggest trying to spend more time with him, go for walks, watch a movie or play a game or something. If he does feel like cleaning it'll help to be in a better mood for it. If you're actually close with your brother you could ask him how he's doing and that you love and care about him and would help him clean up if he needed it (he'll probably say no tho, cause he's ashamed). I find that I usually only want to clean when no one is home. So if there's an option of getting other people out of the house for a bit that might encourage him to try to clean up.
Your brother really needs to seek medical professionals,immediately but I wouldn’t recommend the playing part because that’s his preference but the drug part just crosses the line,And it’s sad to see him go out like this.Either Way He lost his edges and scars to the point that he doesn’t know what even is he battling in life,Re teach him no matter what from right and from wrong,Merry Christmas :).
Hey, thanks for the great post.   I do love him, and wish I could express that. Our mother was super emotionally neglectful though growing up (could also be from just being a male) so it is very hard to express feelings in our household. Even basic ones, let alone extreme ones like love. I'm sure everyone feels like this but I feel like I need to say something about how much I love them in case someone dies but I never can.   We bought him a large curbside garbage can, 80L, and he brought it into his room. So hopefully at least some of his trash can go in there (the pile I saw was way bigger). IDK what else to do at this point. I know what game he plays and I could play with him, but idk if it would help as he definitely plays with other people online anyways.   Hopefully you're doing okay with your stuff. I used to be the same way but the frustration just builds until I snap and clean and be productive in spurts. I think the not following through with the emotions is what keeps you in limbo and stagnant. Meditation is hard but really helps

I want to fucking die leave me alone
I've often considered if Depression may be a means of negative selection, where certain genetic traits are weeded out of the gene pool by the gene carriers removing themselves from the gene pool before they can pass on their genes to another generation. So suicide would become some sort of biological imperative.

You know one or more people wronged you and you could weep and cry and tell them about it till you were blue in the face but they'd never admit any responsibility and never apologize.   Most people go sleep at night happy and safe with their loved ones but what do I do when the lights are out and it's time for me to try sleeping? I cry every night. And nobody knows about and nobody cares.   The worst part is that I don't deserve it. I really don't.   Anyone else ever experienced a similar problem and how did you deal with it?

I can't really think of similar situations. I tend to let things go very easily. Sometimes my friends wrong me by like asking for my phone to take a pic and sending a message to someone they shouldn't or betraying our friendship because of a girl or whatnot. However, I don't really hold grudges.  The worst that happened, well that I can remember is when I was an outcast in highschool. I had no one, and I was in the darkest point in my life. I reached out to a classmate, and my dam burst and I let out so much. Anyways, what happened is that I was made into an even deeper target than I already was. Letting it out made my target even bigger. My depression made me into a bigger joke than I already was.  Two things helped me. One was with time. Over time, the teasing gets old. I wasn't really one to react to situations for the most part. Like I mentioned, I tend to let things go easily, but this one did hurt. The second thing was that I made a friend. I found someone who truly cared about me, and I could trust her. So much so that she ended up being my first love.  Anyways, time and finding someone to lean on truly do help. Also, a therapist isn't a bad idea if you have access to one, whether through school, insurance, wealth, friendship, or anything.  One last thing to note is that if no one knows about it, no one can exactly care. Can't expect anything from someone who's left in the dark.  Feel free to DM me. Tbh, I am not the best at responding to messages. I got a lot to work on, but well, I truly do wish you the best
Yea all the time. You live near Jax

Hello :)  I’ve been diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder recently and I’ve just started trying to get help for mental health stuff.   ~The question I have is, does it ever get better?   I’ve felt pretty much how I feel now for as long as I can remember (about 10 years I don’t have an awfully great memory). I only just realized that routinely thinking of suicide is not the norm but I’ve wanted to die for, well as long as I can remember. I am 20 now, I’m exhausted and I’ve tried everything I could possibly think of but I’ve really just been getting worse.  I’m a student and I have a really hard time keeping up with medication and therapy payments, and I’ve just become completely exhausted. I’m just worried that all the work I put towards getting better will amount to nothing (just off of the pattern of all my other solutions).   I don’t want to be happy, I just want to feel okay. Any perspectives would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you :)  (Sorry if this isn’t the right place to ask, if it isn’t which subreddit do I go to?)

I feel you. Been on 6 different antidepressants been going to theripist for about a year I have days it feels like it's getting better and days it's getting worse. I still think about suiside on a regular. It's not an easy fight and it's not like getting over the flu it's a long road atleast your taking the right steps. And don't drive for ok strive to be the best you your happiness is the most important thing somthing I'm still learning I put everyone else before me but self love is the best love you can get stay strong my friend your not alone
Unfortunately there is no cure for Depression, but with the right medication to manage your symptoms and  you can lead a semi-normal life. I've been treated for the last forty years. My Depression is treatment resistant, but when my doctor and I find one that works it can last for a year or more. It does interfere with your plans, like school, but you can find a direction that will still be productive.
Hi there. I'm so sorry that you're going through this. Does it ever get better? Well - that's a tricky question, and I think the answer is probably different for different people.   For me, similar to you, I've had depression for as long as I can remember. I've been diagnosed with PTSD, severe depression, and anxiety. I first started thinking about suicide when I was 8 years old and presently I think about suicide at least 5 times a week. I've seen probably around 30 psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, counselors and I've taken 5 different anti-depressants, and I haven't had much luck with any of it. I'm with you - I don't need to be "happy." I just want to feel alright.   But, I think the reason why if it ever gets better depends on the person is partly because depression isn't one size fits all, and it doesn't have the same causes and effects for everyone. For me, it's CPTSD/PTSD based depression and anxiety. I don't think that I will ever be completely depression- and anxiety-free. I think it's something that I will have to work through the rest of my life. But, I do notice that I have better and worse days. Some things that have worked for me that maybe could give you some ideas about things to try:  Paying attention to triggers to try to notice if there's a pattern, and when noticing a pattern taking steps to avoid or mitigate triggering situations.   Mindfulness meditation and focusing on the present. This helps with rumination and catastrophizing.   Weighted blanket. This helps with insomnia and anxiety.   Comforting music.   Exercise.  Making and keeping a routine.   My cat. This cat has literally saved my life. I'm in grad school and it has been one of the most lonely, soul-crushing, and alienating times of my life. I was severely psychologically struggling before I adopted her. I wasn't just thinking about suicide, I was making detailed plans for it and was on the verge of preparing for it. I was having a hard time sleeping and when I would sleep I would have frequent nightmares where I'd wake up thrashing around or screaming. I was crying all of the time. I was tired and my body hurt all over all of the time. I was spiraling quick. But, I met her at the shelter and she immediately did the cat bonding stuff with me - touching her nose to my nose, licking my hand, head bunting me, wrapping her tail around my leg. I love her so much that she gives me a reason to get out of bed in the morning and do what I need to do in order to give her a home for the rest of her life. And, playing with her and cuddling with her is immensely comforting.    I hope these have given you some ideas for what might work for you. I wish you peace and comfort.
The point of concern and feeling fine for yourself is what is needed the most from you,I really don’t need you much to do so but there’s a simple trick to feeling okay whether it’d be chocolate,to increase that you are confident that you are okay,or excercise more,it really helps! :),Merry Christmas!.
As someone who has been diagnosed with the same thing, it comes and goes. When life is stable and good you feel it fade away but when things change it tends to feel stronger.   I started taking antidepressants at my doctor's recommendation. After being on them for three months, they help me ignore it, but it doesn't disappear. I'm still apathetic and have trouble finding the energy to do things. But, I'm starting therapy again soon because my doctor also wants me to get mental, so perhaps that will help. Albeit, some of that might have to do with me being a chain-smoker. (PS, nicotine is an awful way to self medicate for this disorder.)  Stay strong, keep at it, respect your own efforts at recovery, and be patient with yourself. Recovery is a journey, not a day trip. You can only go so many miles a day.
Thank you so much for sharing your story :)
Thank you for your advice :)

My friend (29m) and I (25f) are both very into different aspects of graphic design. We want to combine our interests and start making greeting cards. Christmas cards, birthday cards etc. We would also like to include some cards that acknowledge depression (and other mental health issues). So here's my question:  What would you like to see (or have seen) on a 'get well soon' type card regarding depression? Or would you prefer not to have received anything at all?  Our group of friends is very open about any type of mental health issues and we keep each other updated on the status of its progression and we send each other cards when felt appropriate but there's not really a card out there that says 'good luck with your depression' in a funny/sensitive way.

Hi, I'm Jebus (nickname of course). So this is my first post on reddit and I figured I might as well make make it an important one as I want to express myself somehow. I want to be clear as well I will not accept any judgments or insults so if you wish to hurt my feelings, don't waste your time because I have none. Anyway, I've been on this earth for 19 years and it's been a wild ride. But most of it has been 1 traumatic experience after another and it's all caught up to me. I've never felt so alone as I do these days, even when I have a supportive family, the best partner I could ask for and supportive friends too, I still feel alone. All the things that have happened to me I wonder why they happened, but I'm left here just feeling like I wish each of them had killed me. I've been through many things like abuse, assault, robbery, suicidal thoughts, self harm and separation to name a few. Through most of my life I was bullied by most people, couple that with a fatherless home and an abusive stepfather I have some serious abandonment issues. I've never felt like I belonged and I'm always scared that everyone in my life is going to leave as well. Constant fear of being left alone but also being surrounded. The trauma from my assault and my robbery both make me really insecure when it comes to social interaction and it confuses me because it's like there's a constant duality of wanting to be alone but wanting to have company. I'm always confused, I'm always lonely and I'm always thinking about ending my life or hurting myself. The worst part of it is I don't know if it's all from the experiences I've had or if I have some form of depression because I've never been diagnosed I don't know the answer. I've been on this journey for a long time and nothing has come of it. Am I wasting my time? Am I just diluting myself? Am I just seeking attention? I don't know. I need help. Anyone who reads this, what would you recommend?   Thank you if you read this, it means a lot to me.

I don't think many here are actual professionals, but there is a lot of support in the community here.  Regarding your question if you need help - everyone could use some help from time to time.  Whether it's simply a heart to heart with a friend or family member, getting feedback from the internet folk who may be in a similar place, or a professional who knows how to address your issues... everyone could benefit from help.  A professional can gauge how much help you need.    You are young and have what is going to be a long, fulfilling life ahead of you.  You do not need to feel this way.  I understand your struggling right now.  I don't think this sounds like you needing attention. You desire mental well-being.  It doesn't matter right now the cause of it, whether it's depression or PTSD from your history.  Maybe both.  But seek help so you can start the road to recovery.  Ask your parents to help you with this, and if that's not an option, google "therapy" in your area and make a couple phone calls.  They will be very kind on the phone and will want to help you get started.  Good luck friend.

I [21F] have suffered with depression on and off since I was 13 - when I was a teenager battling through it, I would lash out at my mum and get super angry and snappy. When my depression left around 19, the anger subsided and we all thought I was just an angry teenager.  But now I’m 21, my depression is creeping back in & now I find myself lashing out at my boyfriend. I need to put a stop to this NOW, or I’ll have to break up with him (so to not hurt him emotionally). I find myself telling him to go away and leave me alone when he’s only trying to help - I’m just such an angry person ALL the time?  If anyone has found a way to tame or help your depression temper, please please help. Thanks, and merry christmas! :)

Hey all, I've been affected by depression for years, but lately, it's just gotten so much worse. I'm off track with my meds as I see no reason to take them I don't notice any real difference (they've been increased lately), but today while at work I just cracked. I was writing my feeling in a notebook, as I've found that helps when I'm down in one of my emptional pits, and after I was finished I realized I had basically written a suicide note. The thoughts have been increasing lately, probably due to stress, and I know I need help; I'm just not sure what to do. Sorry if this is rambly, or a mess I just need some advice. Thank you.

Let me address the meds. If they have no effect you have every right to say to your doctor you want to try something else. You are a participant in your treatment and your doctor will respect your decision. Managing your symptoms is a priority. If you are like me, your Depression may be "treatment resistant." I have tried everything and even when one does help the effects may not last to long. A self hospitalization is a good decision. You are in control of how long you stay as opposed to ending up there by way of the emergency room. In the latter you are required to stay 72 hours and then s doctor decides if you have to stay longer. Depression is an illness, so treat it as such and manage the symptoms.

So I've been feeling negative for about 3 years now. 3 years ago I started high school so maybe that has something to do with it. But I don't like my favourite food anymore, i hate being outside because of what people might think of me (mainly cause im 5'8 and indian so thats pretty much the worst of it). It's really gross but I stopped having showers everyday because I cant be bothered. Every time my mum calls me to do something I get really moody and when I'm finished I just go to my room and cry. My curtains and windows stay closed everyday and I have no intention of opening it. At night, I never sleep so I end up sleeping in the middle of the day. I don't have a girlfriend and I'm 16 so that's pretty shameful. I used to play so many video games. Make fun of me if you want but I used to enjoy playing fortnite alot. There's this creeping fear that I'll never grow physically or mentally. I'm scared that I'll never get married or have kids. I don't know whether I'm over thinking things or maybe I have anxiety. I don't plat games that much on my phone anymore. I used to love anime so much and I used to enjoy the storyline and events. Now when I watch anime I just think of how badly I want to be the main character or have their abilities. Because its better than being me. A 5'8 ugly kid who's scared of everything. Sometimes I just lay down for hours thinking about how my life would be if I was the main character. No family, no school, no future problems. Just me, my imaginary girlfriend, my imaginary friends, and me being the hero of that imaginary world. The worst part is I have real life friends. Although I feel like they're friends with me out of pity. So yeah that's all I can think of. You don't have to respond to this because I just needed to tell someone about all this. What's better than family and friends who will make fun of you for feeling this way? Random people on the internet.

Should I try these meds or visit another doctor ? Even if it not Bipolar Disorder did mood stabilizer's helped anyone with their depression ? I am 23, Male

So for the past 3 years I've been having patterns of consistent ups and downs. At a point I wanted to get a test to see if I had bipolar because everything was getting too intense for me. I did not get a test because doctors said I didn't apply to the necessary things for bipolar to have and I believe them. I do not have mania episodes. I do not act impulsively or do risky behaviour in a state of mania, I do experience the depression part of it though. Every few weeks or days or hours I get a huge dip in mood and I can go from completely fine and relaxed to the world is ending and it's all my fault.  Recently the dips have been happening daily and it's emotionally exhausting and I know alot about mental health and stuff like that and I can't see anything that makes sense for me. I can go from completely fine and stable to extremely depressed and unstable. People have told me it's related to my period and I will admit that a good amount is, but I will be so far from my period and it still happens, it just gets more intense around that time of the month.  I recently experienced a trigger from out of nowhere where I was arguing about something and a close person to me texted the word "fight" I had an immediate fight/flight/freeze response and it was immediate tears and intense panic and I was in a public space so I choked it down well enough to be able to go without making a big deal out of it. I have abandonment issues as well as attachment issues (being clingy/very codependent on someone) and it's becoming so upsetting to me because I keep ruining relationships. I did not have anything traumatic happen to me that I know of in my early childhood and I had a relatively good childhood but as puberty came I became emotionally parentified. I take medication for severe social anxiety and depression which greatly affects my mood. I have seen many therapists (CBT method) and nothing ever worked. I have difficulty coping and it's just getting worse and worse as the years go on and when it comes to suicidal behaviour I more so imagine being non existent. I will not commit suicide even if I feel this way.   I want to know if I should look for something specific like a mood disorder or if there's a type of therapy offered to adolescences that I can look out for. This is affecting my everyday life constantly. If anyone knows anything that sounds like what I've been experiencing I would appreciate being educated. Thank you for reading.

You might have bipolar type 2. My doctor thinks I may have this. There is no true mania in bipolar 2- just mild highs or even agitation. People with bipolar 2 get severe depression.   Whatever it is, sending you strength and answers to your questions.
I have the same problems. Just commenting to save it!
So based on the limited info here, it doesn’t sound like bipolar. It sounds like depression, possibly generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline PD. three things that commonly go together. Again, no way to make a diagnosis without meeting you and talking to you for a while. This is def not definite. But it might help you to look into those conditions. The fluctuating mood isn’t abnormal for borderline PD
Thank you! I'll look into it :)
I've been looking into bpd and I don't think I have it but I've just started to do research so I'll keep going. Thank you for responding I really appreciate it :)

Just remember that what you feel is a symptom of Depression. It's what you are feeling, not how you really feel.  This is an illness, and you can keep the symptoms in check with the right self-care.  I've been on medication for forty years and have managed to have as productive a life as possible. You can live with this.
Actually, I fear psychical pain. I think about being sick, getting injured etc. What can we do when we face these kinds of things. We can only suffer I guess. I agree with you everything you said btw.

Is it just me but I feel a wave of sadness several times throughout the day for no reason? Like I'm just sitting there and suddenly my brain wants to feel hella sad. Like idk, am I just bored or something that I suddenly become like this. I guess these are intrusive thoughts. How can I get rid of this because it is constantly ruining my day.

REQUESTING ADVICE
yes. i have mood swings. mine mostly come at night. mostly. i'll be having a fine day and working on something happily feeling optimistic, then suddenly get depressed and delete it then unfriend everyone on social media  its getting predictable at this point. if any small disappointing things happens, that can trigger it, or it just happens as soon as i get worn out or tired. i start thinking everything is pointless, i suck, i never do anything right, i hate everyone and everyone hates me etc etc. but when i'm outside around others i pretend to be normal so well that nobody knows i'm like this
That sounds like what I'm going through as well.

Been having issues for 3 years now. Currently in my first year of university.   When COVID started things got worse, I didn't follow any classes anymore. Fast forward I got a 33% on my maths. Thankfully they let me go on to university because of COVID.  Now I'm 6 months further. I need to study for 42 days straight. Everyone does it so effortless but I'm really struggling. I started off reasonably. Today I had a good study day but again I find myself in dark thoughts, staying up until the morning until my heart hurts from sleeping too little.   I can't do 36 more days. I really can't but it's the only option I have. I hope to get through everything but math. (really won't be able to do that). I'll have to study over the summer and I won't do that either. I'm just really worthless.

Don't know what you are suffering, but I can be empathetic with you. Not all people understand depression or even feelings of sadness, but it seems that your dad loves you a lot.   Take it from me that every person is suffering from one thing or another, but still many people are fighting against the negativity and trying to lead an happy life. Easier said than done. I myself am feeling miserable enough to not live, but I have promised that I am not going to end my life no matter what when I was a child. So I have come a long way from that point, but still I am not happy as I wish to be. Life has been very unfair to me. I'm drowning in despair and struggling to keep myself alive,  and I know how hard it is.  I really don't know how to convince you, but you are lucky to have a good dad who cares for you unlike my dad who abandoned me. How I wish I had someone close who cared about me... because I am a very caring person, but people have HURTED me like anything. They still do and make things worse for me (eg. Making fun of me and acting shocked and talking BAD sarcastically when I cook because according to those SC-MBAGS I am not supposed to know how to cook well... telling I am mental or half mad only because I am not confident much..) etc..  Please live for your father.... He seems to be so concerned about you... Please don't hurt him by harming yourself. I have seen the pain in people's eyes when their close ones have left them by suicide. They suffer from the effects their whole lives. Please don't put your father through this. He doesn't deserve pain. Even you don't deserve pain.   If you are happy, your father is going to be happy. Try to make your Life worth living. If my dad was even half caring like your dad, I would have been the happiest person alive... Please don't take for granted what you have. God bless you all.
You need to listen to your dad. He's just trying to help you and prevent you from doing anything stupid.

WTF? That last bit is terrible advice considering OP is asking how to get their parent to let them end their life. Think before you type.  &#x200B;  ETA: OP, I really hope you're able to call or text a crisis line. Keeping you in my prayers.

I’m not gonna hijack OP’s post by arguing with you. Clearly you thinking making your kid eat lunch, go for a bike ride and take a nap are harsh punishments. We have very different definitions of punishment. Good day.

A friend of mine is planning to kill himself. He has a therapist, has been to a psychiatrist, has been to the emergency room twice and has crippling debt as a result. Nothing seems to help. He thinks antidepressants are brainwashing and I have no idea how to convince him otherwise. I’ve been trying so hard to convince him but I don’t know what to do anymore. Any advice?

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kk9zb0/guilt_from_getting_nice_gifts/
I try to be grateful for all that I have, and I don't ask for much in return. I don't have any money to my name, and I'm doing my best in studies and whatnot.  I told my parents before that I just needed a cheap car to get me to and from school, but instead, I got an amazing subaru forester that they financed for 15 grand. I felt like utter shit and undeserving of it for days.  I told my sister that I just needed like decent cheap earbuds for Christmas around the $10-$15 range, but I instead got $70 earbuds that are amazing.  On another occasion, I just wanted an ok mic for discord or skype calls. At most like $30 or so, but my dad got me one that cost like $300.  The thing in common with all of these gifts are that I truly feel undeserving of them. A lot of things I use, I use just normally or casually. I don't feel the need to get the best of anything. I like to use cheap reliable stuff. Over time, I learn to love and appreciate these gifts, but I almost always become sad and I feel undeserving of these items as well for a short time period after receiving them. I can't even give anything in return.  My family is always on the verge of financial destruction, and I don't want to add to that strain to the best of my ability. I rarely ask for food I like or to go on trips that cost much money. I'm ok with going to the park or a friends house or staying at home.  Several other factors at play here such as the fact that I hate myself, but I've been in therapy for a while making strides. I would just like some advice as this Christmas made me quite sad with these nice gifts, and I'm putting a facade of love and appreciation.  Any help is appreciated :)   EDIT: Wording way off, its just sadness i feel for the most part regarding gifts

This has been the year from hell. I really wanted it to be a good Christmas. I feel really out of it right now, so this may be sloppy compared to my usual writing.   I’ve had depression and anxiety for years. This year has been the worst. I went through losing family members, a horrible breakup with the person I thought I was going to marry, losing my 4.0 as a senior in college, many health issues, nearly losing my dog, and I’m running out of money to support myself.   I have been doing everything I can to get help. I have a therapist, I’m on a cocktail of medications, I have a therapy dog, I participate in yoga, yet I’m still so incredibly unhappy. I suffer from fear of abandonment and I constantly feel so alone. I’ve gone on a few dates with no luck as I’m looking for more than just a hook up.   I was finally starting to do a bit better when I decided to go home for Christmas.   My parents were always neglectful and emotionally abusive to me growing up. Because of this I have severe anxiety and I am a people pleaser. Although my parents, especially my mom, have caused me so much pain, I wanted to go home for Christmas. I used my credit card to buy everyone meaningful gifts and drove 4 hours home to see my family. It didn’t take long for things to go south.   The harsh criticism and unkind words began early on. My parents promised me that if I came home from the holidays my extended family members - drug addicts that caused me severe trauma - would not be there. And guess who showed up. I got so upset that I had a panic attack and had to leave to come home. I spent Christmas alone.   I upset my parents by leaving and feel like I ruined Christmas. I cried the entire 4 hours home. I feel so worthless and alone and I have no idea where to go from here. The last time I felt this low I went to my doctor and ended up seeing a crisis counselor, but I don’t know if it’ll do any good and I don’t want to end up institutionalized. I can’t get out of bed. I can’t eat. I feel sick. I am lost and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t have a family to go to, or a boyfriend, or even a close friend. I am graduating college soon, and I feel like I have missed out on so much. I crave human connection.   I don’t even know what to write for a TL:DR and I feel like this has just turned into me complaining.   I just want to feel better and be happy.

I totally feel you on longing human connection and having difficulty starting over . I can relate to this because I’ve been going through it for a long time as well. I’m no one to give advice but the only thing that keeps my mind from spiraling is my brother and the walks I take daily and some exercise . Sometimes I feel like there’s no way out . I sometimes think it’s my mind playing tricks on me but I can’t tell because my reality /life isn’t too great overall . I have a happy family but that still doesn’t stop my mind from spiraling . Have you ever tried going for walks or exercise ?
I take my dog on daily walks and I work at a gym. I attend normal yoga classes which I have to force myself to go to. I love hiking, but it’s kind of scary going alone as I am a relatively small female and my dog is way too friendly for his own good.
What would you say triggers most of your depression ? Are you happy at work? I also walk my dogs and I think it helps
I think I’m just really lonely.

Having anger issues for quite long, also feeling like there is no one to trust, and getting de motivated about ownself. Even when there are instances of happiness, I feel like I don't deserve anything good, and no one deserves me.

I spent the past week in bed, barely eating or drinking, not taking my meds, just watching mindless shows. Finally, my friend asked me to make a cheesecake to bring to the Christmas gathering, and it forced me out of bed and get to the store. I'm finally getting around to cleaning my room, took my meds, took a shower.   Sometimes the need to feel helpful really gets the motivation going. I know people avoid asking people who are depressed for a favor, but sometimes it really does get them out of their funk.  I just felt better today than I have in months. I just wanted to share that.

I know the normal thing a person would do is to just go to the doctor and see if they do but the thought of it makes me anxious, I am a teenager and I know there are some teenagers out there who are pretending to have depression because it’s “what everyone has these days”. I’m nervous about going to the doctor and bringing it up to them, and just have them downplay it because I’m a teenager or something like that.  Or what if I don’t have depression and I just am sad a lot of the time for no reason? Then I would be wasting money for my family, so I’m just in need of some advice. I’m confused.

I’m also in your shoes, I am confident that I might have depression, but during COVID it’s been hard to hide the fact that I go to therapy. I just turned 18 a month ago so it’s difficult starting this process, but from what I heard it’s never a bad time. When you’re ready you go and fix yourself (however that may be)   Tip: Get a friend who you trust and involve them in your situation, having someone your age or close is great and can make the process of finding mental health provider easier   Best of luck to you!  Edit: Grammar

Unfortunately, there's no cure yet for Major Depression, but with the proper medication you can manage your symptoms. Once you manage that you can lead a semi-normal life. I've done it for forty years since I was first diagnosed. Remember that what you are feeling are the symptoms of this illness. They don't reflect how you feel, but what you feel. Give it some thought and it will make sense. Good luck....

I’m not sure what to even write. Not sure weather it’s a rant or a story. But I feel lost.   Long story short, this time of year has always been hard. Everything goes wrong this time of year in my life and seasonal depression has grown worse and worse. I’m conditioned to believe something will go wrong. I’ve lost pets, family members and this time of year takes such a mental toll on me.   Started with never having anything for Christmas. Family was poor. Grandfather who always got me and my sister something nice passed. Right after Christmas. Then child services involved themselves and took me and my sister away. Separated us from our family and each other. On Christmas Eve. Got nothing for Christmas, parents didn’t tell the rest of our grandparents what happened to us. Finally my grandmother and uncle take me in. Uncle passed away right after Christmas. Had a decent couple years, then we loose our dog right after Christmas. then my other grandmother passed away right before Christmas the next year. Found a GF, she left me on Christmas Eve. The year after that I found a GF, now a sr in high school. Things go so well I move in to support her and her mom who got breast cancer during the Christmas time. I got her a puppy one Christmas. Three years later that puppy took a bad fall and had to be put down for Christmas. we decide to get our own place. Then Covid hits. I’m laid off around Christmas. Sucks ass. Go back to work. Hard to financially recover from that. Working hard right after getting our own place.   This year, I get Covid. Recover only to be laid off again beginning of December. No stimulus to be seen. Bank already in shit from last year. This year I have no clue how I’m going to make it. Money issues making it hard. We are arguing a lot. It’s hard for me to even get out of bed. I forced myself to get out of bed today for her, because it’s Christmas Eve and her mon wanted us over for dinner. She gets all this nice stuff. Her mom even got me something small. It’s the thought that counts. But it all reminds me of how I grew up with nothing, and how it seems like I’m headed back to nothing. I try to be happy for her. I try. Nothing motivates me anymore. I just want to lay in bed and never wake up. I find myself flipping out, not at her, but she sees me in such pain, instead of supporting me, she blames herself. That comes from her abusive father who made everything out to be her fault. I tell her it’s not her fault. She cries. Now all I’m good at is making my woman cry on Christmas Eve. It’s Christmas now and it’s thunder-storming. We lost power. I’m now in the bathroom holding back tears. Because men don’t cry. Another lie drilled into me from when I was young.   In the past year I’ve fallen to smoking cigarettes, alcohol, and suicidal thoughts. I don’t. Want to die, I just want to not exist. I joke about it but idk anymore.   I didn’t expect to be laid off for Christmas, there’s hardly any money left. I need a stimulus to save me. No one is hiring. I’ve looked and looked. Unemployment doesn’t cut it between the two of us. I still haven’t recovered from moving in. I’ve watched my bank account crumble, I’ve watched my mentality crumble. I’m waiting for the next bad thing to happen to me this year. Who is going to die, what’s going to go wrong. Seasonal depression has me conditioned to expect the worst.   Sorry for the long story. Merry Christmas everyone. I just not sure if I’m alone or not.

I’ve been neglected, beat/hit, yelled at, all throughout my childhood. I feel distant from my family because of that. I keep to myself and don’t open up to my parents because of how i was treated when i was young.  Im currently 19 years old and am far more mature than anyone my age. I have a loving 21 year old girlfriend of 2 years who hasn’t met my family yet but, shes my world. I want to spend the rest of my life with her and she feels the same. I’ve been focusing on myself, working throughout COVID-19 while my 2 other siblings are at home doing nothing.   I always give money or food to the homeless when I see them, I always donate to whatever fundraiser they have when I checkout at the cashier, I bring home ice cream for my family after work (once a week), I love helping out people during my shifts and I am generally a kind-hearted human.   i workout everyday, I paid off all my student loans, phone bill for one year, sometimes pick up groceries for my family after my shift (i work at Walmart), have 4k invested into assets and i’m constantly using my time into learning about real estate and having financial freedom  My problem is that i’m way more mature than everyone else who is 19 years old. My parents compare me to how my sibling was when they were 19 and ask me why i don’t go to parties, drink or hang out with friends. I don’t do this because i’m using my time to learn in order to benefit my future.  I myself am 19 and the happiest i’ve ever been, thanks to my caring girlfriend. I don’t know what i would be doing without her.  Im glad you’re reading my story and i’m open to any support you can give me. How do i get through my current life while being more mature than normal 19 year olds?

You say you’re the happiest you’ve ever been... it sounds to me like you already know how to get through your life.
Congrats dude, it amazing that you’re paying off your debt, I’m 18 and have a similar experience (to a varying degree ofc); I would say find people who love you for the reasons you love. For example, I was also mature and my family never recognized that I was emotionally analytical and through their attitude they insinuate the opposite (that I’m incapable of processing emotions), hopefully in the future someone will come to love the version of myself that I love.   What I’m trying to say is how do you know when people recognize your strengths and don’t make you feel bad for having them?   Keep going man, make sure you check in with your girlfriend; SO’s aren’t always expected to be emotional rocks 110%

This is the worst Christmas ever, I wish I coul have just spend it alone, that way they would at least faked that they cared,l. But in here I'm not allowed to think, feel or do anything. Everything I do is wrong, everything I say is wrong, even everything I feel is wrong, but they are never in the wrong only me, I'm he only one who doesn't deserve privacy, I'm the one who has to be humiliated for everything, the stupid rules only apply to me. I hate this place, I feel like all my efforts to to waiste, and makes me feel like getting better is more pointless with every day that passes. I'm just so tired.

I'm 22, Female. I was diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety and PTSD around 2 years ago, and have been working with my psychiatrists and therapists ever since to get better.  I know that recovery isn't linear, and there are always bumps in the road, but I've been in a depressive episode for 3 weeks now, and I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever be happy again.  I'm listening to my doctor's advice about medication and doing what my therapist tells me and reaching out to family for support but things just aren't getting better. I feel like my brain has been sucked dry of any happiness or motivation, and everything is so overwhelming I can't leave my bed.  I'm trying to keep my spirits up by finding fun stuff to do, but I'm not at my creative best when it comes to thinking of things.  Any suggestions on low effort activities I can do to get my mood up?  Any reply is helpful, frankly, I'm just tired of feeling so alone.

Have you tried looking into craft kits. Watch reviews first of course as there are some truly awful ones but they should give you most everything you need to complete them and come with idea books so you don’t necessarily need to be at your creative best. I’m a big sewer and I have a couple kits that I use when I need something small to do.
keep your hands busy. clean your room or do something creative. a distraction, though small can help

If things are getting too overwhelming/stressful I think taking a break from school might be a good idea for you. Or maybe there's some other commitments you can dial back to give yourself some breathing room.  But yeah, taking a break isn't the end of the world - you can always come back to it
Hey there. Studying medicine can take its toll on you, I've seen how intense it can be on people who study it.      If you have course/programme advisors at your university/college, I would reach out to them. Their job is to help you with your coursework, and many of them might also be able to advise you on how to balance work and the rest of your life. They should also be able to suggest how to structure your studies if you do decide to take a semester off to focus on your mental health.      I knew someone who took a year off to recover from their mental health problems and they came back to study more revitalised and finished their degree. Sometimes it is necessary to take a step back from work to focus on your mental health, get professional help and develop the necessary skills so that you can better handle your studies.

hey! we don’t know each other, but i am so sure that things will change someday! it is okay to doubt that (i know i do) but it’s true! maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next year, but someday you will look back at this time and feel sorry for yourself, you realize how much you have grown as a person and even tho this was the hardest thing you ever had to do, it was all worth it.   we don’t know each other, but i care about you. maybe not in the way a parent cares for their children, maybe not in a way a best friend cares for the other person, but i do care... in some abstract way! if you like, you can talk to me, tell me what’s bothering you, tell me about your favorite color, wether or not you have any pets, a fond memory or a really dark one. tell me about the things you liked when you were a kid.  i will listen.   we don’t know each other, but we could get to know each other.  i hope i am not too late.

Hello I live at Hong Kong. I always felt stress at school or at home. I am kinda big in video games but my parents never agreed. They believe that school is the only way to success. If I said anything I researched. They would say I am crazy ( not really they but mainly my mom)  I also wanted to improve myself. I have friends at school but I just don't feel happy. I would cry everyday and I never felt joy outside of the internet. I think I might be addicted but I am not really at the same time.   At school I never felt joy. And I am the top 5 student of my class. But I never felt any improvement. I am always doing the same thing wrong and tutor never helped me.  I hope one day I can be happy again. I also wanted to talk to teachers or parent but I never get the chance. I know I never work as hard as the best student. But I just never felt joy in school.   These days I felt worst always having headaches and I am always dizzy. I wanted to seek for help and wanted to be happy. I also have been thinking of suicide but I am too scared to do anything.  I hope this post will make me feel better thank you for reading.

Accepting your feelings can be hard but it's something you need to do. Reminding yourself that you are sad right now is ok. You don't need to listen to your parents. If they don't understand that you are depressed then try to ask them for therapy, it does help. If you want to play videogames together just dm me I am 14. Although I live in Greece so it might lag
You got this kid, I be gettin how you feel, Your young so you got years to be able to improve. Here's what i think about when i be gettin those suicidal thoughts.. i think bout the fact we are on a rock, in the middle of space, which is pretty crazy itself, but also the fact, our chances of existing is like 0,  and your father’s sperm having all the right DNA to make you you - and not a slightly different person, like your sibling - being 1 in 400,000,000,000,000,000. - which basically makes you a miracle. think of that when you feel even a bit down. your life is scientifically a miracle, which is amazing.
I feel you. I hope you will feel more happy. If you would want I can recommend you some happy songs (because that makes me happy when I am sad).  (btw sorry for my english)  edit: "I hope you will feel more happy" means that I hope you won´t be sad. I wrote this edit because "I hope you will feel more happy" sounds bad and I am really sorry for my english :D
Thank you I feel better

This has been a horrible year for me, I know it has everyone else too. I’ve had medical blow and financial emergency after emergency and layoffs and it has left me broke. No gas or food money. I’ve spent all my money and all my Christmas savings. I know I’m no one special but I’m asking if anyone could help me I’d greatly appreciate it. I luckily landed a job and start after the first of the year but I mainly just need gas and food money until I get a paycheck. I have paypal and Venmo if anyone wants to help. Even if you don’t I appreciate your prayers. I hate to ask like this but this is my last resort. I don’t have any family that I could borrow off of and my credit is horrible. Again, sorry if I’m being a nuisance. Merry Christmas and God Bless. Thank you. I know I’m not the only one who has had a less than great year this year, but just figured I’d ask.

I’m new to this subreddit, I just wanted to say hi. I don’t expect a lot of responses because this is probably gonna be a long one, but thanks anyway :)  My parents helped me out with my mental health for a couple of months, they took me to get SSRIs, they scolded me but then helped me out when they found out I was self harming. My mom really cared about my mental health and clearly wanted me to get better, but since september my parents have completely stopped helping me with my mental health. I don’t want to give people the impression that it was a never-ending battle that my parents were helping me fight because it wasn’t, for the most part we would have a small conversation about how I am feeling like once a week at most, and I literally cannot see how they would get burned out from an occasional chit chat on how I’m feeling.   You might be thinking that they would’ve stopped because my outward appearance has gotten better right? Well, it’s actually been quite the opposite. Since my parents have stopped talking to me, I went from a person that typically made a good, happy outward appearance to an emotionless wall that is dissociated from the world 99% of the time and the most you can get out of me is a simple “yes” or “no”.   I really have this concern though, because my parents have always had this way of doing things where they would just be like “everything is fine” and then will proceed to ignore major problems until they finally have to fix that problem. For instance, my dad ended up breaking a glass jar in one of the closets of our house and instead of just cleaning the broken glass up my dad just closed the closet door and never cleaned it up; this happened 3 years ago and to this day there is still glass on the floor in that closet. A toilet may also break and that toilet will be unusable for months and at one point the main toilet in our house was broken and was not fixed for over 2 years. I could make a list of 100s of things that they have done this with but you probably get my point. My fear is that my parents have done the same thing with me, and that they just decided to move on and say “Well he could be worse lol.” I get that it’s not my parent’s job to be on top of my mental health and that it’s my own, but at this point I’m basically sitting with no one to talk to having no place to get help as I watch my mental health go down the drain. I’m worried my parents will find out the wrong way just how severe my mental health has gotten. However it definitely seems that’s the path that everything is headed.

Your Dads behavior suggests depression itself. If he, or they, are battling themselves it’s hard to recognize someone else’s need. Look online, at the library or a book store for books about dealing with depression as a family. There’s a lot of them out there. Try to be specific about your needs. Make a list, if that helps. Good luck! You can always message me!
Let them know this isn't something that can be swept into a closet. That you would still like their love and support as you heal further. The fact they were willing to help in the beginning says they care. They just need a reminder its in ongoing thing.
I'm concerned that your parents behavior is some indication that this runs in the family. It's not so much that they don't care, but that they don't want to face it. Your own condition is pretty much what you can expect with Depression, especially if it's going untreated.  Depression has nothing to do with you personally.  It's an illness and there is no judgement on you or them. A lot don't take it seriously because it's not a visible illness. If you had a heart condition no one would see that as well.  I hope things get better for all of you...
It does sound like avoidance is your parents' go-to solution. My guess is that they do care, but got disheartened when they realized they couldn't easily solve your problems and, lacking the oomph to fight harder, have pulled back. That's really unfortunate, although I think it's important to remember that this is a problem with how they deal with things and probably not a problem with how much they care about you.  One thing to keep in mind is that you say they were only having a discussion with you a week so shouldn't be burned out, but as a parent I would hazard to speculate that they were actually worrying about that conversation for days before and after even if you didn't see evidence of it. The worrying quietly to themselves may be what wore them out to the point they shut down on you and started trying to ignore the issue. Rather than indicating they don't care, burning out could indicate that they really care a lot.  I would suggest calmly asking for something specific from them. Asking for something general like "support me more!" is hard because it's overwhelming and vague. Asking for things like, "Could we have coffee and chat about personal stuff Saturday mornings before we do our weekend errands?" or "Could we do crafts while reviewing our week on Wednesdays after dinner?" are more manageable. (And I do think having an activity other than talking is good. Even if your parents are professional therapists, they're not _your_ therapists. Having something else going on helps lower the pressure of the conversation and adds a extra feeling of normalcy.)  Also, you may have to be clear with your folks that you were benefiting from additional communication and support. They may have gotten the impression they weren't really helping, or even that they were just annoying you.
They're the same as my parents, I had a talk with my father just two days ago suggesting he should go to the doctor and simply he said that he doesn't like to go to the doctor and any one shouldn't go to the doctor when any thing hurts them untill it becomes severe like what the hell how am I even gonna get help if he's not willing to get help on his own. I can relate to you although I'd suggest to continue your meds talk to your therapist and have some quality time with your friends that may help a little wish you the best.
First off, welcome to the subreddit.  I'm rather new myself but I like to try and help others where I can.  Second, it does sound like you're parents have a bit of 'It will work it self out' mindset.  Are they busy people?  While I don't want to defend negligent behavior, it is easy to get wrapped up one's life that you absent mindedly ignore everyone around you.  They're your parents but they're also human, prone to the same flaws and shortcomings we all are.  It does sound like they have your interests at heart, it just seems they prefer to wait to act on things and then fire and forget.  Do you have the ability to try something online / phone therapist?  Since the pandemic, the quality if these online services has really improved.  Talk space and better help are 2 I keep bumping into.
This is a tough situation you’re in with your Dad. I hope you have someone supporting you, while you’re dealing with it.

So, contrary to everything I was expecting, yesterday was okay. Christmas Eve with the family, we even laughed quite a bit. I was expecting to dread it because I don’t have the best relationship with my family, and I’ve gained weight during the pandemic and was afraid they’d bring it up, and also it’s the first christmas since dad passed so... but it was okay. I even had fun.  Then today I woke up and everybody was so happy and I realized... I have nothing. This year has just revealed the absolute emptiness of my life.   I shared a couple of things to groups I’m part of and nobody reacted (but they did to other people). This is totally in line with the rest of the year: my best friend started ghosted me for some reason (right when dad passed, too), people don’t really like talking to me, I feel ignored when I try to start a conversation or even add something to an ongoing conversation (there are MANY times when my input is flatly ignored and I’ve wondered if everybody has me blocked and they just can’t see me).  I just feel so alone. It feels like nobody really cares that I’m around; I think that if I died people wouldn’t even notice for a couple of weeks.   I know I’m not the most pleasant person to have around because I’ve been super depressed but I’ve been hiding it lately in group chats. It’s easy over text because people don’t see my face. I don’t bring that I’m sad, and I try to only say cheerful or neutral things. But it doesn’t work.   I just don’t know what to do anymore. I know people usually feel worse around the holidays so I’m trying to hold on but honestly? I doubt 2021 will be any better. I’m just gonna get more alone, keeping everything bottled up, and... I don’t know. I’m just tired.   I don’t know what to do to get people to like me. I’ve been tried being less intense, talking less often, not bringing up anything sad or upsetting, joining on conversations... I’m running out of ideas.

My heart hurts for you as someone in a similar place right now. I think we've been in the depressive state of mind for so long things start to feel baseline.. I'm sure you know what I mean. Empty, apathetic, detached all the time. And it's frustrating around this time of year when all we want is to feel that happy spark that surrounds us, the spirit of the season. I wish I had advice or something comforting for you to read. But you aren't alone. I'm going to try to lose myself to even a moment of warmth today. Whether that's a warm drink, music, time spent being thankful for being alive instead of indifferent about it. Let's try today 💜

Absolutely. I just can’t wait until the holidays are over.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kjsg57/what_made_me_happy_tonight/
Here is a look into me and my personality haha.  Was feeling not good tonight (Christmas, really), but then instead of just internalizing it I told my boyfriend. He was able to get me to get up and take my meds so I could go to sleep, and then I got distracted by my little baby snake.   My room is poorly insulated so it gets down to like 60°f, and my snake needs a higher temp. Or at least that’s what I was thinking, so I got her a red bulb for the nighttime. She’s out exploring! For the first time in a week! So I’m very glad I did end up buying that bulb.  So she made me happy. I’m also considering buying another snake in the new year, because there’s this one big guy that’s been sitting in the very back, lower corner of this pet store for a while, and I want to give him a better home.   So thinking about snakes tonight made me happy!  In addition to this, I was watching a Sims video and my snake hung down and stared at the screen for a while. She’s done this before when I was watching the same creator. I like to think she enjoys watching her. :-)  But yeah. Hoping I’ll be able to sleep soundly and soon. That is all. I’ll be glad to see you guys on the opposite side of the holidays! If you’re celebrating, happy Christmas. :-) ♥️

[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kjmi65/please_help_my_brother_is_extremely_depressed_and/
My brother is 19. He was given a diagnosis of non-verbal learning disorder and ADD when he was younger. He has always had extreme trouble socializing even from a really young age (last time he had a real friend was like 3rd or 4th grade); however, he has been homeschooled from 12 because of issues with learning in a classroom setting and mean kids. He really loves video games and it’s the thing he talks about most, which my sister (15) and I (20) can’t really have a conversation about Bc we just don’t play them. We have zero interest in games. We can have long conversations about anything else! Really! But with games it’s just... he talks about stuff so specific that we just can’t even relate to it or understand it. He doesn’t have any other friends to play with except 1 guy on discord.   He’s a sophomore compsci major, hasn’t worked Bc of covid so he’s just focused on school.   He’s been really depressed lately and won’t really have a conversation with us. He opened up to us that he been feeling mentally awful. My sister and I are going to try our best to help him and get him into the things he wants to do, have more conversation, get him dressed (get a haircut, buy some outfits, go workout together, so on Bc he expressed unhappiness in his appearance+he loves working out but hasn’t been able to go to a gym Bc of covid again) , etc.   I was extremely depressed from 11-18 to the point I did not leave my room for 5 years (not an exaggeration)+I ended up with anorexia which I am now recovered. I think the thing that confused me most about this is that I took a lot of the initiative myself to get better little by little, but my brother doesn’t take any initiative on his part to change things. It’s really frustrating and I don’t understand.   Is there anything else I can do for him? Is there a way I can find other gamers for him to be friends with? He’s a bit quirky which makes me a little worried. :(   Please help. I don’t want my brother to end up doing something drastic, which I fear is the only path if it continues like this.

The motivation is the difference, everything you said you and your sister are doing or planning to do is a fantastic step in the right direction. Chronic depression however can prevent someone from feeling motivated to do anything about their life, we need constant encouragement and even then we're not going to be happy about it but it's needed.   The loneliness is the most crippling emotion I have personally experienced, it saps your motivation an coupled with depression can send you into a "I'm not good enough for anyone or anything" spiral which is absolutely destructive.   Just follow through with everything your suggesting, take him out of the house but let him have his space as well. It's a delicate balance but if you do this he will come out of it. Good Luck.
I would suggest you try getting him to talk about the games he plays. I know you aren't really interested in the games but since he is and that's what he likes to talk about, that's your gateway to getting him to talk about other things. Guys talk about their feelings more when they can be distracted by other things, imo.
Is there the possibility of working out together, biking, setting up home gym, hiking?
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kjq6ct/lonely_and_depressed/
I’m home for the holidays from school at my family’s new home. There’s some family here but I have no one to talk to. Even when I’m at school I’m super lonely. I literally have just been playing Tetris on my phone this whole week just because I’m not on social media much anymore and I just have no one. I feel a level of sadness I didn’t even know was possible. I’m not even sure what I can say here anymore. Everything I’ve ever done in my short life was wrong. I’ve failed at trying to be a student, trying to be a friend, trying to be a good son, trying to find love. I don’t belong here. I am truly a mistake in this ripple of time. I think about all of the poor people that keep dying everyday and keep thinking that it should’ve been me instead.

**Not looking for medical advice**  Anyone tried Cymbalta for depression/anxiety?? I was on Effexor and came off because we thought about getting pregnant. Since then I’ve been crying, feeling depressed, irritable and lose my temper over nothing. I feel like I need something since I obviously can’t control my moods unmedicated. When I came off Effexor I had about a week of pure hell from withdrawals. I’m nervous to start new meds and would like some input. Pros/cons. Not sure what other option I have seeing as it’s causing relationship problems.. any advise or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

I took Cymbalta years ago. When I lost my health insurance it was gonna cost me over $200 to get it, which I couldn't afford so I took myself off of it. Within like a week I was in the doctor's office curled up in the fetal position. I honestly thought I was dieing..
I took it years ago. I was taking 60 mg. I didn’t care about anything. I stopped paying bills and got a divorce. None of it phased me a bit so I guess it was effective. Worst part was I quit cold turkey and suffered through the “brain snaps”. I can’t recommend it but I know others have had better experiences.
I love my cymbalta!! It has worked wonderfully for me. Although it should be noted that you should (almost) never quit a depression/ anxiety drug cold turkey. Horrible withdrawals for most of them
Effexor is in the same class as Cymbalta. They both increase serotonin and norephrinprine.  How long ago did you withdrawal from Effexor? Withdrawal effects can last months to a year, though they typically dissipate over time.
Oh goodness! So sounds like it’s the same withdrawal effect then.
Can I ask why you quit? My Effexor definitely helped with my mood swings and depression.
I had withdrawal effects for about a week. I was crying and tearful for about a month after. I started 3rd shift and absolutely hate it and feel like I need something to help.
It was pretty terrible..
It was just too mind numbing for me. I think if I’d taken a different route I would have made different decisions, major life changing things. It’s possible my doctor dosed me too high. I just kind of checked out from my adult responsibilities and let everything collapse around me but I was completely cool with it.

My husband has been exhibiting signs of extreme depression for a very long time.  I can't live with it anymore.  And its turning into neglect when it comes to the care of our daughter.   Signs - constant sleeping, no energy or desire to do anything.   Staring at phone for long periods of time...not talking to me at all. Very short temper.  He does not react well when I bring up that I'd like him to at least see a therapist.  Idk what to do, I'm so tired and defeated

My wife has the same situation you do.  Reading your perspective is awakening.
[${URL}] https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/kjmitb/i_lost_what_feels_like_everything_that_truly/
This is going to be long so if you aren’t intending to read it all don’t worry I don’t blame you.  This year I opened a restaurant 5 weeks before the lock down happened in canada, I opened it with two of my friends who have always wanted to do this.   Once starting we ended up running into constant obstacles whether it be with the town for permits, the engineer with issues, or the construction crew for not showing up or finding more problems that caused more fees for extra work. That being said we knew what was possible and we were prepared to adapt and make changes, it took us 10 months but we got open. Once work started for real now my two partners were less than eager to actually pull their weight when it came to work, I was constantly picking up the slack and putting out fires for them. Despite that they resented me for trying to push them to work harder for the betterment of the business, I know not everyone responds to encouragement the same way but I did the best I could and approached the problem from every angle I could, I tried taking responsibility for asking too much of them, I tried asking them to choose the tasks they could complete and setting their own due dates. I tried making lists and just having a communal list that we would mark off as we did things on it, I tried designating jobs with hard deadlines. I tried all the approaches suggested for leading. But nothing worked.  Through this the only reason I managed to stay positive was because my girlfriend was supportive and their for me constantly. She was the light at the end of the tunnel that I needed to succeed for so I could spend the time I wanted to with her and so I could do the things we wanted to do, like travel and even just have consistent dates that don’t get interrupted by my work. She is my everything, she is in part what makes me get out of bed each day.  When quarantine hit we closed for 4 months, we chose not to do take out because no one had the opportunity to realize we had opened. So myself and my partners agreed that each of us would make X amount of dollars each month so we could pay rent and what not, the intent was to monetize the assets the restaurant already had and what our own skills allowed for.   Unfortunately I was the only one to make any money for rent. The other two just said there was no way to make any money, so I came up with and marketed multiple ways for them to do it. But they never took what I did, they just let the interest die and once again did nothing. So I had a meeting with them and asked for them to both be silent partners.  Through this my girlfriend was with me and tried her best to help me when I needed it, she helped me understand things from my partners perspective.   When the full lock down ended I became super busy running a restaurant alone for a while. My girlfriend helped, but at the end of the day the customers weren’t ready to start coming back out. And it made money incredibly tight. My girlfriend hated how much time I spent at the restaurant when “no one was there anyway, why stay open”. She didn’t seem to understand that in order to get busy I had to be available to the public whether I was busy or not. She started to resent me for working as much as I did and we didn’t have nearly as much time together as we used to.  That being said she has her own issues, her mom died when she was 16 and she had been sick for a year or so before that. And while that happened she treated herself as a non priority, she wouldn’t ask for help or talk about her own grief because in her eyes her dad was suffering more than her and in ways she could never understand, and she didn’t want to blame or add anything to his load. So she learned to bury her sadness and depression as deep as she could under alcohol and sarcastic humour, which is much like me.   Things got complicated as I worked more and her issues started to come to the front and I wasn’t always there or available to help, and when I was there she never wanted to talk about or tackle them because “I had way more important things to deal with” as she said it. I did everything I could to explain that just because I have issues with work and money doesn’t mean her problems are any less important. But she didn’t believe me and kept them to herself.  It only started to come out when she would be drunk with me and my friends, she would choose then to pick the fights with me. It hurt a lot when she did but I never once yelled or got angry, I just tried to take the conversation somewhere private. It worked sometimes and not others.   I had a poor relationship with her dad, he really didn’t like me and that was due to a number of things, he didn’t like that I requested he ask me for favours instead of demand I do them and expect me to be ok with it. He was very old school, and I’m not I guess. We got along fine before I was dating his daughter. In fact I would go as far as to say we were friends before. He encouraged me to date her, but when I did I guess he expected me to change the way me and him communicated and treated each other? I’m not sure.  We eventually got to a place where I felt that I couldn’t help her deal with the problems she was facing and that she was using me as a excuse not to work on herself. In my own fucked up head as I’m prone to doing, I convinced myself the best way to help was for her to be rid of me. When I spoke to a close friend about it they agreed and said it’s prolly the best that we break up. I believed him and went ahead and ended things with her, with the hope she would be pushed to focus on herself, because it killed me to see her hurting but afraid to ask for help, it killed me to see her unhappy. I really thought I was doing the right thing.   2 weeks later that “friend” I spoke to about breaking up with her confessed his feelings about her to her. She wasn’t interested but I realized I was wrong and came out of the spiral that I had been in for a couple months. But I could see the improvements she was making and how she was finally taking her issues head on and making progress, so I tried to stay away and distract myself.   So I threw myself into my friend group and ended up talking to one of the girls I hung out with. It was the girl my ex had always been worried I would leave her for. I was an idiot and didn’t think of it. We started talking and it was working I was spending less time thinking about my ex. We talked a lot, but when it came to the physical side of things I realized I wasn’t prepared or ok with any of it, I had that conversation with her. She said she understood, but the next time we hung out she pushed the physical side again and I didn’t know how to say no without making her feel bad and I was scared to ruin the friendship so I just went along with it stupidly. I then spoke with her the next day saying I really didn’t want to be physical with her, and she said she understood. But I wasn’t sure. When I was at work that day I closed and was alone and let my guard down just enough for all the unresolved emotions to rush in and start suffocating me. And just when I thought I had no one to go to or talk to, my ex messaged me asking me to come over. I went immediately without thinking. We slept together again and talked for hours and hours. She begged me to take her back and begged me to stay with her, but I couldn’t do it, I didn’t want to undo all the work she had done, even though I already selfishly came over in the first place, I just wanted to feel safe again and she was my safe place. I never should have gone.  The next day was a party a friend was hosting and the girl I had started talking to was going, so was a number of my friends. I went and blacked out, I can’t remember anything after the first hour. But apparently I slept with that girl again. She apparently came in after me when we were all in the hot tub and we hooked up. I have no memory of it. But this put me in the position of having slept with my ex then her. I never intended to do that and didn’t want to be in that position.   Later that same night apparently I talked about my ex and fell apart in a big way. Which she then wanted to talk to me about.(the new the girl) she asked to talk to me the next morning, but I had work and tried to say no I needed to work, I also wanted to find out what happened the night before because at that time I didn’t remember anything. Other than that I apparently talked about my ex and fell apart. So when she forced me to talk to her that day and then told me she slept with me. I didn’t know how to react, I was angry, hurt, betrayed, guilty, ashamed and a lot more. She then asked if I had slept with my ex the night before, I panicked and made the wrong choice and lied by saying no. I was just trying to buy myself time to come to terms with my own feelings on everything that happened, but I never should have lied to her.   I hurt my ex and the friend at the same time and I hate myself for it. I gave everything up for this business and for my exes best interest. And I was wrong. I was so horribly wrong and I hate myself for making the choice. She was the best thing to ever happen to me and I should have tried harder to make her happy I should have been better, I should have payed more attention to her mental health. I should have been better. I tried my best to be what she needed, but I failed.   Now my friends hate me my ex hates me, I don’t know how to live with myself. I feel like being happy is something I can only be with her, and she wants nothing to do with me. She was what made me get up each day, she was what made me want to succeed. I only wanted to have a future so it could be with her. When I look forward I only see missing her. It’s been 4 months since this all happened and I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, she since then has started sleeping with someone I used to call a friend, all he has said is that he’s better for her then I ever was and that I should never speak to her again. But all I want is to see her happy and I know that he isn’t going to do that. I know that she is sleeping with him because when she is hurt and sad and needs validation she sleeps with anyone willing to. That was a thing I learned before we dated. It’s why I never slept with her or had any physical relationship till she understood I cared about her for who she was and not her body or what she provided. I know this guy isn’t like that, I have heard the shit he says about it and how he sees it and it’s disgusting. It kills me to see her go backwards and I know it’s because I hurt her.   I don’t know what to do, everything I ever wanted was her and the future we had. And I threw that away because I hate myself more than anything and can’t see a world where I can help people. Where I can be a positive aspect of someone’s life, so I left, I pushed her away. Only now that it’s too late I realize we could have taken on the world if we wanted to. I should have tried harder, I should have not given up on her like I did. I shouldn’t have listened to my snake of a ex friend and I should never have tried to move past her. I should have tried to fix what we had, I should have asked what I could do to help instead of telling her what I did to fix my own issues.   If you made it this far thanks. If you didn’t read it all I don’t blame you. It’s a lot and it’s not exactly a great read.

I honestly feel like I should die and I'm a mistake, before you suggest it, I told my mom. She tried to be  supportive but I feel no better, it's gone on for long. Since I was 5-7. I'm honestly sick of faking being happy, I don't know what more to do.  # Why I wouldn't kill myself  I'm afraid of death, and even if I wasn't, there's nothing I could use. I'm probably ''too young'' anyways, that's probably why my mom shrugged it off.   # Why I want to kill myself  First off, I have trouble getting to sleep, I hardly wake up in the night, it's just hard for me to get asleep. My mom has taken notice of that too. ''Over tired'' she calls it. Also, I'm super lonely, I have no friends, the only place I have friends is on the internet, but they're not on much, and when they are, I'M the one giving support. I get they have problems too, but I gave up so long ago. I'm also so scared of so many things. Falling into the sky, on a wall/the ceiling, that is a big problem for me when I look up in the sky or look up when I'm lying down. It just scares me, it doesn't affect my sleeping, but other ascepts. Failure. Nobody likes failure right? It's worse for me. I'm scared of failure because I feel if I fail then; nobody would like me, they would ignore me more, I would be more alone. I know it's not true, I just can't escape that fear.  Sorry if this is too long, I've just been holding this in so long.

If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out. You can find help at a National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  USA: 18002738255 US Crisis textline: 741741 text HOME  United Kingdom: 116 123  Trans Lifeline (877-565-8860)  Others: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines  https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org
As the bot suggestions, you may find benefit in talking to a hotline if you feel actively suicidal. Even if you're not there yet, I have found them helpful during ideation phases in the past when is was trying to keep my fantasies of death from becoming solid plans but didn't want to bother my therapist. There are several to chose from based on where you are and they come in different formats. Some are phone calls, some computer based chats, and some texting based.  It sounds like you haven't talked to a mental health professional or even your general practitioner doctor about your depression, and I really urge you to do so. If you are young enough that your mother would need to be involved and is resisting, you should tell her you have a medical problem and need a medical solution. If the problem is insurance, your mom may need to research programs to get you into because you really do sound like you need therapy at minimum and possibly medication, at least in the short term. Depression is a life threatening problem and should be treated like any other potentially fatal health issue.  I was first diagnosed with depression when I was eight. It is something that affects kids. And it is something that tends to get worse with adolescence. I wasn't medicated until my school became involved because my mom hates medication and didn't fully understand that depression involves chemical imbalances rather than mere drama and moopiness. I'm very grateful to the counselor who insisted on that. My depression didn't vanish and I still struggle with it decades later, but the medication helped me stay alive to fight.  You're not alone and your problem isn't one you should just hope you get over or grow out of. It does sound like your mom cares but maybe doesn't know what to do. There are a lot of resources online or she can talk to your doctor.  I wish you strength.
oh wow- you got diagnosed with depression younger than me, do you know what the computer chats are?
I'm confident there are others, but here is one option: https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/
oh im in uk sos
This page has a list of UK chats... https://www.suicidestop.com/suicide_prevention_chat_uk.html  kooth.com looks to be all online.

You aren't alone. A lot of us former drug abusers have been through similar experiences. We all want you to get better and find peace.
Depends on what you were using,  and for how long.   Keep in touch with your support/doctor/whatever you have.   It gets better,  trust me(drinker/drug user for 13 yrs,  sober five)
I know what’s it’s like to relapse into depression over and over again. I’m just coming out of the latest one. I had my lithium decreased and within 2 weeks I was a hot mess. Add on other health issues and I’m a hot fucking mess.   I think what we need to embrace is that we won’t be “normal”.  What we’ve been taught as “normal” is not OUR normal. It’s kinda helped for me to not push myself to be “normal”.  I honestly don’t remember what being normal or okay is like. All I feel is the void. But acknowledging that I have to find my own definition of being okay has kind of helped. Now I have a scale that runs from suicidal to depressed to not-so-depressed. That’s it for now, and that’s okay. Beating myself up for not being able to meet anyone else’s version of normal is not at all helpful.
Stay strong I'm With you

Hello. I've never been on reddit. I don't even know if I'm on the right place. All I know is that I'm throwing a bottle to the sea as a last cry for help. My melting point is slowly being reached. I cannot anymore. It's not about suicide or depression, it's a constant anxiety with an underlying agony. I'm soon 25 and French, but my anxiety is ruining me. Every night (even during the day sometimes, my mind can feel easily overwrought ) I have a terrible time falling asleep without unprescribed meds (meds you can find at a drugstore to have a a more paisible slumber). Every time, I think about what is going on around me, a terrible fear of death, I am 25 years old, still looking like in my 18s, I'd say maybe even pretty attractive and fresh, but every single year that passes by since I'm 19 feels like the Grim Ripper pushing me into the grave. I think about all the people and pet that I've known and that have passed away now . I can't help but see them into a state of utter decomposition, see the skeletons of once lovely beings that have been reduced to nothing by nature. I think about the few ones I have left, my mom, my boyfriend, whom I couldn't live on without, that are the only beings so precious to me that I have. I can't help but think and dread the day I will lose them. Can't help but imagine all the scenarios I could lose them to, imagine their dead bodies and how they were once such a beautiful, lively and wonderful people. It's dreadful to look at someone and get a underlying picture of their potentially dead face. My mind tortures me with dark pictures. I try to see the world beautiful but my anxiety of getting old, of death and losing my loved ones makes my life a bit of hell.  I often think about my bunny pet, who I consider as my baby, I think about how he's just bones now. This all terrifies me and conveys a tiring pain that kills me slowly through anxiety and toxins. On the daily basis, everyone will tell you I'm a lovely, cheerful person, quite the sun ray perhaps. But on the inside, my anxiety is making my insides rotten. I'm too lazy and entitled to speak to someone. I keep this to myself and will never be powerful enough to seek therapy or empty out my bag, but I'm terribly scared, dreadfully scared to see myself get old, to apprehend the death of my loved ones, to think about my own future, to think about what my own dead body or the body of the people I've loved so much will look like and etc... Putting this exhausting fear into perspective, with proper words, is almost unachievable ! I wish I could describe it! It's just like feeling terribly shaky and worked up, staying in the dark with wide opened eyes while dreading a thousand scenarios that are playing so actively in your head without you being able to shut them down. I fear there isn't a cure for this, But I cannot live a healthy life with this! What is there left to do? Please?

A loved one trying to push me away  Hello everyone,  My girlfriend that’s been suffering from depression for years is having an episode and I noticed that she’s trying to push me away. She even straight up told me that this is what’s happening and she’s sorry. She warned me about this a while back and she told me that if it happens I should try talking some sense into her. Although when I asked about it again today she said that I shouldn’t and it’ll pass eventually. I’m kind of confused on what I’m supposed to do in this situation.   I’ve done tons of research into depression and how I can support her properly without draining myself, but I’m just really worried about her leaving me behind and I wanna do everything I can to support her.   Is there anything specific I should do or say while she’s trying to push me away? I’m not leaving her side no matter what. So even if she tries she won’t be able to do it. I just wanna know what I should or CAN do to help.

I cleaned my kitchen today 😅 baby steps
I know this is well meaning, but as you can see by one of the other comments, this kind of "buck up" advice can be hurtful to those with mental illnesses who are not at a point where they have the ability to self-motivate. They may feel shamed or worthless when reading advice they don't have the ability to follow. I think this is best for subs like r/selfimprovement or r/DecidingToBeBetter where people are seeking inspiration. Not for a mental health sub where people are sick.   I hope you don't take this as me disagreeing with your post, because I'm sure it can help many people. But this sub includes vulnerable people. The last thing we want is to trigger someone into self-harm or spiraling.
Just shut up and go away. These are the same cliched bs that I have been listening from past 6 yrs. Depression doesn't even lets you get out of bed. Everything is a burden. All ambitions are lost. Its a medical problem caused due to a change in biochemistry of the brain. You bs inspirations like "WE ALL FACE HARDSHIPS, You are loved, etc", don't make any difference. So pls just go away. I have been suffering from last 6 years after the death of my brother and now my gf. I know it will persist throughout my life and I have to live with it.
YES ! thats it in itself, step by step, moment by moment, day by day <3 proud of you
I hear what you are saying <3 thank you for sharing, Ill refrain from sharing in here <3 wishing you well
I am not here to express who's depression is worst, or who has experienced more hardships in life. I am here to say that I suffer and struggle with depression, dysphoria, anxiety, pain, etc etc etc. BUT. What will that do if we allow it to consume us. It takes time to heal and I hear how painful your life experience has been. I am saying that there are many other people who have experienced the same thing as you in different areas of their life. I am saying for you to use what you have already endured and are going through to broadcast and share it with the world. There will be 1000s etc of people who will resonate and understand what you are feeling, growing your own community through whatever it may be, podcasting, art, entrepreneurship you name it. I know you are hurting, I know you are pain. I am here for you and i love you. <3
thank u!!
love you <3 wishing you health and happiness <3

When I’m down in the dumps I really don’t have the energy to answer texts and have a conversation etc.   *Also, it’s incredibly hard for me to think of things as real if I can’t physically see them (?). Like all my friendships are long distance currently (bc they’re based at my college) and not seeing my friends in person takes away some sort of thing in my brain that tells me they’re real people that care about me... and I should probably answer. Idk what is it lmao but it makes this harder*   But then when i feel good enough to answer, I get nervous and get convinced it’s been too long and they probably have moved on from my friendship at that point.   It’s now been 2 weeks (or more) since I’ve answered a text and I’m wrecked with anxiety bc I love my friends but idk how to explain that I’m literally just stupid. It’s Christmas Eve and I wanna be like hey sorry merry Christmas but is that weird?   Any advice is appreciated

Hi, this is super relatable and I've been guilty of doing the same when I'm in a low state (aka much of this year). Take a deep breath and send the text. Your friends want to hear from you and want to know how you're doing. 2 weeks isn't a terribly long time and def not long enough to just peace out of a friendship. Send the text. Good luck and I believe in you!

My parents told me two days ago out of nowhere that they are “ending their marriage.” I’m 17 and a senior in high school, and the word divorce or separation has never been mentioned, they’ve don’t fight either (at least in front of me). I’ve got a brother with severe brain cancer, epilepsy and anger management who’s a few years younger and still cannot fully comprehend what is going on. My dad mentioned how he made the decision against what my mom wanted for his “career.” I’m not really sure what that meant but he’s living in the city now with a new job and my mom brother and I are two hours away in the country. I got rejected from the college I wanted to go to a few days before, and this is all just a few days before Christmas which tends to be a big-ish thing in our family. I just feel like I’ve got nothing left. I’ve contemplated suicide and quickly realized how selfish that would be for my mom and my brother, but I just don’t have the slightest hope for my future. I guess this is more of a cathartic rant, but if anyone has ever been in a similar situation please don’t hesitate to reach out.

My mom and dad seperated when I was around 11 years old. I think I handled it as well as a 11 year old could do, but you dont really process things like this when you're 11, so I think it hits you harder than it ever did hit me.  As long as they can remain friends and be in the same room together without it being an issue, this isnt a catastrophe, all though the family dynamics are going to go through some rough transitions in the next 2 years. As long as either parent doesnt just disappear out of your life, your life and relationship with your parents isnt going to change much. But there is going to be a schism in your head as where you once saw your parents as an entitity, you know have to look at them as two seperate induviduals. That is going to take a while to get used to.  It seem that your family situation is a bit more sensetive than mine was considering your brother being ill. I guess it feels alot like your whole life is falling apart right before your very eyes. Seek comfort from your friends and family, your mother is probably going to need a bit of support right now.  >I got rejected from the college I wanted to go to a few days before  Well that happens, do you have any alternatives? Maybe take a year of and get a part time job and save up some money and try again next year?
Thanks so much for this. Feels good to know people have gone through similar things, even though I know half of all marriages end in divorce, I never thought this one would. I’ve got some other plans for applying to college, it’s just a load of work seeing that applications are due in the next 10 days but hopefully I can just bang out the writing in a few sittings. Again thanks for reaching out, means a lot

I have depression for almost all my life and it's getting worst from the last five years to now.  I have a childhood(teenage in the truth) trauma, this trauma make me a piece of shit when comes to talk about relationships, it's impossible for me to talk with women in a romantic way, I have panic and stress crisis and I hate this shit. I never talked about this with a therapist before, let's say that I have big issues to take care of. And when I tried I froze and can't talk for a few minutes so I gave up. And only one other person knows about this trauma.  Before we talk about the dream I need to tell you something. Back in high school I was really attracted by a girl, she was my crush for 2 years, she was beautiful, energetic and a really good listener, we had conversations but I never approach the romantic(or even a second intention) way of talking. An then comes the prom, me and my friends organized the party in a really good place (pra quem fala português foi um sítio com piscina, churrasqueira, e tudo o que se pode ter direito).   The party was a 3 day long in a project X style. In the first day I pull up all my courage and make my move on her, I didn't confesed my feelings I just made a pick up line about the beauty of the sky and her eyes, she had a smirk and sayd that I was a good friend. Somehow she knew what I was trying to do and refused me, it made the rejection not so painfully and I enjoyed the next days with may friends. The next day her and a guy are coming back and forth from the girls room, at the point that the guy sneaked out of the room and hided himself, after asking he reveals that he was almost fainted and need some rest because she was insatiable, I chicked out and didn't try any move.  After the graduation she found a exchange + job program and move out to europe, she had a boyfriend, a good job and what we can consider a really great life, I'm genuinely happy for her.  All of this happened 3 years ago and now let's talk about my dreams. I had dreamed about her, her face, her smile, her body, her scent, and everytime I wake up start to cry. In my dreams we are dating, hung in out and doing a lot of couple stuff, even in my surrealistic dreams she appears ant it made me soo happy in my dreams, but when I wake up I know that was all a dream and I'll never see her again. This shit is hurting me very well. I dunno what to do since my therapist are now in vacation and no one knows about this trauma I'm in a limbo an it's pulling myself deeper every time I dream  Do you guys have any help or wise words for me  I can't stand beyond this  (sorry for any error in my English, it's not my first idiom and I'm very emotional now)

I want to harm and I want to kill myself. But I’m too tired to do it. I just don’t have the energy to.   I’ll stare at my razor and think about using. I feel the urge to use it. But then I just don’t.  Or I’ll be holding my medicine bottle and think about downing all the pills like a drink. But then I just take my meds and go back to what I was doing.   Literally to depressed to kill myself.  Is that common? Has anyone else felt that?

Sunflower flourishes well under well-drained moist, lime soil. It prefers good sunlight. Domesticated varieties bear single large flowerhead (Pseudanthium) at the top. Unlike its domestic cultivar type, wild sunflower plant exhibits multiple branches with each branch carrying its own individual flower-head. The sunflower head consists of two types of flowers. While its perimeter consists of sterile, large, yellow petals (ray flowers), the central disk is made up of numerous tiny fertile flowers arranged in concentric whorls, which subsequently convert into achenes (edible seeds).

If you're spending the holidays alone, I have an idea of what that's like because I am too. The depression and anxiety is intensified - feeling desolate, scared, isolated, alone all the time. I'm trying to find moments of comfort where I can. Holding my cat. Sipping hot chocolate or peppermint tea. Wrapping up tight in thick, soft blankets. Watching great movies. Listening to great music. Making and eating a delicious meal.    If you're spending the holidays alone, I'm so sorry for your pain. I wish you all of the things that bring you moments of comfort.

Even though I've been looking forward towards Christmas, as it's been getting closer I've been looking forward to it less.  The same happened with my birthday this year, as well as both Christmas and my Birthday last year.  I always get irrationally sad. Sometimes I cry, and when I do it's uncontrollable. I don't know why these special occasions make me feel so shitty and down.   (my mental health isn't the best anyways, but this is a reoccurring theme with special holidays for the last couple of years.)  Can someone give me some advice? On improving my mindset; being more positive or even in getting to the root of feeling like this.

Please call the hotline, friend. I know things are shitty right now but give yourself a chance to see if they can get better. Nothing I can say can stop you but I really hope you see another day.

Not sure if this will help anyone but here goes:  I came from a protective and loving environment and yet I would feel different after puberty, it started out as just a thought that I would push away and do things with my brother and friends from school. I developed interests with my best friends from childhood friends such as Pokemon, Digimon, Yugioh, played video games together and would watched television together, for the most part I was doing very well but with time I discovered some other person was in my mind other than myself which I hid and I started to develop anger that I could not control and relieve would only come by punching walls.   I discovered self harm was able to make this anger go away quicker and would become my go to response for my outbursts of anger and years would go by while I continued to live my life with my two best friends, hiding these things from them because I would feel shame, that I was the grandson of a great man and I too wanted to be just like my grandfather but being the way I was, I was ashamed.   I was 18 when I realized I was sick and would not become better, I swore I would hide this from everyone and then I started to live my two lives, one where I was always smiling and helpful and the other I was crying in self harm as I could not understand what is happening to me. Years went by, I held jobs, had relationships, it would be difficult to maintain my two lives and my mental illness only got worse over time, losing interest in the things that gave me joy. I would also become alcoholic and would abuse drugs for a time in between relationships.  I don't want to make this too long, so let's move onto my downward spiral. I was 29 and in a relationship, we moved in together, me trying to live the best life as I could with my fake smile but I had lost all interest in the things that gave me joy and I was tired all the time, I decided to end my life. I was only weeks away from my suicide, I can feeling it coming as my mind was crumbling and my will to live shattering but one evening for a walk with my now ex-girlfriend, I had a vision of my little brother smiling and I said "Damn it, I'm going to live". So to give myself every chance to live, I went to see my doctor and told her the G-Rated symptoms as I was afraid of being "locked away" for being a danger to myself, I got my appointment to see a psychiatrist.  I SAW COLOUR! is the part of my story where I started to improve, I was given antidepressants at low dosages to start and I started to improve, that entity I experienced also faded when I got on anti psychotics, I was going to live! My diagnoses, Depression with Psychotic Features. This would be 2017 but my treatment would taper off and become less effective, I would battle with my illness for the next 3 years. Long story short, I was happy but not with my situation, my relationship ended and I did drugs to run away from everything and went down another path of suicidal thoughts but I confessed to my friends and family what was going on, bringing me to now.  I told my psychiatrist everything and I'm sober again, back on antidepressants and two anti psychotics, I am still alive and significantly improved on my newest treatment. I can indeed now say I am becoming happier, I am still mid-treatment but I hoped someone would get something out of my story.    TL;DR   Despite coming from a safe home I developed mental illness, I hid it for my adult life up until my decision to end my life, I sought help from my doctor and eventually saw a psychiatrist and my life vastly improved until it didn't but with some luck, it improved once again when I confessed and got back on treatment. My treatment saved my life.

Sorry to hear it 😔  Brains can be weird.  Good luck on your recovery from an internet stranger
I hate that brother or sister. Hang in there and know that the sun comes up tomorrow. Keep your recovery in the forefront. This is just ONE crappy day.  Tomorrow can be the one that turns the rocket booster back on!!!!  You got this!!!
You are not alone. I'm going through the same thing. Even though I'm feeling "better" I still don't feel right. I'm trying to trust the process. Good luck to you <3
This might sound odd to some but I take a liquid vegan DHA supplement every morning for brain health and it's really benefitted me. Feel free to pm me if you want more info.
Hey me too. I’m with you. It fucking sucks. Brain feels like mush. You’re not alone
All the best Luck man , stay strong.I believe in you 😊
I know you this isnt an answer we like hearing, but time takes care of everything. Time has never taken an L and will never be defeated. Make small goals for yourself every day. For example- (1. Get out of bed by(x), 2. Brush teeth 3. Clean up something 4. Draw, Paint, Create something) These small wins will add up and soon turn into bigger wins. Be proud of yourself for accomplishing your goals no matter how little they are. Have you ever meditated or heard of microdosing?
Eminem does that to you. Man but that album is underated. He was showing off how he could still recapture the essence of what shady was but also conveyed he was evolving yet people claim he cant do what he could one. But I love relapse, my favourite track is My Darling cause it's just so different.
Thanks
Yes bain does feel like mush it feels shitty and u like can't do anything about it
What is microdosing
It's not for everybody, but it's dosing small amount of psilocybin mushrooms 2-4 times a week. It's a small enough dose that you dont "trip" or have any visuals. It boosts mood and rearranges our perception of our situations we face. I have been prescribed a dozen different SSRIs and anti-depressant medications and nothing has come close to how much mushrooms have helped me overall. I don't even take them anymore because I dont even feel like I need to. On a scale of 1-10, my depression is a B. It only took me 2 months of microdosing to overcome a decade of depression and opiate addiction. I now understand why they call them "Magic Mushrooms"

DISCLAIMER: NOT A DOCTOR! (but has experience from a similar situation). I hear them too. Have ever since I was a little kid.   If you're experiencing hallucinations and delusions of people other than yourself in your head you might wanna consult a professional as it can get worse and cause more stress and anxiety. Although, you might not have much luck if you're under 18 cause most of the time they won't diagnose minors.   They'll medicate you without a diagnosis though if you're concerned enough. Be careful with antipsychotic medication it can be scary. If you notice ANYTHING sketchy get off that shit IMMEDIATELY I cannot express that enough.
Or you can be semi- smart like me and not take those meds at all. There's a reason I don't take psychiatric medications.  Won't even touch them.
Well, im sorry you didn't find my comment helpful. You can try to get better naturally and I sincerely hope you do. It's up to you to take meds or not but options can get limited. Just a warning.

Lately nighttime is like a bomb. The pain of my sadness is like somone sliced me in half with a scythe. Im currently looking for my first therapist. (Yay)  Im just wondering if anyone else feels like they can hold it off during the day only be overcome at night? What do you do to help yourself? The activities id normally do are more daytime centered and I really want to sleep vs agonizing with my brain which keeps me up. Thank you in advance.   This is my first time posting outside of comments. If I do something wrong please let me know. I dont want to upset anyone by not posting this correctly.

I hear what you are saying.  When your life is turned upside down, or you struggle with continuous depression, night time can be tough.  I don't know anything more than any other non-professional, but in my experience, I have concluded that it's a few factors.. your body is getting tired.  I think as my body and mind get tired at night, it weakens my brain to be resilient to the things that trouble me.  The darkness outside closes in my world.  Makes everything feel lonely.  And this time of year with the extended darkness, it enhances this problem.  If this issue you have is fresh, it may pass with time as you heal from whatever troubles you.  If this is ongoing, there are therapists that can help you cope and guide you on a better mental path.  If you want to try and help yourself a little for the time being, there are always the tried and true methods.  Exercise a little.  A night time routine will keep the brain from wandering as much.  Try some guided meditation.  There are free apps that I find very calming.  Finding interest in hobbies can be tough, but if you can, busy your mind with something.  Create something.  Most importantly, find some support from someone who knows you.  Some company may not make the problem disappear, but it takes the edge off.  And if you need to be heard, even if it is just you rambling on, airing your words to someone else may help keep them from festering in your mind.  And if you just want a reddit pal, DM me any time.  I'm happy to chat about anything.

So I need some help with my motivation, and basically even though I'm able to force myself out of bed and get up, I still can't find the motivation/energy to do stuff (brushing my teeth in the morning, doing my work etc). Currently the only way I've gotten the motivation to do anything is by chugging a can of monster (I need 2 cans a day usually) and I heard its pretty bad for the body. I was wondering if you guys knew any better ways to do so?

I know this is always irritating to be asked, but how is your sleep schedule and your diet? Are you are able to get around 8 hours of sleep a night without interuptions? Have you ever had a blood test that's shown you were low on anything? I'm always low on vitamin c + d, fixing those can help my energy levels. And I know this is even more irritating to hear, but exercise + going outside helps a fuckton, even if you just walk for half an hour. When I mentally feel like shit, if I'm physically healthy I can get by, but if they're both shit they rebound off of each other and I'm stuck in bed the whole day.
dont worry about sounding irritating i know youre trying to help :)     as for my sleep schedule, i usually sleep 8-9 hours a day and i usually wake up in the middle of the night randomly (i go back to sleep in 5 mins)     i personally havent taken blood tests but apparently (according to my mom) im iron deficient sort of so ive been taking some iron pills and what not     finally i personally do walk around the block about 30 - 45mins a day but I don't exercise regularly other than the occasional cycling session with my dad.
You sound pretty healthy which is great! Iron deficiency can cause fatigue so it's important to keep taking the pills. But other than that, I don't see any other physical problems- it seems like it might be regular  low energy/low motivation moods caused by depression, which only therapists can help with, I'm afraid. Wishing you all the best in feeling better soon either way
thank you for the well wishes, all the best to you too!

this is the first time i write a post online about anything related to my depression. I'm looking for advice or help so i'll tell you a little more about myself. i don't remember when my depressive mood started. i remember I saw my first therapist when I was around 8, then I remember crying myself to sleep at 10-12 bc anxiety and insomnia. at 15 I felt despair, tried to run away, and had constant suicidal thoughts. I've never tried to kill myself but I've researched the most effective methods many times. i have this feeling of wanting to be gone but not die (if that makes sense? i don't want my family to experience suicide, i don't like the idea of killing myself, i just fantasize about not existing). i wouldn't say I've had a hard life, actually i have a "healthy" and privileged one (food, housing, vacations, etc) but as far as i can remember, my fucking whole life I've been mostly sad. I've been to a psychologist since i was 8. i didn't stick with anyone. when i was 18 i went to one and he told me i was too hard of a case to go on with therapy and that i should seek for a psychiatrist for antidepressants. i didn't want to so i quit and found another psychologist. after about a month of therapy she just didn't reply to my texts for the next appointment. after that I've just given up on professional help. it has never helped me. i dont have any experience with antidepressants, I've never taken them but i have close family members that have and have had a horrible experience. i feel like i dont want to take any bc i have the idea that taking them would be bad on the long run? like I've been hoping that eventually ill overcome it by myself. but its been too long. its not constant but its always there. i can have a great 6 months and then relapse and cry every day for the next 6 months. right now its unbearable. I'm angry, anxious and overthinking all the time. i want to cry everyday, i overreact over anything. i constantly feel drained and dont feel any type of motivation. im currently on a long distance relationship and he came to visit me, what i thought would be a relief has been horrible bc i constantly fight him over anything, i get angry over fucking stupid shit and i cry all day. this adds to my anxiety bc i constantly think about the days we have left together and how my stupid depression is ruining them (along with my whole fucking life)  what should i do? advice?  just pls dont tell my to seek help (i know this, this is everyone's first response, this is googles first find, i have 15 years of experience with professional help and it hasn't helped at all)

Depression can be a weird enemy, i feel like you need someone to talk to more than anything,  I'm available if you want to talk to a stranger who might understand, People say seek help be cause it usually is a good first step, but it's clearly not the golden idea that's gonna solve everything, Depression, after all, is a sickness, psychology hasn't quite figured out the reasons, but there are factors that worsen it, Such as anxiety and overthinking. What i recommend is talking to someone ( family, friends) Or try medicine , personally the antidepressant lexapro changed my life,made me not necessarily happy, but no longer crying myself to sleep every night. Other friends of mine use pot. (that might not be legal where you live)  The idea of seeking help doesn't have to be external, you can do small steps each day to help yourself and reinforce habbit that generally make you happy, take care!

I think at times we place our parents on pedestals and we forget they may be very broken human beings full of faults.    What has helped me when I am in an argument is to take the opposite approach of how I feel inside.  I have a big temper and will lash out with anger and loud yelling.  Now, when in an argument I sit and listen.  When they are done, I say sorry, I ask "What would you like me to do differently?".  This has led to such different outcomes than I ever can have imagined.   By showing my vulnerability, it throws everyone off and gives them a chance to take a step back and evaluate their approach.  It makes them think, Why am I yelling or what do I want.  It gets to the problem faster and a solution.  I sum it up and say it back to them to make sure I have an understanding.  It sounds crazy but it works.  For the parent's side of things as you get older you realize that your parents are people.  They  may have had a hard life, been abused, and just don't have enough emotional intelligence to seek help or not to take part in destructive behavior to those around them.  Especially men, it is very hard for men to seek out help or therapy of any kind.

TW   I’ve been extremely sad and tired lately. And I don’t know what to do about it. I have absolutely no people to talk to. It just bothers me so much. A few days ago I tried to cut myself. I just feel like shit rn and I hate it. Life’s been hard since I moved to where I am rn. I have no friends and I don’t really feel like my family’s “family” if that makes sense. I only have one friend I talk to a lot online but I can’t open up to her for some reason. I’m so tired of feeling like this. It’s so fucking annoying. And I’m so tired of everything. Of feeling this way of living this life just everything pisses me off. ESP here since body image is a big thing I’ve been getting back into my old habits of starving myself. Fuckkk I hate my life so bad.

I am 18, but  I am so tired of life that it is unbearable. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for over 5 years and it's just getting worse and worse.  I can't bring myself to do anything productive, mainly because my illness and because... life is just too boring for me and I would like to end it. It's not like I am getting anywhere since the only thing I do all day is watch anime and game. Even if I want to learn, work out or practice guitar, I just can't.   If this continues I have no hopes for graduating, going to college, getting decent job or having a stable relationship. So basically I will have really no reason to keep  struggling. I am just a big failure atm and I will probably stay like that.  Lately I have been dreaming about suicide and writing my last words way too much. I even remember what I wanted to write there.  Anyway thank you for reading my vent, I am going to cry myself to sleep now  PS: please don't send me any "Jesus loves you" etc messages into DMs. I am atheist and it will just cause more harm than good

Depression and anxiety can be brutal, and will overpower everything else in your life when it gains enough traction.  I hear you and understand you.  You are young with your entire life to live.  It will have successes and failures, love and heartbreak, new friends and added family. It will become full. There is so much potential and an infinite number of ways to live your life. But it is cloudy right now and you can't see the future yet for what it can be.   Whatever the reason for your depression, it doesn't have to be this way.  You do not need to accept this.  There are solutions which may be as easy as confiding in someone.  Or the guidance of a therapist.  Medication may ease the pain a little and allow you to start seeing through the clouds. Then you can take it from there and find some joy in things.  Don't allow this right now to be who you are.  You took a step and put your feelings out there for strangers to read.  Take one more step and reach out to someone directly.  Friend or family or professional help.  Don't hold anything back.  Let them know your distress and how serious it is.  You will be taken care of. No Jesus needed.  Just a little faith in yourself that you can take the next step.

What helped me the most was starting a good diary. I record everything I eat. It was a pain a first, now is second nature. Then figure out your caloric needs for the body weight you'd like to be. Don't go nuts, pick something not too far from where you are now, so you don't get discouraged. Aim your daily intake there. Once you achieve that goal, if you still want to lose more, adjust.
Okay thank you so much!

I am new to Reddit and have never posted before but I feel like I have hit rock bottom and struggling severely. I feel I have no where to go. I have a therapist I speak to, but it doesn’t seem to be stopping me from falling into this depression and loneliness I am feeling in between sessions. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone, including my boyfriend. He seems very annoyed with me being sad all the time and distant- I don’t blame him, but I can’t help how I feel right now. I’m really trying and feel very discouraged. I don’t want to feel like this, I don’t want to be hurting, I don’t want to feel like a burden for how I’m feeling. I don’t know what I’m looking for with this post, but I know that at least trying to reach out to people (rather than just isolating myself and dealing with it on my own in unhealthy ways) is at least better than nothing. I just wish I had someone to talk to.

I'm always available to talk anytime. I understand your struggles
Hey! This is exactly what i go through. All my friends are annoyed my ex also was upset, like you said it is not their fault. In fact they wouldn't even know what we are going through. They are that naive so we can't really blame them either. You can message me whenever you want. I remember once I told him how I'm feeling and he didn't give the response I needed and wanted. I think that's when things started fading between us. What I'm trying to say is that I EXACTLY know what you are going through.
I call hotlines. Talking to a stranger is nice since they have nothing to judge you on and if you're calling up a depression hotline they take you seriously and don't belittle. Find a different therapist if you can. With the pandemic so many are offering services online with flexibility. Journaling also helps me..not nice Journaling..just straight up pouring every rotten feeling onto a page. Like a detoxification of my soul.

I have never been on reddit before but I'm at my whits end on trying to find some sort of engagement with people online due to months of isolation and severe depression, because I feel I can't contain anymore of my sadness and loneliness. I have tried free online depression chat rooms and such but, really, I just need someone to tell me I matter. I don't know how this tends to work on Reddit but this is probably just going to be me venting.   This year my depression has been so bad that my pessimism and slow bitterness and resentment with the world and everyone around me has scared me. I'm scared of how much I have internally changed as a person, my lack of empathy and willingness to care about others, and that has never been my character. This has never been shown through my actions, but I can feel this pessimism and bitterness poisining me internally. I have lost faith in everything, and because of that I eventually stopped coming online on social media altogether for months, both to deal with myself but also because I didn't want to end up acting toxic. I felt (and still do now) that no one cares about me, everyone is busy with their lives and their friends. I may have "friends", but they have THEIR friends who they give more attention to.  I have been online and have had "friends" or mutuals online who have known me for years, but I have always felt i simply cannot fit with them as they share a bigger bond with eachother. I've just always been a nice, familiar presence that they will interact with regularly. But I have always had experiences of feeling left and felt like I do not matter as much. This applies to real life experiences to. People who just stop making the effort to contact me, under no particular circumstances or conflict. I have always struggled to make friends, and the only long distance friendship I had for over nine years also resulted in stopping contact from their part this beginning of the year. Everytime I've felt that my relationship with a person is stable and we connect and have known eachother for years, I get proven wrong. I now naturally feel intense instibility in friendships, or seeking out friendships in general, because I now expect people to already have a circle of close friends, and I can't be apart of that. And it keeps happening, even online mutual friends have not reached out to me despite seeing my personal posts and how much of a hard time I've been having this year. Even me disappearing for months did nothing.   I feel intensely stupid and selfish, while at the same time feeling like if I had killed myself during these months of such bad depression, life would resume and no one would know. I feel stupid and selfish because I absolutely know its not people's responsibility to worry about me, especially when they are living their lives and are probably going through their own issues, and I shouldn't be throwing my frustration and bitterness on people. But it feels I've been just left in the dark while online mutuals who have known me for years, continue to enjoy their interactions with eachother and pretend nothing is happening unless they want to engage in a post thats not a personal one.   There's a lot of different issues in my life which have contributed to my diagnosis of depression and anxiety, but this year it feels like God wants to keep telling me no one cares for you. Til this day I don't know how people make lifelong friendships with people you have so much history and connection with. Maybe because of my own insecurities and outlook on friendships, I'm simply expecting something that normally isn't how it works. I just feel so suffocated whenever I'm online, its like I want to scream at everyone and say "LOOK AT ME PLEASE, IM SUFFERING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS" and for never paying attention when I suffered so much and continue to suffer, but want to interact with me on posts that are not about my personal mental health. What happened to making sure everyones okay? Do I not matter enough? Are they just sick and tired of me now? I can't even reach out in this kind of situation because again, I shouldn't be demanding people think about me.  I just wish my headspace wasn't so messed up. Recently, I anticipated that going back online and mentioning my suicide attempt would cause at least some kind of reaction from these mutuals, but nothing actually did happen. Since then I have completely shut down and cant function when I need to the most (exam season), its all just bad timing. But I'm more angry at myself because I basically asked for this, and when I didn't get the reaction I wanted I caused my own downfall. I know that I've caused my own isolation, my depression wants me to push people away so badly, and when I see people not making an effort on their side, people who I felt they would, its just tearing me apart. I really, really just want to disappear. I feel horrible for wanting people to feel guilty, but I'm so exhausted of feeling this way and I only want to be bitter and angry at the world.

Wish I could say something to make you feel better but the truth is I'm riding this wave same as you.
Welcome!  First of all, if you do feel suicidal, please get some help. It can be professional, a help line, or with a person you trust. I realize this is coming from some stranger on the internet, but I have been in some pretty low places myself before. It can hurt a lot. I don't want to see anyone else feel that way. You do matter. Please take care and make sure you are safe.   The self reinforcement loop of depression is brutal: feel low and don't feel like interacting, so then people interact less with me, and then that makes me feel low because of loneliness, ad infinitum. I have been there. It's awful. I am sorry you are suffering so much now. COVID social distancing just aggravates everything further. Depression hurts. Exhaustion, guilt, and anger all come with the illness. It's okay to feel those things, especially when your social needs are not being met. Humans need social contact. (Really. It is astonishing how harmful solitary confinement is for mental health.) It would be analogous to feeling grouchy after a poor night's sleep. You do have influence over how you react to these feelings. Sometimes it takes a while to change reactions. Baby steps over time do make a difference. Please also remember that you are not your depression. You may have it, but it isn't you.   From what you have said, I didn't quite understand what happened to the longer term relationships you mentioned in the second paragraph. I got the impression that you aren't really in contact anymore but for unclear reasons. There wasn't any fight, correct? If this is the case, be careful about holding on too tightly to initial interpretations. As an example, I often get paranoid that some of the joking texts I send to my partner accidentally pissed them off because they hadn't responded in a while. In reality, they were simply doing other things throughout the day and just didn't get a chance to respond. Moreover, people can care about others, and fail to show it. For instance, I forgot to wish my dad a happy birthday this year. I have a good relationship with him and still care a lot about him, but it slipped my mind (partially because I don't care about my own birthday, so I tend to be bad about remembering others). Did I mess up? Yes. Does that mean I don't care about him any longer? No, I still care about him.   Honestly, social media in general can be pretty toxic. It doesn't quite have the same attention span as a phone call or meeting in person. It is too easy to compare your life with what you see online and forget that people are showing you the highlights. I don't know about you, but I have never posted a picture of me stuffing my face full of greasy comfort pizza in an old ratty sweatshirt. It's the PR version of life. It's not real.   Building close friendships takes time and effort. Sometimes it is best to reach out to others rather than always waiting. Maybe they could be waiting for you to reach out too. This I have found to be true in particularly for longer term friends, especially those who don't live in the same town. Again, COVID makes it difficult to just run into people as often. But I would caution against going too open too soon. It can be a turn off. Dumping too much baggage out of the blue can be difficult for someone to handle. If someone you sort of know, as in you have met them once or twice before, just showed up on your doorstep with a suitcase asking to stay on your couch for a few days, it would make you uneasy, right? I think the same applies with emotional baggage. That isn't to say that you can't be open to anyone; instead, there just needs to be some history. Ask someone if they want to get a virtual coffee. The worst case scenario is you are back in the same position you are in now.   Getting back to your question about how you develop long relationships, I have found shared experiences are key. This is coming from someone who has only a few very close friends. As an example, one guy I ran against in high school (track and field) became my friend after he finished one place behind me in a conference meet. We got to talking and then ran together a few times. Later on, we began a yearly tradition of sharing New Year's Eve together. He is someone I can relate to a lot; we both ran competitively after high school and read many of the same books. He also struggles with many of my frustrations about modern USA society (way too individualistic. GAH!). To this day, we somewhat regularly call each other. Sometimes we talk a few times a week. Other times we can go a months without speaking. It just ebbs and flows. In any case, he is someone I trust and can bring up tough subjects. There have been times where I was at my lowest, and I am not fully convinced I would still be here without him. But this all took years to get to that point.  Again, you do matter. I would not have spent the time to write this if I felt otherwise. Please do take care and reach out to those you know. What have you got to lose? I wish you the best.
I can relate with almost everything you said, so all i can do  is to tell you that if you want to talk, vent or whatever, here i am.
Hey bro you matter, and your not alone. Everyone’s taking a mental hit from all this craziness so don’t be hard on yourself for not feeling the best.   Once a month or more I feel very insecure about all the relationships in my life consistently asking myself, why haven’t they rung my number, or messaged me. The key is I always do my best to ask myself, is this just a anxious thought with no merit. 99% of the time it is just that, and I’d you let it float away, you can get past it. That has been my life for a little over a year, I know we’re all different so it may not work. But It’s worth a shot to help a tortured soul like my own.  My last piece of advice is to be selfish. Seems silly but hear me out. If what you want to do is talk with them then please just do it. Don’t spend your whole life worried about bothering others. To be considerate and unhappy is no way to live friend, nobody would want you to live that way.   Stay positive brother/Sister.
I'm struggling with the same feelings right now, alot of my mates both irl and online have just stopped talking to me
Hey random person!  I see you! You are a real live human being and deserve to continue your existence! You need to continue to fight new fights and to love new things, it will happen in time. Keep working hard on keepin on. Life is fuckin hard I can attest to that, but it is worth it.  Hugs my friend things will get better, it will just take time. L
I think a lot of us can really relate to what you are saying.  It is hard to make friends the older we get.  It's awkward.    My husband has different sets of friends.  One set he goes biking with and the other set he plays and watches hockey with.  I think one of the things that you have to remember is that you need to make the effort on your side as well for a friendship.  At times, I make 80-90% of the effort with some friends.  That's just the way they are.  They do always say it's so wonderful to hear from me and they are happy I called and that they missed me.  I still have to call again after that....  On another note, I really don't think "normal" people understand depression and it makes them uncomfortable.  I texted my friend just recently that I have depression right now and I mentioned that my kids were doing well.  She addressed the kids in her text messages but completely ignored the depression part.  Although they may be your friends they are just not comfortable talking about it.
Hey I completely hear what your saying and I feel that all too well. It really hurts when the people you feel are your friends aren't interacting with you.  Remember if you have seemed closed off a lot of people's instincts would be to give you space until you talk to them.    And something I have to keep reminding myself is the way I feel and the way I appear to others is never the same. I can be crying my eyes out inside but can easily put on a smile that others can't see past.  What I would suggest is if there are people you are close to try to reach out first and see how they are feeling. It can show you are interested and open to communication. Tell them you have been feeling really down and would like to talk.   I have found sometimes you just have to come out and say things to some people. If they don't respond after that then they might not really be a friend.  I don't know if this may help at all just things I have observed and learned through my life thus far.  Be safe and ai wish you all the strength we all need in this crazy time.
Sending hugs. It does get better.
God man I can’t tell you how much I relate to all you wrote here. I can’t promise I gets completely better because it hasn’t yet for me. I’m holding out my optimism still and hope you can too. I’ve found that no matter how bad my depression gets, I will keep hurting, I may consider suicide, I may hurt myself but I still haven’t broken completely . I’m still here every morning even if I’m high, even if I wish I wasn’t here ai all. It’s a strange feeling to look back on all of the shit and be surprised I’m still standing and I hope you can feel that soon anon. Sending hugs <3. Always here to talk. There’s no expiration date on the talk to offer so really hmu if ur ever in need.
I understand this one. I'm more or less on the same boat. I don't have notifications and I don't really have the mental health to talk to others but if you just want to talk send me a message
I feel you and I don't really what to say to make you feel better, but know that you are not alone. If you want someone to talk to, you can send me a pm :)
I am sorry you feel this way. I have been there too. Please try to find happiness in things which you liked to do as a child, no matter how silly it would seem now. You are important to the world. I am here for you if you want someone to listen without judgements.
been there and this whole pandemic and isolation is not helping at all. all i can say is dont give up, please. i know it's difficult to get through this. everything will get better eventually. im sure there are some people or at least ONE person who cares about you. try reaching out some professional help asap and/or talk to someone you trust the most. make sure you get surrounded by people you used to hang out with that will bring you comfort and safety. DONT FORGET THAT YOU MATTER :) your feelings are valid! hope you stay safe, it's tough but it's not gonna last forever.
YOU DO MATTER. Many of us been there its horrible i know.im a bipolar and my heart broke while reading your post cause i can relate to you.i know how loneliness feels like and i promise you life gets better just hang on.look at the comments we all love you❤️ i wish i could do something for you to ease your pain☹️
I understand the pain from no one checking up. suffering in front of everyone can be really painful. sometimes it's helpful for me to try to think about how my own feelings of awkwardness might show up when I want to check in on people. it isn't easy. everyone gets caught up in their own shit and its easy to feel like it isn't your place to bring that up to others.
I still appreciate your comment, thank you
Hello, first of all thank you so much for your comment and advice, I really do appreciate it. Its been an extremely long day for me trying to get myself to type something for my online open-book exam that's due soon, and it is now nearly 1am, so I'm sorry if I don't seem like I'm giving as much energy into my reply as you did for me.   I do see the confusion in my rant regarding my recent ending of my friendship. To elaborate a bit more on that, I have had a long-distance friendship with someone who I met online for over nine years. We've met a couple of times in the past years, and I truly felt we had a strong connection. Think of like, a friend who your bond with is so deep, you never think twice that they would ever leave you, it just never occurs to you that something like that would happen. We've practically watched eachother grow from teens to young adults, despite not living near eachother. Equally we both have had our own personal issues and life problems to deal with but I really did feel that would never stop our friendship, I was always very proud of the fact that we had a healthy and empathetic friendship and never fought for all those years.   However for the last two years things changed on their side in life, I was always the one trying to reach out, but became very aware they just weren't wanting to talk to me anymore. I was going through my own problems too so I felt I should just stop trying. A whole other year passed and they never tried to contact me. Only on the day of my birthday they suddenly decided to message me happy birthday, and that was that. A month later I wished them a happy birthday, and eventually a few days later I confronted the fact they hadn't tried to contact me in a year after all the effort I did. It hurt a lot, but perhaps I expected too much from a friendship. There was no fighting or guilt-tripping or any toxic behaviour, we talked about it maturely and the outcome was: they felt they had changed as a person and found it easier to maintain friendships with people around them than try to keep in touch with me anymore. They were sorry and apologetic, and I accepted that. But since that day I guess we both knew it would be the end of our friendship.   Unfortunately this isn't the first time I've experienced this kind of situation, where I'm trying to reach out and make the effort with friends who I have had years of friendship and experience with, even when I've been hurt by their actions, and they just decide they don't want to do the same in return. This particular friend knew I had experienced this already with past friends, and ironically they did the same thing, simply stop wanting to talk to me, no conflict, just a change and decision made. I don't know how people can suddenly change and decide they no longer want to make an effort to maintain almost a decade-long friendship, but its these experiences that have led me to be so closed off now. 6 years ago i would have still been optimistic and hopefull, now I shrink back and distance myself whenever I realise a potential friend already has a circle of friends or a best friend they've known for years. I guess, after writing all of this down, I just feel abandoned. And now I catch myself desperately not wanting to have anymore hope.   This I guess is all linked to why I'm reacting the way that I am with my online 'friends', again, I keep thinking "they've known me for years.... does knowing someone and interacting with them for this long not mean anything?" Like I just keep questioning, do I have it all wrong in my head, is this not how it works?    Another thing I should probably clear up is everyone in my online space is very proactive in understanding mental health (regularly posting about mental health, etc.). It's just that this distance I feel with my self and with them (they all are very close with eachother from how they interact with eachother, have mentioned they have their own discord etc) makes things feel a little worse, like its a reason why they haven't messaged me to ask if im okay despite seeing evidence of me having such a hard time. They're all busy interacting with eachother and posting and engaging on things of their interest, I just feel ignored. I guess the biggest thing is, all these experiences do not give me the right to be angry, there is no conflict, but I feel so suffocated. The last thing I ever want to do is lash out angrily. Friendship breakups are just as horrible, if not more horrible than romantic relationships. The feelings of heartbreak aren't as intense and in your face like when experiencing it in a relationship, I feel like it is prolonged and stretches out into dull pain and heartache and it never goes away.   Again I really appreciate your advice, and I hope this context gives a bit more understanding why its been so difficult and more and more discouraging for me to try anymore.
Hey thank you, I really appreciate it. I'm sorry you're experiencing this too, I really do wish you all the happiness and that we overcome this.
Hey thank you for your words and advice it really does mean a lot to me. I guess my problem is I feel I have no place and the idea that I won't really ever be as much a priority to others than they do with their closer friends. I know that sounds selfish and demanding but I don't know any other way to put it.
Hi. I was just wondering why you characterized the action of just calling as selfish. Recognizing a need and acting on it, appears to me more in the category of self-interest. Maybe it isn't an important distinction. I guess I was mostly curious what you meant by selfish here. Good advice either way.
I'm really sorry you're going through the same thing. I'm wishing you all the best and that you find peace, we all deserve it.
Hey thank you for your kind words, I've been reading all the comments people left I didn't expect this many people to reach out. It's been a really long time since I felt noticed lol
I read something about the stigma around mental health getting better but still when people see some of the uglier, real mental illness symptoms in people like sleeping all the time or binge eating or staying in bed all day it kind of repels people. But good health and a healthy upbringing are a privilege and not everyone has that and I try not to let other people make me feel bad for not having it.  Other people in the comments are right when they say that people who haven't experienced depression don't understand. They really don't and it is hard not to hold that against them.
Thank you for your comment, really appreciate it. My context and circumstances are a little different but I understand where you're coming from as well. The constant experience of being abandoned by multiple friends has finally discouraged me entirely to try anymore after 7 years of doing my best to stay optimistic. Coupled with my depression its just too difficult to feel like I matter at this point.
Thank you a lot for your message, I really appreciate it. I'm wishing you safety and strength during this time too
Thank you I appreciate it
Hey thank you for your comment I really appreciate it. I actually decided to impulsively buy a japanese stationary subscription box for 3 months so that I can look forward to cute art and stationary and feel like a kid again lol. Trying to do things I like under the stress of my final university year, exams, dissertation writing etc.
Thank you for your comment I really appreciate it. I hope you stay safe and well too during this pandemic. And yes I'm currently still on a waiting list for counselling, just trying to hang in there.
Thank you for your comment <3. Maybe its because I havent been online and interacting with anyone for months but it was overwhelming the amount of comments and kind responses I got... thank you to everyone. I wish you all safety and love.
No worries at all. You can respond how much or how little you want. Also, hello from across the pond! ( I assume you are in the UK based on 1 a.m. local time was 12 hours ago and the spelling of "realise". I am in the Midwest of USA.) Sorry this got a bit long. Sometimes, I feel like I am helping myself more than you as I type these longish responses, as expressing my ideas clarifies them within my own mind. Hopefully, they are useful to you.  &#x200B;  >Friendship breakups are just as horrible, if not more horrible than  romantic relationships. The feelings of heartbreak aren't as intense and  in your face like when experiencing it in a relationship, I feel like  it is prolonged and stretches out into dull pain and heartache and it  never goes away.  Brutally true. I have some ended romantic relationships that I am pretty sure I will never get over, but point taken.   Oh. So in the friendship you described, you two met online. I see. I haven't really had any experience with a close friendship that started online. Most of mine have started in person and come from some kind of mutual interest or geographical proximity. Anyway, I am glad you two did have the maturity to talk it out rather than passively aggressively attack one another. This end parallels a mutual breakup of a romantic relationship. No one is at fault, and yet it still stinks. At least you do know. Now you can invest your energy in future relationships. Them jerking your chain would have been way worse in the long run.   But the discouraging trend of friend divestment you are describing concerns me. At the risk of extrapolating too much for a small amount of information, I think I may see a problem.  If you will indulge me a bit, let me express my thoughts in a parable. Once I was on a subway train (public transit) with irritated bowels post spicy Mexican food. It was really good but also caused that uncomfortable gassy build up where bubbles gurgle up and down my bloated abdomen. The pressure built, and eventually, I just had to release it a bit. The good ole one cheek sneak came to my rescue. Or so I thought. But then I noticed that one woman nearby squished her face a bit. Overall everything seemed okay, but unfortunately, it kept flowing, and throughout the rest of the ride, I had to keep breaking wind. And it smelt bad. Really bad. At one point, that woman got up, gave me a sad smile, and walked to the other end of the train. Then another passenger went. And another. Pretty soon, I was by myself sitting at one end of the train everyone else was on the other. There wasn't anything wrong with me; farting is a normal human process. But also, I had overstepped everyone else's tolerance. At some point, people get tired of inhaling noxious odors.   You told me this sudden ending of online friendships seems to be repeating. It could be random unfortunate chance. But I would also encourage you to do some self-reflection. Not about who you are, but instead focus on what you are doing. Is something you consistently do, which is difficult for others? Is there something you aren't doing? Have you checked in with others? Are you discussing shared interests? Posting a lot about mental health is great. We need to talk about it more as a society. But also, I would caution you that for many people it just is difficult to talk about. Even in this sub, there have been some days I just have to leave because the posts are so ... well ... depressing. And I am guilty of this myself. Pretty recently, I mentioned to my partner that I didn't want to or think I would live to be 60 years old. My casual tone freaked her out (she told me later but not at the time). Moreover, we hadn't been dating for too long at the time, which made it even more difficult for her to process. I am very grateful that she was able to express her discomfort to me. It isn't that we can't discuss these things, but I just also have to recognize others' boundaries.   Please don't get me wrong. Depression stinks. It shouldn't be taboo either. But it is heavy. I don't know how long you have been dealing with it or how severe yours is. My main point is that there is a context for discussing it, and allowing it to consume you isn't good for anyone, including yourself. It is simple but not easy. I have had more recent success dealing with mine by producing some separation. I visualize it as an anchor. As in, "Damn. My anchor is pulling me down today. I guess that is why my dumbass just downed two bottles of wine for not reason." Having support to deal with it is super important as well, but I always have to be conscious of how my supporting people are doing. A mutually beneficial relationship works best. There have been times where I send a text to a friend asking them to go on a run with me. I tell them that I felt horrible last night and balled my eyes out to Bruce Springsteen. He empathized. But then we went on from there discussing different musical artists, eventually ending up into our usual philosophical debates. He had been supportive in listening to my pain, but I also have to be conscious of how difficult it is to hear someone you care about elaborate on how they are in a lot of psychic pain.   Hope is overrated. I view hope as inherently negative. It focuses on what is wrong with the current environment but in a discouraging way. The mind dwells in the dogmatic ideology rather than the here and now of what the pragmatic next step is. Instead, I value gratitude, inspiration, and courage. Act despite the odds, and enjoy the struggle. It isn't easy. I fail all the time and often want to just give up. And some days I do; binging on alcohol and TV just to numb out. But I never wake up the next morning glad I did that (for example, this morning as my head currently feels like someone dropped an anvil on it). Sometimes reflection leads to inspiration, giving me the strength to take the baby steps toward something better. Other times, I feel like I drag my ass through the motions until I stumble upon some kind of motivation.   Jodi Mitchell once said, "If you take my demons away, my angels will go with them." Somewhere within my head there is meaning. I still haven't found my raison d'etre. Maybe I never will. Maybe it doesn't matter. (I suspect the latter.) The point is that I have changed as a person in response to my depression. Through the pain, my anchor has pulled me down away from the numerous distractions of life, into a nothingness, where there is space to just be. It has challenged my values and has resulted in new ones that I suspect will ultimately lead to a more fulfilling life.   Have the courage to take that first step. Mistakes are how we learn. Just try to make each individual mistake only once. :)
Thank you so much, I wish you the same for you!!
All good, discussion is always nice and maybe it’ll help OP. Your probably right that may have been a mislabel on my part, that’s a good distinction to make. The only reason I said selfish was that I feel like no matter the action necessary be it having to contact friends,to make a request of others, etc. I don’t think anyone can judge you for what you had to do to preserve your mental health, and happiness. So even if you have to do something that actually is selfish, just make the choice you can live by happily.
I think a lot of people have felt this way or are currently feeling this way. It is really hard to live with depression, keep fighting the good fight my friend.
I really feel you on that. Unfortunately I have only ever been around people who very clearly have unaddressed mental health issues and trauma, but even then, everyone is too sick to acknowledge and have internalised and reinforce that very stigma. But I 100% agree
Same to you as well. I hope soon you will have someone to talk however feel free to message me if you want to talk
I wish you the same too my friend❤️❤️❤️ lots of love to you❤️
Damn. You're good
Ah. Makes sense. Having boundaries, i.e. doing what you need to do to live happily, seems healthy to me. At the time it may seem selfish though. Good point.

I feel exhausted and depressed like never before. Christmas is ruined for me. To put it in context I've been away for 3 months for an internship in a different city, all alone with no friends or family close by. This made me very depressed and the loneliness was rough for me. Christmas was gonna be my break before going back to school. My boyfriend was going to visit (haven't seen him in 2 years, long distance relationship), so that really helped knowing. Until Covid made it so that he couldn't come visit. That took me further into my depression. The only thing I had to look forward to was seeing my family and especially my 3 year old nephew that I haven't seen in 5 months.  But that would also get taken away from me and my family. My sister lost her custody of the child.(long story, I don't really want to get into it) The father of the child refuses to let us see the kid. My parents is taking this very hard as they are used to seeing him almost every day. My sister barely seems to be bothered by it.  My mom doesn't wanna celebrate Christmas and my dad is starting to put away all the Christmas stuff we just put out.  Essentially Christmas is canceled.  I've spent all day in my room, I'm so deep into my depression now I don't know how to help anyone in my family have a nice Christmas..   We've always had very nice Christmas celebrations in my family. This year it's just gone. I don't wanna sound selfish...by saying my Christmas is ruined. Cause it pretty much ruined for my parents and my boyfriend that is stuck in a different country. He also needed to get away he has been working the whole year saving up money to see me as soon as covid would allow it. I don't know what I can do for him or my parents....or myself.

Sympathies. That really stinks. Without knowing any of the people involved, I question how healthy a reaction your parents cancelling Christmas entirely based on their heartache is. It's horrible to suddenly be denied having their grandchild for the holiday, but is it going to really help their hearts to ignore the holiday completely? (If the answer is yes, then it sucks for you, but it's what they need. If it's not, though...) Do you have the strength to talk to them and tell them skipping Christmas is adding to your hurt so that as a family you can think of ways to help you all as a group? Maybe think of ways to scale things back but still celebrate the family you _are_ able to be with? It's not selfish to open discussions about what you need. It's not at all the same as throwing a tantrum and not taking their needs into account.  Your parents clearly love your nephew, but I'm willing to bet they love you too. Perhaps telling them that you were really looking forward to having a special day with them will even make them feel better because it will help them understand that even though you're not little anymore, you still need them and want to celebrate being with them.
I am so sorry to hear that... I also feel that my christmas is absolutely ruined and I think the last two days were the worst days of the year. I see my family only once a year and we cancelled our visit last minute due to covid... I had planned so many nice things and now I don't even want to celebrate via Zoom, I just want to run from everything and I am so sad. This is the worst time for depression and so many people will have to fight through a terrible christmas. I wish you all the best, and next year will be better!

Kind of a long story after a year long saga.  My (25f) family has always been what most would described as well put together. Typical white, upper middle class, educated family. No major family drama ever in my life. I did know that my father had depression issues, but it never outwardly came up in anything (although now being an adult I know the problem with not talking about that...). He has been struggling with jobs since 2008. He's working a job across the state from his house and has an apartment there. Works weeks and drives home every weekend. Starting around pandemic lockdown, my sister called me saying that my mom had been checking finances and noticed 10's of thousands of dollars were missing. She had confronted him and he admitted to texting women online who had convinced him to send them money. He even borrowed money from my mentally disabled Aunt to send them money.  My sister and I drove home, spent a weekend talking with him, having an intervention, outlining plans and things to go to marriage counseling and get a counselor for himself. Fast forward a month, my mom calls again crying, that it's happening again, more money is gone. I drive back again, have another talk, he seems sincere. This happens 3 more times. All of these "women" are clearly scammers. They've taken upwards of $60k. When my mom texted several of them to F off, they threatened to kidnap my sister. One convinced him that she's an FBI informant that is using his phone to catch the people who are scamming him, and another has got him to let "her" use his bank account for her PPP loan that she had gotten fraudulently (money laundering). This Thanksgiving he finally asked my mom for a divorce, saying he was going to marry one of these women in California. We convinced him not to, this time with a very different angry approach. He came for thanksgiving and he seemed to genuinely want to make things up. He agreed to ask his job to work from home, pay off his apartment lease so he isn't in his hell hole of loneliness across state. I've never known him to be a liar, but it seems he completely loses his shit when he goes back to his apartment.  Today, he said that his "girlfriend" is coming to visit him and he's not coming home for Christmas. My mom just left to go to his apartment.  I feel utterly hopeless. He's always been a smart intelligent man. Not gullible at all. It was completely out of left field. He says that he still loves my mom, and that my sister and I are the most important things to him. Yet we've expressed that if he decides to continue with these internet "women" we won't be involved in his life anymore. He's discussed suicide many times, and I feel once he's burned his bridge with us and finally realizes fully he's been catfished that he'll finally follow through with it. How many chances can you give someone when they hurt you over and over, and yet you still care so much. My mom has nowhere else to turn. She can't afford to keep the house without his income. She has very few friends/family. Worst of all he's gotten them into a pile of debt. I have mental health issues too, and this has severely weighed on me.  I just have no idea what to do or where to turn.

Oh, wow. That's a lot to deal with. It kind of sounds to me like the actual FBI should be involved. Also, your dad clearly has at least one mental health issue going on and should probably talk to a professional. How you convince him of that, I haven't a clue. As far as yourself... I know it'll be hard to keep from being distressed, but remember your dad's problems aren't your problems. You can try to help him and try to help your mom, but don't get lost in the drama. Take time to take care of yourself or you won't be able to help them at all.
They spoke to the police right after the PPP money laundering thing. They didn't really care. But now my dad has been black listed from several banking institutions.     I've tried distancing myself, but its so hard when its clear that the path he's taking himself down really only looks to be taking his own life. I have no reason to believe the woman he's talking to now is any different than the other scammers. She's already ask for money to visit him with no time actually set out, the most obvious catfish tactic. Once he finally figures it out, he'll have nothing left and all the motivation to finally go through with it.

After yesterday I’m pretty sure my best friend decided to abandon me. So they’ve liked me as more than a friend for a while now, they approached me because they liked the way I looked so it’s like for them, our whole friendship was probably more about hoping one day we will date. But for me, it was just a really good friendship and I loved them as a friend. They talked to me and texted me so much bc they liked me and I texted them so much bc they were my best friend. So maybe it was doomed. I was always scared once they don’t like me anymore like that they’d leave and not wanna be friends either. Welp guess it came true. They’re text messages are so cold now, it just doesn’t feel like my best friend anymore. They never text first. I don’t get it I texted them and loved them so much even when I didn’t have romantic feelings for them but they really don’t even wanna be friends now that they don’t like me like that? I’m so hurt. I feel so alone. I wish they never liked me like that. And now next semester at school will feel so weird and awkward. They’re literally my ONLY friend at school. Wow it’s crazy how we were so damn close and just overnight it’s all gone. I’m so hurt I deleted all our messages and I’ve never done that before with someone I’m close to. I love keeping them as memories. Maybe I shouldn’t have been so straight forward yesterday. I thought communication was key. I was so stressed and curious about whether they still liked me or not so I just asked them, I said hey you’ve been acting like you don’t wanna text or call at least not as often as you used to. And they’re like yeah I’m losing feelings. Like dude that’s totally fine I didn’t even really like you like that either great now we can be just good friends. but nope now they text hella weird and I can just feel the dryness and want to end the convo as soon as I start it. I’ve felt like shit since yesterday morning until now. I can’t seem to stop it. I’m trying to distract myself so hard and it’s just not working. Someone help. I feel so alone now. The one person I trusted to never abandon me and be there for me when I needed just threw me away. I just need someone to talk to when I’m down. Can someone pls like exchange numbers with me and we can just text each other whenever we have something we need to vent about. Neither of us needs to be under the pressure that we need to give amazing advice but we can just listen to each other. I just want a friend who I can talk to. I feel so so alone. But I’m asking kinda specially for someone who’s also alone and feels like they have no one to turn to. Cause if you have a lot of friends idk if you really feel the need to have a vent buddy or anything. And if we’re both as alone and depressed maybe we’ll understand eachother. Ah Idk what I’m doing. Hopefully this reaches someone who’s kinda in the same boat and wants someone to talk to like this.

Hello, it's my first time here so I hope I'm not doing anything wrong. This Christmas will be my second Christmas with clinical depression. I had anxiety for years but I've had depression only since 2019. We still haven't found the right treatment: we've tried 3 ssri and I'm now given a neuroleptic because my anxiety is going crazy.   Recently, I was doing better than before because my last antidepressant was kind of working, which is a first. The neuroleptic made everything better because I could finally feel things and do something else than sleeping all day. But now I realise that I'm not doing that much better, my brain is just fucked up in a different way. I still think of harming myself everyday. I'm stealing opiates from my parents and grandparents like a junkie. When I don't take xanax or anything, my mind is just racing, trying to find how I could buy drugs or something. The other day my mom complimented about how happy and better I looked and how seeing me like this made her feel better after months of struggle but I was high on drugs and I couldn't tell her. It's so scary because I had never touched anything like that, I don't even drink alcohol more than 3 or 4 times a year. I don't even want to go to therapy anymore. I don't want to kill myself but it's not like I really wanted to live either. I'm so confused, lost and sad.  Physically I am doing better, I can do things. But everything else is so fucked that I don't know if I can say I am doing better. My psychiatrist and my psychologist also said that I was doing a lot better and that I would be able to go back to uni (and my dorm) after Christmas and it makes me want to scream so so bad. Sometimes I wish things were easier, sometimes I wish I was a little stronger.

Please tell your therapists everything that is going on. If they don’t know then they can’t help you.
So you’re taking an SSRI, a Benzo and a neuroleptic all at once? The first 2 SSRI’s didn’t work and the neuroleptic was added because the third one didn’t work as well?   If the drugs aren’t working why keep taking them while adding more? 3 SSRI, didn’t work so a neuroleptic  which blocks serotonin was added. These drugs aren’t benign they have many negative effects.   We’re you given informed consent? Told none of these drugs have any long term study showing any benefits? (many studies confuse withdrawal with a benefit). Told the drugs cause cognitive impairment, physical illness addiction/withdrawal and can worsen mental health?   According to the scientific research you’re most likely stronger than you think because the drugs that keep not working are holding you back.  https://www.madinamerica.com/2018/03/do-antidepressants-work-a-peoples-review-of-the-evidence/  http://psychrights.org/research/digest/nlps/The-Case-Against-AntipsychoticsWhitaker2016.pdf

There are times that I catch myself in the mirror and I don't recognize myself.  Especially in pictures.  I have gained about 50lbs on a little 5 foot frame.  At times I still think of myself as my former pretty and small self.  It is just crazy what the mind wants to see and what is really right in front of you staring back.....

This girl seems to get attached to every guy she talks to and I'm one of them/was however it seems as if she ends up liking the guys that are hard to get and don't fight for her.  For the last how many months she can get close to me at stages and one moment she can be talking good with me and being so comfortable and talking about personal stuff and then 2 minutes later she can just change and make it as if she's so uncomfortable with me and she doesn't know me. How can she get close and comfortable telling me personal stuff and then say she doesn't want me in her life?? She also initiates most conversations between us showing to me that she does want to talk to me and is comfortable so it's so confusing.  She has said she's got depression and anxiety and does therapy. She has been hurt by people. She also has issues with her dad maybe from a young age he has always been away and stuff so she has daddy issues.  She makes so many lies also for no reason and creates fake people or scenarios that don't exist.  Any thoughts on what might being going on in this girls mind? She has told me that she sometimes freaks out at times and she gets triggered. However it seems like she does it mostly to me as I'm always there for her and she sees me as someone that maybe she can take advantage of? Because if she did this to anyone else they probably won't care or be hurt by it

I got broken up by my trans partner and obviously I didn’t take it well.I just don’t know what to do.I want them back, but they keep saying no.But I literally just can’t live without them because like I really loved them so much.And I just can’t believe that I’m just all on my own.My brain just dead and I can’t think logically at this point.All i keep thinking is about them and suicide.I just don’t know what to do at this point..

I thought for a long time I had ADHD, but after seeing a psychiatrist, he diagnosed me with depression due to organic factors (or something like that). I’ve had significant medical trauma in my life, which is from a non-curable disease.  He advised I see a psychodynamic psychoanalyst. I tried Googling one, and there are so many to choose from? How do I decide? I’m in London, UK and have been on the professional body websites, but they don’t really seem to help much.  How did other people go about finding one they could connect with?

Back in Sept. I told someone at work (call him G) how I felt about him and that I wanted to tell him because I was planning to leave my job. I loved him a lot but it was something that would never work. Over 3 years I just became depressed and hopeless and I needed to leave.  While I was coping for my feelings for him I was simultaneously battling my feelings of failure at work. My bosses would always prefer to micromanage me over my co-worker (call him C). They'd skip over me for new responsibilities. They would overload my co-worker with things to do but give me nothing to advance with. If something went wrong they would make me find reasons it was my fault. At one point they hounded me so much about a mistake that I admitted to doing, even when I found out later I didn't. I just assumed I fucked up because it always seemed like I was screwing up somewhere. I'd always struggled to have a job that paid me a liveable wage. I had only gotten this $15/hr job after getting vocational training at 29. I've had a BFA which was worthless in the end. In July 2019 I began to self harm.  The other co-worker - G, I was in love with had become horrible to me, he used to be my friend and then he just turned on me last Nov. He was the only reason why I wanted to go to work and he decided one day to ignore me out of the blue. I had been trying to talk to him anonymously through email but he'd never respond. I only told him nice things, he always seemed sad and he had become so mean towards me, I thought his bad behavior was a symptom of someone who was suffering like me. I'd tell him things like "you're a really beautiful person, and I hope you have someone kind that takes care of you".  When I told G about how I felt and that it was me in the emails. He reported me. My bosses told me I could no longer leave my office without permission. My job was to run things around the hospital...they wanted me to ask for permission to do anything from then on. Meanwhile C, who did the same job as me - got promoted, was never hounded, was never micromanaged. It felt like I was a threat or a criminal. No one would let me explain. No one would ask if I was ok... why they didn't fire me I don't know. They knew I had Lupus so I think they didn't want to fire me because it might look like discrimination so they chose to humiliate me instead. I felt like a monster.  I put in my 2 weeks out of humiliation and told them I only want to work from home. At that point I had been fantasizing about jumping from the parking garage. I'd imagine if anyone would even care that I got to that point. In my last year I thought about suicide daily. Getting a new job wasn't even an option because I couldn't get motivation to apply to anything. It all felt like a failure. I got home from work and crawled into my closet and had a breakdown. 33 years old hiding in my closet. I cant leave my apartment without a great sense of shame now. Like I dont belong.  I tried to talk to G, I wasn't hostile. I just wanted to say sorry. I wanted someone to know how I felt and he just ignored it and threatened to call the police. I'm such a fucking idiot for believing anyone cared about me. I feel so fucking stupid. I was lighting candles for them during covid and no one even said goodbye. My bosses told me they wouldn't tell anyone I was leaving until I was gone.  I just woke up from a dream that I was back at work, I saw all the people that bullied me and they once again all turned their backs on me. Ignored me. Pretended like I didn't exist. So for the first time in my dreams I wasn't empowered, I jumped off the roof of the hospital I worked at. I just wanted someone to know how I felt.   I truly believed if I didn't tough it out there I'd never get ahead. I know now that I was bullied but I dont know if it was because I liked to look pretty and looked like a bimbo or if it was my Lupus. I'm on medication now, but I'm not the same. I want to sue them but my family and friends say no one will believe me because I never reported it. I feel like the only way for me to feel better is to sue them. They wouldn't let me speak. I never got to tell them how I wanted to kill myself because of them.  Can anyone tell me if suing will bring me solace? I don't even care if I win. I just want them to know what they did...My life is ruined and my spirit is crushed. I'd pay $5,000 for someone to know...I just want someone to fucking care what happened to me.

You can find help at a National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  USA: 18002738255 US Crisis textline: 741741 text HOME  United Kingdom: 116 123  Trans Lifeline (877-565-8860)  Others: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines  https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org
I would talk to a lawyer. The fact that they ignored you for your male coworker screams sexism to me. However, never reporting anything could hurt your chances. A lawyer would know best. It never hurts to talk about your options. I would also highly recommend talking to your doctor about depression meds and possibly starting therapy.
I'm already taking meds. I've been on them on since October. I've been talking to a counselor for a long time for ADHD maintenance. I've brought all this up to her but I don't feel like she realizes how traumatized I am by this. I'm not sure what counselors are supposed to do tbh.
Therapists are there to help you. I’ve had several and some were better than others. Honestly, the best advice I’ve ever been given was this: If they are not helping you, then you have the right to tell them “you are not helping me. I am telling you what my problem is and you are not helping me to solve it. If you can’t or won’t, then I will find someone who will. “ Thank my psychiatrist for that one.   It’s not easy, because many of us were taught to not question professionals. However, in this case, we do know if a professional is doing what we pay them to do, as our mental state is the direct result. If you know this person well, then you should be able to criticize them for not understanding the severity of your feelings. Bullying (in this context) was not just a normal part of life, this was systematic abuse, regardless of what those douche bags call it. You don’t have to justify your feelings to anyone, and your therapist should be the first one in your corner helping you process it.

We think that change is a choice. We think change is in our control. Change happens. If we like it or not. We are constantly changing everyday moment, every second, every minute, every hour which ultimately will lead to every day, every week, month, year and so on.   Our life in the past 9 months has been filled of unprecedented times, chaos but has allowed us to be given a sense of time to sit with ourself, sit in solidarity. These past months have been filled with lots of highs and lots of downs. We must sit in it all. We must focus on our passions, on our crafts, on what we have been given to feel and resonate with. We all have different things inside of us, different likes, dislikes, attributes, characteristics, insecurities, struggles, strengths, things that make us happy etc. We are all unique. We are all 1 of 1. We are all sacred.   For every moment we are given we have to realize that we must be thankful and grateful for it. This analogy always creates a sort of confuzzle inside of me. The sense of only living for today as if this is the only day I have but as well as that our life is long & that we will live for another 30, 40, 50, 60 years etc. Do something today that makes you feel alive, if you don't know what that is, well sit present for a few moments and allow it to come to you; it will come.  These times have been difficult. These times have been challenging, but with challenges comes growth. With things that question our comfort zones, that question everything we have always known comes a realignment, naturally and organically. It all takes time and I am grateful for the time that it takes, even if sometimes I want to get there already (my dysphoria & transitioning).   We will get to where we want to go but most of the time, it will be better than what we set out to achieve and that we expect that we will achieve. Keep doing your best. Today, Tomorrow and for the rest of the week until the end of the year. Work your hardest and leave it all on the field. I wish you well.  I love you.
